	<title>RSS PAP: State-Dependent Modification of Sensory Sensitivity via Modulation of Backpropagating Action Potentials</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0283-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Neuromodulators play a critical role in sensorimotor processing via various actions, including pre- and postsynaptic signal modulation and direct modulation of signal encoding in peripheral dendrites. Here we present a new mechanism that allows state-dependent modulation of signal encoding in sensory dendrites by neuromodulatory projection neurons. We studied the impact of antidromic action potentials (APs) on stimulus encoding using the anterior gastric receptor (AGR) neuron in the heavily modulated crustacean stomatogastric ganglion. We found that ectopic AP initiation in AGR's axon trunk is under direct neuromodulatory control by the inferior ventricular (IV) neurons, a pair of descending projection neurons. IV neuron activation elicited a long-lasting decrease in AGR ectopic activity. This modulation was specific to the site of AP initiation and could be mimicked by focal application of the IV neuron co-transmitter histamine. IV neuron actions were diminished after blocking H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in AGR's axon trunk, suggesting a direct axonal modulation. This local modulation did not affect the propagation dynamics of en-passant APs. However, decreases in ectopic AP frequency prolonged sensory bursts elicited distantly near AGR's dendrites. This frequency-dependent effect was mediated via the reduction of antidromic APs, and the diminishment of backpropagation into the sensory dendrites. Computational models suggest that invading antidromic APs interact with local ionic conductances the rate constants of which determine the sign and strength of the frequency-dependent change in sensory sensitivity. Antidromic APs therefore provide descending projection neurons with a means to influence sensory encoding without affecting AP propagation or stimulus transduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Descending modulatory projection neurons are a hallmark of motor systems and fundamentally involved in sensorimotor processing. While they have been shown to interact on many levels with motor networks to dynamically and rapidly adjust motor and behavioral output, their actions on sensory neurons are not well understood. We found that descending projection neurons directly modulate action potential initiation in a sensory axon, diminishing the frequency of spontaneously generated ectopic action potentials that propagate antidromically into peripheral sensory dendrites. Changes in the frequency of these backpropagating action potentials determined the response of the sensory neuron to sensory stimuli. This suggests that descending projection neurons modulate sensory encoding by altering axonal membrane excitability and the frequency of antidromic action potential initiation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Early Targeting of L-Selectin on Leukocytes Promotes Recovery after Spinal Cord Injury, Implicating Novel Mechanisms of Pathogenesis</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0101-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;L-selectin, a lectin-like receptor on all leukocyte classes, functions in adhesive and signaling roles in the recruitment of myeloid cells from the blood to sites of inflammation. Herein, we consider L-selectin as a determinant of neurological recovery in a murine model of spinal cord injury. Spinal cord-injured, L-selectin knockout mice (male) showed improved long-term recovery with greater white matter sparing relative to wildtype mice and reduced oxidative stress in the injured cord at 72 hours post-spinal cord injury. There was a partial and transient reduction in accumulation of neutrophils in the injured spinal cords of knockouts at 24 hours post-injury. To complement these findings with knockout mice, we sought a pharmacologic means for lowering L-selectin levels. We found that diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, induced the shedding of L-selectin from the cell surface of myeloid subsets, specifically neutrophils and non-classical monocytes, in the blood and the injured spinal cord. Diclofenac administration to injured wildtype mice enhanced neurological recovery to a level comparable to that of knockouts but did not improve recovery in knockouts. While diclofenac treatment had no effect on myeloid cell accumulation, there was a reduction in oxidative stress at 72 hours post-spinal cord injury. These findings implicate L-selectin in secondary pathogenesis beyond a role in leukocyte recruitment and raise the possibility of repurposing diclofenac for the treatment of spinal cord injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; In this study, we establish L-selectin, an adhesion and signaling receptor on immune cells, as a determinant of long-term recovery and tissue sparing after spinal cord injury. We demonstrate that L-selectin contributes to secondary pathogenesis during acute inflammation, and implicate L-selectin in novel roles other than recruitment. We also report a strategy to improve recovery by employing diclofenac, an FDA-approved NSAID that induces the shedding of L-selectin from the surface of innate immune cells. Our findings demonstrate a critical time-period for anti-inflammatory intervention in a murine model of spinal cord injury and suggest that diclofenac be tested as an acute therapy for attenuating neurologic deficits following spinal cord injury in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Differentiation in Theta and Beta Electrocortical Activity between Visual and Physical Perturbations to Walking and Standing Balance</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/4/ENEURO.0207-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human balance is a complex process in healthy adults, requiring precisely timed coordination among sensory information, cognitive processing, and motor control. It has been difficult to quantify brain dynamics during human balance control due to limitations in brain-imaging modalities. The goal of this study was to determine whether by using high-density electroencephalography (EEG) and independent component analysis, we can identify common cortical responses to visual and physical balance perturbations during walking and standing. We studied the responses of 30 healthy young adults to sensorimotor perturbations that challenged their balance. Subjects performed four 10 min trials of beam walking and tandem stance while either being mediolaterally pulled at the waist or viewing brief 20° field-of-view rotations in virtual reality. We recorded high-density EEG, motion capture, lower leg electromyography (EMG), and neck EMG. We hypothesized that both physical pull and visual rotation perturbations would elicit time–frequency fluctuations in theta (4–8 Hz) and beta (13–30 Hz) bands, with increased occipito-parietal activity during visual rotations compared with pull perturbations. Our results confirmed this hypothesis. For both perturbations, we found early theta synchronization and late alpha–beta (8–30 Hz) desynchronization following perturbation onset. This pattern was strongest in occipito-parietal areas during visual perturbations and strongest in sensorimotor areas during pull perturbations. These results suggest a similar time–frequency electrocortical pattern when humans respond to sensorimotor conflict, but with substantive differences in the brain areas involved for visual versus physical perturbations. Our findings may have important implications for assessing and training balance in individuals with and without motor disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Novel Quantitative Analyses of Spontaneous Synaptic Events in Cortical Pyramidal Cells Reveal Subtle Parvalbumin-Expressing Interneuron Dysfunction in a Knock-In Mouse Model of Alzheimers Disease</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/4/ENEURO.0059-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that has become a compelling global public health concern. Besides pathological hallmarks such as extracellular amyloid plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and loss of neurons and synapses, clinical reports have shown that epileptiform activity, even seizures, can occur early in the disease. Aberrant synaptic and network activities as well as epileptiform discharges have also been observed in various mouse models of AD. The new &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mouse model is generated by a gene knock-in approach and there are limited studies on basic synaptic properties in &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice. Therefore, we applied quantitative methods to analyze spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory synaptic events in parietal cortex layer 2/3 pyramidal cells. First, by an objective amplitude distribution analysis, we found decreased amplitudes of spontaneous IPSCs (sIPSCs) in aged &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice caused by a reduction in the amplitudes of the large sIPSCs with fast rates of rise, consistent with deficits in the function of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV INs). Second, we calculated the burstiness and memory in a series of successive synaptic events. Lastly, by using a novel approach to determine the excitation-to-inhibition (E/I) ratio, we found no changes in the &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice, indicating that homeostatic mechanisms may have maintained the overall balance of excitation and inhibition in spite of a mildly impaired PV IN function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We propose a novel Coupled Hidden Markov Model to detect epileptic seizures
in multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) data. Our model defines a network
of seizure propagation paths to capture both the temporal and spatial evolution
of epileptic activity. To address the intractability introduced by the coupled
interactions, we derive a variational inference procedure to efficiently infer
the seizure evolution from spectral patterns in the EEG data. We validate our
model on EEG aquired under clinical conditions in the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit
of the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Using 5-fold cross validation, we demonstrate
that our model outperforms three baseline approaches which rely on a classical
detection framework. Our model also demonstrates the potential to localize
seizure onset zones in focal epilepsy.

integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons for different coupling strength, connectivity,
and by varying the degree of refractoriness, as well as the delay in the spike
transmission. We find that the neural network does not only exhibit a
microscopic (single-neuron) stochastic-like evolution, but also a collective
irregular dynamics (CID). Our analysis is based on the computation of a
suitable order parameter, typically used to characterize synchronization
phenomena and on a detailed scaling analysis (i.e. simulations of different
network sizes). As a result, we can conclude that CID is a true thermodynamic
phase, intrinsically different from the standard asynchronous regime.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Error Forward-Propagation: Reusing Feedforward Connections to Propagate Errors in Deep Learning. (arXiv:1808.03357v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03357</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We introduce Error Forward-Propagation, a biologically plausible mechanism to
propagate error feedback forward through the network. Architectural constraints
on connectivity are virtually eliminated for error feedback in the brain;
systematic backward connectivity is not used or needed to deliver error
feedback. Feedback as a means of assigning credit to neurons earlier in the
forward pathway for their contribution to the final output is thought to be
used in learning in the brain. How the brain solves the credit assignment
problem is unclear. In machine learning, error backpropagation is a highly
successful mechanism for credit assignment in deep multilayered networks.
Backpropagation requires symmetric reciprocal connectivity for every neuron.
From a biological perspective, there is no evidence of such an architectural
constraint, which makes backpropagation implausible for learning in the brain.
This architectural constraint is reduced with the use of random feedback
weights. Models using random feedback weights require backward connectivity
patterns for every neuron, but avoid symmetric weights and reciprocal
connections. In this paper, we practically remove this architectural
constraint, requiring only a backward loop connection for effective error
feedback. We propose reusing the forward connections to deliver the error
feedback by feeding the outputs into the input receiving layer. This mechanism,
Error Forward-Propagation, is a plausible basis for how error feedback occurs
deep in the brain independent of and yet in support of the functionality
underlying intricate network architectures. We show experimentally that
recurrent neural networks with two and three hidden layers can be trained using
Error Forward-Propagation on the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets, achieving
$1.90\%$ and $11\%$ generalization errors respectively.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38064</link>
	<content:encoded>K146N is a dominant mutation in human β-cardiac myosin heavy chain, which causes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We examined how &lt;i&gt;Drosophila &lt;/i&gt;muscle responds to this mutation and integratively analyzed the biochemical, physiological and mechanical foundations of the disease. ATPase assays, actin motility, and indirect flight muscle mechanics suggest at least two rate constants of the cross-bridge cycle are altered by the mutation: increased myosin attachment to actin and decreased detachment, yielding prolonged binding. This increases isometric force generation, but also resistive force and work absorption during cyclical contractions, resulting in decreased work, power output, flight ability and degeneration of flight muscle sarcomere morphology. Consistent with prolonged cross-bridge binding serving as the mechanistic basis of the disease and with human phenotypes, &lt;i&gt;146N&lt;/i&gt;/+ hearts are hypercontractile with increased tension generation periods, decreased diastolic/systolic diameters and myofibrillar disarray. This suggests that screening mutated &lt;i&gt;Drosophila &lt;/i&gt;hearts could rapidly identify hypertrophic cardiomyopathy alleles and treatments.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36781</link>
	<content:encoded>To make successful evidence-based decisions, the brain must rapidly and accurately transform sensory inputs into specific goal-directed behaviors. Most experimental work on this subject has focused on forebrain mechanisms. Using a novel evidence-accumulation task for mice, we performed recording and perturbation studies of crus I of the lateral posterior cerebellum, which communicates bidirectionally with numerous forebrain regions. Cerebellar inactivation led to a reduction in the fraction of correct trials. Using two-photon fluorescence imaging of calcium, we found that Purkinje cell somatic activity contained choice/evidence-related information. Decision errors were represented by dendritic calcium spikes, which in other contexts are known to drive cerebellar plasticity. We propose that cerebellar circuitry may contribute to computations that support accurate performance in this perceptual decision-making task.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Autophagy-dependent rRNA degradation is essential for maintaining nucleotide homeostasis during C. elegans development</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36588</link>
	<content:encoded>Ribosome degradation through the autophagy-lysosome pathway is crucial for cell survival during nutrient starvation, but whether it occurs under normal growth conditions and contributes to animal physiology remains unaddressed. In this study, we identified RNST-2, a &lt;i&gt;C. elegans &lt;/i&gt;T2 family endoribonuclease, as the key enzyme that degrades ribosomal RNA in lysosomes. We found that loss of &lt;i&gt;rnst-2&lt;/i&gt; causes accumulation of rRNA and ribosomal proteins in enlarged lysosomes and both phenotypes are suppressed by blocking autophagy, which indicates that RNST-2 mediates autophagic degradation of ribosomal RNA in lysosomes. &lt;i&gt;rnst-2(lf) &lt;/i&gt;mutants are defective in embryonic and larval development and are short-lived. Remarkably, simultaneous loss of RNST-2 and &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides leads to complete embryonic lethality, which is suppressed by supplements of uridine or cytidine. Our study reveals an essential role of autophagy-dependent degradation of ribosomal RNA in maintaining nucleotide homeostasis during animal development.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Extinction recall of fear memories formed before stress is not affected despite higher theta activity in the amygdala</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/35450</link>
	<content:encoded>Stress is known to exert its detrimental effects not only by enhancing fear, but also by impairing its extinction. However, in earlier studies stress exposure preceded both processes. Thus, compared to unstressed animals, stressed animals had to extinguish fear memories that were strengthened by prior exposure to stress. Here we dissociate the two processes to examine if stress specifically impairs the acquisition and recall of fear extinction. Strikingly, when fear memories were formed before stress exposure, thereby allowing animals to initiate extinction from comparable levels of fear, recall of fear extinction was unaffected. Despite this we observed a persistent increase in theta activity in the BLA. Theta activity in the mPFC, by contrast, was normal. Stress also disrupted mPFC-BLA theta-frequency synchrony and directional coupling. Thus, in the absence of the fear-enhancing effects of stress, the expression of fear during and after extinction reflects normal regulation of theta activity in the mPFC, not theta hyperactivity in the amygdala.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34793</link>
	<content:encoded>The precise steps of iNKT subset differentiation in the thymus and periphery have been controversial. We demonstrate here that the small proportion of thymic iNKT and mucosal associated invariant T cells that express CCR7 represent a multi-potent progenitor pool that gives rise to effector subsets within the thymus. Using intra-thymic labeling, we also showed that CCR7&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; iNKT cells emigrate from the thymus in a &lt;i&gt;Klf2&lt;/i&gt; dependent manner, and undergo further maturation after reaching the periphery. &lt;i&gt;Ccr7&lt;/i&gt; deficiency impaired differentiation of iNKT effector subsets and localization to the medulla. Parabiosis and intra-thymic transfer showed that thymic NKT1 and NKT17 were resident - they were not derived from and did not contribute to the peripheral pool. Finally, each thymic iNKT effector subset produces distinct factors that influence T cell development. Our findings demonstrate how the thymus is both a source of iNKT progenitors and a unique site of tissue dependent effector cell differentiation.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A model of repetitive mild concussion with persistent brain injury but no symptomology - risk for Parkinson\'s disease with aging?</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/390856v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Objectives: To test the hypothesis that repetitive mild traumatic brain injury in early life may be a potential risk factor for Parkinson's disease. Methods: A closed-head momentum exchange model was used to produce one or three mild concussions in young adult male rats as compare to non-injured, age and weight-matched controls. Six-seven weeks post-injury, rats were studied for deficits in cognitive and motor function Changes in brain anatomy and function were evaluated through analysis of resting state functional connectivity, diffusion weighted imaging with quantitative anisotropy and immunohistochemistry for neuroinflammation. Results: Head injuries occurred without skull fracture or signs of intracranial bleeding or contusion. There were no significant differences in cognitive or motors behaviors between experimental groups. Rats concussed three times showed altered diffusivity in white matter tracts, basal ganglia, central amygdala, brainstem, and cerebellum. With a single concussion, the affected areas were limited to the caudate/putamen and central amygdala. Disruption of functional connectivity was most pronounced with three concussions as the midbrain dopamine system, hippocampus and brainstem/cerebellum showed hypoconnectivity. The suprachiasmatic nucleus was isolated from all functional connections. Interestingly, rats exposed to one concussion showed enhanced functional connectivity (or hyperconnectivity) across brain sites, particularly between the olfactory system and the cerebellum. Immunostaining for microglia activation showed inflammation in striatum and substantia nigra with three concussions but not with one. Interpretation: Neuroradiological and immunohistochemical evidence of altered brain structure and function, particularly in striatal and midbrain dopaminergic areas, persists long after mild repetitive head injury. These changes may be long lasting and serve as early biomarkers of neurodegeneration and risk for Parkinson's disease with aging.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/390732v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Protein palmitoylation and depalmitoylation alter protein function. This post-translational modification is critical for synaptic transmission and plasticity. Mutation of the depalmitoylating enzyme palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1) causes infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN1), a pediatric neurodegenerative disease. However, the role of protein depalmitoylation in synaptic maturation is unknown. Therefore, we studied synapse development in Ppt1-/- mouse visual cortex. We demonstrate the stagnation of the developmental N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunit switch from GluN2B to GluN2A in Ppt1-/- mice. Correspondingly, GluN2A-mediated synaptic currents are diminished and Ppt1-/- dendritic spines maintain immature morphology in vivo. Further, GluN2B is hyperpalmitoylated in Ppt1-/- neurons and associated with extrasynaptic, diffuse calcium influxes and enhanced vulnerability to NMDA-induced excitotoxicity. Remarkably, Ppt1-/- neurons treated with palmitoylation inhibitors demonstrate normalized levels of palmitoylated GluN2B and Fyn kinase, reversing susceptibility to excitotoxic insult. Thus, depalmitoylation of GluN2B by PPT1 plays a critical role in postsynapse maturation and pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disease.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Multiscale dynamic mean field (MDMF) model to relate resting state brain dynamics with local cortical excitatory-inhibitory neurotransmitter homeostasis in health and disease.</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/390716v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The spontaneous neuronal activity of human brain shows highly structured spatio-temporal pattern, designated as resting state network. Previous neuro-computational studies have established the connection of spontaneous resting state activity with neuronal ensembles (using dynamic mean field approach) and showed the impact of local inhibitory-excitatory balance on this patterned spontaneous resting state activity of brain. But, the role of neurotransmitter dynamics on large-scale network organization remains unexplored. Empirically, this is beyond the scope of current neuroimaging techniques to monitor the neurotransmitter changes and capture BOLD dynamics simultaneously. We argue that large-scale computational models offer an attractive platform to test out the possible neural mechanisms that operate at multiple scales of physiological organization namely, brain metabolism and changes in synaptic concentrations of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)/glutamate. We introduce a multiscale dynamic mean field (MDMF) model, that captures the synaptic gating dynamics as a function of neurotransmitter kinetics, we demonstrate how local homeostasis of excitatory-inhibitory neurotransmitter concentrations (GABA/glutamate) could modulate the large-scale resting state network dynamics of brain. Simulations were carried out across glutamate (0.1 to 15 mmol) and GABA (0.1 to 15 mmol) concentration regimes that span the parameter space reported from healthy and diseased brains. We have found for optimal configurations of glutamate concentration ranging from 5.6 to 15 mmol and GABA concentration from 0.9 to 15 mmol model predicted functional connectivity matrix show closest match with empirical functional connectivity matrix of normal resting brain. Graph theoretical measures of segregation (modularity, clustering coefficient and local efficiency) and integration (global efficiency and characteristic path length) in network information processing reported earlier in healthy and diseased brains were related to optimal GABA and glutamate concentrations and pathological values reported in epilepsy and schizophrenia respectively. In conclusion, the MDMF model could relate the various scales of observations from neurotransmitter concentrations to dynamics of synaptic gating to large-scale resting state network topology in healthy and in disordered states of the brain. Key words: GABA, glutamate, resting-state functional connectivity, structural connectivity, network measures, epilepsy and schizophrenia.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/390658v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>We use sequences of saccadic eye movements to continually explore our visual environments. Previous studies have established that saccades in a sequence may be programmed in parallel by the oculomotor system. In this study, we tested the neural correlates of parallel programming of saccade sequences in the frontal eye field (FEF), using single-unit electrophysiological recordings from macaques performing a double-step saccade task. Neurons in the FEF range from visual neurons instantiating target selection, to movement neurons which prepare a saccadic response towards the selected target. The question of whether the FEF movement neurons undertake concurrent processing of multiple goals or saccade plans is yet unresolved. We show that when a peripheral target is foveated by a sequence of two saccades, FEF movement activity for the second saccade can be initiated whilst the first is still underway. Moreover, the onset of the movement activity varied parametrically with the behaviorally measured time available for parallel programming. Finally, the concurrent activity was specific for the final remapped motor vector connecting the first and the second targets and not the goal of the second saccade. In contrast, the upstream FEF visual-related neurons showed concurrent activity related to the goal of the second saccade, but not the remapped vector connecting the first and the second targets. Taken together, the results indicate that movement neurons, although located terminally in the FEF visual-motor spectrum, can accomplish concurrent processing of multiple saccade plans, leading to rapid execution of saccade sequences.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Artificial neural network models have long proven useful for understanding healthy, disordered, and developing cognition, but this work has often proceeded with little connection to functional brain imaging. We consider how analysis of functional brain imaging data is best approached if the representational assumptions embodied by neural networks are valid. Using a simple model to generate synthetic data, we show that four contemporary methods each have critical and complementary blind-spots for detecting distributed signal. The pattern suggests a new approach based on structured sparsity that, in simulation, retains the strengths of each method while avoiding its weaknesses. When applied to functional magnetic resonance imaging data the new approach reveals extensive distributed signal missed by the other methods, suggesting radically different conclusions about how brains encode cognitive information in the well-studied domain of visual face perception.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>How functionally flexible is human cortex? In congenitally blind individuals, visual cortices are active during auditory and tactile tasks. The cognitive role of these responses and the underlying mechanisms remain uncertain. A dominant view is that, in blindness, visual cortices process information from low-level auditory and somatosensory systems. An alternative hypothesis is that higher-cognitive fronto-parietal systems take over visual cortices. We report that, in congenitally blind individuals, right-lateralized visual cortex responds to executive-load in a go/no-go task. These right-lateralized occipital cortices of blind, but not sighted, individuals mirrored the executive-function pattern observed in fronto-parietal systems. In blindness, the same visual cortex area, at rest, also increases its synchronization with prefrontal executive control regions and decreases its synchronization with auditory and sensorimotor cortices. These results support the hypothesis of top-down fronto-parietal takeover of visual cortices, and suggest that human cortex is highly flexible at birth.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Frequent experience with regularities in our environment allows us to use predictive information to guide our decision process. However, contingencies in our environment are not always explicitly present and sometimes need to be inferred. Heretofore, it remained unknown how predictive information guides decision-making when explicit knowledge is absent and how the brain shapes such implicit inferences. In the present experiment, participants performed a discrimination task in which a target stimulus was preceded by a predictive cue. Critically, participants had no explicit knowledge that some of the cues signaled an upcoming target, allowing us to investigate how implicit inferences emerge and guide decision-making. Despite unawareness of the cue-target contingencies, participants were able to use implicit information to improve performance. Concurrent EEG recordings demonstrate that implicit inferences rely upon interactions between internally and externally oriented networks, whereby anterior prefrontal regions inhibit right parietal cortex under internal implicit control.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Reward availability and the potential for danger or safety potently regulates emotion. Despite women being more likely than men to develop emotion dysregulation disorders, there are few studies investigating fear, safety and reward regulation in females. Here, we show that female Long Evans rats do not suppress conditioned freezing in the presence of a safety cue, nor do they extinguish their freezing response, whereas males do both. Females did show evidence of conditioned inhibition of darting, however. Females were also more reward responsive during the reward cue until the first footshock exposure, at which point there were no sex differences in reward seeking to the reward cue. In summary, females showed a significantly different behavioral profile than males in a task that tests the ability to discriminate among fear, safety and reward cues. This paradigm offers a great opportunity to test for mechanisms that are generating these behavioral sex differences.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Circulating immune cells, which are recruited to the site of injury/disease, secrete various inflammatory mediators that are critical to nociception and pain. The role of tissue-resident immune cells, however, remains poorly characterized. One of the first cells to be activated in peripheral tissues following injury are {gamma}{delta} T cells, which serve important roles in infection and disease. Using a transgenic mouse line lacking these cells, we sought to identify their contribution to inflammatory pain. Three distinct models of inflammatory pain were used: intraplantar injection of formalin and incisional wound (as models of acute inflammatory pain) and intraplantar injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (as a model of chronic inflammatory pain). Our results show that absence of these cells does not alter baseline sensitivity, nor does it result in changes to mechanical or thermal hypersensitivity after tissue injury. These results were consistent in both male and female mice, suggesting that there are no sex differences in these outcomes. This comprehensive characterization suggests that {gamma}{delta} T cells do not contribute to basal sensitivity or the development and maintenance of inflammatory pain.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Reversible inactivation of different millimeter-scale regions of primate IT results in different patterns of core object recognition deficits</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/390245v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Extensive research suggests that the inferior temporal (IT) population supports visual object recognition behavior. However, causal evidence for this hypothesis has been equivocal, particularly beyond the specific case of face-selective sub-regions of IT. Here, we directly tested this hypothesis by pharmacologically inactivating individual, millimeter-scale sub-regions of IT while monkeys performed several object discrimination tasks, interleaved trial-by-trial. First, we observed that IT inactivation resulted in reliable contralateral-biased task-selective behavioral deficits. Moreover, inactivating different IT sub-regions resulted in different patterns of task deficits, each predicted by that sub-region's neuronal object discriminability. Finally, the similarity between different inactivation effects was tightly related to the anatomical distance between corresponding inactivation sites. Taken together, these results provide direct evidence that IT cortex causally supports general core object recognition, and that the underlying IT codes are topographically organized.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/390179v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Schizophrenia is a devastating brain disorder that disturbs sensory perception, motor action, and abstract thought. Its clinical phenotype implies dysfunction of various mental domains, which has motivated a series of theories regarding the underlying pathophysiology. Aiming at a predictive benchmark of a catalogue of cognitive functions, we developed a bottom-up machine-learning strategy and provide a proof of principle in a multi-site clinical dataset (n=324). Existing neuroscientific knowledge on diverse cognitive domains was first condensed into neuro-topographical maps. We then examined how the ensuing meta-analytic cognitive priors can distinguish patients and controls using brain morphology and intrinsic functional connectivity. Some affected cognitive domains supported well-studied directions of research on auditory evaluation and social cognition. However, rarely suspected cognitive domains also emerged as disease-relevant, including self-oriented processing of bodily sensations in gustation and pain. Such algorithmic charting of the cognitive landscape can be used to make targeted recommendations for future mental health research.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/390120v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The study shows the relevance of sciatic nerve stiffness assessed by strain elastography using ARFI (Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse) for surgical decision making and the follow up of patients with deep gluteal syndrome (DGS). The research focuses on nerve stiffness associated with knee movements in order to determine the degree of nerve entrapment. Neurological examination, MRI of pelvis and electromyography (EMG) were performed as well. The sciatic nerve was scanned by ARFI (strain) elastography during knee movements in patients with DGS (143). In 54 patients surgical treatment was indicated, while 24 of them underwent surgery. The results were based on tissue response to ARFI by color elastogram and stiffness ratio. Diameters of the sciatic nerve in patients with DGS during knee flexion were statistically significantly lower than during extension movement (p&amp;lt;0.01). In patients with DGS (in ones without indication and the ones scheduled for surgery) sciatic nerve stiffness ratio was significantly increased (p&amp;lt;0.01) during knee flexion. Patients scheduled for surgery confirmed increased sciatic nerve stiffness during knee movements, compared with those without indications for surgery (p&amp;lt;0.05). Sciatic nerve recovery after surgery by diameter and stiffness ratio was marked (r=0.881). The correlation between MRI and EMG findings and ARFI nerve stiffness values in patients scheduled for surgery was high (r=0.963). The overall specificity of method was 93.5%, sensitivity was 88.9% with accuracy of 90.6%. ARFI elastography (by strain) is a diagnostic procedure based on nerve stiffness assessment and a useful tool in decision making for surgery and the follow up.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A Framework for Cortical Layer Composition Analysis using Low Resolution T1 MRI Images</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/390112v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The layer composition of the cerebral cortex represents a unique anatomical fingerprint of brain development, function, connectivity and pathology. Historically the cortical layers were investigated solely ex-vivo using histological means, but recent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies suggest that T1 relaxation images can be utilized to separate the layers. Despite technological advancements in the field of high resolution MRI, accurate estimation of whole brain layer composition has remained limited due to partial volume effects, leaving some layers far beyond the image resolution. In this study we offer a simple and accurate method for layer composition analysis, resolving partial volume effects and cortical curvature heterogeneity. We use a low resolution echo planar imaging inversion recovery (EPI IR) MRI scan protocol that provides fast acquisition (~12 minutes) and enables extraction of multiple T1 relaxation time components per voxel, which are assigned to types of brain tissue and utilized to extract the subvoxel composition of each T1 layer. While previous investigation of the layers required the estimation of cortical normals or smoothing of layer widths (similar to VBM), here we developed a sphere-based approach to explore the inner mesoscale architecture of the cortex. Our novel algorithm conducts spatial analysis using volumetric sampling of a system of virtual spheres dispersed throughout the entire cortical space. The methodology offers a robust and powerful framework for quantification and visualization of the layers on the cortical surface, providing a basis for quantitative investigation of their role in cognition, physiology and pathology.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Predicting One-Year Outcome in First Episode Psychosis using Machine Learning</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/390096v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Early illness course correlates with long-term outcome in psychosis. Accurate prediction could allow more focused intervention. Earlier intervention corresponds to significantly better symptomatic and functional outcomes. Our study objective is to use routinely collected baseline demographic and clinical characteristics to predict employment, education or training (EET) status, and symptom remission in patients with first episode psychosis (FEP) at one-year. Methods and findings: 83 FEP patients were recruited from National Health Service (NHS) Glasgow between 2011 and 2014 to a 24-month prospective cohort study with regular assessment of demographic and psychometric measures. An external independent cohort of 79 FEP patients were recruited from NHS Glasgow and Edinburgh during a 12-month study between 2006 and 2009. Elastic net regularised logistic regression models were built to predict binary EET status, period and point remission outcomes at one-year on 83 Glasgow patients (training dataset). Models were externally validated on an independent dataset of 79 patients from Glasgow and Edinburgh (validation dataset). Only baseline predictors shared across both cohorts were made available for model training and validation. After excluding participants with missing outcomes, models were built on the training dataset for EET status, period and point remission outcomes and externally validated on the validation dataset. Models predicted EET status, period and point remission with ROC area under curve (AUC) performances of 0.876 (95%CI: 0.864, 0.887), 0.630 (95%CI: 0.612, 0.647) and 0.652 (95%CI: 0.635, 0.670) respectively. Positive predictors of EET included baseline EET and living with spouse/children. Negative predictors included higher PANSS suspiciousness, hostility and delusions scores. Positive predictors for symptom remission included living with spouse/children, and affective symptoms on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Negative predictors of remission included passive social withdrawal symptoms on PANSS. A key limitation of this study is the small sample size (n) relative to the number of predictors (p), whereby p approaches n. The use of elastic net regularised regression rather than ordinary least squares regression helped circumvent this difficulty. Further, we did not have information for biological and additional social variables, such as nicotine dependence, which observational studies have linked to outcomes in psychosis. Conclusions and Relevance: Using advanced statistical machine learning techniques we provide the first externally validated evidence, in a temporally and geographically independent cohort, for the ability to predict one-year EET status and symptom remission in individual FEP patients.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/390088v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>People are able to keep track of objects as they navigate through space, even when objects are out of sight. This requires some kind of representation of the scene and of the observer's location. We tested the accuracy and reliability of observers' estimates of the visual direction of previously-viewed targets. Participants viewed 4 objects from one location, with binocular vision and small head movements giving information about the 3D locations of the objects. Without any further sight of the targets, participants walked to another location and pointed towards them. All the conditions were tested in an immersive virtual environment and some were also carried out in a real scene. Participants made large, consistent pointing errors that are poorly explained by any single 3D representation. Instead, a flattened representation of space that is dependent on the structure of the environment at the time of pointing provides a good account of participants' errors. This suggests that the mechanisms for updating visual direction of unseen targets are not based on a stable 3D model of the scene, even a distorted one.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/390443v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The claustrum is proposed to mediate a variety of functions ranging from sensory binding to top-down cognitive control of action, but direct functional assessments of this telencephalic nucleus are lacking. Here we employ the guanine nucleotide-binding subunit beta-4 cre driver line in mice to selectively monitor and manipulate claustrum projection neurons. Using fiber photometry, we find elevated claustrum activity prior to an expected cue during correct performance on a cognitively demanding five-choice response assay relative to a less-demanding one-choice version of the task. Claustrum activity during reward acquisition is also enhanced when cognitive demand is higher. Furthermore, we use optogenetic inhibition of claustrum prior to the expected cue to demonstrate that claustrum is critical for accurate performance on the five-choice, but not the one-choice, task. These results suggest the claustrum supports a cognitive control function necessary for reward acquisition under cognitively demanding conditions.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/390435v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are increasingly successful in solving tasks long considered hallmarks of cognition in Biological Neural Networks (BNN), such as visual discrimination, playing Go and navigation [1-7]. While the design of ANNs has been inspired by discoveries in BNNs [8], it is controversial whether both network types utilize the same fundamental principles and hence if ANNs can serve as models of animal cognition [9]. However, if representations and algorithms are shared between BNNs and ANNs, then the analysis of processing in ANNs could lead to fundamental insights into their biological counterparts. Here, we generated and trained a deep convolutional neural network to solve a heat gradient navigation task using the behavioral repertoire of larval zebrafish. We found that these behavioral constraints led to striking similarities in temperature processing and representation in this ANN with biological circuits and neural dynamics underlying heat avoidance in larval zebrafish [10]. This includes stimulus representation in ON and OFF types as well as ANN units showing adapting and sustained responses. Importantly, ANN performance critically relied on units representing temperature in a fish-like manner while other nodes were dispensable for network function. We next used the accessibility of the ANN to uncover new features of the zebrafish BNN. We identified a novel neuronal response type in the zebrafish brain that was predicted by the ANN but escaped detection in previous brain wide calcium imaging experiments. Finally, our approach generalized since training the same ANN constrained by the C. elegans motor repertoire resulted in distinct neural representations that match closely features observed in the worm. Together, these results emphasize convergence of ANNs and BNNs on canonical representations and that man made ANNs form a powerful tool to understand their biological counterparts.</content:encoded>

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology allows researchers to profile the transcriptomes of thousands of cells simultaneously. Protocols that incorporate both designed and random barcodes have greatly increased the throughput of scRNA-seq, but give rise to a more complex data structure. There is a need for new tools that can handle the various barcoding strategies used by different protocols and exploit this information for quality assessment at the sample-level and provide effective visualization of these results in preparation for higher-level analyses. To this end, we developed &lt;i&gt;scPipe&lt;/i&gt;, an R/Bioconductor package that integrates barcode demultiplexing, read alignment, UMI-aware gene-level quantification and quality control of raw sequencing data generated by multiple protocols that include CEL-seq, MARS-seq, Chromium 10X, Drop-seq and Smart-seq. &lt;i&gt;scPipe&lt;/i&gt; produces a count matrix that is essential for downstream analysis along with an HTML report that summarises data quality. These results can be used as input for downstream analyses including normalization, visualization and statistical testing. &lt;i&gt;scPipe&lt;/i&gt; performs this processing in a few simple R commands, promoting reproducible analysis of single-cell data that is compatible with the emerging suite of open-source scRNA-seq analysis tools available in R/Bioconductor and beyond.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Mohanalakshmi Narasumani, Paul M. Harrison&lt;/p&gt;

Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of proteins play significant biological functional roles despite lacking a well-defined 3D structure. For example, IDRs provide efficient housing for large numbers of post-translational modification (PTM) sites in eukaryotic proteins. Here, we study the distribution of more than 15,000 experimentally determined human methylation, acetylation and ubiquitination sites (collectively termed ‘MAU’ sites) in ordered and disordered regions, and analyse their conservation across 380 eukaryotic species. Conservation signals for the maintenance and novel emergence of MAU sites are examined at 11 evolutionary levels from the whole eukaryotic domain down to the ape superfamily, in both ordered and disordered regions. We discover that MAU PTM is a major driver of conservation for arginines and lysines in both ordered and disordered regions, across the 11 levels, most significantly across the mammalian clade. Conservation of human methylatable arginines is very strongly favoured for ordered regions rather than for disordered, whereas methylatable lysines are conserved in either set of regions, and conservation of acetylatable and ubiquitinatable lysines is favoured in disordered over ordered. Notably, we find evidence for the emergence of new lysine MAU sites in disordered regions of proteins in deuterostomes and mammals, and in ordered regions after the dawn of eutherians. For histones specifically, MAU sites demonstrate an idiosyncratic significant conservation pattern that is evident since the last common ancestor of mammals. Similarly, folding-on-binding (FB) regions are highly enriched for MAU sites relative to either ordered or disordered regions, with ubiquitination sites in FBs being highly conserved at all evolutionary levels back as far as mammals. This investigation clearly demonstrates the complex patterns of PTM evolution across the human proteome and that it is necessary to consider conservation of sequence features at multiple evolutionary levels in order not to get an incomplete or misleading picture.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AVRbsaFgEhA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

In schizophrenia, increased aberrant salience to irrelevant events and reduced learning of relevant information may relate to an underlying deficit in relevance detection. So far, subjective estimates of relevance have not been probed in schizophrenia patients. The mechanisms underlying belief formation about relevance and their translation into decisions are unclear. Using novel computational methods, we investigated relevance detection during implicit learning in 42 schizophrenia patients and 42 healthy individuals. Participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while detecting the outcomes in a learning task. These were preceded by cues differing in color and shape, which were either relevant or irrelevant for outcome prediction. We provided a novel definition of relevance based on Bayesian precision and modeled reaction times as a function of relevance weighted unsigned prediction errors (UPE). For aberrant salience, we assessed responses to subjectively irrelevant cue manifestations. Participants learned the contingencies and slowed down their responses following unexpected events. Model selection revealed that individuals inferred the relevance of cue features and used it for behavioral adaption to the relevant cue feature. Relevance weighted UPEs correlated with dorsal anterior cingulate cortex activation and hippocampus deactivation. In patients, the aberrant salience bias to subjectively task-irrelevant information was increased and correlated with decreased striatal UPE activation and increased negative symptoms. This study shows that relevance estimates based on Bayesian precision can be inferred from observed behavior. This underscores the importance of relevance detection as an underlying mechanism for behavioral adaptation in complex environments and enhances the understanding of aberrant salience in schizophrenia.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/njS8vXy7zbs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Motivation Modulates Brain Networks in Response to Faces Varying in Race and Status: A Multivariate Approach</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0039-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Previous behavioral and neuroimaging work indicates that individuals who are externally motivated to respond without racial prejudice tend not to spontaneously regulate their prejudice and prefer to focus on non-racial attributes when evaluating others. This fMRI multivariate analysis used Partial Least Squares (PLS) to examine the distributed neural processing of race and a relevant but ostensibly non-racial attribute (viz., socioeconomic status) as a function of the perceiver’s external motivation. Sixty-one White male participants (&lt;i&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/i&gt;) privately formed impressions of Black and White male faces ascribed with high or low status. Across all conditions, greater external motivation was associated with reduced co-activation of brain regions believed to support emotion regulation (rostral anterior cingulate cortex), introspection (middle cingulate), and social cognition (temporal pole, medial prefrontal cortex). The reduced involvement of this network irrespective of target race and status suggests that external motivation is related to the participant’s overall approach to impression formation in an interracial context. The findings highlight the importance of examining network co-activation in understanding the role of external motivation in impression formation, among other interracial social processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; This multivariate fMRI analysis examined distributed neural processing as participants formed impressions of faces varying in race and status. Across all conditions, participants reporting greater external motivation to respond without racial prejudice showed reduced co-activation in brain regions believed to support emotion regulation, introspection, and social cognition. These results suggest that external motivation may calibrate how perceivers form impressions in an interracial context, irrespective of target race. Results from this analysis raise new questions that may not have readily emerged in studies relying on traditional behavioral and univariate fMRI analyses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Evolutionary optimisation of neural network models for fish collective behaviours in mixed groups of robots and zebrafish. (arXiv:1808.03166v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03166</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Animal and robot social interactions are interesting both for ethological
studies and robotics. On the one hand, the robots can be tools and models to
analyse animal collective behaviours, on the other hand, the robots and their
artificial intelligence are directly confronted and compared to the natural
animal collective intelligence. The first step is to design robots and their
behavioural controllers that are capable of socially interact with animals.
Designing such behavioural bio-mimetic controllers remains an important
challenge as they have to reproduce the animal behaviours and have to be
calibrated on experimental data. Most animal collective behavioural models are
designed by modellers based on experimental data. This process is long and
costly because it is difficult to identify the relevant behavioural features
that are then used as a priori knowledge in model building. Here, we want to
model the fish individual and collective behaviours in order to develop robot
controllers. We explore the use of optimised black-box models based on
artificial neural networks (ANN) to model fish behaviours. While the ANN may
not be biomimetic but rather bio-inspired, they can be used to link perception
to motor responses. These models are designed to be implementable as robot
controllers to form mixed-groups of fish and robots, using few a priori
knowledge of the fish behaviours. We present a methodology with multilayer
perceptron or echo state networks that are optimised through evolutionary
algorithms to model accurately the fish individual and collective behaviours in
a bounded rectangular arena. We assess the biomimetism of the generated models
and compare them to the fish experimental behaviours.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38461</link>
	<content:encoded>SWELL1 (LRRC8A) is the only essential subunit of the Volume Regulated Anion Channel (VRAC), which regulates cellular volume homeostasis and is activated by hypotonic solutions. SWELL1, together with four other LRRC8 family members, potentially forms a vastly heterogeneous cohort of VRAC channels with different properties; however, SWELL1 alone is also functional. Here, we report a high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of full-length human homo-hexameric SWELL1. The structure reveals a trimer of dimers assembly with symmetry mismatch between the pore-forming domain and the cytosolic leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains. Importantly, mutational analysis demonstrates that a charged residue at the narrowest constriction of the homomeric channel is an important pore determinant of heteromeric VRAC. Additionally, a mutation in the flexible N-terminal portion of SWELL1 affects pore properties, suggesting a putative link between intracellular structures and channel regulation. This structure provides a scaffold for further dissecting the heterogeneity and mechanism of activation of VRAC.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37267</link>
	<content:encoded>Class II HLH proteins heterodimerize with class I HLH/E proteins to regulate transcription. Here we show that E proteins sharpen neurogenesis by adjusting the neurogenic strength of the distinct proneural proteins. We find that inhibiting BMP signaling or its target ID2 in the chick embryo spinal cord, impairs the neuronal production from progenitors expressing ATOH1/ASCL1, but less severely that from progenitors expressing NEUROG1/2/PTF1a. We show this context-dependent response to result from the differential modulation of proneural proteins' activity by E proteins. E proteins synergize with proneural proteins when acting on CAGSTG motifs, thereby facilitating the activity of ASCL1/ATOH1 which preferentially bind to such motifs. Conversely, E proteins restrict the neurogenic strength of NEUROG1/2 by directly inhibiting their preferential binding to CADATG motifs. Since we find this mechanism to be conserved in corticogenesis, we propose this differential co-operation of E proteins with proneural proteins as a novel though general feature of their mechanism of action.</content:encoded>

Using extracts from either cells, or tissues, polysomes can be separated within 15 min from sample injection to fraction collection. Ribo Mega-SEC shows translating ribosomes exist predominantly in polysome complexes in human cell lines and mouse liver tissue. Changes in polysomes are easily quantified between treatments, such as the cellular response to amino acid starvation. Ribo Mega-SEC is shown to provide an efficient, convenient and highly reproducible method for studying functional translation complexes. We show that Ribo Mega-SEC is readily combined with high-throughput MS-based proteomics to characterize proteins associated with polysomes and ribosomal subunits.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/35786</link>
	<content:encoded>The neural crest (NC) is a multipotent embryonic cell population that generates distinct cell types in an axial position-dependent manner. The production of NC cells from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) is a valuable approach to study human NC biology. However, the origin of human trunk NC remains undefined and current &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; differentiation strategies induce only a modest yield of trunk NC cells. Here we show that hPSC-derived axial progenitors, the posteriorly-located drivers of embryonic axis elongation, give rise to trunk NC cells and their derivatives. Moreover, we define the molecular signatures associated with the emergence of human NC cells of distinct axial identities &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Collectively, our findings indicate that there are two routes toward a human post-cranial NC state: the birth of cardiac and vagal NC is facilitated by retinoic acid-induced posteriorisation of an anterior precursor whereas trunk NC arises within a pool of posterior axial progenitors.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/35373</link>
	<content:encoded>Wingless/Wnts are signalling molecules, traditionally considered to pattern tissues as long-range morphogens. However, more recently the spread of Wingless was shown to be dispensable in diverse developmental contexts in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; and vertebrates. Here we demonstrate that release and spread of Wingless is required to pattern the proximo-distal (P-D) axis of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Malpighian tubules. Wingless signalling, emanating from the midgut, directly activates &lt;i&gt;odd skipped&lt;/i&gt; expression several cells distant in the proximal tubule. Replacing Wingless with a membrane-tethered version that is unable to diffuse from the Wingless producing cells results in aberrant patterning of the Malpighian tubule P-D axis and development of short, deformed ureters. This work directly demonstrates a patterning role for a released Wingless signal. As well as extending our understanding about the functional modes by which Wnts shape animal development, we anticipate this mechanism to be relevant to patterning epithelial tubes in other organs, such as the vertebrate kidney.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34595</link>
	<content:encoded>The ultimate overexpression of a protein could cause growth defects, which are known as the protein burden. However, the expression limit at which the protein-burden effect is triggered is still unclear. To estimate this limit, we systematically measured the overexpression limits of glycolytic proteins in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;. The limits of some glycolytic proteins were up to 15% of the total cellular protein. These limits were independent of the proteins’ catalytic activities, a finding that was supported by an in silico analysis. Some proteins had low expression limits that were explained by their localization and metabolic perturbations. The codon usage should be highly optimized to trigger the protein-burden effect, even under strong transcriptional induction. The S–S-bond-connected aggregation mediated by the cysteine residues of a protein might affect its expression limit. Theoretically, only non-harmful proteins could be expressed up to the protein-burden limit. Therefore, we established a framework to distinguish proteins that are harmful and non-harmful upon overexpression.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/33250</link>
	<content:encoded>During awake consciousness, the brain intrinsically maintains a dynamical state in which it can coordinate complex responses to sensory input. How the brain reaches this state spontaneously is not known. General anesthesia provides a unique opportunity to examine how the human brain recovers its functional capabilities after profound unconsciousness. We used intracranial electrocorticography and scalp EEG in humans to track neural dynamics during emergence from propofol general anesthesia. We identify a distinct transient brain state that occurs immediately prior to recovery of behavioral responsiveness. This state is characterized by large, spatially distributed, slow sensory-evoked potentials that resemble the K-complexes that are hallmarks of stage two sleep. However, the ongoing spontaneous dynamics in this transitional state differ from sleep. These results identify an asymmetry in the neurophysiology of induction and emergence, as the emerging brain can enter a state with a sleep-like sensory blockade before regaining responsivity to arousing stimuli.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Inactivation of medial frontal cortex changes risk preference</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/390021v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Humans and other animals need to make decisions under varying degrees of uncertainty. These decisions are strongly influenced by an individual's risk preference, however the neuronal circuitry by which risk preference shapes choice is still unclear. Supplementary eye field (SEF), an oculomotor area within primate medial frontal cortex, is thought to be an essential part of the neuronal circuit underlying oculomotor decision-making, including decisions under risk. Consistent with this view, risk-related action value and monitoring signals have been observed in SEF. However, such activity has also been observed in other frontal areas, including orbitofrontal, cingulate, and dorsal lateral frontal cortex. It is thus unknown whether the activity in SEF causally contributes to risky decisions, or if it is merely a reflection of neural processes in other cortical regions. Here, we tested a causal role of SEF in risky oculomotor choices. We found that SEF inactivation strongly reduced the frequency of risky choices. This reduction was largely due to a reduced attraction to reward uncertainty and high reward gain, but not due to changes in the subjective estimation of reward probability or average expected reward. Moreover, SEF inactivation also led to increased sensitivity to differences between expected and actual reward during free choice. Nevertheless, it did not affect adjustments of decisions based on reward history.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Stable and efficient locomotion requires precise coordination of whole-body movements. Learned changes in interlimb coordination can be induced by exposure to a split-belt treadmill that imposes different speeds under each side of the body. Here we show that mice adapt to split-belt walking in a way that is remarkably similar to humans, suggesting that this form of locomotor learning is highly conserved across vertebrates. Like human learning, mouse locomotor adaptation is specific to measures of interlimb coordination, has spatial and temporal components that adapt at different rates, and is highly context-specific. Using a variety of approaches, we demonstrate that split-belt adaptation in mice specifically depends on intermediate cerebellum, but is insensitive to large lesions of cerebral cortex. Finally, cell-type specific chemogenetics combined with quantitative behavioral analysis reveal distinct neural circuit mechanisms underlying spatial vs. temporal components of locomotor adaptation.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Risk-taking behavior affects many aspects of life, including maladaptive behaviors such as illicit substance use, unsafe driving, and risky sexual behavior. Risk-taking has been measured using both self-report measures and behavioral tasks designed for the purpose, but there is little consensus in the associations among measures and our understanding of the latent constructs underlying different forms of risk is limited. In the present study we examined the construct of risk using data from over 1000 young adults who completed measures of risk-taking, including self-reports of perception of risk, propensity to engage in risky behaviors and performance on behavioral tasks designed to measure risk. To examine the latent structure of risk preferences, we conducted a principal component analysis (PCA). The PCA revealed a latent structure of three distinct components of risk-taking behavior: &quot;Lifestyle Risk Sensitivity&quot;, &quot;Financial Risk Sensitivity&quot;, and &quot;Behavioral Risk Sensitivity&quot;, which consisted only of the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART; Lejuez et al., 2002). As expected, risk-taking and perception of risk differed in men and women. Yet, the PCA components were similar in men and women. Future work utilizing additional measures of risk-taking behavior in more heterogeneous samples will help to identify the true biobehavioral constructs underlying these behaviors.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Here we describe a novel mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) that moves the site of kainate injection from the rodent dorsal hippocampus (corresponding to the human posterior hippocampus) to the ventral hippocampus (corresponding to the human anterior hippocampus). We compare the phenotypes of this new model—with respect to seizures, cognitive impairment, affective deficits, and histopathology—to the standard dorsal intrahippocampal kainate model. Our results demonstrate that histopathological measures of granule cell dispersion and mossy fiber sprouting maximize near the site of kainate injection. Somewhat surprisingly, both the dorsal and ventral models exhibit similar spatial memory impairments in addition to similar electrographic and behavioral seizure burdens. In contrast, we find a more pronounced affective (anhedonic) phenotype specifically in the ventral model. These results demonstrate that the ventral intrahippocampal kainic acid model recapitulates critical pathologies of the dorsal model while providing a means to further study affective phenotypes such as depression in TLE.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/4/ENEURO.0129-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Circadian clocks modulate timing of sleep/wake cycles in animals; however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;, large ventral lateral neurons (l-LN&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) are known to promote wakefulness through the action of the neuropeptide pigment dispersing factor (PDF), but the downstream targets of PDF signalling remain elusive. In a screen using downregulation or overexpression (OEX) of the gene encoding PDF receptor (&lt;i&gt;pdfr&lt;/i&gt;), we found that a subset of dopaminergic neurons responds to PDF to promote wakefulness during the day. Moreover, we found that small LN&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; (s-LN&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) and dopaminergic neurons form synaptic contacts, and PDFR signalling inhibited dopaminergic neurons specifically during day time. We propose that these dopaminergic neurons that respond to PDFR signalling are sleep-promoting and that during the day when PDF levels are high, they are inhibited, thereby promoting wakefulness. Thus, we identify a novel circadian clock pathway that mediates wake promotion specifically during day time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Oscillations are ubiquitous features of brain dynamics that undergo task-related changes in synchrony, power, and frequency. The impact of those changes on target networks is poorly understood. In this work, we used a biophysically detailed model of prefrontal cortex (PFC) to explore the effects of varying the spike rate, synchrony, and waveform of strong oscillatory inputs on the behavior of cortical networks driven by them. Interacting populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons with strong feedback inhibition are inhibition-based network oscillators that exhibit resonance (i.e., larger responses to preferred input frequencies). We quantified network responses in terms of mean firing rates and the population frequency of network oscillation; and characterized their behavior in terms of the natural response to asynchronous input and the resonant response to oscillatory inputs. We show that strong feedback inhibition causes the PFC to generate internal (natural) oscillations in the beta/gamma frequency range (&amp;gt;15 Hz) and to maximize principal cell spiking in response to external oscillations at slightly higher frequencies. Importantly, we found that the fastest oscillation frequency that can be relayed by the network maximizes local inhibition and is equal to a frequency even higher than that which maximizes the firing rate of excitatory cells; we call this phenomenon population frequency resonance. This form of resonance is shown to determine the optimal driving frequency for suppressing responses to asynchronous activity. Lastly, we demonstrate that the natural and resonant frequencies can be tuned by changes in neuronal excitability, the duration of feedback inhibition, and dynamic properties of the input. Our results predict that PFC networks are tuned for generating and selectively responding to beta- and gamma-rhythmic signals due to the natural and resonant properties of inhibition-based oscillators. They also suggest strategies for optimizing transcranial stimulation and using oscillatory networks in neuromorphic engineering.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9krHxaH4sa8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The mechanisms by which different microbes colonize the healthy human gut versus other body sites, the gut in disease states, or other environments remain largely unknown. Identifying microbial genes influencing fitness in the gut could lead to new ways to engineer probiotics or disrupt pathogenesis. We approach this problem by measuring the statistical association between a species having a gene and the probability that the species is present in the gut microbiome. The challenge is that closely related species tend to be jointly present or absent in the microbiome and also share many genes, only a subset of which are involved in gut adaptation. We show that this phylogenetic correlation indeed leads to many false discoveries and propose phylogenetic linear regression as a powerful solution. To apply this method across the bacterial tree of life, where most species have not been experimentally phenotyped, we use metagenomes from hundreds of people to quantify each species’ prevalence in and specificity for the gut microbiome. This analysis reveals thousands of genes potentially involved in adaptation to the gut across species, including many novel candidates as well as processes known to contribute to fitness of gut bacteria, such as acid tolerance in Bacteroidetes and sporulation in Firmicutes. We also find microbial genes associated with a preference for the gut over other body sites, which are significantly enriched for genes linked to fitness in an &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; competition experiment. Finally, we identify gene families associated with higher prevalence in patients with Crohn’s disease, including Proteobacterial genes involved in conjugation and fimbria regulation, processes previously linked to inflammation. These gene targets may represent new avenues for modulating host colonization and disease. Our strategy of combining metagenomics with phylogenetic modeling is general and can be used to identify genes associated with adaptation to any environment.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NwEaQS18QuE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Characterization of Tissue Plasminogen Activator Expression and Trafficking in the Adult Murine Brain</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/4/ENEURO.0119-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is an immediate-early gene important for regulating physiological processes like synaptic plasticity and neurovascular coupling. It has also been implicated in several pathological processes including blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, seizure progression, and stroke. These varied reports suggest that tPA is a pleiotropic mediator whose actions are highly compartmentalized in space and time. The specific localization of tPA, therefore, can provide useful information about its function. Accordingly, the goal of this study was to provide a detailed characterization of tPA’s regional, cellular, and subcellular localization in the brain. To achieve this, two new transgenic mouse lines were utilized: (1) a PlatβGAL reporter mouse, which houses the β-galactosidase gene in the tPA locus and (2) a tPA&lt;sup&gt;BAC&lt;/sup&gt;-Cerulean mouse, which has a cerulean-fluorescent protein fused in-frame to the tPA C-terminus. Using these two transgenic reporters, we show that while tPA is expressed throughout most regions of the adult murine brain, it appears to be preferentially targeted to fiber tracts in the limbic system. In the hippocampus, confocal microscopy revealed tPA-Cerulean (tPA-Cer) puncta localized to giant mossy fiber boutons (MFBs) and astrocytes in stratum lucidum. With amplification of the tPA-Cer signal, somatically localized tPA was also observed in the stratum oriens (SO)/alveus layer of both CA1 and CA3 subfields. Coimmunostaining of tPA-Cer and interneuronal markers indicates that these tPA-positive cell bodies belong to a subclass of somatostatin (SST)/oriens-lacunosum moleculare (O-LM) interneurons. Together, these data imply that tPA’s localization is differentially regulated, suggesting that its neuromodulatory effects may be compartmentalized and specialized to cell type.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Interlimb Generalization of Learned Bayesian Visuomotor Prior Occurs in Extrinsic Coordinates</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/4/ENEURO.0183-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent work suggests that the brain represents probability distributions and performs Bayesian integration during sensorimotor learning. However, our understanding of the neural representation of this learning remains limited. To begin to address this, we performed two experiments. In the first experiment, we replicated the key behavioral findings of Körding and Wolpert (2004), demonstrating that humans can perform in a Bayes-optimal manner by combining information about their own sensory uncertainty and a statistical distribution of lateral shifts encountered in a visuomotor adaptation task. In the second experiment, we extended these findings by testing whether visuomotor learning occurring during the same task generalizes from one limb to the other, and relatedly, whether this learning is represented in an extrinsic or intrinsic reference frame. We found that the learned mean of the distribution of visuomotor shifts generalizes to the opposite limb only when the perturbation is congruent in extrinsic coordinates, indicating that the underlying representation of learning acquired during training is available to the untrained limb and is coded in an extrinsic reference frame.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Sodium Channel-Dependent and -Independent Mechanisms Underlying Axonal Afterdepolarization at Mouse Hippocampal Mossy Fibers</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0254-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Action potentials propagating along axons are often followed by prolonged afterdepolarization (ADP) lasting for several tens of milliseconds. Axonal ADP is thought to be an important factor in modulating the fidelity of spike propagation during repetitive firings. However, the mechanism as well as the functional significance of axonal ADP remain unclear, partly due to inaccessibility to small structures of axon for direct electrophysiological recordings. Here, we examined the ionic and electrical mechanisms underlying axonal ADP using whole-bouton recording from mossy fiber terminals in mice hippocampal slices. ADP following axonal action potentials was strongly enhanced by focal application of veratridine, an inhibitor of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel inactivation. On the contrary, tetrodotoxin (TTX) partly suppressed ADP, suggesting that a Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel-dependent component is involved in axonal ADP. The remaining TTX-resistant Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel-independent component represents slow capacitive discharge reflecting the shape and electrical properties of the axonal membrane. We also addressed the functional impact of axonal ADP on presynaptic function. In paired-pulse stimuli, we found that axonal ADP minimally affected the peak height of subsequent action potentials, although the rising phase of action potentials was slightly slowed, possibly due to steady-state inactivation of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels by prolonged depolarization. Voltage clamp analysis of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; current elicited by action potential waveform commands revealed that axonal ADP assists short-term facilitation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry into the presynaptic terminals. Taken together, axonal ADP maintains reliable firing during repetitive stimuli and plays important roles in the fine-tuning of short-term plasticity of transmitter release by modulating Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry into presynaptic terminals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Axonal action potentials are often followed by depolarizing or hyperpolarizing afterpotentials. This study illuminated the mechanisms of ADP in the hippocampal mossy fibers, where morphologic as well as biophysical data were accumulated. We found that slow activating Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels are partly involved in ADP. Capacitive components also substantially contribute to ADP, suggesting that axonal shape and electrical properties are optimized for high-fidelity propagation during repetitive stimuli. We also tested the roles of ADP in the activity-dependent tuning of the presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; current. Action potential-driven Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry into the axon terminals was facilitated by paired stimuli, possibly due to Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; current facilitation by ADP. Therefore, ADP contributes to fine-tuning of transmitter release and ensures high-fidelity spiking of axons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Neural Pattern Classification Tracks Transfer-Appropriate Processing in Episodic Memory</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0251-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The transfer-appropriate processing (TAP) account holds that episodic memory depends on the overlap between encoding and retrieval processing. In the current study, we employed multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) of electroencephalography to examine the relevance of spontaneously engaged visual processing during encoding for later retrieval. Human participants encoded word- picture associations, where the picture could be a famous face, a landmark, or an object. At test, we manipulated the retrieval demands by asking participants to retrieve either visual or verbal information about the pictures. MVPA revealed classification between picture categories during early perceptual stages of encoding (~170 ms). Importantly, these visual category-specific neural patterns were predictive of later episodic remembering, but the direction of the relationship was contingent on the particular retrieval demand of the memory task: a benefit for the visual and a cost for the verbal. A reinstatement of the category-specific neural patterns established during encoding was observed during retrieval, and again the relationship with behavior varied with retrieval demands. Reactivation of visual representations during retrieval was associated with better memory in the visual task, but with lower performance in the verbal task. Our findings support and extend the TAP account by demonstrating that processing of particular aspects during memory formation can also have detrimental effects on later episodic remembering when other aspects of the event are called-for and shed new light on encoding and retrieval interactions in episodic memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Episodic memory allows us to mentally travel in time to relive our personal past. The likelihood that a previous episode will be remembered is considered to depend on the extent to which processes engaged during encoding are also engaged at the time of retrieval. In the present study, we leveraged multivariate pattern analysis of high time-resolution oscillatory brain activity to assess participants’ category-specific visual processing during memory formation, and later cortical reinstatement at retrieval. The results demonstrate that category-specific visual processing may predict both benefits and costs in episodic memory, depending on the retrieval requirements. These novel findings elucidate the neurocognitive dynamics of encoding and retrieval, which mediate the access to our personal past.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/39879</link>
	<content:encoded>Outside of the neurogenic niches of the brain, postmitotic neurons have not been found to undergo efficient regeneration. We demonstrate that mouse Purkinje cells (PCs), which are born at midgestation and are crucial for development and function of cerebellar circuits, are rapidly and fully regenerated following their ablation at birth. New PCs are produced from immature FOXP2+ neural precursors (iPCs) that are able to enter the cell cycle and support normal cerebellum development. The number of iPCs and their regenerative capacity, however, diminish soon after birth and consequently PCs are poorly replenished when ablated at postnatal day five. Nevertheless, the PC-depleted cerebella reach a normal size by increasing cell size, but scaling of neuron types is disrupted and cerebellar function is impaired. Our findings provide a new paradigm in the field of neuron regeneration by identifying a population of immature neurons that buffers against perinatal brain injury in a stage-dependent process.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>We generated two new genetic tools to efficiently tag genes in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. The first, Double Header (DH) utilizes intronic MiMIC/CRIMIC insertions to generate artificial exons for GFP mediated protein trapping or T2A-GAL4 gene trapping &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt;based on Cre recombinase to avoid embryo injections. DH significantly increases integration efficiency compared to previous strategies and faithfully reports the expression pattern of genes and proteins. The second technique targets genes lacking coding introns using a two-step cassette exchange. First, we replace the endogenous gene with an excisable compact dominant marker using CRISPR making a null allele. Second, the insertion is replaced with a protein::tag cassette. This sequential manipulation allows the generation of numerous tagged alleles or insertion of other DNA fragments that facilitates multiple downstream applications. Both techniques allow precise gene manipulation and facilitate detection of gene expression, protein localization and assessment of protein function, as well as numerous other applications.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Targeting light-gated chloride channels to neuronal somatodendritic domain reduces their excitatory effect in the axon</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38506</link>
	<content:encoded>Light-gated chloride channels are emerging as promising optogenetic tools for inhibition of neural activity. However, their effects depend on the transmembrane chloride electrochemical gradient and may be complex due to the heterogeneity of this gradient in different developmental stages, neuronal types, and subcellular compartments. Here we characterized a light-gated chloride channel, GtACR2, in mouse cortical neurons. We found that GtACR2 activation inhibited the soma, but unexpectedly depolarized the presynaptic terminals resulting in neurotransmitter release. Other light-gated chloride channels had similar effects. Reducing the chloride concentrations in the axon and presynaptic terminals diminished the GtACR2-induced neurotransmitter release, indicating an excitatory effect of chloride channels in these compartments. A novel hybrid somatodendritic targeting motif reduced the GtACR2-induced neurotransmitter release while enhancing the somatic photocurrents. Our results highlight the necessity of precisely determining the effects of light-gated chloride channels under specific experimental conditions and provide a much-improved light-gated chloride channel for optogenetic inhibition.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38232</link>
	<content:encoded>D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase (DTD) acts on achiral glycine, in addition to D-amino acids, attached to tRNA. We have recently shown that this activity enables DTD to clear non-cognate Gly-tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Ala&lt;/sup&gt; with 1000-fold higher efficiency than its activity on Gly-tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Gly&lt;/sup&gt;, indicating tRNA-based modulation of DTD (Pawar et al., 2017). Here, we show that tRNA's discriminator base predominantly accounts for this activity difference and is the key to selection by DTD. Accordingly, the uracil discriminator base, serving as a negative determinant, prevents Gly-tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Gly&lt;/sup&gt; misediting by DTD and this protection is augmented by EF-Tu. Intriguingly, eukaryotic DTD has inverted discriminator base specificity and uses only G3•U70 for tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Gly/Ala&lt;/sup&gt; discrimination. Moreover, DTD prevents alanine-to-glycine misincorporation in proteins rather than only recycling mischarged tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Ala&lt;/sup&gt;. Overall, the study reveals the unique co-evolution of DTD and discriminator base, and suggests DTD's strong selection pressure on bacterial tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Gly&lt;/sup&gt;s to retain a pyrimidine discriminator code.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37621</link>
	<content:encoded>The influence of biomechanics on the tempo and mode of morphological evolution is unresolved, yet is fundamental to organismal diversification. Across multiple four-bar linkage systems in animals, we discovered that rapid morphological evolution (tempo) is associated with mechanical sensitivity (strong correlation between a mechanical system's output and one or more of its components). Mechanical sensitivity is explained by size: the smallest link(s) are disproportionately affected by length changes and most strongly influence mechanical output. Rate of evolutionary change (tempo) is greatest in the smallest links and trait shifts across phylogeny (mode) occur exclusively via the influential, small links. Our findings illuminate the paradigms of many-to-one mapping, mechanical sensitivity, and constraints: tempo and mode are dominated by strong correlations that exemplify mechanical sensitivity, even in linkage systems known for exhibiting many-to-one mapping. Amidst myriad influences, mechanical sensitivity imparts distinct, predictable footprints on morphological diversity.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>VivosX is an &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; disulfide crosslinking approach that utilizes a pair of strategically positioned cysteines on two proteins to probe physical interactions within cells. Histone H2A.Z, which often replaces one or both copies of H2A in nucleosomes downstream of promoters, was used to validate VivosX. Disulfide crosslinks between cysteine-modified H2A.Z and/or H2A histones within nucleosomes were induced using a membrane-permeable oxidant. VivosX detected different combinations of H2A.Z and H2A within nucleosomes in yeast cells. This assay correctly reported the change in global H2A.Z occupancy previously observed when the deposition and eviction pathways of H2A.Z were perturbed. Homotypic H2A.Z/H2A.Z (ZZ) nucleosomes accumulated when assembly of the transcription preinitiation complex was blocked, revealing that the transcription machinery preferentially disassembles ZZ nucleosomes. VivosX works in human cells and distinguishes ZZ nucleosomes with one or two ubiquitin moieties, demonstrating that it can be used to detect protein-protein interactions inside cells from different species.</content:encoded>

From the spatial coordinates of intracellular features such as segmented subcellular structures or vesicle trajectories, QuantEv automatically estimates weighted densities that are easy to interpret and performs a comprehensive statistical analysis from distribution distances. We apply this approach to study the spatio-temporal distribution of moving Rab6 fluorescently labeled membranes with respect to their direction of movement in crossbow- and disk-shaped cells. We also investigate the position of the generating hub of Rab11-positive membranes and the effect of actin disruption on Rab11 trafficking in coordination with cell shape.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Transmembrane Domain of Synaptobrevin Influences Neurotransmitter Flux through Synaptic Fusion Pores</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/32/7179?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The soluble &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor (SNARE) proteins synaptobrevin (Syb), syntaxin, and SNAP-25 function in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-triggered exocytosis in both endocrine cells and neurons. The transmembrane domains (TMDs) of Syb and syntaxin span the vesicle and plasma membrane, respectively, and influence flux through fusion pores in endocrine cells as well as fusion pores formed during SNARE-mediated fusion of reconstituted membranes. These results support a model for exocytosis in which SNARE TMDs form the initial fusion pore. The present study sought to test this model in synaptic terminals. Patch-clamp recordings of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) were used to probe fusion pore properties in cultured hippocampal neurons from mice of both sexes. Mutants harboring tryptophan at four different sites in the Syb TMD reduced the rate-of-rise of mEPSCs. A computer model that simulates glutamate diffusion and receptor activation kinetics could account for this reduction in mEPSC rise rate by slowing the flux of glutamate through synaptic fusion pores. TMD mutations introducing positive charge also reduced the mEPSC rise rate, but negatively charged residues and glycine, which should have done the opposite, had no effect. The sensitivity of mEPSCs to pharmacological blockade of receptor desensitization was enhanced by a mutation that slowed the mEPSC rate-of-rise, suggesting that the mutation prolonged the residence of glutamate in the synaptic cleft. The same four Syb TMD residues found here to influence synaptic release were found previously to influence endocrine release, leading us to propose that a similar TMD-lined fusion pore functions widely in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-triggered exocytosis in mammalian cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; SNARE proteins function broadly in biological membrane fusion. Evidence from non-neuronal systems suggests that SNARE proteins initiate fusion by forming a fusion pore lined by transmembrane domains, but this model has not yet been tested in synapses. The present study addressed this question by testing mutations in the synaptic vesicle SNARE synaptobrevin for an influence on the rise rate of miniature synaptic currents. These results indicate that synaptobrevin's transmembrane domain interacts with glutamate as it passes through the fusion pore. The sites in synaptobrevin that influence this flux are identical to those shown previously to influence flux through endocrine fusion pores. Thus, SNARE transmembrane domains may function in the fusion pores of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-triggered exocytosis of both neurotransmitters and hormones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Beta-Blocker Propranolol Modulates Decision Urgency During Sequential Information Gathering</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/32/7170?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Arbitrating between timely choice and extended information gathering is critical for effective decision making. Aberrant information gathering behavior is thought to be a feature of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder, but we know little about the underlying neurocognitive control mechanisms. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled drug study involving 60 healthy human subjects (30 female), we examined the effects of noradrenaline and dopamine antagonism on information gathering during performance of an information sampling task. We show that modulating noradrenaline function with 40 mg of the β-blocker propranolol leads to decreased information gathering behavior. Modulating dopamine function via a single dose of 400 mg of amisulpride revealed some effects that were intermediate between those of propranolol and placebo. Using a Bayesian computational model, we show that sampling behavior is best explained by inclusion of a nonlinear urgency signal that promotes commitment to an early decision. Noradrenaline blockade promotes the expression of this decision-related urgency signal during information gathering. We discuss the findings with respect to psychopathological conditions that are linked to aberrant information gathering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Knowing when to stop gathering information and commit to a choice option is nontrivial. This is an important element in arbitrating between information gain and energy conservation. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled drug study, we investigated the role of catecholamines noradrenaline and dopamine on sequential information gathering. We found that blockade of noradrenaline led to a decrease in information gathering. Dopamine blockade showed an intermediate, but nonsignificant, effect. Using a Bayesian computational model, we show that this noradrenaline effect is driven by increased decision urgency, a signal that reflects an escalating subjective cost of sampling. The observation that noradrenaline modulates decision urgency suggests new avenues for treating patients that show information gathering deficits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Generic Mechanism for Perceptual Organization in the Parietal Cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/32/7158?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Our visual system's ability to group visual elements into meaningful entities and to separate them from others is referred to as scene segmentation. Visual motion often provides a powerful cue for this process as parallax or coherence can inform the visual system about scene or object structure. Here we tested the hypothesis that scene segmentation by motion cues relies on a common neural substrate in the parietal cortex. We used fMRI and a set of three entirely distinct motion stimuli to examine scene segmentation in the human brain. The stimuli covered a wide range of high-level processes, including perceptual grouping, transparent motion, and depth perception. All stimuli were perceptually bistable such that percepts alternated every few seconds while the physical stimulation remained constant. The perceptual states were asymmetric, in that one reflected the default (nonsegmented) interpretation, and the other the non-default (segmented) interpretation. We confirmed behaviorally that upon stimulus presentation, the default percept was always perceived first, before perceptual alternations ensued. Imaging results showed that across all stimulus classes perceptual scene-segmentation was associated with an increase of activity in the posterior parietal cortex together with a decrease of neural signal in the early visual cortex. This pattern of activation is compatible with predictive coding models of visual perception, and suggests that parietal cortex hosts a generic mechanism for scene segmentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Making sense of cluttered visual scenes is crucial for everyday perception. An important cue to scene segmentation is visual motion: slight movements of scene elements give away which elements belong to the foreground or background or to the same object. We used three distinct stimuli that engage visual scene segmentation mechanisms based on motion. They involved perceptual grouping, transparent motion, and depth perception. Brain activity associated with all three mechanisms converged in the same parietal region with concurrent deactivation of early visual areas. The results suggest that posterior parietal cortex is a hub involved in structuring visual scenes based on different motion cues, and that feedback modulates early cortical processing in accord with predictive coding theory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neural Computations Underlying Causal Structure Learning</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/32/7143?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Behavioral evidence suggests that beliefs about causal structure constrain associative learning, determining which stimuli can enter into association, as well as the functional form of that association. Bayesian learning theory provides one mechanism by which structural beliefs can be acquired from experience, but the neural basis of this mechanism is poorly understood. We studied this question with a combination of behavioral, computational, and neuroimaging techniques. Male and female human subjects learned to predict an outcome based on cue and context stimuli while being scanned using fMRI. Using a model-based analysis of the fMRI data, we show that structure learning signals are encoded in posterior parietal cortex, lateral prefrontal cortex, and the frontal pole. These structure learning signals are distinct from associative learning signals. Moreover, representational similarity analysis and information mapping revealed that the multivariate patterns of activity in posterior parietal cortex and anterior insula encode the full posterior distribution over causal structures. Variability in the encoding of the posterior across subjects predicted variability in their subsequent behavioral performance. These results provide evidence for a neural architecture in which structure learning guides the formation of associations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Animals are able to infer the hidden structure behind causal relations between stimuli in the environment, allowing them to generalize this knowledge to stimuli they have never experienced before. A recently published computational model based on this idea provided a parsimonious account of a wide range of phenomena reported in the animal learning literature, suggesting a dedicated neural mechanism for learning this hidden structure. Here, we validate this model by measuring brain activity during a task that involves both structure learning and associative learning. We show that a distinct network of regions supports structure learning and that the neural signal corresponding to beliefs about structure predicts future behavioral performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Efficient Coding in Visual Working Memory Accounts for Stimulus-Specific Variations in Recall</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/32/7132?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recall of visual features from working memory varies in both bias and precision depending on stimulus parameters. Whereas a number of models can approximate the average distribution of recall error across target stimuli, attempts to model how error varies with the choice of target have been &lt;i&gt;ad hoc&lt;/i&gt;. Here we adapt a neural model of working memory to provide a principled account of these stimulus-specific effects, by allowing each neuron's tuning function to vary according to the principle of efficient coding, which states that neural responses should be optimized with respect to the frequency of stimuli in nature. For orientation, this means incorporating a prior that favors cardinal over oblique orientations. While continuing to capture the changes in error distribution with set size, the resulting model accurately described stimulus-specific variations as well, better than a slot-based competitor. Efficient coding produces a repulsive bias away from cardinal orientations, a bias that ought to be sensitive to changes in the environmental statistics. We subsequently tested whether shifts in the stimulus distribution influenced response bias to uniformly sampled target orientations in human subjects (of either sex). Across adaptation blocks, we manipulated the distribution of nontarget items by sampling from a bimodal congruent (incongruent) distribution with peaks centered on cardinal (oblique) orientations. Preadaptation responses were repulsed away from the cardinal axes. However, exposure to the incongruent distribution produced systematic decreases in repulsion that persisted after adaptation. This result confirms the role of prior expectation in generating stimulus-specific effects and validates the neural framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Theories of neural coding have been used successfully to explain how errors in recall from working memory depend on the number of items stored. However, recall of visual features also shows stimulus-specific variation in bias and precision. Here we unify two previously unconnected theories, the neural resource model of working memory and the efficient coding framework, to provide a principled account of these stimulus-specific effects. Given the importance of working memory limitations to multiple aspects of human and animal behavior, and the recent high-profile advances in theories of efficient coding, our modeling framework provides a richer, yet parsimonious, description of how orientation encoding influences visual working memory performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Selective Role of RGS9-2 in Regulating Retrograde Synaptic Signaling of Indirect Pathway Medium Spiny Neurons in Dorsal Striatum</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/32/7120?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the striatum, medium spiny neurons (MSNs) are heavily involved in controlling movement and reward. MSNs form two distinct populations expressing either dopamine receptor 1 (D1-MSN) or dopamine receptor 2 (D2-MSN), which differ in their projection targets and neurochemical composition. The activity of both types of MSNs is shaped by multiple neuromodulatory inputs processed by GPCRs that fundamentally impact their synaptic properties biasing behavioral outcomes. How these GPCR signaling cascades are regulated and what downstream targets they recruit in D1-MSN and D2-MSN populations are incompletely understood. In this study, we examined the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the action of RGS9–2, a key GPCR regulator in MSNs implicated in both movement control and actions of addictive drugs. Imaging cultured striatal neurons, we found that ablation of RGS9–2 significantly reduced calcium influx through NMDARs. Electrophysiological recordings in slices confirmed inhibition of NMDAR function in MSNs, resulting in enhanced AMPAR/NMDAR ratio. Accordingly, male mice lacking RGS9–2 displayed behavioral hypersensitivity to NMDAR blockade by MK-801 or ketamine. Recordings from genetically identified populations of striatal neurons revealed that these changes were selective to D2-MSNs. Surprisingly, we found that these postsynaptic effects resulted in remodeling of presynaptic inputs to D2-MSNs increasing the frequency of mEPSC and inhibiting paired-pulse ratio. Pharmacological dissection revealed that these adaptations were mediated by the NMDAR-dependent inhibition of retrograde endocannabinoid signaling from D2-MSNs to CB1 receptor on presynaptic terminals. Together, these data demonstrate a novel mechanism for pathway selective regulation of synaptic plasticity in MSNs controlled by GPCR signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study identifies a role for a major G-protein regulator in controlling synaptic properties of striatal neurons in a pathway selective fashion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Synaptopathy in the Aging Cochlea: Characterizing Early-Neural Deficits in Auditory Temporal Envelope Processing</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/32/7108?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aging listeners, even in the absence of overt hearing loss measured as changes in hearing thresholds, often experience impairments processing temporally complex sounds such as speech in noise. Recent evidence has shown that normal aging is accompanied by a progressive loss of synapses between inner hair cells and auditory nerve fibers. The role of this cochlear synaptopathy in degraded temporal processing with age is not yet understood. Here, we used population envelope following responses, along with other hair cell- and neural-based measures from an age-graded series of male and female CBA/CaJ mice to study changes in encoding stimulus envelopes. By comparing responses obtained before and after the application of the neurotoxin ouabain to the inner ear, we demonstrate that we can study changes in temporal processing on either side of the cochlear synapse. Results show that deficits in neural coding with age emerge at the earliest neural stages of auditory processing and are correlated with the degree of cochlear synaptopathy. These changes are seen before losses in neural thresholds and particularly affect the suprathreshold processing of sound. Responses obtained from more central sources show smaller differences with age, suggesting compensatory gain. These results show that progressive cochlear synaptopathy is accompanied by deficits in temporal coding at the earliest neural generators and contribute to the suprathreshold sound processing deficits observed with age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Aging listeners often experience difficulty hearing and understanding speech in noisy conditions. The results described here suggest that age-related loss of cochlear synapses may be a significant contributor to those performance declines. We observed aberrant neural coding of sounds in the early auditory pathway, which was accompanied by and correlated with an age-progressive loss of synapses between the inner hair cells and the auditory nerve. Deficits first appeared before changes in hearing thresholds and were largest at higher sound levels relevant to real world communication. The noninvasive tests described here may be adapted to detect cochlear synaptopathy in the clinical setting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Drug Refraining and Seeking Potentiate Synapses on Distinct Populations of Accumbens Medium Spiny Neurons</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/32/7100?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cocaine-associated cues and contexts can precipitate drug seeking in humans and in experimental animals. Glutamatergic synapses in the core subcompartment of the nucleus accumbens (NAcore) undergo transient potentiation in response to presenting drug-associated cues. The NAcore contains two populations of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) that differentially express D1 or D2 dopamine receptors. By recording the ratio of AMPA and NMDA glutamate receptor currents (AMPA/NMDA ratio) from MSNs in NAcore tissue slices, we endeavored to understand which subpopulation of MSNs was undergoing transient potentiation. Transgenic female and male mice differentially expressing fluorescent reporters in D1 or D2 MSNs were withdrawn for 2–3 weeks after being trained to self-administer cocaine. In some mice, discrete cocaine-conditioned cues were isolated from the drug-associated context via extinction training, which causes rodents to refrain from drug seeking in the extinguished context. By measuring AMPA/NMDA ratios in the drug context with or without contextual or discrete cues, and with or without extinction training, we made the following three discoveries: (1) mice refraining from cocaine seeking in the extinguished context showed selective elevation in AMPA/NMDA ratios in D2 MSNs; (2) without extinction training, the drug-associated context selectively increased AMPA/NMDA ratios in D1 MSNs; (3) mice undergoing cue-induced cocaine seeking after extinction training in the drug-associated context showed AMPA/NMDA ratio increases in both D1 and D2 MSNs. These findings reveal that the NAcore codes drug seeking through transient potentiation of D1 MSNs, and that refraining from cocaine seeking in an extinguished context is coded through transient potentiation of D2 MSNs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Relapse is a primary symptom of addiction that can involve competition between the desire to use drugs and the desire to refrain from using drugs. Drug-associated cues induce relapse, which is correlated with transiently potentiated glutamatergic synapses in the nucleus accumbens core. We determined which of two cell populations in the accumbens core, D1-expressing or D2-expressing neurons, undergo transient synaptic potentiation. After being trained to self-administer cocaine, mice underwent withdrawal, some with and others without extinguishing responding in the drug-associated context. Extinguished mice showed transient potentiation in D2-expressing neurons in the extinguished environment, and all mice engaged in context-induced or cue-induced drug seeking showed transient potentiation of D1-expressing neurons. A simple binary engram in accumbens for seeking drugs and refraining from drugs offers opportunities for cell-specific therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Targeting TrkB with a Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Mimetic Promotes Myelin Repair in the Brain</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/32/7088?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Methods to promote myelin regeneration in response to central myelin loss are essential to prevent the progression of clinical disability in demyelinating diseases. The neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is known to promote myelination during development via oligodendrocyte expressed TrkB receptors. Here, we use a structural mimetic of BDNF to promote myelin regeneration in a preclinical mouse model of central demyelination. In female mice, we show that selective targeting of TrkB with the BDNF-mimetic enhances remyelination, increasing oligodendrocyte differentiation, the frequency of myelinated axons, and myelin sheath thickness after a demyelinating insult. Treatment with exogenous BDNF exerted an attenuated effect, increasing myelin sheath thickness only. Further, following conditional deletion of TrkB from premyelinating oligodendrocytes, we show the effects of the BDNF-mimetic on oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination are lost, indicating these are dependent on oligodendrocyte expression of TrkB. Overall, these studies demonstrate that targeting oligodendrocyte TrkB promotes &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; remyelination in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Novel strategies to promote myelin regeneration are required to prevent progressive neurodegeneration and clinical disability in patients with central demyelinating disease. Here, we test whether selectively targeting the TrkB receptor on the myelin-producing oligodendrocytes, can promote remyelination in the brain. Using a structural mimetic of its native ligand, BDNF, we show that stimulation of TrkB enhances remyelination, increasing oligodendrocyte differentiation, the frequency of myelinated axons and thickness of the myelin sheath following a demyelinating insult. Further, we show that these effects are dependent on the phosphorylation of oligodendrocyte expressed TrkB receptors &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Overall, we demonstrate that selective targeting of TrkB has therapeutic potential to promote remyelination in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Claudin-like Protein HPO-30 Is Required to Maintain LAChRs at the C. elegans Neuromuscular Junction</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/32/7072?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Communications across chemical synapses are primarily mediated by neurotransmitters and their postsynaptic receptors. There are diverse molecular systems to localize and regulate the receptors at the synapse. Here, we identify HPO-30, a member of the claudin superfamily of membrane proteins, as a positive regulator for synaptic localization of levamisole-dependent AChRs (LAChRs) at the &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; neuromuscular junction (NMJ). The HPO-30 protein localizes at the NMJ and shows genetic and physical association with the LAChR subunits LEV-8, UNC-29, and UNC-38. Using genetic and electrophysiological assays in the hermaphrodite &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;, we demonstrate that HPO-30 functions through Neuroligin at the NMJ to maintain postsynaptic LAChR levels at the synapse. Together, this work suggests a novel function for a tight junction protein in maintaining normal receptor levels at the NMJ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Claudins are a large superfamily of membrane proteins. Their role in maintaining the functional integrity of tight junctions has been widely explored. Our experiments suggest a critical role for the claudin-like protein, HPO-30, in maintaining synaptic levamisole-dependent AChR (LAChR) levels. LAChRs contribute to &amp;lt;20% of the acetylcholine-mediated conductance in adult &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;; however, they play a significant functional role in worm locomotion.

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Regional Distribution of CNS Antigens Differentially Determines T-Cell Mediated Neuroinflammation in a CX3CR1-Dependent Manner</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/32/7058?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;T cells continuously sample CNS-derived antigens in the periphery, yet it is unknown how they sample and respond to CNS antigens derived from distinct brain areas. We expressed ovalbumin (OVA) neoepitopes in regionally distinct CNS areas (Cnp-OVA and Nes-OVA mice) to test peripheral antigen sampling by OVA-specific T cells under homeostatic and neuroinflammatory conditions. We show that antigen sampling in the periphery is independent of regional origin of CNS antigens in both male and female mice. However, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is differentially influenced in Cnp-OVA and Nes-OVA female mice. Although there is the same frequency of CD45&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; CD11b+ CD11c+ CX3CL1+ myeloid cell–T-cell clusters in neoepitope-expressing areas, EAE is inhibited in Nes-OVA female mice and accelerated in CNP-OVA female mice. Accumulation of OVA-specific T cells and their immunomodulatory effects on EAE are CX3C chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1) dependent. These data show that despite similar levels of peripheral antigen sampling, CNS antigen-specific T cells differentially influence neuroinflammatory disease depending on the location of cognate antigens and the presence of CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Our data show that peripheral T cells similarly recognize neoepitopes independent of their origin within the CNS under homeostatic conditions. Contrastingly, during ongoing autoimmune neuroinflammation, neoepitope-specific T cells differentially influence clinical score and pathology based on the CNS regional location of the neoepitopes in a CX3CR1-dependent manner. Altogether, we propose a novel mechanism for how T cells respond to regionally distinct CNS derived antigens and contribute to CNS autoimmune pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Angiotensin II Triggers Peripheral Macrophage-to-Sensory Neuron Redox Crosstalk to Elicit Pain</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/32/7032?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Injury, inflammation, and nerve damage initiate a wide variety of cellular and molecular processes that culminate in hyperexcitation of sensory nerves, which underlies chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Using behavioral readouts of pain hypersensitivity induced by angiotensin II (Ang II) injection into mouse hindpaws, our study shows that activation of the type 2 Ang II receptor (AT2R) and the cell-damage-sensing ion channel TRPA1 are required for peripheral mechanical pain sensitization induced by Ang II in male and female mice. However, we show that AT2R is not expressed in mouse and human dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons. Instead, expression/activation of AT2R on peripheral/skin macrophages (Ms) constitutes a critical trigger of mouse and human DRG sensory neuron excitation. Ang II-induced peripheral mechanical pain hypersensitivity can be attenuated by chemogenetic depletion of peripheral Ms. Furthermore, AT2R activation in Ms triggers production of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, which &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-activate TRPA1 on mouse and human DRG sensory neurons via cysteine modification of the channel. Our study thus identifies a translatable immune cell-to-sensory neuron signaling crosstalk underlying peripheral nociceptor sensitization. This form of cell-to-cell signaling represents a critical peripheral mechanism for chronic pain and thus identifies multiple druggable analgesic targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Pain is a widespread health problem that is undermanaged by currently available analgesics. Findings from a recent clinical trial on a type II angiotensin II receptor (AT2R) antagonist showed effective analgesia for neuropathic pain. AT2R antagonists have been shown to reduce neuropathy-, inflammation- and bone cancer-associated pain in rodents. We report that activation of AT2R in macrophages (Ms) that infiltrate the site of injury, but not in sensory neurons, triggers an intercellular redox communication with sensory neurons via activation of the cell damage/pain-sensing ion channel TRPA1. This M-to-sensory neuron crosstalk results in peripheral pain sensitization. Our findings provide an evidence-based mechanism underlying the analgesic action of AT2R antagonists, which could accelerate the development of efficacious non-opioid analgesic drugs for multiple pain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Persistent activity generated in the PFC during the delay period of working memory tasks represents information about stimuli held in memory and determines working memory performance. Alternative models of working memory, depending on the rhythmicity of discharges or exclusively on short-term synaptic plasticity, are inconsistent with the neurophysiological data.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Persistent spiking has been thought to underlie working memory (WM). However, virtually all of the evidence for this comes from studies that averaged spiking across time and across trials, which masks the details. On single trials, activity often occurs in sparse transient bursts. This has important computational and functional advantages. In addition, examination of more complex tasks reveals neural coding in WM is dynamic over the course of a trial. All this suggests that spiking is important for WM, but that its role is more complex than simply persistent spiking.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recently Dzhafarov and Kon published the paper presenting the critical
viewpoint on applications of quantum probabilities to modeling of physical and
mental observations. They advertised classical probability theory and the
method of coupling. The latter is used by Dzhafarov et al. to embed observables
for generally incompatible contexts in the common Kolmogorov probability space.
Here I present comments on this paper by stressing advantages and disadvantages
of Dzhafarov et al. approach. In appendix 1, I point to its possible
generalization

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Experimental Design Modulates Variance in BOLD Activation: The Variance Design General Linear Model. (arXiv:1808.02157v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02157</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Typical fMRI studies have focused on either the mean trend in the
blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) time course or functional connectivity
(FC). However, other statistics of the neuroimaging data may contain important
information. Despite studies showing links between the variance in the BOLD
time series (BV) and age and cognitive performance, a formal framework for
testing these effects has not yet been developed. We introduce the Variance
Design General Linear Model (VDGLM), a novel framework that facilitates the
detection of variance effects. We designed the framework for general use in any
fMRI study by modeling both mean and variance in BOLD activation as a function
of experimental design. The flexibility of this approach allows the VDGLM to i)
simultaneously make inferences about a mean or variance effect while
controlling for the other and ii) test for variance effects that could be
associated with multiple conditions and/or noise regressors. We demonstrate the
use of the VDGLM in a working memory application and show that engagement in a
working memory task is associated with whole-brain decreases in BOLD variance.

Here, we review new studies showing evidence for diverse allele-specific expression and epigenetic states in mammalian brain cells, which suggest that diploidy expands the landscape of gene regulatory and expression programs in cells. Allele-specific expression has been thought to be restricted to a few specific classes of genes. However, new studies show novel genomic imprinting effects that are brain-region-, cell-type- and age-dependent.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Network-level allosteric effects are elucidated by detailing how ligand-binding events modulate utilization of catalytic potentials</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/cFSQuS8gwrc/article</link>

Allosteric regulation has traditionally been described by mathematically-complex allosteric rate laws in the form of ratios of polynomials derived from the application of simplifying kinetic assumptions. Alternatively, an approach that explicitly describes all known ligand-binding events requires no simplifying assumptions while allowing for the computation of enzymatic states. Here, we employ such a modeling approach to examine the “catalytic potential” of an enzyme—an enzyme’s capacity to catalyze a biochemical reaction. The catalytic potential is the fundamental result of multiple ligand-binding events that represents a “tug of war” among the various regulators and substrates within the network. This formalism allows for the assessment of interacting allosteric enzymes and development of a network-level understanding of regulation. We first define the catalytic potential and use it to characterize the response of three key kinases (hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase) in human red blood cell glycolysis to perturbations in ATP utilization. Next, we examine the sensitivity of the catalytic potential by using existing personalized models, finding that the catalytic potential allows for the identification of subtle but important differences in how individuals respond to such perturbations. Finally, we explore how the catalytic potential can help to elucidate how enzymes work in tandem to maintain a homeostatic state. Taken together, this work provides an interpretation and visualization of the dynamic interactions and network-level effects of interacting allosteric enzymes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cFSQuS8gwrc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Network supporting contextual fear learning after dorsal hippocampal damage has increased dependence on retrosplenial cortex</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/Nut-R4-WNSE/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Cesar A. O. Coelho, Tatiana L. Ferreira, Juliana C. Kramer-Soares, João R. Sato, Maria Gabriela M. Oliveira&lt;/p&gt;

Hippocampal damage results in profound retrograde, but no anterograde amnesia in contextual fear conditioning (CFC). Although the content learned in the latter have been discussed, alternative regions supporting CFC learning were seldom proposed and never empirically addressed. Here, we employed network analysis of pCREB expression quantified from brain slices of rats with dorsal hippocampal lesion (dHPC) after undergoing CFC session. Using inter-regional correlations of pCREB-positive nuclei between brain regions, we modelled functional networks using different thresholds. The dHPC network showed small-world topology, equivalent to SHAM (control) network. However, diverging hubs were identified in each network. In a direct comparison, hubs in both networks showed consistently higher centrality values compared to the other network. Further, the distribution of correlation coefficients was different between the groups, with most significantly stronger correlation coefficients belonging to the SHAM network. These results suggest that dHPC network engaged in CFC learning is partially different, and engage alternative hubs. We next tested if pre-training lesions of dHPC and one of the new dHPC network hubs (perirhinal, Per; or disgranular retrosplenial, RSC, cortices) would impair CFC. Only dHPC-RSC, but not dHPC-Per, impaired CFC. Interestingly, only RSC showed a consistently higher centrality in the dHPC network, suggesting that the increased centrality reflects an increased functional dependence on RSC. Our results provide evidence that, without hippocampus, the RSC, an anatomically central region in the medial temporal lobe memory system might support CFC learning and memory.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Nut-R4-WNSE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Differential Involvement of Kinase Activity of Ca2+/Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase II{alpha} in Hippocampus- and Amygdala-Dependent Memory Revealed by Kinase-Dead Knock-in Mouse</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0133-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα (CaMKIIα) is a key mediator of activity-dependent neuronal modifications and has been implicated in the molecular mechanisms of learning and memory. Indeed, several types of CaMKIIα knock-in and knock-out mice revealed impairments in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and behavioral learning. On the other hand, a similar role for CaMKIIα has been implicated in amygdala-dependent memory, but detailed analyses have not much been performed yet. To better understand its involvement in amygdala-dependent memory as compared to hippocampus-dependent memory, here we performed biochemical analyses and behavioral memory tests using the kinase-dead CaMKIIα (K42R) knock-in mouse. In the Morris water maze tasks, homozygous mutants performed well in the visible platform trials, while they failed to form spatial memory in the hippocampus-dependent hidden platform trials. In fear conditioning, these mice were impaired but showed a certain level of amygdala-dependent cued fear memory, which lasted four weeks, while they showed virtually no hippocampus-dependent context discrimination. Neither stronger stimulation nor repetitive stimulation compensated for their memory deficits. The differential outcome of hippocampus- and amygdala-dependent memory in the mutant mouse was not due to differential expression of CaMKIIα between the hippocampus and the amygdala, because biochemical analyses revealed that both kinase activity and protein levels of CaMKII were indistinguishable between the two brain regions. These results indicate that kinase activity of CaMKIIα is indispensable for hippocampus-dependent memory, but not necessarily for amygdala-dependent memory. There may be a secondary, CaMKIIα activity-independent pathway, in addition to the CaMKIIα activity-dependent pathway, in the acquisition of amygdala-dependent memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Studying molecular mechanisms of learning and memory is important to confront memory-deficient and abnormal memory-associated disorders. An enzyme called Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα (CaMKIIα) that is abundant in the brain and phosphorylates important proteins has a key role in such mechanisms. However, how CaMKIIα enzymatic activity is involved in hippocampus- vs. amygdala-dependent memory is still not clear. Using our genetically engineered mouse that lacks kinase activity but retains protein expression of CaMKIIα, here we showed that kinase activity of CaMKIIα is indispensable for hippocampus-dependent space/context-related memory, but not necessarily for amygdala-dependent fear-related memory. The role of CaMKIIα kinase activity in distinguishing different contexts indicates its possible involvement as a measure against abnormal fear memory-associated disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Immediate-Early Promoter-Driven Transgenic Reporter System for Neuroethological Researches in a Hemimetabolous Insect</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0061-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Genes expressed in response to increased neuronal activity are widely used as activity markers in recent behavioral neuroscience. In the present study, we established transgenic reporter system for whole-brain activity mapping in the two-spotted cricket &lt;i&gt;Gryllus bimaculatus&lt;/i&gt;, a hemimetabolous insect used in neuroethology and behavioral ecology. In the cricket brain, a homolog of &lt;i&gt;early growth response-1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Gryllus egr-B&lt;/i&gt;) was rapidly induced as an immediate-early gene (IEG) in response to neuronal hyperexcitability. The upstream genomic fragment of &lt;i&gt;Gryllus egr-B&lt;/i&gt; contains potential binding sites for transcription factors regulated by various intracellular signaling pathways, as well as core promoter elements conserved across insect/crustacean &lt;i&gt;egr-B&lt;/i&gt; homologs. Using the upstream genomic fragment of &lt;i&gt;Gryllus egr-B,&lt;/i&gt; we established an IEG promoter-driven transgenic reporter system in the cricket. In the brain of transgenic crickets, the reporter gene (a nuclear-targeted destabilized EYFP) was induced in response to neuronal hyperexcitability. Inducible expression of reporter protein was detected in almost all neurons after neuronal hyperexcitability. Using our novel reporter system, we successfully detected neuronal activation evoked by feeding in the cricket brain. Our IEG promoter-driven activity reporting system allows us to visualize behaviorally relevant neural circuits at cellular resolution in the cricket brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Insects are the largest and most diverse group of organisms, and show a wide variety of behaviors. Despite the importance of a comparative approach, recent insect neuroethology mostly relies on the fruit fly &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;, a versatile model insect with particularly powerful genetic tools, and a relatively small number of researchers use non-&lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; insects. In the present study, a novel genetic reporting system for whole-brain activity mapping was established in the two-spotted cricket &lt;i&gt;Gryllus bimaculatus&lt;/i&gt; by using the newly identified and evolutionary conserved gene regulatory region of an immediate-early gene, &lt;i&gt;early growth response&lt;/i&gt;. This reporting system allowed us to analyze the behaviorally-evoked neural activity patterns at cellular resolution in the cricket brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Spiking Neural Networks modelled as Timed Automata with parameter learning. (arXiv:1808.01893v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01893</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this paper we present a novel approach to automatically infer parameters
of spiking neural networks. Neurons are modelled as timed automata waiting for
inputs on a number of different channels (synapses), for a given amount of time
(the accumulation period). When this period is over, the current potential
value is computed considering current and past inputs. If this potential
overcomes a given threshold, the automaton emits a broadcast signal over its
output channel , otherwise it restarts another accumulation period. After each
emission, the automaton remains inactive for a fixed refractory period. Spiking
neural networks are formalised as sets of automata, one for each neuron,
running in parallel and sharing channels according to the network structure.
Such a model is formally validated against some crucial properties defined via
proper temporal logic formulae. The model is then exploited to find an
assignment for the synaptical weights of neural networks such that they can
reproduce a given behaviour. The core of this approach consists in identifying
some correcting actions adjusting synaptical weights and back-propagating them
until the expected behaviour is displayed. A concrete case study is discussed.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01805</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Social and affective relations may shape empathy to others' affective states.
Previous studies also revealed that people tend to form very different mental
representations of stimuli on the basis of their physical distance. In this
regard, embodied cognition proposes that different physical distances between
individuals activate different interpersonal processing modes, such that close
physical distance tends to activate the interpersonal processing mode typical
of socially and affectively close relationships. In Experiment 1, two groups of
participants were administered a pain decision task involving upright and
inverted face stimuli painfully or neutrally stimulated, and we monitored their
neural empathic reactions by means of event-related potentials (ERPs)
technique. Crucially, participants were presented with face stimuli of one of
two possible sizes in order to manipulate retinal size and perceived physical
distance, roughly corresponding to the close and far portions of social
distance. ERPs modulations compatible with an empathic reaction were observed
only for the group exposed to face stimuli appearing to be at a close social
distance from the participants. This reaction was absent in the group exposed
to smaller stimuli corresponding to face stimuli observed from a far social
distance. In Experiment 2, one different group of participants was engaged in a
match-to-sample task involving the two-size upright face stimuli of Experiment
1 to test whether the modulation of neural empathic reaction observed in
Experiment 1 could be ascribable to differences in the ability to identify
faces of the two different sizes. Results suggested that face stimuli of the
two sizes could be equally identifiable. In line with the Construal Level and
Embodied Simulation theoretical frameworks, we conclude that perceived physical
distance may shape empathy as well as social and affective distance.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01642</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In order to decode the human brain, Multivariate Pattern (MVP) classification
generates cognitive models by using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(fMRI) datasets. As a standard pipeline in the MVP analysis, brain patterns in
multi-subject fMRI dataset must be mapped to a shared space and then a
classification model is generated by employing the mapped patterns. However,
the MVP models may not provide stable performance on a new fMRI dataset because
the standard pipeline uses disjoint steps for generating these models. Indeed,
each step in the pipeline includes an objective function with independent
optimization approach, where the best solution of each step may not be optimum
for the next steps. For tackling the mentioned issue, this paper introduces the
Multi-Objective Cognitive Model (MOCM) that utilizes an integrated objective
function for MVP analysis rather than just using those disjoint steps. For
solving the integrated problem, we proposed a customized multi-objective
optimization approach, where all possible solutions are firstly generated, and
then our method ranks and selects the robust solutions as the final results.
Empirical studies confirm that the proposed method can generate superior
performance in comparison with other techniques.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01612</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Colour information not only helps sustain the survival of animal species by
guiding sexual selection and foraging behaviour, but also is an important
factor in the cultural and technological development of our own species. This
is illustrated by examples from the visual arts and from state-of-the-art
imaging technology, where the strategic use of colour has become a powerful
tool for guiding the planning and execution of interventional procedures. The
functional role of colour information in terms of its potential benefits to
behavioural success across the species is addressed in the introduction here to
clarify why colour perception may have evolved to generate behavioural success.
It is argued that evolutionary and environmental pressures influence not only
colour trait production in the different species, but also their ability to
process and exploit colour information for goal-specific purposes. We then leap
straight to the human primate with insight from current research on the
facilitating role of colour cues on performance training with precision
technology for image-guided surgical planning and intervention. It is shown
that local colour cues in 2D images generated by a surgical fisheye camera help
individuals become more precise rapidly across a limited number of trial sets
in simulator training for specific manual gestures with a tool. The
progressively facilitating effect of a local colour cue on performance
evolution in a video controlled simulator task can be explained in terms of
colour-based figure-ground segregation guiding attention towards local image
parts, with an immediate cost on performance time, and a lasting long-term
benefit in terms of greater task precision.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01503</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Grid cells in the entorhinal cortex are believed to establish their regular,
spatially correlated firing patterns by path integration of the animal's
motion. Mechanisms for path integration, e.g. in attractor network models,
predict stochastic drift of grid responses, which is not observed
experimentally. We demonstrate a biologically plausible mechanism of dynamic
self-organization by which border cells, which fire at environmental
boundaries, can correct such drift in grid cells. In our model,
experience-dependent Hebbian plasticity during exploration allows border cells
to learn connectivity to grid cells. Border cells in this learned network reset
the phase of drifting grids. This error-correction mechanism is robust to
environmental shape and complexity, including enclosures with interior
barriers, and makes distinctive predictions for environmental deformation
experiments. Our work demonstrates how diverse cell types in the entorhinal
cortex could interact dynamically and adaptively to achieve robust path
integration.

Developmental patterning mechanisms are critical to ensuring concordance between dendritic form and function. This article reviews recent studies in vertebrate retina and brain that elucidate key strategies for dendrite functional maturation. Specific cellular and molecular signals control the initiation and elaboration of dendritic arbors, and facilitate integration of young neurons into particular circuits. In some cells, dendrite growth and remodeling continues into adulthood. Once formed, dendrites subdivide into compartments with distinct physiological properties that enable dendritic computations. Understanding these key stages of dendrite patterning will help reveal how circuit functional properties arise during development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

Dynamic correlations are pervasive in high-throughput data. Large numbers of gene pairs can change their correlation patterns in response to observed/unobserved changes in physiological states. Finding changes in correlation patterns can reveal important regulatory mechanisms. Currently there is no method that can effectively detect global dynamic correlation patterns in a dataset. Given the challenging nature of the problem, the currently available methods use genes as surrogate measurements of physiological states, which cannot faithfully represent true underlying biological signals. In this study we develop a new method that directly identifies strong latent dynamic correlation signals from the data matrix, named DCA: Dynamic Correlation Analysis. At the center of the method is a new metric for the identification of pairs of variables that are highly likely to be dynamically correlated, without knowing the underlying physiological states that govern the dynamic correlation. We validate the performance of the method with extensive simulations. We applied the method to three real datasets: a single cell RNA-seq dataset, a bulk RNA-seq dataset, and a microarray gene expression dataset. In all three datasets, the method reveals novel latent factors with clear biological meaning, bringing new insights into the data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PtZYXnfwjiY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Differentiation in Theta and Beta Electrocortical Activity between Visual and Physical Perturbations to Walking and Standing Balance</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0207-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Human balance is a complex process in healthy adults, requiring precisely-timed coordination between sensory information, cognitive processing, and motor control. It has been difficult to quantify brain dynamics during human balance control due to limitations in brain imaging modalities. The goal of this study was to determine if by using high-density electroencephalography (EEG) and independent component analysis, we can identify common cortical responses to visual and physical balance perturbations during walking and standing. We studied the responses of 30 healthy young adults to sensorimotor perturbations that challenged their balance. Subjects performed four 10-minute trials of beam-walking and tandem stance while either being mediolaterally pulled at the waist or viewing brief 20° field-of-view rotations in virtual reality. We recorded high-density EEG, motion capture, lower leg electromyography (EMG), and neck EMG. We hypothesized that both physical pull and visual rotation perturbations would elicit time-frequency fluctuations in theta (4-8 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) bands, with increased occipito-parietal activity during visual rotations compared to pull perturbations. Our results confirmed this hypothesis. For both perturbations, we found early theta synchronization and late alpha-beta (8-30 Hz) desynchronization following perturbation onset. This pattern was strongest in occipito-parietal areas during visual perturbations and strongest in sensorimotor areas during pull perturbations. These results suggest a similar time-frequency electrocortical pattern when humans respond to sensorimotor conflict, but with substantive differences in the brain areas involved for visual vs. physical perturbations. Our findings may have important implications for assessing and training balance in individuals with and without motor disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; We performed the first EEG time-frequency analysis on source-localized human electrocortical responses to physical and visual balance perturbations during both walking and standing. Perturbations elicited similar time-frequency patterns, but in notably different cortical areas for physical versus visual perturbations. Perturbation-evoked EEG fluctuations localized primarily to occipito-parietal areas during visual perturbations and motor areas during physical perturbations. These similarities suggest a common electrocortical response to sensorimotor perturbations. Notably, standing had greater electrocortical responses than walking. The results from this study may have applications in assessing and assisting treatment of balance dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Built to Last: Functional and structural mechanisms in the moth olfactory network mitigate effects of neural injury. (arXiv:1808.01279v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01279</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Most organisms are exposed to neural damage throughout their lives, which can
reduce their ability to carry out core behavioral tasks. Their neural circuits
need to maintain functionality despite injury, which often requires that key
readout signals from the system be preserved. In this work, we explore whether
and how certain structural and functional network motifs act as injury
mitigation mechanisms by protecting these readouts. Specifically, we examine
how (i) Hebbian learning, (ii) high levels of noise, and (iii) presence of
parallel inhibitory and excitatory connections contribute to robustness of the
olfactory system in the Manduca sexta moth.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We simulate injuries on a detailed computational model of the moth olfactory
network in which structures-under-test are parametrically varied. Neuronal
impairments are modeled as focal axonal swellings, an axonal pathology observed
across all severities of traumatic brain injuries and present in other leading
brain disorders. Axonal swellings effectively compromise spike train
propagation along the axon and consequently reduce the effective neural firing
rate delivered to downstream neurons.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three of the network motifs examined significantly mitigate the effects
of injury on readout neurons, either by reducing injury's impact on readout
neuron responses or by restoring these responses to pre-injury levels through
reinforcement learning. These motifs may thus be partially explained by their
value as adaptive mechanisms to minimize the functional effects of neural
injury. More generally, these experiments suggest that robustness to injury is
a vital design principle to consider when analyzing biological neural systems.
Indeed, it is possible that some neural structures and mechanisms, including
the ability to learn, are best understood as evolutionary solutions to the
challenge of maintaining system function despite injury.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01058</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the information processing roles of cortical circuits is an
outstanding problem in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. The
theoretical setting of Bayesian inference has been suggested as a framework for
understanding cortical computation. Based on a recently published generative
model for visual inference (George et al., 2017), we derive a family of
anatomically instantiated and functional cortical circuit models. In contrast
to simplistic models of Bayesian inference, the underlying generative model's
representational choices are validated with real-world tasks that required
efficient inference and strong generalization. The cortical circuit model is
derived by systematically comparing the computational requirements of this
model with known anatomical constraints. The derived model suggests precise
functional roles for the feedforward, feedback and lateral connections observed
in different laminae and columns, and assigns a computational role for the path
through the thalamus.

Using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing, we have compared the methylomes of neuronal and non-neuronal cells from 3 human and 3 chimpanzee cortices. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) with genome-wide significance were enriched in specific genomic regions. Intraspecific methylation differences between neuronal and non-neuronal cells were approximately 3 times more abundant than interspecific methylation differences between human and chimpanzee cell types. The vast majority (&amp;gt;90%) of human intraspecific DMRs (including DMRs in retrotransposons) were hypomethylated in neurons, compared with glia. Intraspecific DMRs were enriched in genes associated with different neuropsychiatric disorders. Interspecific DMRs were enriched in genes showing human-specific brain histone modifications. Human–chimpanzee methylation differences were much more frequent in non-neuronal cells (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n. DMRs&lt;/span&gt; = 666) than in neurons (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n. DMRs&lt;/span&gt; = 96). More than 95% of interspecific DMRs in glia were hypermethylated in humans. Although without an outgroup we cannot assign whether a change in methylation occurred in the human or chimpanzee lineage, our results are consistent with a wave of methylation affecting several hundred non-neuronal genes during human brain evolution.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Glycosyltransferases are a class of enzymes that catalyse the posttranslational modification of proteins to produce a large number of glycoconjugate acceptors from a limited number of nucleotide-sugar donors. The products of one glycosyltransferase can be the substrates of several other enzymes, causing a combinatorial explosion in the number of possible glycan products. The kinetic behaviour of systems where multiple acceptor substrates compete for a single enzyme is presented, and the case in which high concentrations of an acceptor substrate are inhibitory as a result of abortive complex formation, is shown to result in non-Michaelian kinetics that can lead to bistability in an open system. A kinetic mechanism is proposed that is consistent with the available experimental evidence and provides a possible explanation for conflicting observations on the &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-1,4-galactosyltransferases. Abrupt switching between steady states in networks of glycosyltransferase-catalysed reactions may account for the observed changes in glycosyl-epitopes in cancer cells.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lG3i3Zrauw4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Stochastic simulation has been a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of gene regulatory networks, particularly in terms of understanding how cell-phenotype stability and fate-transitions are impacted by noisy gene expression. However, gene networks often have dynamics characterized by multiple attractors. Stochastic simulation is often inefficient for such systems, because most of the simulation time is spent waiting for rare, barrier-crossing events to occur. We present a rare-event simulation-based method for computing epigenetic landscapes and phenotype-transitions in metastable gene networks. Our computational pipeline was inspired by studies of metastability and barrier-crossing in protein folding, and provides an automated means of computing and visualizing essential stationary and dynamic information that is generally inaccessible to conventional simulation. Applied to a network model of pluripotency in Embryonic Stem Cells, our simulations revealed rare phenotypes and approximately Markovian transitions among phenotype-states, occurring with a broad range of timescales. The relative probabilities of phenotypes and the transition paths linking pluripotency and differentiation are sensitive to global kinetic parameters governing transcription factor-DNA binding kinetics. Our approach significantly expands the capability of stochastic simulation to investigate gene regulatory network dynamics, which may help guide rational cell reprogramming strategies. Our approach is also generalizable to other types of molecular networks and stochastic dynamics frameworks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ct0OUsyiK38&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: ApoE Regulates the Development of Adult Newborn Hippocampal Neurons</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/4/ENEURO.0155-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Adult hippocampal neurogenesis occurs throughout life and is believed to participate in cognitive functions such as learning and memory. A number of genes that regulate adult hippocampal neurogenesis have been identified, although most of these have been implicated in progenitor proliferation and survival, but not in the development into fully differentiated neurons. Among these genes, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is particularly compelling because the human ApoE isoform E4 is a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer’s disease, where hippocampal neurogenesis is reported to be dysfunctional. To investigate the effects of ApoE and its human isoforms on adult hippocampal neurogenesis and neuronal development, retroviruses carrying a GFP-expressing vector were injected into wild-type (WT), ApoE-deficient, and human targeted replacement (ApoE3 and ApoE4) mice to infect progenitors in the dentate gyrus and analyze the morphology of fully developed GFP-expressing neurons. Analysis of these adult-born neurons revealed significant decreases in the complexity of dendritic arborizations and spine density in ApoE-deficient mice compared with WT mice, as well as in ApoE4 mice compared with ApoE3. These findings demonstrate that ApoE deficiency and the ApoE4 human isoform both impair hippocampal neurogenesis and give insight into how ApoE may influence hippocampal-related neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: {Delta}FosB Decreases Excitability of Dorsal Hippocampal CA1 Neurons</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/4/ENEURO.0104-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Both the function of hippocampal neurons and hippocampus-dependent behaviors are dependent on changes in gene expression, but the specific mechanisms that regulate gene expression in hippocampus are not yet fully understood. The stable, activity-dependent transcription factor FosB plays a role in various forms of hippocampal-dependent learning and in the structural plasticity of synapses onto CA1 neurons. The authors examined the consequences of viral-mediated overexpression or inhibition of FosB on the function of adult mouse hippocampal CA1 neurons using &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; slice whole-cell physiology. We found that the overexpression of FosB decreased the excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons, while inhibition increased excitability. Interestingly, these manipulations did not affect resting membrane potential or spike frequency adaptation, but FosB overexpression reduced hyperpolarization-activated current. Both FosB overexpression and inhibition decreased spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents, while only FosB inhibition affected the AMPA/NMDA ratio, which was mediated by decreased NMDA receptor current, suggesting complex effects on synaptic inputs to CA1 that may be driven by homeostatic cell-autonomous or network-driven adaptations to the changes in CA1 cell excitability. Because FosB is induced in hippocampus by drugs of abuse, stress, or antidepressant treatment, these results suggest that FosB-driven changes in hippocampal cell excitability may be critical for learning and, in maladaptive states, are key drivers of aberrant hippocampal function in diseases such as addiction and depression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Estradiol Increases Glutamate and GABA Neurotransmission into GnRH Neurons via Retrograde NO-Signaling in Proestrous Mice during the Positive Estradiol Feedback Period</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/4/ENEURO.0057-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Surge release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is essential in the activation of pituitary gonadal unit at proestrus afternoon preceded by the rise of serum 17β-estradiol (E2) level during positive feedback period. Here, we describe a mechanism of positive estradiol feedback regulation acting directly on GnRH-green fluorescent protein (GFP) neurons of mice. Whole-cell clamp and loose patch recordings revealed that a high physiological dose of estradiol (200 pM), significantly increased firing rate at proestrus afternoon. The mPSC frequency at proestrus afternoon also increased, whereas it decreased at metestrus afternoon and had no effect at proestrus morning. Inhibition of the estrogen receptor β (ERβ), intracellular blockade of the Src kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) and scavenge of nitric oxide (NO) inside GnRH neurons prevented the facilitatory estradiol effect indicating involvement of the ERβ/Src/PI3K/Akt/nNOS pathway in this fast, direct stimulatory effect. Immunohistochemistry localized soluble guanylate cyclase, the main NO receptor, in both glutamatergic and GABAergic terminals innervating GnRH neurons. Accordingly, estradiol facilitated neurotransmissions to GnRH neurons via both GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;-R and glutamate/AMPA/kainate-R. These results indicate that estradiol acts directly on GnRH neurons via the ERβ/Akt/nNOS pathway at proestrus afternoon generating NO that retrogradely accelerates GABA and glutamate release from the presynaptic terminals contacting GnRH neurons. The newly explored mechanism might contribute to the regulation of the GnRH surge, a fundamental prerequisite of the ovulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00756</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;What is the physiological basis of long term memory? The current dogma in
theoretical neuroscience attributes changes in synaptic efficacy to memory
acquisition. This view implies that in the absence of learning, synaptic
efficacies should be constant; in other words, stable memories correspond to
stable connectivity patterns. However, an increasing body of experimental
evidence points to significant, activity-independent dynamics in synaptic
strengths. These fluctuations seem to be occurring continuously, without
specific reference to a learning process, but with similar magnitude. Motivated
by these observations, we explore the possibility of memory storage within a
specific component of network connectivity, while individual connections
fluctuate in time. We find a family of neural network models in which memory is
acquired by means of biologically-inspired learning rules; the properties of
these rules, in turn, determine the storing component in which memory can
persist indefinitely. Memory representations manifest as time-varying
attractors in neural state-space and support associative retrieval of learned
information. Our results suggest a link between the properties of learning
rules and those of network-level memory representations, which generates
experimentally-testable predictions.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00675</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Experimental observations of neuroscience suggest that the brain is working a
probabilistic way when computing information with uncertainty. This processing
could be modeled as Bayesian inference. However, it remains unclear how
Bayesian inference could be implemented at the level of neuronal circuits of
the brain. In this study, we propose a novel general-purpose neural
implementation of probabilistic inference based on a ubiquitous network of
cortical microcircuits, termed winner-take-all (WTA) circuit. We show that each
WTA circuit could encode the distribution of states defined on a variable. By
connecting multiple WTA circuits together, the joint distribution can be
represented for arbitrary probabilistic graphical models. Moreover, we prove
that the neural dynamics of WTA circuit is able to implement one of the most
powerful inference methods in probabilistic graphical models, mean-field
inference. We show that the synaptic drive of each spiking neuron in the WTA
circuit encodes the marginal probability of the variable in each state, and the
firing probability (or firing rate) of each neuron is proportional to the
marginal probability. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate
that the WTA circuits can get comparable inference result as mean-field
approximation. Taken together, our results suggest that the WTA circuit could
be seen as the minimal inference unit of neuronal circuits.

In particular, inhibitory inputs on dendritic spines could serve to selectively veto or modulate individual excitatory inputs, greatly expanding the computational power of individual neurons. To investigate this, we have undertaken a combined functional, molecular, and ultrastructural mapping of the location of GABAergic inputs onto dendrites of pyramidal neurons from upper layers of juvenile mouse somatosensory cortex. Using two-photon uncaging of GABA, intracellular labeling with gerphyrin intrabodies, and focused ion beam milling with scanning electron microscopy, we find that most (96–98%) spines lack GABAergic synapses, although they still display GABAergic responses, potentially due to extrasynaptic GABA receptors. We conclude that GABAergic inputs, in practice, contact dendritic shafts and likely control clusters of excitatory inputs, defining functional zones on dendrites.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Cellular morphology and associated morphodynamics are widely used for qualitative and quantitative assessments of cell state. Here we implement a framework to profile cellular morphodynamics based on an adaptive decomposition of local cell boundary motion into instantaneous frequency spectra defined by the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT). Our approach revealed that spontaneously migrating cells with approximately homogeneous molecular makeup show remarkably consistent instantaneous frequency distributions, though they have markedly heterogeneous mobility. Distinctions in cell edge motion between these cells are captured predominantly by differences in the magnitude of the frequencies. We found that acute photo-inhibition of Vav2 guanine exchange factor, an activator of the Rho family of signaling proteins coordinating cell motility, produces significant shifts in the frequency distribution, but does not affect frequency magnitude. We therefore concluded that the frequency spectrum encodes the wiring of the molecular circuitry that regulates cell boundary movements, whereas the magnitude captures the activation level of the circuitry. We also used HHT spectra as multi-scale spatiotemporal features in statistical region merging to identify subcellular regions of distinct motion behavior. In line with our conclusion that different HHT spectra relate to different signaling regimes, we found that subcellular regions with different morphodynamics indeed exhibit distinct Rac1 activities. This algorithm thus can serve as an accurate and sensitive classifier of cellular morphodynamics to pinpoint spatial and temporal boundaries between signaling regimes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v0zeezADMos&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Several channels, ranging from TRP receptors to Gap junctions, allow the exchange of small organic solute across cell membrane. However, very little is known about the molecular mechanism of their permeation. Cyclic Nucleotide Gated (CNG) channels, despite their homology with K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels and in contrast with them, allow the passage of larger methylated and ethylated ammonium ions like dimethylammonium (DMA) and ethylammonium (EA). We combined electrophysiology and molecular dynamics simulations to examine how DMA interacts with the pore and permeates through it. Due to the presence of hydrophobic groups, DMA enters easily in the channel and, unlike the alkali cations, does not need to cross any barrier. We also show that while the crystal structure is consistent with the presence of a single DMA ion at full occupancy, the channel is able to conduct a sizable current of DMA ions only when two ions are present inside the channel. Moreover, the second DMA ion dramatically changes the free energy landscape, destabilizing the crystallographic binding site and lowering by almost 25 kJ/mol the binding affinity between DMA and the channel. Based on the results of the simulation the experimental electron density maps can be re-interpreted with the presence of a second ion at lower occupancy. In this mechanism the flexibility of the channel plays a key role, extending the classical multi-ion permeation paradigm in which conductance is enhanced by the plain interaction between the ions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Lr7lghkzqrk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Although NSCs were thought to merely represent a stem cell type in the brain, recent advances have demonstrated the incredible complexity of NSC identity and functions. Ranging between quiescence, activation and intermediary subtypes, NSCs choose their fate through their developmental inheritance, regional positioning within the niche, as well as dynamic transcriptional and metabolic states. The plasticity of their developmental program is reflected in the tremendous changes they undergo upon external environmental cues and extrinsic manipulations, and harnessing these potentials can open new avenues to fight against brain injury, neurodegenerative and age-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Pattern Separation in a Spiking Neural Network of Hippocampus Robust to Imbalanced Excitation/Inhibition. (arXiv:1808.00367v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00367</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Efficient pattern separation in dentate gyrus plays an important role in
storing information in the hippocampus. Current knowledge of the structure and
function of the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and dentate gyrus, in pattern
separation are incorporated in our model. A three-layer feedforward spiking
neural network inspired by the rodent hippocampus an equipped with simplified
synaptic and molecular mechanisms is developed. The aim of the study is to make
an spiking neural network capable of pattern separation in imbalanced
excitation/inhibition ratios caused by different levels of stimulations or
network damage. This work present a novel theory on the cellular mechanisms of
robustness to damges to synapses and connectivity of neurons in dentate gyrus
that results in imbalanced excitation-inhibition activity of neurons. This
spiking neural network uses simplified molecular and cellular hypothetical
mechanisms and demonstrates efficient storing of information in different
levels of stimulation and can be implemented in cognitive robotics.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Modeling the impact of changes in day-care contact patterns on the dynamics of varicella transmission in France between 1991 and 2015</title>

Annual incidence rates of varicella infection in the general population in France have been rather stable since 1991 when clinical surveillance started. Rates however show a statistically significant increase over time in children aged 0–3 years, and a decline in older individuals. A significant increase in day-care enrolment and structures’ capacity in France was also observed in the last decade. In this work we investigate the potential interplay between an increase of contacts of young children possibly caused by earlier socialization in the community and varicella transmission dynamics. To this aim, we develop an age-structured mathematical model, informed with historical demographic data and contact matrix estimates in the country, accounting for longitudinal linear increase of early childhood contacts. While the reported overall varicella incidence is well reproduced independently of mixing variations, age-specific empirical trends are better captured by accounting for an increase in contacts among pre-school children in the last decades. We found that the varicella data are consistent with a 30% increase in the number of contacts at day-care facilities, which would imply a 50% growth in the contribution of 0-3y old children to overall yearly infections in 1991–2015. Our findings suggest that an earlier exposure to pathogens due to changes in day-care contact patterns, represents a plausible explanation for the epidemiological patterns observed in France. Obtained results suggest that considering temporal changes in social factors in addition to demographic ones is critical to correctly interpret varicella transmission dynamics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZNcGQQSchNU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Irrelevance by inhibition: Learning, computation, and implications for schizophrenia</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/rsPCF-wkzJY/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Nathan Insel, Jordan Guerguiev, Blake A. Richards&lt;/p&gt;

Symptoms of schizophrenia may arise from a failure of cortical circuits to filter-out irrelevant inputs. Schizophrenia has also been linked to disruptions in cortical inhibitory interneurons, consistent with the possibility that in the normally functioning brain, these cells are in some part responsible for determining which sensory inputs are relevant versus irrelevant. Here, we develop a neural network model that demonstrates how the cortex may learn to ignore irrelevant inputs through plasticity processes affecting inhibition. The model is based on the proposal that the amount of excitatory output from a cortical circuit encodes the expected magnitude of reward or punishment (“relevance”), which can be trained using a temporal difference learning mechanism acting on feedforward inputs to inhibitory interneurons. In the model, irrelevant and blocked stimuli drive lower levels of excitatory activity compared with novel and relevant stimuli, and this difference in activity levels is lost following disruptions to inhibitory units. When excitatory units are connected to a competitive-learning output layer with a threshold, the relevance code can be shown to “gate” both learning and behavioral responses to irrelevant stimuli. Accordingly, the combined network is capable of recapitulating published experimental data linking inhibition in frontal cortex with fear learning and expression. Finally, the model demonstrates how relevance learning can take place in parallel with other types of learning, through plasticity rules involving inhibitory and excitatory components, respectively. Altogether, this work offers a theory of how the cortex learns to selectively inhibit inputs, providing insight into how relevance-assignment problems may emerge in schizophrenia.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rsPCF-wkzJY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Parallel Arousal Pathways in the Lateral Hypothalamus</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0228-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Until recently, hypocretin (Hcrt) neurons were the only known wake-promoting neuronal population in the lateral hypothalamus (LH), but subpopulations of inhibitory neurons in this area and glutamatergic neurons in the nearby supramammillary nucleus (SuM) have recently been found that also promote wakefulness. We performed chemogenetic excitation of LH neurons in mice and observed increased wakefulness that lasted more than 4h without unusual behavior or EEG anomalies. The increased wakefulness was similar in the presence or absence of the dual orexin receptor blocker almorexant (ALM). Analysis of hM3Dq transfection and c-FOS expression in LH inhibitory neurons and in the SuM failed to confirm that the increased wakefulness was due to these wake-promoting populations, although this possibility cannot be completely excluded. To evaluate the relationship to the Hcrt system, we repeated the study in &lt;i&gt;Orexin-tTA&lt;/i&gt; mice in the presence or absence of dietary doxycycline (DOX), which enabled us to manipulate the percentage of Hcrt neurons that expressed hM3Dq. In DOX-fed mice, 18% of Hcrt neurons as well as many other LH neurons expressed hM3Dq; these mice showed a profound increase in wake after hM3Dq activation even in the presence of ALM. In mice switched to normal chow, 62% of Hcrt neurons expressed hM3Dq along with other LH cells; chemogenetic activation produced even more sustained arousal which could be reduced to previous levels by ALM treatment. Together, these results indicate an LH neuron population that promotes wakefulness through an Hcrt-independent pathway that can act synergistically with the Hcrt system to prolong arousal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance&lt;/b&gt; Despite nearly a century of evidence suggesting that the lateral hypothalamus contains neurons essential to sustain wakefulness, the primary wake-promoting cells in this brain region studied to date have been the hypocretin/orexin neurons. Here, we show that chemogenetic excitation of lateral hypothalamus neurons can induce sustained wakefulness even in absence of hypocretin signaling and that concurrent hypocretin neuron activation can prolong arousal. These results indicate the existence of parallel arousal pathways in the lateral hypothalamus and suggest a new therapeutic target for disorders of excessive sleepiness such as hypersomnia and narcolepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Novel Quantitative Analyses of Spontaneous Synaptic Events in Cortical Pyramidal Cells Reveal Subtle Parvalbumin-Expressing Interneuron Dysfunction in a Knock-in Mouse Model of Alzheimers Disease</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0059-18.2018v2?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that has become a compelling global public health concern. Besides pathological hallmarks such as extracellular amyloid plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, and loss of neurons and synapses, clinical reports have shown that epileptiform activity, even seizures, can occur early in the disease. Aberrant synaptic and network activities as well as epileptiform discharges have also been observed in various mouse models of AD. The new &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mouse model is generated by a gene knock-in approach and there are limited studies on basic synaptic properties in &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice. Therefore, we applied quantitative methods to analyze spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory synaptic events in parietal cortex layer 2/3 pyramidal cells. First, by an objective amplitude distribution analysis, we found decreased amplitudes of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in aged &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice caused by a reduction in the amplitudes of the large sIPSCs with fast rates of rise, consistent with deficits in the function of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV INs). Second, we calculated the burstiness and memory in a series of successive synaptic events. Lastly, by using a novel approach to determine the excitation to inhibition (E/I) ratio, we found no changes in the &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice, indicating that homeostatic mechanisms may have maintained the overall balance of excitation and inhibition in spite of a mildly impaired PV IN function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Using novel quantitative analyses of spontaneous synaptic currents in L2/3 pyramidal cells, we revealed subtle deficits in the function of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV INs) in a new mouse model of AD, the &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice. We applied novel statistical and analytical methods to further characterize the properties of spontaneous postsynaptic currents. Our approach provides rigorous quantitative tools for the analysis of synaptic events in mouse models of disease for objectively and reliably revealing even subtle disease-related alterations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Grid-Cell Activity on Linear Tracks Indicates Purely Translational Remapping of 2D Firing Patterns at Movement Turning Points</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/31/7004?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Grid cells in rodent medial entorhinal cortex are thought to play a critical role for spatial navigation. When the animal is freely moving in an open arena the firing fields of each grid cell tend to form a hexagonal lattice spanning the environment. For movements along a linear track the cells seem to respond differently. They show multiple firing fields that are not periodically arranged and whose shape and position change when the running direction is reversed. In addition, peak firing rates vary widely from field to field. Measured along one running direction only, firing fields are, however, compatible with a slice through a two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal pattern. It is an open question, whether this is also true if leftward and rightward runs are jointly considered. By analyzing data from 15 male Long–Evans rats, we show that a single hexagonal firing pattern explains the linear-track data if translational shifts of the pattern are allowed at the movement turning points. A rotation or scaling of the grid is not required. The agreement is further improved if the peak firing rates of the underlying 2D grid fields can vary from field to field, as suggested by recent studies. These findings have direct consequences for experiments using linear tracks in virtual reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Various types of neurons support spatial navigation. Their response properties are often studied in reduced settings and might change when the animal can freely explore its environment. Grid cells in rodents, for example, exhibit seemingly irregular firing fields when animal movement is restricted to a linear track but highly regular patterns in two-dimensional (2D) arenas. We show that linear-track responses of a cell for both leftward and rightward running directions can be explained as cuts through a single hexagonal pattern if translational remapping is allowed at movement turning points; neither rotations nor scale transformations are needed. These results provide a basis to quantify grid-cell activity in 1D virtual reality and could help to detect and categorize grid cells without experiments in 2D environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide-Immunoreactive Interneurons within Circuits of the Mouse Basolateral Amygdala</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/31/6983?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In cortical structures, principal cell activity is tightly regulated by different GABAergic interneurons (INs). Among these INs are vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-expressing (VIP+) INs, which innervate preferentially other INs, providing a structural basis for temporal disinhibition of principal cells. However, relatively little is known about VIP+ INs in the amygdaloid basolateral complex (BLA). In this study, we report that VIP+ INs have a variable density in the distinct subdivisions of the mouse BLA. Based on different anatomical, neurochemical, and electrophysiological criteria, VIP+ INs could be identified as IN-selective INs (IS-INs) and basket cells expressing CB1 cannabinoid receptors. Whole-cell recordings of VIP+ IS-INs revealed three different spiking patterns, none of which was associated with the expression of calretinin. Genetic targeting combined with optogenetics and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; recordings enabled us to identify several types of BLA INs innervated by VIP+ INs, including other IS-INs, basket and neurogliaform cells. Moreover, light stimulation of VIP+ basket cell axon terminals, characterized by CB1 sensitivity, evoked IPSPs in ~20% of principal neurons. Finally, we show that VIP+ INs receive a dense innervation from both GABAergic inputs (although only 10% from other VIP+ INs) and distinct glutamatergic inputs, identified by their expression of different vesicular glutamate transporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, our study provides a wide-range analysis of single-cell properties of VIP+ INs in the mouse BLA and of their intrinsic and extrinsic connectivity. Our results reinforce the evidence that VIP+ INs are structurally and functionally heterogeneous and that this heterogeneity could mediate different roles in amygdala-dependent functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We provide the first comprehensive analysis of the distribution of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-expressing (VIP+) interneurons (INs) across the entire mouse amygdaloid basolateral complex (BLA), as well as of their morphological and physiological properties. VIP+ INs in the neocortex preferentially target other INs to form a disinhibitory network that facilitates principal cell firing. Our study is the first to demonstrate the presence of such a disinhibitory circuitry in the BLA. We observed structural and functional heterogeneity of these INs and characterized their input/output connectivity. We also identified several types of BLA INs that, when inhibited, may provide a temporal window for principal cell firing and facilitate associative plasticity, e.g., in fear learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Network models in neuroscience. (arXiv:1807.11935v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11935</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;From interacting cellular components to networks of neurons and neural
systems, interconnected units comprise a fundamental organizing principle of
the nervous system. Understanding how their patterns of connections and
interactions give rise to the many functions of the nervous system is a primary
goal of neuroscience. Recently, this pursuit has begun to benefit from the
development of new mathematical tools that can relate a system's architecture
to its dynamics and function. These tools, which are known collectively as
network science, have been used with increasing success to build models of
neural systems across spatial scales and species. Here we discuss the nature of
network models in neuroscience. We begin with a review of model theory from a
philosophical perspective to inform our view of networks as models of complex
systems in general, and of the brain in particular. We then summarize the types
of models that are frequently studied in network neuroscience along three
primary dimensions: from data representations to first-principles theory, from
biophysical realism to functional phenomenology, and from elementary
descriptions to coarse-grained approximations. We then consider ways to
validate these models, focusing on approaches that perturb a system to probe
its function. We close with a description of important frontiers in the
construction of network models and their relevance for understanding
increasingly complex functions of neural systems.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Farzaneh Mohajerani, Michael F. Hagan&lt;/p&gt;

Bacterial microcompartments are large, roughly icosahedral shells that assemble around enzymes and reactants involved in certain metabolic pathways in bacteria. Motivated by microcompartment assembly, we use coarse-grained computational and theoretical modeling to study the factors that control the size and morphology of a protein shell assembling around hundreds to thousands of molecules. We perform dynamical simulations of shell assembly in the presence and absence of cargo over a range of interaction strengths, subunit and cargo stoichiometries, and the shell spontaneous curvature. Depending on these parameters, we find that the presence of a cargo can either increase or decrease the size of a shell relative to its intrinsic spontaneous curvature, as seen in recent experiments. These features are controlled by a balance of kinetic and thermodynamic effects, and the shell size is assembly pathway dependent. We discuss implications of these results for synthetic biology efforts to target new enzymes to microcompartment interiors.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VqXYLlYSdr8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Revealing a Cortical Circuit Responsive to Predatory Threats and Mediating Contextual Fear Memory</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy173/5062357?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The ventral part of the anteromedial thalamic nucleus (AMv) receives substantial inputs from hypothalamic sites that are highly responsive to a live predator or its odor trace and represents an important thalamic hub for conveying predatory threat information to the cerebral cortex. In the present study, we begin by examining the cortico-amygdalar-hippocampal projections of the main AMv cortical targets, namely, the caudal prelimbic, rostral anterior cingulate, and medial visual areas, as well as the rostral part of the ventral retrosplenial area, one of the main targets of the anterior cingulate area. We observed that these areas form a clear cortical network. Next, we revealed that in animals exposed to a live cat, all of the elements of this circuit presented a differential increase in Fos, supporting the idea of a predator threat-responsive cortical network. Finally, we showed that bilateral cytotoxic lesions in each element of this cortical network did not change innate fear responses but drastically reduced contextual conditioning to the predator-associated environment. Overall, the present findings suggest that predator threat has an extensive representation in the cerebral cortex and revealed a cortical network that is responsive to predatory threats and exerts a critical role in processing fear memory.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Interrogating the Relationship Between Schizotypy, the Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT) Val158Met Polymorphism, and Neuronal Oscillatory Activity</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy171/5062355?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;COMT&lt;/span&gt; Val158Met polymorphism affects the availability of synaptic dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and has been widely studied as a genetic risk factor for psychosis. Schizotypy is associated with an increased risk of psychosis, with some studies implicating similar neurobiological mechanisms to schizophrenia. The present study sought to interrogate the link between the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;COMT&lt;/span&gt; Val158Met polymorphism and schizotypy using electroencephalogram (EEG) to identify neurophysiological mechanisms underpinning psychosis risk. Neurotypical (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 91) adults were genotyped for the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;COMT&lt;/span&gt; Val158Met polymorphism, completed the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ), and had eyes open resting-state EEG recorded for 4 min. SPQ suspiciousness subscale scores were higher for individuals homozygous for Val/Val and Met/Met versus Val/Met genotypes. Delta, theta, alpha-2, beta-1, and beta-2 amplitudes were lower for Val/Val than Met/Met individuals. Lower theta amplitudes were correlated with higher total SPQ scores (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; = 0.050), and multiple regression revealed that higher delta, and lower theta and beta-2 amplitudes (but not &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;COMT&lt;/span&gt; genotype) best predicted total SPQ scores (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; = 0.014). This study demonstrates the importance of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;COMT&lt;/span&gt; genotype in determining trait suspiciousness and EEG oscillatory activity. It also highlights relationships between dopaminergic alterations, EEG and schizotypy that are dissimilar to those observed in schizophrenia.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Possible Neurobiological Underpinnings of Homosexuality and Gender Dysphoria</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy090/5062356?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Although frequently discussed in terms of sex dimorphism, the neurobiology of sexual orientation and identity is unknown. We report multimodal magnetic resonance imaging data, including cortical thickness (Cth), subcortical volumes, and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging, from 27 transgender women (TrW), 40 transgender men (TrM), and 80 heterosexual (40 men) and 60 homosexual cisgender controls (30 men). These data show that whereas homosexuality is linked to cerebral sex dimorphism, gender dysphoria primarily involves cerebral networks mediating self–body perception. Among the homosexual cisgender controls, weaker sex dimorphism was found in white matter connections and a partly reversed sex dimorphism in Cth. Similar patterns were detected in transgender persons compared with heterosexual cisgender controls, but the significant clusters disappeared when adding homosexual controls, and correcting for sexual orientation. Instead, both TrW and TrM displayed singular features, showing greater Cth as well as weaker structural and functional connections in the anterior cingulate-precuneus and right occipito-parietal cortex, regions known to process own body perception in the context of self.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Selective attention is central to cognition. Dramatic advances have been made in understanding the neural circuits that mediate selective attention. Forebrain networks, most elaborated in primates, control all forms of attention based on task demands and the physical salience of stimuli. These networks contain circuits that distribute top-down signals to sensory processing areas and enhance information processing in those areas. A midbrain network, most elaborated in birds, controls spatial attention.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/PSYkmktapmQ/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Naihui Zhou, Zachary D. Siegel, Scott Zarecor, Nigel Lee, Darwin A. Campbell, Carson M. Andorf, Dan Nettleton, Carolyn J. Lawrence-Dill, Baskar Ganapathysubramanian, Jonathan W. Kelly, Iddo Friedberg&lt;/p&gt;

The accuracy of machine learning tasks critically depends on high quality ground truth data. Therefore, in many cases, producing good ground truth data typically involves trained professionals; however, this can be costly in time, effort, and money. Here we explore the use of crowdsourcing to generate a large number of training data of good quality. We explore an image analysis task involving the segmentation of corn tassels from images taken in a field setting. We investigate the accuracy, speed and other quality metrics when this task is performed by students for academic credit, Amazon MTurk workers, and Master Amazon MTurk workers. We conclude that the Amazon MTurk and Master Mturk workers perform significantly better than the for-credit students, but with no significant difference between the two MTurk worker types. Furthermore, the quality of the segmentation produced by Amazon MTurk workers rivals that of an expert worker. We provide best practices to assess the quality of ground truth data, and to compare data quality produced by different sources. We conclude that properly managed crowdsourcing can be used to establish large volumes of viable ground truth data at a low cost and high quality, especially in the context of high throughput plant phenotyping. We also provide several metrics for assessing the quality of the generated datasets.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PSYkmktapmQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Inter-trial effects in visual pop-out search: Factorial comparison of Bayesian updating models</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/0rQcDnT9JDA/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Fredrik Allenmark, Hermann J. Müller, Zhuanghua Shi&lt;/p&gt;

Many previous studies on visual search have reported inter-trial effects, that is, observers respond faster when some target property, such as a defining feature or dimension, or the response associated with the target repeats versus changes across consecutive trial episodes. However, what processes drive these inter-trial effects is still controversial. Here, we investigated this question using a combination of Bayesian modeling of belief updating and evidence accumulation modeling in perceptual decision-making. In three visual singleton (‘pop-out’) search experiments, we explored how the probability of the response-critical states of the search display (e.g., target presence/absence) and the repetition/switch of the target-defining dimension (color/ orientation) affect reaction time distributions. The results replicated the mean reaction time (RT) inter-trial and dimension repetition/switch effects that have been reported in previous studies. Going beyond this, to uncover the underlying mechanisms, we used the Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM) and the Linear Approach to Threshold with Ergodic Rate (LATER) model to explain the RT distributions in terms of decision bias (starting point) and information processing speed (evidence accumulation rate). We further investigated how these different aspects of the decision-making process are affected by different properties of stimulus history, giving rise to dissociable inter-trial effects. We approached this question by (i) combining each perceptual decision making model (DDM or LATER) with different updating models, each specifying a plausible rule for updating of either the starting point or the rate, based on stimulus history, and (ii) comparing every possible combination of trial-wise updating mechanism and perceptual decision model in a factorial model comparison. Consistently across experiments, we found that the (recent) history of the response-critical property influences the initial decision bias, while repetition/switch of the target-defining dimension affects the accumulation rate, likely reflecting an implicit ‘top-down’ modulation process. This provides strong evidence of a disassociation between response- and dimension-based inter-trial effects.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0rQcDnT9JDA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

These behavioral responses are thought to be largely driven by genetically pre-programmed circuits. However, they can also vary significantly according to the animal’s previous social experience and physiological state, suggesting that the underlying circuits are shaped by adaptive modulatory changes. Modern tools of neuroscience have enabled the direct interrogation of circuits driving sex-specific behaviors and helped unravel key neural mechanisms underlying their function and modulation. In particular, recent work has shown how individual neuronal responses may combine with population activity to encode specific social information in both sexes. In this review, we summarize recent findings on how sex-specific sensory information is processed in social behavioral circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Activation of the DNA-repair mechanism through NBS1 and MRE11 diffusion</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/Goom-28bvCg/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Ida Friis, Ilia A. Solov’yov&lt;/p&gt;

The non-homologous end joining of a DNA double strand break is initiated by the MRE11-NBS1-RAD50 complex whose subunits are the first three proteins to arrive to the breakage site thereby making the recruitment time of MRE11, NBS1 and RAD50 essential for cell survival. In the present investigation, the nature of MRE11 and NBS1 transportation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, hosting the damaged DNA strand, is hypothesized to be a passive diffusive process. The feasibility of such a mechanism is addressed through theoretical and computational approaches which permit establishing the characteristic recruitment time of MRE11 and NBS1 by the nucleus. A computational model of a cell is constructed from a set of biological parameters and the kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm is used to simulate the diffusing MRE11 and NBS1 particles as a random walk process. To accurately describe the experimented data, it is discovered that MRE11 and NBS1 should start diffusion from significantly different starting positions which suggests that diffusion might not be the only transport mechanism of repair protein recruitment to the DNA break.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Goom-28bvCg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Bayesian comparison of explicit and implicit causal inference strategies in multisensory heading perception</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/ZGcPnbf7Gpw/article</link>

The precision of multisensory perception improves when cues arising from the same cause are integrated, such as visual and vestibular heading cues for an observer moving through a stationary environment. In order to determine how the cues should be processed, the brain must infer the causal relationship underlying the multisensory cues. In heading perception, however, it is unclear whether observers follow the Bayesian strategy, a simpler non-Bayesian heuristic, or even perform causal inference at all. We developed an efficient and robust computational framework to perform Bayesian model comparison of causal inference strategies, which incorporates a number of alternative assumptions about the observers. With this framework, we investigated whether human observers’ performance in an &lt;i&gt;explicit&lt;/i&gt; cause attribution and an &lt;i&gt;implicit&lt;/i&gt; heading discrimination task can be modeled as a causal inference process. In the explicit causal inference task, all subjects accounted for cue disparity when reporting judgments of common cause, although not necessarily all in a Bayesian fashion. By contrast, but in agreement with previous findings, data from the heading discrimination task only could not rule out that several of the same observers were adopting a forced-fusion strategy, whereby cues are integrated regardless of disparity. Only when we combined evidence from both tasks we were able to rule out forced-fusion in the heading discrimination task. Crucially, findings were robust across a number of variants of models and analyses. Our results demonstrate that our proposed computational framework allows researchers to ask complex questions within a rigorous Bayesian framework that accounts for parameter and model uncertainty.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZGcPnbf7Gpw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

However, the millisecond timescales for association often do not match the much longer delays for behaviorally relevant signals that supervise learning. In particular, information about the behavioral outcome of neural activity can be delayed, leading to a problem of temporal credit assignment. Recent studies suggest that synaptic plasticity can have temporal rules that not only accommodate the delays relevant to the circuit, but also be precisely tuned to the behavior the circuit supports. These discoveries highlight the diversity of plasticity rules, whose temporal requirements may depend on circuit delays and the contingencies of behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy175/5060274?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a key structure implicated in the regulation of cognitive control (CC). Previous studies suggest that variability in the ACC sulcal pattern—a neurodevelopmental marker unaffected by maturation or plasticity after birth—is associated with intersubject differences in CC performance. Here, we investigated whether bilingual experience modulates the effects of ACC sulcal variability on CC performance across the lifespan. Using structural MRI, we first established the distribution of the ACC sulcal patterns in a large sample of healthy individuals (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 270) differing on gender and ethnicity. Second, a participants’ subsample (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 157) was selected to test whether CC performance was differentially affected by ACC sulcation in bilinguals and monolinguals across age. A prevalent leftward asymmetry unaffected by gender or ethnicity was reported. Sulcal variability in the ACC predicted CC performance differently in bilinguals and monolinguals, with a reversed pattern of structure–function relationship: asymmetrical versus symmetrical ACC sulcal patterns were associated with a performance advantage in monolinguals and a performance detriment to bilinguals and vice versa. Altogether, these findings provide novel insights on the dynamic interplay between early neurodevelopment, environmental background and cognitive efficiency across age.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Hippocampal Network Oscillations Rescue Memory Consolidation Deficits Caused by Sleep Loss</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy174/5060282?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Oscillations in the hippocampal network during sleep are proposed to play a role in memory storage by patterning neuronal ensemble activity. Here we show that following single-trial fear learning, sleep deprivation (which impairs memory consolidation) disrupts coherent firing rhythms in hippocampal area CA1. State-targeted optogenetic inhibition of CA1 parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons during postlearning NREM sleep, but not REM sleep or wake, disrupts contextual fear memory (CFM) consolidation in a manner similar to sleep deprivation. NREM-targeted inhibition disrupts CA1 network oscillations which predict successful memory storage. Rhythmic optogenetic activation of PV+ interneurons following learning generates CA1 oscillations with coherent principal neuron firing. This patterning of CA1 activity rescues CFM consolidation in sleep-deprived mice. Critically, behavioral and optogenetic manipulations that disrupt CFM also disrupt learning-induced stabilization of CA1 ensembles’ communication patterns in the hours following learning. Conversely, manipulations that promote CFM also promote long-term stability of CA1 communication patterns. We conclude that sleep promotes memory consolidation by generating coherent rhythms of CA1 network activity, which provide consistent communication patterns within neuronal ensembles. Most importantly, we show that this rhythmic patterning of activity is sufficient to promote long-term memory storage in the absence of sleep.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Dynamic Reorganization of Motor Networks During Recovery from Partial Spinal Cord Injury in Monkeys</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy172/5060284?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;After spinal cord injury (SCI), the motor-related cortical areas can be a potential substrate for functional recovery in addition to the spinal cord. However, a dynamic description of how motor cortical circuits reorganize after SCI is lacking. Here, we captured the comprehensive dynamics of motor networks across SCI in a nonhuman primate model. Using electrocorticography over the sensorimotor areas in monkeys, we collected broadband neuronal signals during a reaching-and-grasping task at different stages of recovery of dexterous finger movements after a partial SCI at the cervical levels. We identified two distinct network dynamics: grasping-related intrahemispheric interactions from the contralesional premotor cortex (PM) to the contralesional primary motor cortex (M1) in the high-γ band (&amp;gt;70 Hz), and motor-preparation-related interhemispheric interactions from the contralesional to ipsilesional PM in the α and low-β bands (10–15 Hz). The strengths of these networks correlated to the time course of behavioral recovery. The grasping-related network showed enhanced activation immediately after the injury, but gradually returned to normal while the strength of the motor-preparation-related network gradually increased. Our findings suggest a cortical compensatory mechanism after SCI, where two interdependent motor networks redirect activity from the contralesional hemisphere to the other hemisphere to facilitate functional recovery.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Control Engagement During Sentence and Inhibition fMRI Tasks in Children With Reading Difficulties</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Recent reading research implicates executive control regions as sites of difference in struggling readers. However, as studies often employ only reading or language tasks, the extent of deviation in control engagement in children with reading difficulties is not known. The current study investigated activation in reading and executive control brain regions during both a sentence comprehension task and a nonlexical inhibitory control task in third–fifth grade children with and without reading difficulties. We employed both categorical (group-based) and individual difference approaches to relate reading ability to brain activity. During sentence comprehension, struggling readers had less activation in the left posterior temporal cortex, previously implicated in language, semantic, and reading research. Greater negative activity (relative to fixation) during sentence comprehension in a left inferior parietal region from the executive control literature correlated with poorer reading ability. Greater comprehension scores were associated with less dorsal anterior cingulate activity during the sentence comprehension task. Unlike the sentence task, there were no significant differences between struggling and nonstruggling readers for the nonlexical inhibitory control task. Thus, differences in executive control engagement were largely specific to reading, rather than a general control deficit across tasks in children with reading difficulties, informing future intervention research.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Timing of Sensory-Guided Behavioral Response is Represented in
the Mouse Primary Somatosensory Cortex</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Whisker-guided decision making in mice is thought to critically depend on
information processing occurring in the primary somatosensory cortex. However,
it is not clear if neuronal activity in this “early”
sensory region contains information about the timing and speed of motor
response. To address this question we designed a new task in which freely moving
mice learned to associate a whisker stimulus to reward delivery. The task was
tailored in such a way that a wide range of delays between whisker stimulation
and reward collection were observed due to differences of motivation and
perception. After training, mice were anesthetized and neuronal responses evoked
by stimulating trained and untrained whiskers were recorded across several
cortical columns of barrel cortex. We found a strong correlation between the
delay of the mouse behavioral response and the timing of multiunit activity
evoked by the trained whisker, outside its principal cortical column, in layers
4 and 5A but not in layer 2/3. Circuit mapping ex vivo revealed this effect was
associated with a weakening of layer 4 to layer 2/3 projection. We conclude that
the processes controlling the propagation of key sensory inputs to naive
cortical columns and the timing of sensory-guided action are linked.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;While matched crossmodal information is known to facilitate object recognition, it is unclear how our perceptual systems encode the more gradual congruency variations that occur in our natural environment. Combining visual objects with odor mixtures to create a gradual increase in semantic object overlap, we demonstrate high behavioral acuity to linear variations of olfactory–visual overlap in a healthy adult population. This effect was paralleled by a linear increase in cortical activation at the intersection of occipital fusiform and lingual gyri, indicating linear encoding of crossmodal semantic overlap in visual object recognition networks. Effective connectivity analyses revealed that this integration of olfactory and visual information was achieved by direct information exchange between olfactory and visual areas. In addition, a parallel pathway through the superior frontal gyrus was increasingly recruited towards the most ambiguous stimuli. These findings demonstrate that cortical structures involved in object formation are inherently crossmodal and encode sensory overlap in a linear manner. The results further demonstrate that prefrontal control of these processes is likely required for ambiguous stimulus combinations, a fact of high ecological relevance that may be inappropriately captured by common task designs juxtaposing congruency and incongruency.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;A frequently repeated finding is that the default mode network (DMN) shows activation decreases during externally focused tasks. This finding has led to an emphasis in DMN research on internally focused self-relevant thought processes. A recent study, in contrast, implicates the DMN in substantial externally focused task switches. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we scanned 24 participants performing a task switch experiment. Whilst replicating previous DMN task switch effects, we also found large DMN increases for brief rests as well as task restarts after rest. Our findings are difficult to explain using theories strictly linked to internal or self-directed cognition. In line with principal results from the literature, we suggest that the DMN encodes scene, episode or context, by integrating spatial, self-referential, and temporal information. Context representations are strong at rest, but rereference to context also occurs at major cognitive transitions.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Here, we examine how potential reward and its influence on arousal, measured by pupil dynamics, are represented in the brain while preparing for a challenging task. We further ask how neural representations during preparation relate to actual performance. Trials resulting in performance failure were characterized by increased pupil dilation as a function of increasing reward magnitude during preparation. Such failure trials were also associated with activation of the right amygdala representing pupil dilation, and the left caudate representing reward magnitude. Notably, increases in functional connectivity between amygdala and caudate preceded performance failure. These findings highlight increased connectivity between neural regions representing reward and arousal in circumstances where reward-driven arousal impairs performance.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a multisystem disorder affecting muscle and central nervous system (CNS) function. The cellular mechanisms underlying CNS alterations are poorly understood and no useful treatments exist for the neuropsychological deficits observed in DM1 patients. We investigated the progression of behavioral deficits present in male and female muscleblind-like 2 (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mbnl2&lt;/span&gt;) knockout (KO) mice, a rodent model of CNS alterations in DM1, and determined the biochemical and electrophysiological correlates in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), striatum and hippocampus (HPC). Male KO exhibited more cognitive impairment and depressive-like behavior than female KO mice. In the mPFC, KO mice showed an overexpression of proinflammatory microglia, increased transcriptional levels of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Dat&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Drd1&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Drd2&lt;/span&gt;, exacerbated dopamine levels, and abnormal neural spiking and oscillatory activities in the mPFC and HPC. Chronic treatment with methylphenidate (MPH) (1 and 3 mg/kg) reversed the behavioral deficits, reduced proinflammatory microglia in the mPFC, normalized prefrontal &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Dat&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Drd2&lt;/span&gt; gene expression, and increased &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Bdnf&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Nrf2&lt;/span&gt; mRNA levels.

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is thought to encode and represent the number of objects in a visual scene (i.e., numerosity). Whether this representation is shared for simultaneous and sequential stimuli (i.e., mode independency) is debated. We tested the existence of a common neural substrate for the encoding of these modes using fMRI. While both modes elicited overlapping BOLD response in occipital areas, only simultaneous numerosities significantly activated PPC. Unique activation for sequential numerosities was found in bilateral temporal areas. Multivoxel pattern analysis revealed numerosity selectivity in PPC only for simultaneous numerosities and revealed differential encoding of presentation modes. Voxel-wise numerosity tuning functions for simultaneous numerosities in occipital and parietal ROIs revealed increasing numerosity selectivity along an occipito-to-parietal gradient. Our results suggest that the parietal cortex is involved in the extraction of spatial but not temporal numerosity and question the idea of commonly used cortical circuits for a mode-independent numerosity representation.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and multivariate pattern analyses to examine the effects of acute stress during retrieval. We report that stress reduced the probability of recollecting the details of past experience, and that this impairment was driven, in part, by a disruption of the relationship between hippocampal activation, cortical reinstatement, and memory performance. Moreover, even memories expressed with high confidence were less accurate under stress, and this stress-induced decline in accuracy was explained by reduced posterior hippocampal engagement despite similar levels of category-level cortical reinstatement. Finally, stress degraded the relationship between the engagement of frontoparietal control networks and retrieval decision uncertainty. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the widespread consequences of acute stress on the neural systems of remembering.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Mitochondria play a key role in energy production and calcium buffering, among many other functions. They provide most of the energy required by neurons, and they are transported along axons and dendrites to the regions of higher energy demands. We have used focused ion beam milling and scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM) to obtain stacks of serial sections from the somatosensory cortex of the juvenile rat. We have estimated the volume fraction occupied by mitochondria and their distribution between dendritic, axonal, and nonsynaptic processes. The volume fraction of mitochondria increased from layer I (4.59%) to reach its maximum in layer IV (7.74%) and decreased to its minimum in layer VI (4.03%). On average, 44% of mitochondrial volume was located in dendrites, 15% in axons and 41% in nonsynaptic elements. Given that dendrites, axons, and nonsynaptic elements occupied 38%, 23%, and 39% of the neuropil, respectively, it can be concluded that dendrites are proportionally richer in mitochondria with respect to axons, supporting the notion that most energy consumption takes place at the postsynaptic side. We also found a positive correlation between the volume fraction of mitochondria located in neuronal processes and the density of synapses.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The Ras-MAPK pathway has an established role in neural development and synaptic signaling. Mutations in this pathway are associated with a collection of neurodevelopmental syndromes, Rasopathies; among these, Noonan syndrome (NS) is the most common (1:2000). Prior research has focused on identifying genetic mutations and cellular mechanisms of the disorder, however, effects of NS on the human brain remain unknown. Here, imaging and cognitive data were collected from 12 children with &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;PTPN11&lt;/span&gt;-related NS, ages 4.0–11.0 years (8.98 ± 2.33) and 12 age- and sex-matched typically developing controls (8.79 ± 2.17). We observe reduced gray matter volume in bilateral corpus striatum (Cohen’s &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; = −1.0:−1.3), reduced surface area in temporal regions (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; = −1.8:−2.2), increased cortical thickness in frontal regions (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; = 1.2–1.3), and reduced cortical thickness in limbic regions (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; = −1.6), including limbic structures integral to the circuitry of the hippocampus. Further, we find high levels of inattention, hyperactivity, and memory deficits in children with NS. Taken together, these results identify effects of NS on specific brain regions associated with ADHD and learning in children. While our research lays the groundwork for elucidating the neural and behavioral mechanisms of NS, it also adds an essential tier to understanding the Ras-MAPK pathway’s role in human brain development.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Cortical plasticity in congenitally blind individuals leads to cross-modal activation of the visual cortex and may lead to superior perceptual processing in the intact sensory domains. Although mental imagery is often defined as a quasi-perceptual experience, it is unknown whether it follows similar cortical reorganization as perception in blind individuals. In this study, we show that auditory versus tactile perception evokes similar intra-modal discriminative patterns in congenitally blind compared with sighted participants. These results indicate that cortical plasticity following visual deprivation does not influence broad intra-modal organization of auditory and tactile perception as measured by our task. Furthermore, not only the blind, but also the sighted participants showed cross-modal discriminative patterns for perception modality in the visual cortex. During mental imagery, both groups showed similar decoding accuracies for imagery modality in the intra-modal primary sensory cortices. However, no cross-modal discriminative information for imagery modality was found in early visual cortex of blind participants, in contrast to the sighted participants. We did find evidence of cross-modal activation of higher visual areas in blind participants, including the representation of specific-imagined auditory features in visual area V4.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Sensory processing relies on fast detection of changes in environment, as well as integration of contextual cues over time. The mechanisms by which local circuits of the cerebral cortex simultaneously perform these opposite processes remain obscure. Thalamic “specific” nuclei relay sensory information, whereas “nonspecific” nuclei convey information on the environmental and behavioral contexts. We expressed channelrhodopsin in the ventrobasal specific (sensory) or the rhomboid nonspecific (contextual) thalamic nuclei. By selectively activating each thalamic pathway, we found that nonspecific inputs powerfully activate adapting (slow-responding) interneurons but weakly connect fast-spiking interneurons, whereas specific inputs exhibit opposite interneuron preference. Specific inputs thereby induce rapid feedforward inhibition that limits response duration, whereas, in the same cortical area, nonspecific inputs elicit delayed feedforward inhibition that enables lasting recurrent excitation. Using a mean field model, we confirm that cortical response dynamics depends on the type of interneuron targeted by thalamocortical inputs and show that efficient recruitment of adapting interneurons prolongs the cortical response and allows the summation of sensory and contextual inputs. Hence, target choice between slow- and fast-responding inhibitory neurons endows cortical networks with a simple computational solution to perform both sensory detection and integration.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Neuromodulators such as dopamine can transform neural circuit function, but the mechanisms underlying such transformations are incompletely understood. A recent study introduced dLight1, a genetically encoded fluorescent dopamine indicator. dLight1 allows the optical measurement of dopamine sensed by isolated target circuits with high spatiotemporal resolution and has unique advantages for the study of neuromodulatory mechanisms.</content:encoded>

This has spurred current consideration of DLK as a candidate therapeutic target, and raises a vital question: in what context is DLK a friend or foe to neurons? Here, we review our current understanding of DLK’s function and mechanisms in regulating both regenerative and degenerative responses to axonal damage and stress in the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

The specific patterns and properties of these synaptic connections are fundamental to the computations cortical neurons perform. How such specificity arises in cortical circuits has remained elusive. Here, we first consider the cell-type, subcellular and synaptic specificity required for generating mature patterns of cortical connectivity and responses. Next, we focus on recent progress in understanding how the synaptic connections among excitatory cortical projection neurons are established during development using the primary visual cortex of the mouse as a model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Graphical abstract for this article&quot; src=&quot;https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438818300655-fx1.jpg&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;301&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The diverse culinary habits of microglia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diverse culinary habits of microglia, Published online: 23 July 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0196-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-018-0196-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Heterogeneity of function in microglia from different brain regions is suspected but largely unknown. This paper identifies the epigenetic mechanism underlying differential phagocytic activity of microglia in discrete brain regions and examines the consequences of inducing an appetite not commensurate with the level of cell death in the region in which they reside.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/lpNCxFRTwYo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>
