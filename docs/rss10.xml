Extensive works during the past decade yield ample insights into the molecular and cellular functions of MeCP2 in neural development. Furthermore, genetic manipulations in Mecp2 mouse models strongly suggested that deficiency in synaptic plasticity and various behaviors of Mecp2 null or transgenic mice could be rescued in adulthood. Further studies elucidating neural circuits responsible for symptoms in MECP2-associated disorders in rodent and non-human primate models will shed light on the development of potential therapeutic interventions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Clinical and animal model studies have shown that changes in PFC excitation and inhibition are important for cognitive functions as well as related disorders. Here, we discuss recent findings revealing the roles of the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic proteins neuroligin 1 (NLGN1) and NLGN2 in the PFC in memory formation and modulation of memory strength. We propose that shifts in NLGN1 and NLGN2 expression in specific excitatory and inhibitory neuronal subpopulations in response to experience regulate the dynamic processes of memory consolidation and strengthening. Because excitatory/inhibitory imbalances accompany neuropsychiatric disorders in which strength and flexibility of representations play important roles, understanding these mechanisms may suggest novel therapies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Publication date: June 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Guosong   Hong, Xiao   Yang, Tao   Zhou, Charles M   Lieber&lt;br /&gt; Existing implantable neurotechnologies for understanding the brain and treating neurological diseases have intrinsic properties that have limited their capability to achieve chronically-stable brain interfaces with single-neuron spatiotemporal resolution. These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to ‘look and behave’ like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Human neuroimaging studies consistently show a hunger-dependent, selective enhancement of responses to images of food in association cortex and amygdala. More recently, cellular-resolution imaging combined with circuit mapping experiments in behaving mice have revealed underlying neuronal population dynamics and enabled tracing of pathways by which hunger circuits influence the assignment of value to visual objects in visual association cortex, insular cortex, and amygdala. These experiments begin to provide a mechanistic understanding of motivation-specific neural processing of need-relevant cues in healthy humans and in disease states such as obesity and other eating disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Since the earliest days of embryology, lineage questions have been addressed with methods of increasing specificity, capacity, and resolution. Yet, a full realization of individual cell lineages remains challenging for complex systems. A recent explosion of technical advances in genome-editing and single-cell sequencing has enabled lineage analysis in an unprecedented scale, speed, and depth across different species. In this review, we discuss the application of available as well as future genetic labeling techniques for tracking neural lineages in vivo in the mammalian nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

During development, individual gene activity can dynamically engage different signaling networks; thus genetic mutations can lead to different functional changes at different times. Interpretation of phenotypes can be further complicated if initial functional changes trigger compensatory mechanisms. Examining genetic mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders reveals cellular phenotypes that change over the course of development and exist long before behavioral deficits are assessed. Correspondingly, earlier genetic interventions in these disorder models have often been more effective at improving behavioral deficits than late interventions. The restricted period of effective intervention demonstrates that identifying a target window is an essential component of treatment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Emerging evidence indicates that REST is a master transcriptional regulator of neuron-specific genes not only in neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation, but also in differentiated neurons during the critical period in postnatal brain development, where it plays a role in fine-tuning of genes involved in synaptic plasticity, and in normal aging, where it promotes neuroprotection by repressing genes involved in oxidative stress and β-amyloid toxicity. This review focuses on recent findings that dysregulation of REST and REST-dependent epigenetic remodeling provide a central mechanism critical to the progressive neurodegeneration associated with neurologic disorders and diseases including global ischemia, stroke, epilepsy, Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

During the first three weeks of postnatal development, immature astrocytes express mGlu5 and expands several fold while undergoing a transition towards their mature phase. Although mGlu5-mediated signalling in astrocyte functions has been extensively studied in the last decades, whether this signalling is implicated in the mechanisms governing their development, as well as the effects of dysregulated astrocytic development on neurodevelopmental disorders, are still unclear. The aim of this review is to examine what is known about the mGlu5-mediated signalling in the developing astrocytes and its possible contribution to the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

This neural activity reflects internal processes by which the brain plans and executes volitional movements. The study of motor planning offers an opportunity to understand how the structure and dynamics of neural circuits support persistent internal states and how these states influence behavior. Recent advances in large-scale neural recordings are beginning to decipher the relationship of the dynamics of populations of neurons during motor planning and movements. New behavioral tasks in rodents, together with quantified perturbations, link dynamics in specific nodes of neural circuits to behavior. These studies reveal a neural network distributed across multiple brain regions that collectively supports motor planning. We review recent advances and highlight areas where further work is needed to achieve a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying motor planning and related cognitive processes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

These functions rely on the computation of the local cerebellar microcircuits and long-range connectivity that relays cerebellar output to various brain areas. In this review, we discuss recent work on two of the circuit elements, which are thought to be fundamental for a wide range of non-sensorimotor behaviors: The role for cerebellar granule cells in multimodal integration in the cerebellar cortex and the long-range connectivity between the deep cerebellar nuclei and the basal ganglia. Lastly, we discuss how studies on synapses and circuits of the cerebellum in rodent models of autism-spectrum disorders might contribute to our understanding of the pathophysiology of this class of neurodevelopmental disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Studies have found that sensory, prefrontal, hippocampal, cerebellar, and striatal regions, as well as the circuits that connect them, are perturbed in mouse models of ASD and ID. Dissecting the disruptions in morphology and activity in these neural circuits might help us to understand the shared risk between the two disorders as well as their clinical heterogeneity. Treatments that target the balance between excitation and inhibition in these regions are able to reverse pathological phenotypes, elucidating this deficit as a commonality across models and opening new avenues for intervention. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Individual network components in the mushroom bodies of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster represent cues, learning signals and behavioral outcomes of learned experience. Recent findings have highlighted the importance of dopamine-driven plasticity and activity in feedback and feedforward connections, between various elements of the mushroom body neural network. These computational motifs have been shown to be crucial for long term olfactory memory consolidation, integration of internal states, re-evaluation and updating of learned information. The often recurrent circuit anatomy and a prolonged requirement for activity in parts of these underlying networks, suggest that self-sustained and precisely timed activity is a fundamental feature of network computations in the insect brain. Together these processes allow flies to continuously adjust the content of their learned knowledge and direct their behavior in a way that best represents learned expectations and serves their most pressing current needs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Numerous genes in the endo-lysosomal pathways have been found to associate with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations of these genes lead to dysfunction in multiple steps of the endo-lysosomal network: autophagy, endocytic trafficking and lysosomal degradation, resulting in accumulation of pathogenic proteins. Although the exact pathogenic mechanism varies for different disease-associated genes, dysfunction of the endo-lysosomal pathways represents a converging mechanism shared by these diseases. Therefore, strategies that correct or compensate for endo-lysosomal dysfunction may be promising therapeutic approaches to treat neurodegenerative diseases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

These devices, usually sensing cell activity via microelectrodes, should be characterized by safe working conditions in the biological milieu together with a well-controlled operation-life. The stable device/neuronal electrical coupling at the interface requires tight interactions between the electrode surface and the cell membrane. This neuro-electrode hybrid represents the hyphen between the soft nature of neural tissue, generating electrical signals via ion motions, and the rigid realm of microelectronics and medical devices, dealing with electrons in motion. Efficient integration of these entities is essential for monitoring, analyzing and controlling neuronal signaling but poses significant technological challenges. Improving the cell/electrode interaction and thus the interface performance requires novel engineering of (nano)materials: tuning at the nanoscale electrode's properties may lead to engineer interfacing probes that better camouflaged with their biological target. In this brief review, we highlight the most recent concepts in nanotechnologies and nanomaterials that might help reducing the mismatch between tissue and electrode, focusing on the device's mechanical properties and its biological integration with the tissue. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Prefrontal Corticostriatal Disconnection Blocks the Acquisition of Goal-Directed Action</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1311?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The acquisition of goal-directed action requires encoding of the association between an action and its specific consequences or outcome. At a neural level, this encoding has been hypothesized to involve a prefrontal corticostriatal circuit involving the projection from the prelimbic cortex (PL) to the posterior dorsomedial striatum (pDMS); however, no direct evidence for this claim has been reported. In a series of experiments, we performed functional disconnection of this pathway using targeted lesions of the anterior corpus callosum to disrupt contralateral corticostriatal projections with asymmetrical lesions of the PL and/or pDMS to block plasticity in this circuit in rats. We first demonstrated that unilaterally blocking the PL input to the pDMS prevented the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-related kinase/mitogen activated protein kinase (pERK/pMAPK) induced by instrumental training. Next, we used a full bilateral disconnection of the PL from the pDMS and assessed goal-directed action using an outcome-devaluation test. Importantly, we found evidence that rats maintaining an ipsilateral and/or contralateral connection between the PL and the pDMS were able to acquire goal-directed actions. In contrast, bilateral PL–pDMS disconnection abolished the acquisition of goal-directed actions. Finally, we used a temporary pharmacological disconnection to disrupt PL inputs to the pDMS by infusing the NMDA antagonist dl-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid into the pDMS during instrumental training and found that this manipulation also disrupted goal-directed learning. These results establish that, in rats, the acquisition of new goal-directed actions depends on a prefrontal–corticostriatal circuit involving a connection between the PL and the pDMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It has been hypothesized that the prelimbic cortex (PL) and posterior dorsomedial striatum (pDMS) in rodents interact in a corticostriatal circuit to mediate goal-directed learning. However, no direct evidence supporting this claim has been reported. Using targeted lesions, we performed functional disconnection of the PL–pDMS pathway to assess its role in goal-directed learning. In the first experiment, we demonstrated that PL input to the pDMS is necessary for instrumental training-induced neuronal activity. Next, we disrupted ipsilateral, contralateral, or bilateral PL–pDMS connections and found that only bilateral PL–pDMS disconnection disrupted the acquisition of goal-directed actions, a finding we replicated in our final study using a pharmacological disconnection procedure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Visually-Driven Maps in Area 3b</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1295?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sensory perception relies on the precise neuronal encoding of modality-specific environmental features in primary sensory cortices. Some studies have reported the penetration of signals from other modalities even into early sensory areas. So far, no comprehensive account of maps induced by &quot;foreign sources&quot; exists. We addressed this question using surface-based topographic mapping techniques applied to ultra-high resolution fMRI neuroimaging data, measured in female participants. We show that fine-grained finger maps in human primary somatosensory cortex, area 3b, are somatotopically activated not only during tactile mechanical stimulation, but also when viewing the same fingers being touched. Visually-induced maps were weak in amplitude, but overlapped with the stronger tactile maps tangential to the cortical sheet when finger touches were observed in both first- and third-person perspectives. However, visually-induced maps did not overlap tactile maps when the observed fingers were only approached by an object but not actually touched. Our data provide evidence that &quot;foreign source maps&quot; in early sensory cortices are present in the healthy human brain, that their arrangement is precise, and that their induction is feature-selective. The computations required to generate such specific responses suggest that counterflow (feedback) processing may be much more spatially specific than has been often assumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Using ultra-high field fMRI, we provide empirical evidence that viewing touches activates topographically aligned single finger maps in human primary somatosensory cortical area 3b. This shows that &quot;foreign source maps&quot; in early sensory cortices are topographic, precise, and feature-selective in healthy human participants with intact sensory pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Meis1 Coordinates Cerebellar Granule Cell Development by Regulating Pax6 Transcription, BMP Signaling and Atoh1 Degradation</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1277?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cerebellar granule cell precursors (GCPs) and granule cells (GCs) represent good models to study neuronal development. Here, we report that the transcription factor myeloid ectopic viral integration site 1 homolog (Meis1) plays pivotal roles in the regulation of mouse GC development. We found that Meis1 is expressed in GC lineage cells and astrocytes in the cerebellum during development. Targeted disruption of the Meis1 gene specifically in the GC lineage resulted in smaller cerebella with disorganized lobules. Knock-down/knock-out (KO) experiments for Meis1 and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; assays showed that Meis1 binds to an upstream sequence of Pax6 to enhance its transcription in GCPs/GCs and also suggested that the Meis1–Pax6 cascade regulates morphology of GCPs/GCs during development. In the conditional KO (cKO) cerebella, many Atoh1-positive GCPs were observed ectopically in the inner external granule layer (EGL) and a similar phenomenon was observed in cultured cerebellar slices treated with a bone morphogenic protein (BMP) inhibitor. Furthermore, expression of Smad proteins and Smad phosphorylation were severely reduced in the cKO cerebella and Meis1-knock-down GCPs cerebella. Reduction of phosphorylated Smad was also observed in cerebellar slices electroporated with a Pax6 knock-down vector. Because it is known that BMP signaling induces Atoh1 degradation in GCPs, these findings suggest that the Meis1–Pax6 pathway increases the expression of Smad proteins to upregulate BMP signaling, leading to degradation of Atoh1 in the inner EGL, which contributes to differentiation from GCPs to GCs. Therefore, this work reveals crucial functions of Meis1 in GC development and gives insights into the general understanding of the molecular machinery underlying neural differentiation from neural progenitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We report that myeloid ectopic viral integration site 1 homolog (Meis1) plays pivotal roles in the regulation of mouse granule cell (GC) development. Here, we show Meis1 is expressed in GC precursors (GCPs) and GCs during development. Our knock-down and conditional knock-out (cKO) experiments and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; assays revealed that Meis1 is required for proper cerebellar structure formation and for &lt;i&gt;Pax6&lt;/i&gt; transcription in GCPs and GCs. The Meis1–Pax6 cascade regulates the morphology of GCs. In the cKO cerebella, Smad proteins and bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling are severely reduced and Atoh1-expressing GCPs are ectopically detected in the inner external granule layer. These findings suggest that Meis1 regulates degradation of Atoh1 via BMP signaling, contributing to GC differentiation in the inner EGL, and should provide understanding into GC development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Selective Suppression of Local Interneuron Circuits in Human Motor Cortex Contributes to Movement Preparation</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1264?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Changes in neural activity occur in the motor cortex before movement, but the nature and purpose of this preparatory activity is unclear. To investigate this in the human (male and female) brain noninvasively, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to probe the excitability of distinct sets of excitatory inputs to corticospinal neurons during the warning period of various reaction time tasks. Using two separate methods (H-reflex conditioning and directional effects of TMS), we show that a specific set of excitatory inputs to corticospinal neurons are suppressed during motor preparation, while another set of inputs remain unaffected. To probe the behavioral relevance of this suppression, we examined whether the strength of the selective preparatory inhibition in each trial was related to reaction time. Surprisingly, the greater the amount of selective preparatory inhibition, the faster the reaction time was. This suggests that the inhibition of inputs to corticospinal neurons is not involved in preventing the release of movement but may in fact facilitate rapid reactions. Thus, selective suppression of a specific set of motor cortical neurons may be a key aspect of successful movement preparation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Movement preparation evokes substantial activity in the motor cortex despite no apparent movement. One explanation for the lack of movement is that motor cortical output in this period is gated by an inhibitory mechanism. This notion was supported by previous noninvasive TMS studies of human motor cortex indicating a reduction of corticospinal excitability. On the contrary, our data support the idea that there is a coordinated balance of activity upstream of the corticospinal output neurons. This includes a suppression of specific local circuits that supports, rather than inhibits, the rapid generation of prepared movements. Thus, the selective suppression of local circuits appears to be an essential part of successful movement preparation instead of an external control mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) Neuron Excitability Is Regulated by Estradiol Feedback and Kisspeptin</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1249?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons produce the central output controlling fertility and are regulated by steroid feedback. A switch from estradiol negative to positive feedback initiates the GnRH surge, ultimately triggering ovulation. This occurs on a daily basis in ovariectomized, estradiol-treated (OVX+E) mice; GnRH neurons are suppressed in the morning and activated in the afternoon. To test the hypotheses that estradiol and time of day signals alter GnRH neuron responsiveness to stimuli, GFP-identified GnRH neurons in brain slices from OVX+E or OVX female mice were recorded during the morning or afternoon. No differences were observed in baseline membrane potential. Current-clamp revealed GnRH neurons fired more action potentials in response to current injection during positive feedback relative to all other groups, which were not different from each other despite reports of differing ionic conductances. Kisspeptin increased GnRH neuron response in cells from OVX and OVX+E mice in the morning but not afternoon. Paradoxically, excitability in kisspeptin knock-out mice was similar to the maximum observed in control mice but was unchanged by time of day or estradiol. A mathematical model applying a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to estimate probability distributions for estradiol- and time of day–dependent parameters was used to predict intrinsic properties underlying excitability changes. A single identifiable distribution of solutions accounted for similar GnRH neuron excitability in all groups other than positive feedback despite different underlying conductance properties; this was attributable to interdependence of voltage-gated potassium channel properties. In contrast, redundant solutions may explain positive feedback, perhaps indicative of the importance of this state for species survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Infertility affects 15%–20% of couples; failure to ovulate is a common cause. Understanding how the brain controls ovulation is critical for new developments in both infertility treatment and contraception. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons are the final common pathway for central neural control of ovulation. We studied how estradiol feedback regulates GnRH excitability, a key determinant of neural firing rate using laboratory and computational approaches. GnRH excitability is upregulated during positive feedback, perhaps driving increased neural firing rate at this time. Kisspeptin increased GnRH excitability and was essential for estradiol regulation of excitability. Modeling predicts that multiple combinations of changes to GnRH intrinsic conductances can produce the firing response in positive feedback, suggesting the brain has many ways to induce ovulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Tenuous Inhibitory GABAergic Signaling in the Reticular Thalamus</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1232?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Maintenance of a low intracellular Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; concentration ([Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) is critical for enabling inhibitory neuronal responses to GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-mediated signaling. Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; transporters, including KCC2, and extracellular impermeant anions ([A]&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;) of the extracellular matrix are both proposed to be important regulators of [Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. Neurons of the reticular thalamic (RT) nucleus express reduced levels of KCC2, indicating that GABAergic signaling may produce excitation in RT neurons. However, by performing perforated patch recordings and calcium imaging experiments in rats (male and female), we find that [Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; remains relatively low in RT neurons. Although we identify a small contribution of [A]&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; to a low [Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; in RT neurons, our results also demonstrate that reduced levels of KCC2 remain sufficient to maintain low levels of Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;. Reduced KCC2 levels, however, restrict the capacity of RT neurons to rapidly extrude Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; following periods of elevated GABAergic signaling. In a computational model of a local RT network featuring slow Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; extrusion kinetics, similar to those we found experimentally, model RT neurons are predisposed to an activity-dependent switch from GABA-mediated inhibition to excitation. By decreasing the activity threshold required to produce excitatory GABAergic signaling, weaker stimuli are able to propagate activity within the model RT nucleus. Our results indicate the importance of even diminished levels of KCC2 in maintaining inhibitory signaling within the RT nucleus and suggest how this important activity choke point may be easily overcome in disorders such as epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Precise regulation of intracellular Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; levels ([Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) preserves appropriate, often inhibitory, GABAergic signaling within the brain. However, there is disagreement over the relative contribution of various mechanisms that maintain low [Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. We found that the Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; transporter KCC2 is an important Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; extruder in the reticular thalamic (RT) nucleus, despite this nucleus having remarkably low KCC2 immunoreactivity relative to other regions of the adult brain. We also identified a smaller contribution of fixed, impermeant anions ([A]&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;) to lowering [Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; in RT neurons. Inhibitory signaling among RT neurons is important for preventing excessive activation of RT neurons, which can be responsible for generating seizures. Our work suggests that KCC2 critically restricts the spread of activity within the RT nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Conditional Deletion of Hippocampal CA2/CA3a Oxytocin Receptors Impairs the Persistence of Long-Term Social Recognition Memory in Mice</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1218?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Oxytocin (OXT) receptors (OXTRs) are prominently expressed in hippocampal CA2 and CA3 pyramidal neurons, but little is known about its physiological function. As the functional necessity of hippocampal CA2 for social memory processing, we tested whether CA2 OXTRs may contribute to long-term social recognition memory (SRM) formation. Here, we found that conditional deletion of &lt;i&gt;Oxtr&lt;/i&gt; from forebrain (&lt;i&gt;Oxtr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;) or CA2/CA3a-restricted excitatory neurons in adult male mice impaired the persistence of long-term SRM but had no effect on sociability and preference for social novelty. Conditional deletion of CA2/CA3a &lt;i&gt;Oxtr&lt;/i&gt; showed no changes in anxiety-like behavior assessed using the open-field, elevated plus maze and novelty-suppressed feeding tests. Application of a highly selective OXTR agonist [Thr&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;,Gly&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;]-OXT to hippocampal slices resulted in an acute and lasting potentiation of excitatory synaptic responses in CA2 pyramidal neurons that relied on &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activation and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II activity. In addition, &lt;i&gt;Oxtr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice displayed a defect in the induction of long-term potentiation, but not long-term depression, at the synapses between the entorhinal cortex and CA2 pyramidal neurons. Furthermore, &lt;i&gt;Oxtr&lt;/i&gt; deletion led to a reduced complexity of basal dendritic arbors of CA2 pyramidal neurons, but caused no alteration in the density of apical dendritic spines. Considering that the methodologies we have used to delete &lt;i&gt;Oxtr&lt;/i&gt; do not rule out targeting the neighboring CA3a region, these findings suggest that OXTR signaling in the CA2/CA3a is crucial for the persistence of long-term SRM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Oxytocin receptors (OXTRs) are abundantly expressed in hippocampal CA2 and CA3 regions, but there are little known about their physiological function. Taking advantage of the conditional &lt;i&gt;Oxtr&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mice, the present study highlights the importance of OXTR signaling in the induction of long-term potentiation at the synapses between the entorhinal cortex and CA2 pyramidal neurons and the persistence of long-term social recognition memory. Thus, OXTRs in the CA2/CA3a may provide a new target for therapeutic approaches to the treatment of social cognition deficits, which are often observed in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Attention Shifts Recruit the Monkey Default Mode Network</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1202?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A unifying function associated with the default mode network (DMN), which is more active during rest than under active task conditions, has been difficult to define. The DMN is activated during monitoring the external world for unexpected events, as a sentinel, and when humans are engaged in high-level internally focused tasks. The existence of DMN correlates in other species, such as mice, challenge the idea that internally focused, high-level cognitive operations, such as introspection, autobiographical memory retrieval, planning the future, and predicting someone else's thoughts, are evolutionarily preserved defining properties of the DMN. A recent human study demonstrated that demanding cognitive shifts could recruit the DMN, yet it is unknown whether this holds for nonhuman species. Therefore, we tested whether large changes in cognitive context would recruit DMN regions in female and male nonhuman primates. Such changes were measured as displacements of spatial attentional weights based on internal rules of relevance (spatial shifts) compared with maintaining attentional weights at the same location (stay events). Using fMRI in macaques, we detected that a cortical network, activated during shifts, largely overlapped with the DMN. Moreover, fMRI time courses sampled from independently defined DMN foci showed significant shift selectivity during the demanding attention task. Finally, functional clustering based on independent resting state data revealed that DMN and shift regions clustered conjointly, whereas regions activated during the stay events clustered apart. We therefore propose that cognitive shifting in primates generally recruits DMN regions. This might explain a breakdown of the DMN in many neurological diseases characterized by declined cognitive flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Activation of the human default mode network (DMN) can be measured with fMRI when subjects shift thoughts between high-level internally directed cognitive states, when thinking about the self, the perspective of others, when imagining future and past events, and during mind wandering. Furthermore, the DMN is activated as a sentinel, monitoring the environment for unexpected events. Arguably, these cognitive processes have in common fast and substantial changes in cognitive context. As DMN activity has also been reported in nonhuman species, we tested whether shifts in spatial attention activated the monkey DMN. Core monkey DMN and shift-selective regions shared several functional properties, indicating that cognitive shifting, in general, might constitute one of the evolutionarily preserved functions of the DMN.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Prismatic Adaptation Modulates Oscillatory EEG Correlates of Motor Preparation but Not Visual Attention in Healthy Participants</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1189?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Prismatic adaption (PA) has been proposed as a tool to induce neural plasticity and is used to help neglect rehabilitation. It leads to a recalibration of visuomotor coordination during pointing as well as to aftereffects on a number of sensorimotor and attention tasks, but whether these effects originate at a motor or attentional level remains a matter of debate. Our aim was to further characterize PA aftereffects by using an approach that allows distinguishing between effects on attentional and motor processes. We recorded EEG in healthy human participants (9 females and 7 males) while performing a new double step, anticipatory attention/motor preparation paradigm before and after adaptation to rightward-shifting prisms, with neutral lenses as a control. We then examined PA aftereffects through changes in known oscillatory EEG signatures of spatial attention orienting and motor preparation in the alpha and beta frequency bands. Our results were twofold. First, we found PA to rightward-shifting prisms to selectively affect EEG signatures of motor but not attentional processes. More specifically, PA modulated preparatory motor EEG activity over central electrodes in the right hemisphere, contralateral to the PA-induced, compensatory leftward shift in pointing movements. No effects were found on EEG signatures of spatial attention orienting over occipitoparietal sites. Second, we found the PA effect on preparatory motor EEG activity to dominate in the beta frequency band. We conclude that changes to intentional visuomotor, rather than attentional visuospatial, processes underlie the PA aftereffect of rightward-deviating prisms in healthy participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Prismatic adaptation (PA) has been proposed as a tool to induce neural plasticity in both healthy participants and patients, due to its aftereffect impacting on a number of visuospatial and visuomotor functions. However, the neural mechanisms underlying PA aftereffects are poorly understood as only little neuroimaging evidence is available. Here, we examined, for the first time, the origin of PA aftereffects studying oscillatory brain activity. Our results show a selective modulation of preparatory motor activity following PA in healthy participants but no effect on attention-related activity. This provides novel insight into the PA aftereffect in the healthy brain and may help to inform interventions in neglect patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Attention Is Required for Knowledge-Based Sequential Grouping: Insights from the Integration of Syllables into Words</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1178?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;How the brain groups sequential sensory events into chunks is a fundamental question in cognitive neuroscience. This study investigates whether top–down attention or specific tasks are required for the brain to apply lexical knowledge to group syllables into words. Neural responses tracking the syllabic and word rhythms of a rhythmic speech sequence were concurrently monitored using electroencephalography (EEG). The participants performed different tasks, attending to either the rhythmic speech sequence or a distractor, which was another speech stream or a nonlinguistic auditory/visual stimulus. Attention to speech, but not a lexical-meaning-related task, was required for reliable neural tracking of words, even when the distractor was a nonlinguistic stimulus presented cross-modally. Neural tracking of syllables, however, was reliably observed in all tested conditions. These results strongly suggest that neural encoding of individual auditory events (i.e., syllables) is automatic, while knowledge-based construction of temporal chunks (i.e., words) crucially relies on top–down attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Why we cannot understand speech when not paying attention is an old question in psychology and cognitive neuroscience. Speech processing is a complex process that involves multiple stages, e.g., hearing and analyzing the speech sound, recognizing words, and combining words into phrases and sentences. The current study investigates which speech-processing stage is blocked when we do not listen carefully. We show that the brain can reliably encode syllables, basic units of speech sounds, even when we do not pay attention. Nevertheless, when distracted, the brain cannot group syllables into multisyllabic words, which are basic units for speech meaning. Therefore, the process of converting speech sound into meaning crucially relies on attention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Loss of Intercalated Cells (ITCs) in the Mouse Amygdala of Tshz1 Mutants Correlates with Fear, Depression, and Social Interaction Phenotypes</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1160?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The intercalated cells (ITCs) of the amygdala have been shown to be critical regulatory components of amygdalar circuits, which control appropriate fear responses. Despite this, the molecular processes guiding ITC development remain poorly understood. Here we establish the zinc finger transcription factor Tshz1 as a marker of ITCs during their migration from the dorsal lateral ganglionic eminence through maturity. Using germline and conditional knock-out (cKO) mouse models, we show that &lt;i&gt;Tshz1&lt;/i&gt; is required for the proper migration and differentiation of ITCs. In the absence of &lt;i&gt;Tshz1&lt;/i&gt;, migrating ITC precursors fail to settle in their stereotypical locations encapsulating the lateral amygdala and BLA. Furthermore, they display reductions in the ITC marker Foxp2 and ectopic persistence of the dorsal lateral ganglionic eminence marker Sp8. &lt;i&gt;Tshz1&lt;/i&gt; mutant ITCs show increased cell death at postnatal time points, leading to a dramatic reduction by 3 weeks of age. In line with this, &lt;i&gt;Foxp2&lt;/i&gt;-null mutants also show a loss of ITCs at postnatal time points, suggesting that &lt;i&gt;Foxp2&lt;/i&gt; may function downstream of &lt;i&gt;Tshz1&lt;/i&gt; in the maintenance of ITCs. Behavioral analysis of male &lt;i&gt;Tshz1&lt;/i&gt; cKOs revealed defects in fear extinction as well as an increase in floating during the forced swim test, indicative of a depression-like phenotype. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;Tshz1&lt;/i&gt; cKOs display significantly impaired social interaction (i.e., increased passivity) regardless of partner genetics. Together, these results suggest that &lt;i&gt;Tshz1&lt;/i&gt; plays a critical role in the development of ITCs and that fear, depression-like and social behavioral deficits arise in their absence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We show here that the zinc finger transcription factor Tshz1 is expressed during development of the intercalated cells (ITCs) within the mouse amygdala. These neurons have previously been shown to play a crucial role in fear extinction. &lt;i&gt;Tshz1&lt;/i&gt; mouse mutants exhibit severely reduced numbers of ITCs as a result of abnormal migration, differentiation, and survival of these neurons. Furthermore, the loss of ITCs in mouse &lt;i&gt;Tshz1&lt;/i&gt; mutants correlates well with defects in fear extinction as well as the appearance of depression-like and abnormal social interaction behaviors reminiscent of depressive disorders observed in human patients with distal 18q deletions, including the &lt;i&gt;Tshz1&lt;/i&gt; locus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cocaine Selectively Reorganizes Excitatory Inputs to Substantia Nigra Pars Compacta Dopamine Neurons</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1151?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopamine neurons and their targets are involved in addiction and cue-induced relapse. However, afferents onto SNc dopamine neurons themselves appear insensitive to drugs of abuse, such as cocaine, when afferents are collectively stimulated electrically. This contrasts with ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons, whose glutamate afferents react robustly to cocaine. We used an optogenetic strategy to isolate identified SNc inputs and determine whether cocaine sensitivity in the mouse SNc circuit is conferred at the level of three glutamate afferents: dorsal raphé nucleus (DR), pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), and subthalamic nucleus (STN). We found that excitatory afferents to SNc dopamine neurons are sensitive to cocaine in an afferent-specific manner. A single exposure to cocaine &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; led to PPN-innervated synapses reducing the AMPA-to-NMDA receptor-mediated current ratio. In contrast to work in the VTA, this was due to increased NMDA receptor function with no change in AMPA receptor function. STN synapses showed a decrease in calcium-permeable AMPA receptors after cocaine, but no change in the AMPA-to-NMDA ratio. Cocaine also increased the release probability at DR-innervated and STN-innervated synapses, quantified by decreases in paired-pulse ratios. However, release probability at PPN-innervated synapses remained unaffected. By examining identified inputs, our results demonstrate a functional distribution among excitatory SNc afferent nuclei in response to cocaine, and suggest a compelling architecture for differentiation and separate parsing of inputs within the nigrostriatal system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Prior studies have established that substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopamine neurons are a key node in the circuitry that drives addiction and relapse, yet cocaine apparently has no effect on electrically stimulated excitatory inputs. Our study is the first to demonstrate the functional impact of a drug of abuse on synaptic mechanisms of identified afferents to the SNc. Optogenetic dissection of inputs originating from dorsal raphé, pedunculopontine, and subthalamic nuclei were tested for synaptic modifications following &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; cocaine exposure. Our results demonstrate that cocaine differentially induces modifications to SNc synapses depending on input origin. This presents implications for understanding dopamine processing of motivated behavior; most critically, it indicates that dopamine neurons selectively modulate signal reception processed by afferent nuclei.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cholinergic Overstimulation Attenuates Rule Selectivity in Macaque Prefrontal Cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1137?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Acetylcholine is released in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and is a key modulator of cognitive performance in primates. Cholinergic stimulation has been shown to have beneficial effects on performance of cognitive tasks, and cholinergic receptors are being actively explored as promising targets for ameliorating cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease. We hypothesized that cholinergic stimulation of PFC during performance of a cognitive task would augment neuronal activity and neuronal coding of task attributes. We iontophoretically applied the general cholinergic receptor agonist carbachol onto neurons in dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) of male rhesus macaques performing rule-guided prosaccades and antisaccades, a well established oculomotor task for testing cognitive control. Carbachol application had heterogeneous effects on neuronal excitability, with both excitation and suppression observed in significant proportions. Contrary to our prediction, neurons with rule-selective activity exhibited a reduction in selectivity during carbachol application. Cholinergic stimulation disrupted rule selectivity regardless of whether it had suppressive or excitatory effects on these neurons. In addition, cholinergic stimulation excited putative pyramidal neurons, whereas the activity of putative interneurons remained unchanged. Moreover, cholinergic stimulation attenuated saccade direction selectivity in putative pyramidal neurons due to nonspecific increases in activity. Our results suggest excessive cholinergic stimulation has detrimental effects on DLPFC representations of task attributes. These findings delineate the complexity and heterogeneity of neuromodulation of cerebral cortex by cholinergic stimulation, an area of active exploration with respect to the development of cognitive enhancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The neurotransmitter acetylcholine is known to be important for cognitive processes in the prefrontal cortex. Removal of acetylcholine from prefrontal cortex can disrupt short-term memory performance and is reminiscent of Alzheimer's disease, which is characterized by degeneration of acetylcholine-producing neurons. Stimulation of cholinergic receptors is being explored to create cognitive enhancers for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other psychiatric diseases. Here, we stimulated cholinergic receptors in prefrontal cortex and examined its effects on neurons that are engaged in cognitive behavior. Surprisingly, cholinergic stimulation decreased neurons' ability to discriminate between rules. This work suggests that overstimulation of acetylcholine receptors could disrupt neuronal processing during cognition and is relevant to the design of cognitive enhancers based on stimulating the cholinergic system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: DRG Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel 1.7 Is Upregulated in Paclitaxel-Induced Neuropathy in Rats and in Humans with Neuropathic Pain</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1124?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common adverse effect experienced by cancer patients receiving treatment with paclitaxel. The voltage-gated sodium channel 1.7 (Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7) plays an important role in multiple preclinical models of neuropathic pain and in inherited human pain phenotypes, and its gene expression is increased in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) of paclitaxel-treated rats. Hence, the potential of change in the expression and function of Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 protein in DRGs from male rats with paclitaxel-related CIPN and from male and female humans with cancer-related neuropathic pain was tested here. Double immunofluorescence in CIPN rats showed that Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 was upregulated in small DRG neuron somata, especially those also expressing calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and in central processes of these cells in the superficial spinal dorsal horn. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in rat DRG neurons revealed that paclitaxel induced an enhancement of ProTx II (a selective Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 channel blocker)-sensitive sodium currents. Bath-applied ProTx II suppressed spontaneous action potentials in DRG neurons occurring in rats with CIPN, while intrathecal injection of ProTx II significantly attenuated behavioral signs of CIPN. Complementarily, DRG neurons isolated from segments where patients had a history of neuropathic pain also showed electrophysiological and immunofluorescence results indicating an increased expression of Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 associated with spontaneous activity. Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 was also colocalized in human cells expressing transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 and CGRP. Furthermore, ProTx II decreased firing frequency in human DRGs with spontaneous action potentials. This study suggests that Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 may provide a potential new target for the treatment of neuropathic pain, including chemotherapy (paclitaxel)-induced neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This work demonstrates that the expression and function of the voltage-gated sodium channel Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 are increased in a preclinical model of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), the most common treatment-limiting side effect of all the most common anticancer therapies. This is key as gain-of-function mutations in human Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 recapitulate both the distribution and pain percept as shown by CIPN patients. This work also shows that Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 is increased in human DRG neurons only in dermatomes where patients are experiencing acquired neuropathic pain symptoms. This work therefore has major translational impact, indicating an important novel therapeutic avenue for neuropathic pain as a class.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Decoding Trans-Saccadic Memory</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1114?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We examine whether peripheral information at a planned saccade target affects immediate postsaccadic processing at the fovea on saccade landing. Current neuroimaging research suggests that presaccadic stimulation has a late effect on postsaccadic processing, in contrast to the early effect seen in behavioral studies. Human participants (both male and female) were instructed to saccade toward a face or a house that, on different trials, remained the same, changed, or disappeared during the saccade. We used a multivariate pattern analysis of electroencephalography data to decode face versus house processing directly after the saccade. The classifier was trained on separate trials without a saccade, where a house or face was presented at the fovea. When the saccade target remained the same across the saccade, we could reliably decode the target 123 ms after saccade offset. In contrast, when the target was changed during the saccade, the new target was decoded at a later time-point, 151 ms after saccade offset. The &quot;same&quot; condition advantage suggests that congruent presaccadic information facilitates processing of the postsaccadic stimulus compared with incongruent information. Finally, the saccade target could be decoded above chance even when it had been removed during the saccade, albeit with a slower time course (162 ms) and poorer signal strength. These findings indicate that information about the (peripheral) presaccadic stimulus is transferred across the saccade so that it becomes quickly available and influences processing at its expected new retinal position (the fovea).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Here we provide neural evidence for early information transfer across saccades. Specifically, we examined the effect of presaccadic sensory information on the initial neuronal processing of a postsaccadic stimuli. Using electroencephalography and multivariate pattern analysis, we found the following: (1) that the identity of the presaccadic stimulus modulated the postsaccadic latency of stimulus relevant information; and (2) that a saccadic neural marker for a saccade target stimulus could be detected even when the stimulus had been removed during saccade. These results demonstrate that information about the peripheral presaccadic stimulus was transferred across the saccade and influenced processing at a new retinal position (the fovea) directly after the saccade landed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Disruption of Interneuron Neurogenesis in Premature Newborns and Reversal with Estrogen Treatment</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1100?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many Preterm-born children suffer from neurobehavioral disorders. Premature birth terminates the hypoxic &lt;i&gt;in utero&lt;/i&gt; environment and supply of maternal hormones. As the production of interneurons continues until the end of pregnancy, we hypothesized that premature birth would disrupt interneuron production and that restoration of the hypoxic milieu or estrogen treatment might reverse interneuron generation. To test these hypotheses, we compared interneuronal progenitors in the medial ganglionic eminences (MGEs), lateral ganglionic eminences (LGEs), and caudal ganglionic eminences (CGEs) between preterm-born [born on embryonic day (E) 29; examined on postnatal day (D) 3 and D7] and term-born (born on E32; examined on D0 and D4) rabbits at equivalent postconceptional ages. We found that both total and cycling Nkx2.1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Dlx2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Sox2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells were more abundant in the MGEs of preterm rabbits at D3 compared with term rabbits at D0, but not in D7 preterm relative to D4 term pups. Total Nkx2.1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; progenitors were also more numerous in the LGEs of preterm pups at D3 compared with term rabbits at D0. Dlx2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in CGEs were comparable between preterm and term pups. Simulation of hypoxia by dimethyloxalylglycine treatment did not affect the number of interneuronal progenitors. However, estrogen treatment reduced the density of total and proliferating Nkx2.1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Dlx2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in the MGEs and enhanced Ascl1 transcription factor. Estrogen treatment also reduced Ki67, c-Myc, and phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein, suggesting inhibition of the G1-to-S phase transition. Hence, preterm birth disrupts interneuron neurogenesis in the MGE and estrogen treatment reverses interneuron neurogenesis in preterm newborns by cell-cycle inhibition and elevation of Ascl1. We speculate that estrogen replacement might partially restore neurogenesis in human premature infants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Prematurity results in developmental delays and neurobehavioral disorders, which might be ascribed to disturbances in the development of cortical interneurons. Here, we show that preterm birth disrupts interneuron neurogenesis in the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) and, more importantly, that estrogen treatment reverses this perturbation in the population of interneuron progenitors in the MGE. The estrogen seems to restore neurogenesis by inhibiting the cell cycle and elevating Ascl1 expression. As preterm birth causes plasma estrogen level to drop 100-fold, the estrogen replacement in preterm infants is physiological. We speculate that estrogen replacement might ameliorate disruption in production of interneurons in human premature infants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A{beta} mediates F-actin disassembly in dendritic spines leading to cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1085?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dendritic spine loss is recognized as an early feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Dendritic spine structure is defined by filamentous actin (F-actin) and we observed depolymerization of synaptosomal F-actin accompanied by increased globular-actin (G-actin) at as early as 1 month of age in a mouse model of AD (APPswe/PS1E9, male mice). This led to recall deficit after contextual fear conditioning (cFC) at 2 months of age in APPswe/PS1E9 male mice, which could be reversed by the actin-polymerizing agent jasplakinolide. Further, the F-actin-depolymerizing agent latrunculin induced recall deficit after cFC in WT mice, indicating the importance of maintaining F-/G-actin equilibrium for optimal behavioral response. Using direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), we show that F-actin depolymerization in spines leads to a breakdown of the nano-organization of outwardly radiating F-actin rods in cortical neurons from APPswe/PS1E9 mice. Our results demonstrate that synaptic dysfunction seen as F-actin disassembly occurs very early, before onset of pathological hallmarks in AD mice, and contributes to behavioral dysfunction, indicating that depolymerization of F-actin is causal and not consequent to decreased spine density. Further, we observed decreased synaptosomal F-actin levels in postmortem brain from mild cognitive impairment and AD patients compared with subjects with normal cognition. F-actin decrease correlated inversely with increasing AD pathology (Braak score, Aβ load, and tangle density) and directly with performance in episodic and working memory tasks, suggesting its role in human disease pathogenesis and progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Synaptic dysfunction underlies cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The cytoskeletal protein actin plays a critical role in maintaining structure and function of synapses. Using cultured neurons and an AD mouse model, we show for the first time that filamentous actin (F-actin) is lost selectively from synapses early in the disease process, long before the onset of classical AD pathology. We also demonstrate that loss of synaptic F-actin contributes directly to memory deficits. Loss of synaptosomal F-actin in human postmortem tissue correlates directly with decreased performance in memory test and inversely with AD pathology. Our data highlight that synaptic cytoarchitectural changes occur early in AD and they may be targeted for the development of therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: HRPU-2, a Homolog of Mammalian hnRNP U, Regulates Synaptic Transmission by Controlling the Expression of SLO-2 Potassium Channel in Caenorhabditis elegans</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1073?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Slo2 channels are large-conductance potassium channels abundantly expressed in the nervous system. However, it is unclear how their expression level in neurons is regulated. Here we report that HRPU-2, an RNA-binding protein homologous to mammalian heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (hnRNP U), plays an important role in regulating the expression of SLO-2 (a homolog of mammalian Slo2) in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;. Loss-of-function (&lt;i&gt;lf&lt;/i&gt;) mutants of &lt;i&gt;hrpu-2&lt;/i&gt; were isolated in a genetic screen for suppressors of a sluggish phenotype caused by a hyperactive SLO-2. In &lt;i&gt;hrpu-2(lf)&lt;/i&gt; mutants, SLO-2-mediated delayed outward currents in neurons are greatly decreased, and neuromuscular synaptic transmission is enhanced. These mutant phenotypes can be rescued by expressing wild-type HRPU-2 in neurons. HRPU-2 binds to &lt;i&gt;slo-2&lt;/i&gt; mRNA, and &lt;i&gt;hrpu-2(lf)&lt;/i&gt; mutants show decreased SLO-2 protein expression. In contrast, &lt;i&gt;hrpu-2(lf)&lt;/i&gt; does not alter the expression of either the BK channel SLO-1 or the &lt;i&gt;Shaker&lt;/i&gt; type potassium channel SHK-1. &lt;i&gt;hrpu-2(lf)&lt;/i&gt; mutants are indistinguishable from wild type in gross motor neuron morphology and locomotion behavior. Together, these observations suggest that HRPU-2 plays important roles in SLO-2 function by regulating SLO-2 protein expression, and that SLO-2 is likely among a restricted set of proteins regulated by HRPU-2. Mutations of human Slo2 channel and hnRNP U are strongly linked to epileptic disorders and intellectual disability. The findings of this study suggest a potential link between these two molecules in human patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (hnRNP U) belongs to a family of RNA-binding proteins that play important roles in controlling gene expression. Recent studies have established a strong link between mutations of hnRNP U and human epilepsies and intellectual disability. However, it is unclear how mutations of hnRNP U may cause such disorders. This study shows that mutations of HRPU-2, a worm homolog of mammalian hnRNP U, result in dysfunction of a Slo2 potassium channel, which is critical to neuronal function. Because mutations of Slo2 channels are also strongly associated with epileptic encephalopathies and intellectual disability in humans, the findings of this study point to a potential mechanism underlying neurological disorders caused by hnRNP U mutations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Glutamatergic Transmission to Hypothalamic Kisspeptin Neurons Is Differentially Regulated by Estradiol through Estrogen Receptor {alpha} in Adult Female Mice</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1061?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Estradiol feedback regulates gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons and subsequent luteinizing hormone (LH) release. Estradiol acts via estrogen receptor α (ERα)-expressing afferents of GnRH neurons, including kisspeptin neurons in the anteroventral periventricular (AVPV) and arcuate nuclei, providing homeostatic feedback on episodic GnRH/LH release as well as positive feedback to control ovulation. Ionotropic glutamate receptors are important for estradiol feedback, but it is not known where they fit in the circuitry. Estradiol-negative feedback decreased glutamatergic transmission to AVPV and increased it to arcuate kisspeptin neurons; positive feedback had the opposite effect. Deletion of ERα in kisspeptin cells decreased glutamate transmission to AVPV neurons and markedly increased it to arcuate kisspeptin neurons, which also exhibited increased spontaneous firing rate. KERKO mice had increased LH pulse frequency, indicating loss of negative feedback. These observations indicate that ERα in kisspeptin cells is required for appropriate differential regulation of these neurons and neuroendocrine output by estradiol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The brain regulates fertility through gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons. Ovarian estradiol regulates the pattern of GnRH (negative feedback) and initiates a surge of release that triggers ovulation (positive feedback). GnRH neurons do not express the estrogen receptor needed for feedback (estrogen receptor α [ERα]); kisspeptin neurons in the arcuate and anteroventral periventricular nuclei are postulated to mediate negative and positive feedback, respectively. Here we extend the network through which feedback is mediated by demonstrating that glutamatergic transmission to these kisspeptin populations is differentially regulated during the reproductive cycle and by estradiol. Electrophysiological and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; hormone profile experiments on kisspeptin-specific ERα knock-out mice demonstrate that ERα in kisspeptin cells is required for appropriate differential regulation of these neurons and for neuroendocrine output.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09997</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Low-dimensional yet rich dynamics often emerge in the brain. Examples include
oscillations and chaotic dynamics during sleep, epilepsy, and voluntary
movement. However, a general mechanism for the emergence of low dimensional
dynamics remains elusive. Here, we consider Wilson-Cowan networks and
demonstrate through numerical and analytical work that a type of homeostatic
regulation of the network firing rates can paradoxically lead to a rich
dynamical repertoire. The dynamics include mixed-mode oscillations, mixed-mode
chaos, and chaotic synchronization. This is true for single recurrently coupled
node, pairs of reciprocally coupled nodes without self-coupling, and networks
coupled through experimentally determined weights derived from functional
magnetic resonance imaging data. In all cases, the stability of the homeostatic
set point is analytically determined or approximated. The dynamics at the
network level are directly determined by the behavior of a single node system
through synchronization in both oscillatory and non-oscillatory states. Our
results demonstrate that rich dynamics can be preserved under homeostatic
regulation or even be caused by homeostatic regulation.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09900</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We investigated, by using auditory models, how three perceptual parameters,
loudness, pitch and sharpness, determine human echolocation. We used acoustic
recordings from two previous studies, both from stationary situations, and
their resulting perceptual data as input to our analysis. An initial analysis
was on the room acoustics of the recordings. The parameters of interest were
sound pressure level, autocorrelation and spectral centroid. The auditory
models were used to analyze echolocation resulting from the perceptual
variables, i.e. loudness, pitch and sharpness. Relevant auditory models were
chosen to simulate each variable. Based on these results, we calculated
psychophysical thresholds for detecting a reflecting object with constant
physical size. A non-parametric method was used to determine thresholds for
distance, loudness, pitch and sharpness. Difference thresholds were calculated
for the psychophysical variables, since a 2-Alternative-Forced-Choice Paradigm
had originally been used. We found that (1) blind persons could detect objects
at lower loudness values, lower pitch strength, different sharpness values and
at further distances than sighted persons, (2) detection thresholds based on
repetition pitch, loudness and sharpness varied and depended on room acoustics
and type of sound stimuli, (3) repetition pitch was useful for detection at
shorter distances and was determined from the peaks in the temporal profile of
the autocorrelation function, (4) loudness at shorter distances provides
echolocation information, (5) at longer distances, timbre aspects, such as
sharpness, might be used to detect objects. We also discuss binaural
information, movements and the auditory model approach. Autocorrelation was
assumed as a proper measure for pitch, but the question is raised whether a
mechanism based on strobe integration is a viable possibility.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09858</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Decoding specific task states from human fMRI (functional magnetic resonance
imaging) signals constitutes a major goal of neuroimaging. Previous studies of
task-state classification have focused largely on processed fMRI
characteristics (e.g. functional connectivity patterns, activity patterns) or a
single fMRI volume. Here, we assembled a novel deep neural network (DNN) for
classifying directly from 4-D fMRI time series, retaining both spatial and
temporal information of fMRI signals. We trained and tested the DNN classifier
by task fMRI data from human connectome project (HCP) S1200 dataset. Reading
just a single block of fMRI time series of each task for each individual, the
novel classification method identified the seven tasks with 91.75% accuracy in
test. Then we extracted task heatmaps of each time series by a guided
backpropagation approach, and found that the heatmaps had a high similarity
with the group average result of traditional contrast of parameter estimate
(COPE). Furthermore, the DNN could be applied to small dataset. The features
from the intermediate layer of the DNN were trained and used to train a support
vector machine (SVM) to classify four conditions within 300 blocks of task-fMRI
scans, data amount comparable to a usual neuroimaging research, and obtained a
95% accuracy. Our reported findings were the first to demonstrate the ability
of DNN to classify and extract heatmaps from a 4-D fMRI time series, as well as
its ability to be transfer trained by a small dataset. This approach should
enable decoding and mapping subject's task status and furthermore help with
classification and diagnosis of neuropsychiatric diseases.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Over-representation of Extreme Events in Decision-Making: A Rational Metacognitive Account. (arXiv:1801.09848v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09848</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Availability bias, manifested in the over-representation of extreme
eventualities in decision-making, is a well-known cognitive bias, and is
generally taken as evidence of human irrationality. In this work, we present
the first rational, metacognitive account of the Availability bias, formally
articulated at Marr's algorithmic level of analysis. Concretely, we present a
normative, metacognitive model of how a cognitive system should over-represent
extreme eventualities, depending on the amount of time available at its
disposal for decision-making. Our model also accounts for two well-known
framing effects in human decision-making under risk---the fourfold pattern of
risk preferences in outcome probability (Tversky &amp;amp; Kahneman, 1992) and in
outcome magnitude (Markovitz, 1952)---thereby providing the first
metacognitively-rational basis for those effects. Empirical evidence,
furthermore, confirms an important prediction of our model. Surprisingly, our
model is unimaginably robust with respect to its focal parameter. We discuss
the implications of our work for studies on human decision-making, and conclude
by presenting a counterintuitive prediction of our model, which, if confirmed,
would have intriguing implications for human decision-making under risk. To our
knowledge, our model is the first metacognitive, resource-rational process
model of cognitive biases in decision-making.

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/257568v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Rhythmic animal behaviors are regulated in part by neural circuits called the central pattern generators (CPGs). Classifying neural activities correlated with body movements and identifying component neurons associated with the activities are critical steps in understanding the workings of CPGs and animal locomotion. Here, we present a novel method for classifying motor activities in large-scale calcium imaging data of Drosophila larvae. The method is based on pre-trained convolutional neural network model VGG-16 and unsupervised learning, and successfully classified activities correlated with forward and backward locomotion in activity data of different types of neurons and under different imaging conditions. We also used voxel-wise correlation mapping to identify neurons associated with each motor activity. By applying these methods to neurons targeted by 5-HT2A-GAL4, which we generated by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knock-in, we identified two classes of interneurons, termed Seta and Leta, which are specifically active during backward but not forward fictive locomotion. Optogenetic activation of Seta and Leta neurons increases backward locomotion. Conversely, thermogenetic inhibition of 5-HT2A-GAL4 neurons or application of a 5-HT2 antagonist decreased backward locomotion induced by noxious light stimuli. Our results suggest that 5-HT modulates backward locomotion by acting on Seta and Leta neurons via the 5-HT2A receptor. This study establishes an accelerated pipeline for activity profiling and cell identification in larval Drosophila and implicates a serotonergic system in the modulation of backward locomotion.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/257378v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The dorsal raphe (DR) constitutes a major serotonergic input to the forebrain, and modulates diverse functions and brain states including mood, anxiety, and sensory and motor functions. Most functional studies to date have treated DR serotonin neurons as a single, homogeneous population. Using viral-genetic methods, we found that subcortical- vs. cortical-projecting serotonin neurons have distinct cell body distributions within the DR and different degrees of co-expressing a vesicular glutamate transporter. Further, the amygdala- and frontal cortex-projecting DR serotonin neurons have largely complementary whole-brain collateralization patterns, receive biased inputs from presynaptic partners, and exhibit opposite responses to aversive stimuli. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments suggest that amygdala-projecting DR serotonin neurons promote anxiety-like behavior, whereas frontal cortex-projecting neurons promote active coping in face of challenge. These results provide compelling evidence that the DR serotonin system contains parallel sub-systems that differ in input and output connectivity, physiological response properties, and behavioral functions.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/257337v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Temporal difference reinforcement learning (TDRL) accurately models associative learning observed in animals where they learn to predict the reward value of an unconditioned stimulus (US) based on a conditioned stimulus (CS), such as in classical conditioning. A key component of TDRL is the value function, which captures the expected temporally discounted reward from a given state. The value function can also be modified by the animal's knowledge and certainty of its environment. Here we show that not only do primary motor cortex (M1) neurodynamics reflect a TD learning process, but M1 also encodes a value function in line with TDRL. M1 responds to the delivery of an unpredictable reward, and shifts its value related response earlier in a trial, becoming predictive of an expected reward, when reward is predictable, such as when a CS acts as a cue predicting the upcoming reward. This is observed in tasks performed manually or observed passively, as well as in tasks with explicit CS predicting reward, or simply with a predictable temporal task structure, that is a predictable environment. M1 also encodes the expected reward value associated with a CS in a multiple reward level CS-US task. The Microstimulus TD model, reported to accurately capture RL related dopaminergic activity, extends to account for M1 reward related neural activity in a multitude of tasks.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/257188v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective: Previous findings suggest that differences in brain expression of a human-specific long intergenic non-coding RNA (LINC01268; GRCh37/hg19: LOC285758) may be linked to aggressive behavior and suicide. The authors sought to replicate and extend these findings in a new sample, and translate the results to the behavioral level in living healthy subjects. Method: The authors examined RNA sequencing data in human brain to confirm the prior postmortem association of the lincRNA specifically with suicide by violent means. In addition, they used a genetic variant associated with LINC01268 expression to detect association with in vivo prefrontal physiology related to behavioral control. They finally performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and gene-ontology analysis to identify biological processes associated with a LINC01268 co-expression network. Results: In the replication sample, prefrontal expression of LINC01268 was again higher in suicides by violent means (N=65) than both non-suicides (N=78; 1.29e-06) and suicides by non-violent means (N=46; p=1.4e-06). In a living cohort, carriers of the minor allele of a SNP associated with increased LINC01268 expression in brain scored higher on a lifetime aggression questionnaire and show diminished engagement of prefrontal cortex (BA10) when viewing angry faces during fMRI. WGCNA highlighted the immune response. Conclusions: These results suggest that LINC01268 influences emotional regulation, aggressive behavior and suicide by violent means; the underlying biological dynamics may include modulation of genes potentially engaged in the immune response.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/257170v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The schizophrenia and bipolar disorder associated gene, BRD1, encodes a scaffold protein that in complex with epigenetic modifiers regulate gene sets enriched for psychiatric disorder risk. Preclinical evidence from male Brd1+/- mice has previously implicated BRD1 with phenotypes of translational relevance to schizophrenia. Here we describe the phenotype of female Brd1+/- mice and report attenuated dendritic architecture and monoaminergic dysregulation accompanied by sex-specific changes in affective behaviors. In accordance, global gene expression profiling reveals regional dysregulation of gene sets enriched with major depressive disorder and schizophrenia risk in female and male Brd1+/- mice, respectively. Independent of sex, however, differentially expressed genes cluster in common functional pathways associated with psychiatric disorders, including mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative phosphorylation as well as G-protein coupled-, and nuclear receptor mediated signaling. Accordingly, we provide in vitro evidence that BRD1 modulates the transcriptional drive of a subset of nuclear receptors (e.g. the vitamin D and glucocorticoid receptors). Moreover, we demonstrate enrichment of psychiatric disorder risk in the target genes of nuclear receptors, sex-biased expression of several nuclear receptor genes in the adult brain of Brd1+/- mice, and that sex-biased genes in general are enriched with nuclear receptor genes particularly at the earliest developmental stage of the human brain. Overall, our data suggests that the spatio-temporal interaction between BRD1 and subsets of nuclear receptors in the brain is sex-biased and that hampered BRD1 mediated regulation of target genes governed by certain nuclear receptors may significantly contribute to sex differences in psychopathology.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Human obesity can result from the aberrant production or processing of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) in hypothalamic neurons, but it is unclear which human POMC-derived peptides are most relevant to body weight regulation. To address this question, we analysed both hypothalamic neurons derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and primary human hypothalamic tissue using quantitative liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS). In both in vitro- and in vivo-derived samples, we found that POMC was processed into {beta}-melanocyte stimulating hormone ({beta}-MSH), whose existence in the human brain has been controversial. {beta}-MSH and desacetyl -MSH (d--MSH) were produced at roughly equimolar concentrations and in vast excess to acetylated -MSH (5-to 200-fold), suggesting that the importance of both d--MSH and {beta}-MSH to human obesity has been underestimated. Since body weight is sensitive to changes in MSH concentration, we asked whether hPSC-derived hypothalamic neurons could provide mechanistic insights into the processing and secretion of MSH peptides. We found that cultured human hypothalamic neurons appropriately trafficked POMC and its derivatives, and robustly (P&amp;lt;0.0001) secreted them when depolarised. Furthermore, the adipocyte-derived hormone leptin significantly (P&amp;lt;0.01) promoted their production of both d--MSH and {beta}-MSH. These results establish hPSC-derived hypothalamic neurons as a model system for studying human-specific aspects of POMC processing that might be therapeutically harnessed to treat obesity.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/256933v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Advanced brain imaging techniques make it possible to measure individuals' structural connectomes in large cohort studies non-invasively. However, due to limitations in image resolution and pre-processing, questions remain about whether reconstructed connectomes are measured accurately enough to detect relationships with human traits and behaviors. Using a state-of-the-art structural connectome processing pipeline and a novel dimensionality reduction technique applied to data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we show strong relationships between connectome structure and various human traits. Our dimensionality reduction approach uses a tensor characterization of the connectomes and relies on a generalization of principal components analysis. We analyze over 1100 scans for 1076 subjects from the HCP and the Sherbrooke test-retest data set as well as 175 human traits that measure domains including cognition, substance use, motor, sensory and emotion. We find that brain connectomes are associated with many traits. Specifically, fluid intelligence, language comprehension, and motor skills are associated with increased cortical-cortical brain connectivity, while the use of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana are associated with decreased cortical-cortical connectivity.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/254904v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Low-dose ketamine is an efficacious antidepressant for treatment-resistant unipolar and bipolar depressed patients. Major Depression Disorder patients receiving a single infusion report elevated mood within two hours, and ketamine's antidepressant effects have been observed as long as seven days post-treatment. In light of this remarkable observation, efforts have been undertaken to &quot;reverse-translate&quot; ketamine's effects to understand its mechanism of action. Major advances have been achieved in understanding the molecular, cellular, and circuit level changes that are initiated by low-dose ketamine. Although enhancement of protein synthesis clearly plays a role, the field lacks a comprehensive understanding of the protein synthesis program initiated after ketamine treatment. Here, using ribosome-bound mRNA footprinting and deep sequencing (RiboSeq), we uncover a genome-wide set of actively translated mRNAs (the translatome) in medial prefrontal cortex after an acute antidepressant-like dose of ketamine. Gene Ontology analysis confirmed that initiation of protein synthesis is a defining feature of antidepressant-dose ketamine in mice and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis points to a role for GPCR signaling, metabolism, vascularization, and structural plasticity in ketamine's effects. One gene, VIPR2, whose protein product VPAC2 acts as a GPCR for the neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide, was characterized in cortex and identified as a potential novel target for antidepressant action.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Yonathan Murin, Jeremy Kim, Josef Parvizi, Andrea Goldsmith&lt;/p&gt;

Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders affecting about 1% of the world population. For patients with focal seizures that cannot be treated with antiepileptic drugs, the common treatment is a surgical procedure for removal of the seizure onset zone (SOZ). In this work we introduce an algorithm for automatic localization of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) in epileptic patients based on electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings. The proposed algorithm builds upon the hypothesis that the abnormal excessive (or synchronous) neuronal activity in the brain leading to seizures &lt;i&gt;starts in the SOZ&lt;/i&gt; and then &lt;i&gt;spreads&lt;/i&gt; to other areas in the brain. Thus, when this abnormal activity starts, signals recorded at electrodes close to the SOZ should have a relatively large &lt;i&gt;causal influence&lt;/i&gt; on the rest of the recorded signals. The SOZ localization is executed in two steps. First, the algorithm represents the set of electrodes using a directed graph in which nodes correspond to recording electrodes and the edges’ weights quantify the &lt;i&gt;pair-wise&lt;/i&gt; causal influence between the recorded signals. Then, the algorithm infers the SOZ from the estimated graph using a variant of the &lt;i&gt;PageRank&lt;/i&gt; algorithm followed by a novel post-processing phase. Inference results for 19 patients show a close match between the SOZ inferred by the proposed approach and the SOZ estimated by expert neurologists (success rate of 17 out of 19).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jWjec7d9uT0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Francesco Alessandro Massucci, Francesc Sagués, M. Ángeles Serrano&lt;/p&gt;

The most frequent form of pairwise synthetic lethality (SL) in metabolic networks is known as plasticity synthetic lethality. It occurs when the simultaneous inhibition of paired functional and silent metabolic reactions or genes is lethal, while the default of the functional partner is backed up by the activation of the silent one. Using computational techniques on bacterial genome-scale metabolic reconstructions, we found that the failure of the functional partner triggers a critical reorganization of fluxes to ensure viability in the mutant which not only affects the SL pair but a significant fraction of other interconnected reactions, forming what we call a SL cluster. Interestingly, SL clusters show a strong entanglement both in terms of reactions and genes. This strong overlap mitigates the acquired vulnerabilities and increased structural and functional costs that pay for the robustness provided by essential plasticity. Finally, the participation of coessential reactions and genes in different SL clusters is very heterogeneous and those at the intersection of many SL clusters could serve as supertargets for more efficient drug action in the treatment of complex diseases and to elucidate improved strategies directed to reduce undesired resistance to chemicals in pathogens.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RgV2wA7v53Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Proximity ligation assay (PLA) is a powerful tool for quantitative detection of protein biomarkers in biological fluids and tissues. Here, we present the circular proximity ligation assay (c-PLA), a highly specific protein detection method that outperforms traditional PLA in stringency, ease of use, and compatibility with low-affinity reagents. In c-PLA,...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/gMON3KBxqdg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: In Praise of Artifice Reloaded: Caution with subjective image quality databases. (arXiv:1801.09632v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09632</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Subjective image quality databases are a major source of raw data on how the
visual system works in naturalistic environments. These databases describe the
sensitivity of many observers to a wide range of distortions (of different
nature and with different suprathreshold intensities) seen on top of a variety
of natural images. They seem like a dream for the vision scientist to check the
models in realistic scenarios.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, while these natural databases are great benchmarks for models
developed in some other way (e.g. by using the well-controlled artificial
stimuli of traditional psychophysics), they should be carefully used when
trying to fit vision models. Given the high dimensionality of the image space,
it is very likely that some basic phenomenon (e.g. sensitivity to distortions
in certain environments) are under-represented in the database. Therefore, a
model fitted on these large-scale natural databases will not reproduce these
under-represented basic phenomena that could otherwise be easily illustrated
with well selected artificial stimuli.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work we study a specific example of the above statement. A
wavelet+divisive normalization layer of a sensible cascade of linear+nonlinear
layers fitted to maximize the correlation with subjective opinion of observers
on a large image quality database fails to reproduce basic crossmasking. Here
we outline a solution for this problem using artificial stimuli. Then, we show
that the resulting model is also a competitive solution for the large-scale
database. In line with Rust and Movshon (2005), our report (misrepresentation
of basic visual phenomena in subjectively-rated natural image databases) is an
additional argument in praise of artifice.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Coactivated Clique Based Multisource Overlapping Brain Subnetwork Extraction. (arXiv:1801.09589v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09589</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Subnetwork extraction using community detection methods is commonly used to
study the brain's modular structure. Recent studies indicated that certain
brain regions are known to interact with multiple subnetworks. However, most
existing methods are mainly for non-overlapping subnetwork extraction. In this
paper, we present an approach for overlapping brain subnetwork extraction using
cliques, which we defined as co-activated node groups performing multiple
tasks. We proposed a multisource subnetwork extraction approach based on the
co-activated clique, which (1) uses task co-activation and task connectivity
strength information for clique identification, (2) automatically detects
cliques of different sizes having more neuroscientific justifications, and (3)
shares the subnetwork membership, derived from a fusion of rest and task data,
among the nodes within a clique for overlapping subnetwork extraction. On real
data, compared to the commonly used overlapping community detection techniques,
we showed that our approach improved subnetwork extraction in terms of
group-level and subject-wise reproducibility. We also showed that our
multisource approach identified subnetwork overlaps within brain regions that
matched well with hubs defined using functional and anatomical information,
which enables us to study the interactions between the subnetworks and how hubs
play their role in information flow across different subnetworks. We further
demonstrated that the assignments of interacting/individual nodes using our
approach correspond with the posterior probability derived independently from
our multimodal random walker based approach.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Olfactory receptor usage is highly non-uniform, with some receptor types
being orders of magnitude more abundant than others. Intriguingly, in mammals
the receptors are replaced regularly and the receptor distribution changes in
response to olfactory experience. We propose a theoretical model that explains
these experimental observations. Our model suggests that the receptor
distribution is tuned to maximize the amount of information about the olfactory
environment, in accordance with the efficient coding hypothesis. The optimal
receptor distribution depends on natural odor statistics, implying that a
change in environment should lead to changes in receptor abundances. The effect
is more pronounced when olfactory receptors respond strongly to a smaller
number of odors. Our model also predicts that, between closely-related species,
those with more neurons in the olfactory epithelium should express more
receptor types. We show that simple dynamical rules for neural birth and death
processes converge to the predicted optimum.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09257</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Entropy is a classical measure to quantify the amount of information or
complexity of a system. Various entropy-based measures such as functional and
spectral entropy have been proposed in brain network analysis. However, they
are less widely used than traditional graph theoretic measures such as global
and local efficiencies because they are not well-defined on a graph or
difficult to interpret its biological meaning. In this paper, we propose a new
entropy-based graph invariant, called volume entropy. It measures the
exponential growth rate of the number of graph paths, based on the assumption
that information flows through a graph forever. We model the information
propagation on a brain graph by the generalized Markov system associated to a
new edge transition matrix. The volume entropy is estimated by the stationary
equation of the generalized Markov system. Moreover, its stationary
distribution shows the information capacity of edge and the direction of
information flow on a brain graph. The simulation results show that the volume
entropy distinguishes the underlying graph topology and geometry better than
the existing graph measures. In the clinical application, the volume entropy of
brain graphs was significantly related to healthy normal aging from 20s to 60s.
In addition, the stationary distribution of information propagation gives a new
insight into the information flow of functional brain graph.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09165</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic and disabling
neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by insufficient top-down modulation of
the amygdala activity by the prefrontal cortex. Real-time fMRI neurofeedback
(rtfMRI-nf) is an emerging method with potential for modifying the
amygdala-prefrontal interactions. We report the first controlled emotion
self-regulation study in veterans with combat-related PTSD utilizing rtfMRI-nf
of the amygdala activity. PTSD patients in the experimental group (EG, n=20)
learned to upregulate BOLD activity of the left amygdala (LA) using rtfMRI-nf
during a happy emotion induction task. PTSD patients in the control group (CG,
n=11) were provided with a sham rtfMRI-nf. The study included three rtfMRI-nf
training sessions, and EEG recordings were performed simultaneously with fMRI.
PTSD severity was assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS).
The EG participants showed a significant reduction in total CAPS ratings,
including significant reductions in avoidance and hyperarousal symptoms.
Overall, 80% of the EG participants demonstrated clinically meaningful
reductions in CAPS ratings, compared to 38% in the CG. During the first
session, fMRI connectivity of the LA with the orbitofrontal cortex and the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was progressively enhanced, and this
enhancement significantly and positively correlated with initial CAPS ratings.
Left-lateralized enhancement in upper alpha EEG coherence also exhibited a
significant positive correlation with initial CAPS ratings. Reduction in PTSD
severity between the first and last rtfMRI-nf sessions significantly correlated
with enhancement in functional connectivity between the LA and the left DLPFC.
Our results demonstrate that the rtfMRI-nf of the amygdala activity has the
potential to correct the amygdala-prefrontal functional connectivity
deficiencies specific to PTSD.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.08950</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Seizure and synchronization are related to each other in complex manner.
Altered synchrony has been implicated in loss of consciousness during partial
seizures. However, the mechanism of altered consciousness following termination
of seizures has not been studied well. In this work we used bivariate mutual
information as a measure of synchronization to understand the neural correlate
of altered consciousness during and after termination of mesial temporal lobe
onset seizures. First, we have compared discrete bivariate mutual information
(MI) measure with amplitude correlation (AC), phase synchronization (PS),
nonlinear correlation and coherence, and established MI as a robust measure of
synchronization. Next, we have extended MI to more than two signals by
principal component method. The extended MI was applied on intracranial
electroencephalogram (iEEG) before, during and after 23 temporal lobe seizures
recorded from 11 patients. The analyses were carried out in delta, theta,
alpha, beta and gamma bands. In 77% of the complex partial seizures MI was
higher towards the seizure offset than in the first half of the seizure in the
seizure onset zone (SOZ) channels in beta and gamma bands, whereas MI remained
higher in the beginning or in the middle of the seizure than towards the offset
across the least involved channels in the same bands. Synchronization seems
built up outside the SOZ, gradually spread and culminated in SOZ and remained
high beyond offset leading to impaired consciousness in 82% of the complex
partial temporal lobe seizures. Consciousness impairment was scored according
to a method previously applied to assess the same in patients with temporal

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08606</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While modern imaging technologies such as fMRI have opened exciting new
possibilities for studying the brain in vivo, histological sections remain the
best way to study the anatomy of the brain at the level of single neurons. The
histological atlas changed little since 1909 and localizing brain regions is a
still a labor intensive process performed only by experienced neuro-anatomists.
Existing digital atlases such as the Allen Brain atlas are limited to low
resolution images which cannot identify the detailed structure of the neurons.
We have developed a digital atlas methodology that combines information about
the 3D organization of the brain and the detailed texture of neurons in
different structures. Using the methodology we developed an atlas for the mouse
brainstem and mid-brain, two regions for which there are currently no good
atlases. Our atlas is &quot;active&quot; in that it can be used to automatically align a
histological stack to the atlas, thus reducing the work of the neuroanatomist.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Inhibition of Hsp70 suppresses neuronal hyperexcitability and attenuates seizures by enhancing A-type potassium currents</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/256602v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is upregulated in response to stress and has been implicated as a stress marker in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). However, whether Hsp70 plays a pathologic or protective role in TLE remains unclear. Here we report that Hsp70 exerts an unexpected deleterious role in kainic acid (KA)-induced seizures, and inhibition of Hsp70 suppresses neuronal hyperexcitability and attenuates both acute and chronic seizures via enhancing A-type potassium currents primarily formed by Kv4 -subunits and auxiliary KChIPs. Proteosomal degradation of Kv4-KChIP4a channel complexes is enhanced by Hsp70, which can be reversed by the Hsp70 inhibitors, 2-phenylethynesulfonamide (PES) and VER-155008 (VER). In cultured hippocampal neurons, either PES or VER can increase A-type Kv4 current to suppress neuronal hyperexcitability. Mechanistically, Hsp70-CHIP complexes directly bind to the N-terminus of auxiliary KChIP4a and target Kv4-KChIP4a complexes to the proteasome. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized role of Hsp70 in mediating degradation of Kv4-KChIP4a complexes and regulating neuronal excitability, thus highlighting a therapeutic potential for hyperexcitability-related neurological disorders through Hsp70 inhibition.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/256347v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Neural systems control purposeful movements both within the body of an animal (e.g., pumping blood) and in the environment (e.g., reaching). This is vital for all animals. The movement control functions of globus pallidus (GP), subthalamic nucleus (STN) and zona incerta (ZI) were analyzed in monkeys reaching for seen targets. Temporal profiles of their hand movements and the synchronized pattern of neuropower (rate of flow of electrochemical energy) through the basal ganglia were analyzed in terms of general tau theory of movement control (Lee et al., 2009), using the variable rho (=1/tau). The results suggest: (i) the neuroinformation for controlling movement is the relative-rate-of-change, rho, of neuropower in the nervous system; (ii) GP is involved in creating prescriptive rhos of neuropower to guide movements; (iii) STN is involved in registering perceptual rhos of neuropower to monitor the movement; (iv) ZI is involved in combining the prescriptive and perceptual rhos of neuropower to generate performatory rhos of neuropower to activate the muscles to produce the movement. Possible implications for Parkinsons disease are discussed.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/256081v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>OBJECTIVE: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is extensively used in basic and clinical neuroscience. Previous work has shown substantial residual variability in TMS effects even despite use of on-line visual feedback monitoring of coil position. Here, we aimed to evaluate if off-line modeling of coil position and orientation deviations can enhance detection of TMS effects. METHODS: Retrospective modeling was used to denoise the impact of common coil position and rotation deviations during TMS experimental sessions on motor evoked potentials (MEP) to single pulse TMS. RESULTS: Offline denoising led to a 26.19% improvement in the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of corticospinal excitability measurements. CONCLUSIONS: Offline modeling enhanced detection of TMS effects by removing variability introduced by coil deviations. SIGNIFICANCE: This approach could allow more accurate determination of TMS effects in cognitive and interventional neuroscience.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Analog Signalling with 'Digital' Molecular Switches</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/256032v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Molecular switches, such as the protein kinase CaMKII, play a fundamental role in cell signalling by decoding inputs into either high or low states of activity; because the high activation state can be turned on and persist after the input ceases, these switches have earned a reputation as digital. Although this binary perspective has been valuable for understanding synaptic plasticity over long timescales, accumulating experimental evidence suggests that molecular switches also control cellular processing on short timescales. To investigate this idea further, a non-autonomous, nonlinear ordinary differential equation, representative of a bistable molecular switch, is analyzed. The existence and uniqueness of model solutions to arbitrary input is proved for both the high and low states of activity. These results suggest that sub-state switch activity is an analog signal that tracks instantaneous input frequency, thereby increasing the capacity for information transfer to downstream cellular targets. Using simple dynamics based on the ubiquitous Hill equation, the model and theory make intriguing predictions about synaptic plasticity and suggest a multiplexed encoding of instantaneous frequency information over short timescales, with integration of total activity over long timescales, helping to reconcile contrasting perspectives presented in the literature.</content:encoded>

Our results provide clear evidence for hierarchical processing, and challenge influential neurocomputational accounts of learning.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/255935v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is essential for neuronal growth, differentiation, and synaptic plasticity. Although the release and effects of BDNF have been well-studied separately, the transfer of BDNF between cells has not been investigated. Using a four-fluorophore imaging approach to identify both the cell of origin and target cells, we quantified transfer of BDNF. Surprisingly, we found that astrocytes are the main recipient of neuronally expressed BDNF. We further found that astrocytes specifically take up mature (and not pro) BDNF released by neurons. Over-expression of TrkB in neurons redirects released BDNF from astrocytes to neurons, indicating that TrkB level determines neuronal versus astrocytic BDNF uptake. Increased neuronal activity further increased astrocytic (but not neuronal) uptake of neuronally expressed BDNF. Finally, we demonstrate that astrocytes are not simply a sink for excess BDNF, but that BDNF taken up by astrocytes mediates physiological effects on the astrocytic population by increasing astrocytic territory.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/255794v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>As a movement sequence is learned, serially ordered actions get bound together into sets in order to reduce computational complexity during planning and execution. Here we examined how the binding of serial actions alters the cortical representations of individual movements. Across five weeks of practice, healthy human subjects learned either a complex 32-item sequence of finger movements (Trained group, N=9) or randomly ordered actions (Control group, N=9). After five weeks of training, responses during sequence production in the Trained group were correlated, consistent with being bound together under a common command. These behavioral changes, however, did not coincide with plasticity in the multivariate representations of individual finger movements, assessed using fMRI, at any level of the cortical motor hierarchy. This suggests that the representations of individual actions remain stable, even as the execution of those same actions become bound together in the context of producing a well learned sequence.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/255653v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Understanding neuronal mechanisms of learned behaviors requires efficient behavioral assays. We designed a high-throughput automatic training system (HATS) for olfactory behaviors in head-fixed mice. The hardware and software were constructed to enable automatic training with minimal human intervention. The integrated system was composed of customized 3D-printing supporting components, an odor-delivery unit with fast response, Arduino based hardware-controlling and data-acquisition unit. Furthermore, the customized software was designed to enable automatic training in all training phases, including lick-teaching, shaping, and learning. Using HATS, we trained mice to perform delayed non-match to sample (DNMS), delayed paired association (DPA), Go/No-go (GNG), and GNG reversal tasks. These tasks probed cognitive functions including sensory discrimination, working memory, decision making, and cognitive flexibility. Mice reached stable levels of performance within several days in the tasks. HATS enabled an experimenter to train eight mice simultaneously, therefore greatly enhanced the experimental efficiency. Combined with causal perturbation and activity recording techniques, HATS can greatly facilitate our understanding of the neural-circuitry mechanisms underlying learned behaviors.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/255489v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>We investigated, in young healthy subjects, how the affective content of subliminally presented priming images and their specific visual attributes impacted conscious perception of facial expressions. The priming images were broadly categorised as aggressive, pleasant, or neutral and further subcategorised by the presence of a face and by the centricity (egocentric or allocentric vantage-point) of the image content. Subjects responded to the emotion portrayed in a pixelated target-face by indicating via key-press if the expression was angry or neutral. Priming images containing a face compared to those not containing a face significantly impaired performance on neutral or angry target-face evaluation. Recognition of angry target-face expressions was selectively impaired by pleasant prime images which contained a face. For egocentric primes, recognition of neutral target-face expressions was significantly better than of angry expressions. Our results suggest that, first, the affective primacy hypothesis which predicts that affective information can be accessed automatically, preceding conscious cognition, holds true in subliminal priming only when the priming image contains a face. Second, egocentric primes interfere with the perception of angry target-face expressions suggesting that this vantage-point, directly relevant to the viewer, perhaps engages processes involved in action preparation which may weaken the priority of affect processing.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/255455v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Cocaine self-administration causes dephosphorylation of proteins in prelimbic (PL) cortex that mediate excitation-transcription coupling, suggesting that cocaine causes decreased activity in PL neurons. Thus, we used in vivo single-unit extracellular recordings in awake, behaving rats to measure activity in PL neurons before, during, and after cocaine self-administration on the first and last session day (range 12-14 days). On the last day, cocaine suppressed 52% of recorded neurons in the PL cortex when compared to a 20 min baseline, significantly more than the 23% of neurons suppressed on the first day of cocaine. There was no change in the percentage of neurons that were excited on the first vs. the last day of self-administration (14% vs. 13%, respectively). To determine whether the tonic inhibitory shift was induced by the behavior or by the drug itself, rats received a final session in which cocaine availability was delayed for the first 30 min or in which cocaine was administered non-contingently in the absence of levers or cues in a subset of rats. These manipulations indicated that cocaine was both necessary and sufficient to induce a downshift in PL neuronal activity. However, this activity decrease was not observed in rats that received only non-contingent cocaine for 12-14 days, indicating that contingency during self-administration training contributes to the cocaine-induced tonic downshift in PL activity. These data suggest that the session-by-session decrease in PL neuronal activity induced by cocaine is a reflection of learned drug-seeking behavior and, hence, reducing this inhibition may lessen cocaine addiction.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/255406v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Creating a stable perception of the world during pursuit eye movements is one of the everyday roles of visual system. Some motion regions have been shown to differentiate between motion in the external world from that generated by eye movements. However, in most circumstances, perceptual stability is consistently related to content: the surrounding scene is typically stable. However, no prior study has examined to which extent motion responsive regions are modulated by scene content, and whether there is an interaction between content and motion response. In the present study we used a factorial design that has previously been shown to reveal regional involvement in integrating efference copies of eye-movements with retinal motion to mediate perceptual stability and encode real-world motion. We then added scene content as a third factor, which allowed us to examine to which extent real-motion, retinal motion, and static responses were modulated by meaningful scenes versus their Fourier scrambled counterpart. We found that motion responses in human motion responsive regions V3A, V6, V5+/MT+ and cingulate sulcus visual area (CSv) were all modulated by scene content. Depending on the region, these motion-content interactions differentially depended on whether motion was self-induced or not. V3A was the only motion responsive region that also showed responses to still scenes. Our results suggest that contrary to the two-pathway hypothesis, scene responses are not isolated to ventral regions, but also can be found in dorsal areas.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/255323v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Sensory abnormalities and sleep disturbances are highly prevalent in children with autism, but the potential relationship between these two domains has rarely been explored. Understanding such relationships is important for identifying children with autism who exhibit more homogeneous symptoms. Methods: Here we examined this relationship using the Caregiver Sensory Profile and the children's sleep habit questionnaires, which were completed by parents of 69 children with autism and 62 frequency age-matched controls. Results: In line with previous studies, children with autism exhibited more severe sensory abnormalities and sleep disturbances than age-matched controls. The sleep disturbance scores were strongly associated with touch and oral sensitivities in the autism group and with touch and vestibular sensitivities in the control group. Hyper sensitivity towards touch, in particular, exhibited the strongest relationship with sleep disturbances in the autism group and single-handedly explained 24% of the variance in sleep disturbance scores. In contrast, sensitivity in other sensory domains such as vision and audition was not associated with sleep quality in either group. Conclusions: While it is often assumed that sensitivities in all sensory domains are similarly associated with sleep problems, our results suggest that hyper sensitivity towards touch exhibits the strongest relationship to sleep disturbances when examining children autism. We speculate that hyper sensitivity towards touch interferes with sleep onset and maintenance in a considerable number of children with autism who exhibit severe sleep disturbances. Studies that examine the effects of tactile sensory therapies/aids on sleep quality and behavioral improvement in these children are, therefore, highly warranted.</content:encoded>

Reactome is a free, open-source, open-data, curated and peer-reviewed knowledgebase of biomolecular pathways. One of its main priorities is to provide easy and efficient access to its high quality curated data. At present, biological pathway databases typically store their contents in relational databases. This limits access efficiency because there are performance issues associated with queries traversing highly interconnected data. The same data in a graph database can be queried more efficiently. Here we present the rationale behind the adoption of a graph database (Neo4j) as well as the new ContentService (REST API) that provides access to these data. The Neo4j graph database and its query language, Cypher, provide efficient access to the complex Reactome data model, facilitating easy traversal and knowledge discovery. The adoption of this technology greatly improved query efficiency, reducing the average query time by 93%. The web service built on top of the graph database provides programmatic access to Reactome data by object oriented queries, but also supports more complex queries that take advantage of the new underlying graph-based data storage. By adopting graph database technology we are providing a high performance pathway data resource to the community. The Reactome graph database use case shows the power of NoSQL database engines for complex biological data types.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7RLEkfWxsdM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The extent of ribosome queuing in budding yeast</title>

Ribosome queuing is a fundamental phenomenon suggested to be related to topics such as genome evolution, synthetic biology, gene expression regulation, intracellular biophysics, and more. However, this phenomenon hasn't been quantified yet at a genomic level. Nevertheless, methodologies for studying translation (e.g. ribosome footprints) are usually calibrated to capture only single ribosome protected footprints (mRPFs) and thus limited in their ability to detect ribosome queuing. On the other hand, most of the models in the field assume and analyze a certain level of queuing. Here we present an experimental-computational approach for studying ribosome queuing based on sequencing of RNA footprints extracted from pairs of ribosomes (dRPFs) using a modified ribosome profiling protocol. We combine our approach with traditional ribosome profiling to generate a detailed profile of ribosome traffic. The data are analyzed using computational models of translation dynamics. The approach was implemented on the &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; transcriptome. Our data shows that ribosome queuing is more frequent than previously thought: the measured ratio of ribosomes within dRPFs to mRPFs is 0.2–0.35, suggesting that at least one to five translating ribosomes is in a traffic jam; these queued ribosomes cannot be captured by traditional methods. We found that specific regions are enriched with queued ribosomes, such as the 5’-end of ORFs, and regions upstream to mRPF peaks, among others. While queuing is related to higher density of ribosomes on the transcript (characteristic of highly translated genes), we report cases where traffic jams are relatively more severe in lowly expressed genes and possibly even selected for. In addition, our analysis demonstrates that higher adaptation of the coding region to the intracellular tRNA levels and longer genes are associated with lower queuing levels. Our analysis also suggests that the &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; transcriptome undergoes selection for eliminating traffic jams. Thus, our proposed approach is an essential tool for high resolution analysis of ribosome traffic during mRNA translation and understanding its evolution.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EGKWmrKeD6Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The ecto-5’-nucleotidase CD73 plays an important role in the production of immune-suppressive adenosine in tumor micro-environment, and has become a validated drug target in oncology. Indeed, the anticancer immune response involves extracellular ATP to block cell proliferation through T-cell activation. However, in the tumor micro-environment, two extracellular membrane-bound enzymes (CD39 and CD73) are overexpressed and hydrolyze efficiently ATP into AMP then further into immune-suppressive adenosine. To circumvent the impact of CD73-generated adenosine, we applied an original bioinformatics approach to identify new allosteric inhibitors targeting the dimerization interface of CD73, which should impair the large dynamic motions required for its enzymatic function. Several hit compounds issued from virtual screening campaigns showed a potent inhibition of recombinant CD73 with inhibition constants in the low micromolar range and exhibited a non-competitive inhibition mode. The structure-activity relationships studies indicated that several amino acid residues (D366, H456, K471, Y484 and E543 for polar interactions and G453-454, I455, H456, L475, V542 and G544 for hydrophobic contacts) located at the dimerization interface are involved in the tight binding of hit compounds and likely contributed for their inhibitory activity. Overall, the gathered information will guide the upcoming lead optimization phase that may lead to potent and selective CD73 inhibitors, able to restore the anticancer immune response.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MmJFMNHwHpM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Biophysical network modeling of the dLGN circuit: Effects of cortical feedback on spatial response properties of relay cells</title>

Despite half-a-century of research since the seminal work of Hubel and Wiesel, the role of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) in shaping the visual signals is not properly understood. Placed on route from retina to primary visual cortex in the early visual pathway, a striking feature of the dLGN circuit is that both the relay cells (RCs) and interneurons (INs) not only receive feedforward input from retinal ganglion cells, but also a prominent feedback from cells in layer 6 of visual cortex. This feedback has been proposed to affect synchronicity and other temporal properties of the RC firing. It has also been seen to affect spatial properties such as the center-surround antagonism of thalamic receptive fields, i.e., the suppression of the response to very large stimuli compared to smaller, more optimal stimuli. Here we explore the spatial effects of cortical feedback on the RC response by means of a a comprehensive network model with biophysically detailed, single-compartment and multicompartment neuron models of RCs, INs and a population of orientation-selective layer 6 simple cells, consisting of pyramidal cells (PY). We have considered two different arrangements of synaptic feedback from the ON and OFF zones in the visual cortex to the dLGN: phase-reversed (‘push-pull’) and phase-matched (‘push-push’), as well as different spatial extents of the corticothalamic projection pattern. Our simulation results support that a phase-reversed arrangement provides a more effective way for cortical feedback to provide the increased center-surround antagonism seen in experiments both for flashing spots and, even more prominently, for patch gratings. This implies that ON-center RCs receive direct excitation from OFF-dominated cortical cells and indirect inhibitory feedback from ON-dominated cortical cells. The increased center-surround antagonism in the model is accompanied by spatial focusing, i.e., the maximum RC response occurs for smaller stimuli when feedback is present.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2Ye3WzHcxNo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive control researchers aim to describe the processes that support
adaptive cognition to achieve specific goals. Control theorists consider how to
influence the state of systems to reach certain user-defined goals. In brain
networks, some conceptual and lexical similarities between cognitive control
and control theory offer appealing avenues for scientific discovery. However,
these opportunities also come with the risk of conceptual confusion. Here, I
suggest that each field of inquiry continues to produce novel and distinct
insights. Then, I describe opportunities for synergistic research at the
intersection of these subdisciplines with a critical stance that reduces the
risk of conceptual confusion. Through this exercise, we can observe that both
cognitive neuroscience and systems engineering have much to contribute to
cognitive control research in human brain networks.

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The architecture of neocortical projection neurons is subject of a complex gene control. Here we demonstrated that &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Foxg1&lt;/span&gt;, a transcription factor gene which patterns the early rostral brain and sets the pace of telencephalic neuronogenesis, specifically stimulates dendrite elongation. This phenomenon occurs in vivo like in vitro, and it is detectable even upon moderate changes of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Foxg1&lt;/span&gt; expression levels. We found that &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Foxg1&lt;/span&gt; acts by stimulating &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Hes1&lt;/span&gt;, which in turn upregulates pCreb1, a well-known pro-dendritogenic effector, and downregulates &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Syt&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Ndr1&lt;/span&gt;, namely two established antagonizers of dendrite elongation. Moreover, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Foxg1&lt;/span&gt;-driven pCreb1 upregulation requires PKA and AKT, and correlates with reduced PP1 and PP2A phosphatase activity. These findings contribute to clarify normal neurodevelopmental and activity-related regulation of neuritogenesis. They further suggest that an abnormal sizing of the dendritic tree of neocortical projection neurons may occur in West and Rett syndrome patients with anomalous &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;FOXG1&lt;/span&gt; allele dosages and contribute to their neurolopathological profiles.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: MUMmer4: A fast and versatile genome alignment system</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/ad66bIHbWNc/article</link>

The MUMmer system and the genome sequence aligner nucmer included within it are among the most widely used alignment packages in genomics. Since the last major release of MUMmer version 3 in 2004, it has been applied to many types of problems including aligning whole genome sequences, aligning reads to a reference genome, and comparing different assemblies of the same genome. Despite its broad utility, MUMmer3 has limitations that can make it difficult to use for large genomes and for the very large sequence data sets that are common today. In this paper we describe MUMmer4, a substantially improved version of MUMmer that addresses genome size constraints by changing the 32-bit suffix tree data structure at the core of MUMmer to a 48-bit suffix array, and that offers improved speed through parallel processing of input query sequences. With a theoretical limit on the input size of 141Tbp, MUMmer4 can now work with input sequences of any biologically realistic length. We show that as a result of these enhancements, the nucmer program in MUMmer4 is easily able to handle alignments of large genomes; we illustrate this with an alignment of the human and chimpanzee genomes, which allows us to compute that the two species are 98% identical across 96% of their length. With the enhancements described here, MUMmer4 can also be used to efficiently align reads to reference genomes, although it is less sensitive and accurate than the dedicated read aligners. The nucmer aligner in MUMmer4 can now be called from scripting languages such as Perl, Python and Ruby. These improvements make MUMer4 one the most versatile genome alignment packages available.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ad66bIHbWNc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.08366</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural mass models are ubiquitous in large scale brain modelling. At the node
level they are written in terms of a set of ODEs with a nonlinearity that is
typically a sigmoidal shape. Using structural data from brain atlases they may
be connected into a network to investigate the emergence of functional dynamic
states, such as synchrony. With the simple restriction of the classic sigmoidal
nonlinearity to a piecewise linear caricature we show that the famous
Wilson-Cowan neural mass model can be analysed at both the node and network
level. The construction of periodic orbits at the node level is achieved by
patching together matrix exponential solutions, and stability is determined
using Floquet theory. For networks with interactions described by circulant
matrices, we show that the stability of the synchronous state can be determined
in terms of a low-dimensional Floquet problem parameterised by the eigenvalues
of the interaction matrix. This network Floquet problem is readily solved using
linear algebra, to predict the onset of spatio-temporal network patterns
arising from a synchronous instability. We consider the case of a discontinuous
choice for the node nonlinearity, namely the replacement of the sigmoid by a
Heaviside nonlinearity. This gives rise to a continuous-time switching network.
At the node level this allows for the existence of unstable sliding periodic
orbits, which we construct. The stability of a periodic orbit is now treated
with a modification of Floquet theory to treat the evolution of small
perturbations through switching manifolds via saltation matrices. At the
network level the stability analysis of the synchronous state is considerably
more challenging. Here we report on the use of ideas originally developed for
the study of Glass networks to treat the stability of periodic network states
in neural mass models with discontinuous interactions.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The role of spatial heterogeneity in the evolution of local and global infections of viruses</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/QvuUxAMbOWQ/article</link>

Viruses have two modes spread in a host body, one is to release infectious particles from infected cells (global infection) and the other is to infect directly from an infected cell to an adjacent cell (local infection). Since the mode of spread affects the evolution of life history traits, such as virulence, it is important to reveal what level of global and local infection is selected. Previous studies of the evolution of global and local infection have paid little attention to its dependency on the measures of spatial configuration. Here we show the evolutionarily stable proportion of global and local infection, and how it depends on the distribution of target cells. Using an epidemic model on a regular lattice, we consider the infection dynamics by pair approximation and check the evolutionarily stable strategy. We also conduct the Monte-Carlo simulation to observe evolutionary dynamics. We show that a higher local infection is selected as target cells become clustered. Surprisingly, the selected strategy depends not only on the degree of clustering but also the abundance of target cells per se.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QvuUxAMbOWQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Gamma-glutamyl transferase predicts future stroke: a Korean nationwide study</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25158</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Although gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) is generally regarded as an alternative biomarker for alcohol consumption, its independent role in vascular diseases emerged recently. However, its role in stroke remains unknown. The aim of this study is to clarify the impact of GGT on stroke in a large-sized, national, standardized population cohort in Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: In Korea, the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) provides full-coverage health insurance service for all citizens. Using data from the NHIS, the NHIS-National Sample Cohort (NHIS-NSC) was designed by randomly selecting 2% of Koreans, carefully considering demographic characteristics. We analyzed eligible individuals from this standardized cohort. The Cox proportional hazards model was used for the longitudinal study investigating the relationship between GGT and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Among the 456,100 eligible participants, 7,459 patients (1.64%) developed stroke as follows: 5,789 ischemic strokes, 1,046 intracerebral hemorrhages (ICHs), and 624 subarachnoid hemorrhages. GGT was independently correlated with increased risk of stroke after adjustment for alcohol consumption and stroke risk factors (hazard ratio (HR), 1.39; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.29–1.51). The risks of both ischemic stroke (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.32–1.58) and ICH (HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.18–1.80) were significantly elevated with increasing GGT. Despite some effect modifications by sex, age and alcohol, the risk of total stroke and ischemic stroke in association with GGT remained significant in all subgroups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: In a standard Korean population, GGT was a novel biomarker predicting stroke risk, independently from alcohol consumption and other risk factors.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Pallidal deep brain stimulation modulates cortical excitability and plasticity</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25156</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Internal globus pallidus (GPi) deep brain stimulation (DBS) relieves symptoms in dystonia patients. However, the physiological effects produced by GPi DBS are not fully understood. In particular, how a single-pulse GPi DBS changes cortical circuits has never been investigated. We studied the modulation of motor cortical excitability and plasticity with single-pulse GPi DBS in dystonia patients with bilateral implantation of GPi DBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: The cortical evoked potentials from DBS were recorded with electroencephalography. Transcranial magnetic stimulation with a conditioning-test paired-pulse paradigm was used to investigate the effect of GPi DBS on the primary motor cortex. How GPi DBS might modulate the motor cortical plasticity was tested using a paired associative stimulation paradigm with repetitive pairs of GPi DBS and motor cortical stimulation at specific time intervals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: GPi stimulation produced two peaks of cortical evoked potentials with latencies of ∼10 and ∼25 ms in the motor cortical area. Cortical facilitation was observed at ∼10 ms after single-pulse GPi DBS and cortical inhibition was observed at ∼25 ms interval. Repetitive pairs of GPi stimulation with cortical stimulation at these two time intervals produced long term potentiation-like effects in the motor cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Single-pulse DBS modulates cortical excitability and plasticity at specific time intervals. These effects may be related to the mechanism of action of DBS. Combination of DBS with cortical stimulation at appropriate timing has therapeutic potential and could be explored in the future as a method to enhance the effects of neuromodulation for neurological and psychiatric diseases.

&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess the association between incident Parkinson's disease (PD) and subsequent incident epileptic seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conducted a retrospective cohort study with a nested case-control analysis using data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. We identified patients aged ≥40 years with an incident diagnosis of PD between 1995 and 2016 and a matched comparison group of PD-free individuals. We calculated crude incidence rates (IRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of epileptic seizures in PD patients and the PD-free comparison group, and corresponding crude incidence rate ratios (IRRs). In the nested case-control analysis, we calculated adjusted odds ratios (adj. ORs) of incident PD among cases with incident epileptic seizures and seizure-free controls overall and stratified by various, seizure-provoking comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among 23,086 incident PD patients and 92,343 PD-free individuals, we identified 898 patients with incident epileptic seizures. The crude IR of epileptic seizures in PD patients was 266.7/100,000 person years (95% CI 235.6-297.7), and in PD-free individuals 112.4/100,000 person years (95% CI 103.5-121.3) [IRR: 2.37, 95% CI 2.06-2.37]. The adj. OR of epileptic seizures was 1.68 [95% CI 1.43-1.98]) in PD patients compared with PD-free individuals. PD patients with comorbid brain disorders (adj. OR 12.36 [95% CI 8.74-17.48]) or with &amp;gt;1 seizure-provoking comorbidity (adj. OR 13.24 [95% CI 10.15-17.25]) were at the highest risk of epileptic seizures compared with PD-free individuals with no seizure-provoking comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study suggests that incident PD is associated with an increased risk of incident epileptic seizures. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Neutrophil hyperactivation correlates with Alzheimer's disease progression</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25159</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Recent studies have underlined the effect of systemic inflammation on the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. Neutrophils are key components of early innate immunity and contribute to uncontrolled systemic inflammation if not tightly regulated. The aim of our study was to fully characterize human circulating neutrophils at different disease stages in Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We analyzed neutrophil phenotypes and functions in forty-two patients with Alzheimer's disease (sixteen with mild cognitive impairment and twenty-six with dementia), and compared them with twenty-two age-matched healthy subjects. This study was performed directly in whole blood to avoid issues with data interpretation related to cell isolation procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Blood samples from Alzheimer's diseases patients with dementia revealed neutrophil hyperactivation associated with increased reactive oxygen species production and increased levels of intravascular neutrophil extravascular traps. The homeostasis of circulating neutrophils in these patients also changed: the ratio between the harmful hyperreactive CXCR4&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt;/CD62L&lt;sup&gt;low&lt;/sup&gt; senescent and the CD16&lt;sup&gt;bright&lt;/sup&gt;/CD62L&lt;sup&gt;dim&lt;/sup&gt; immunosuppressive neutrophil subsets rose in the later stage of the disease. These abnormalities were greater in fast-decliner than in slow-decliner patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Our results indicate that the inflammatory properties of circulating neutrophils shift as the percentage of aged neutrophils expands in patients with Alzheimer's disease — changes that may play an instrumental role in establishing systemic chronic inflammation. Most important, our data strongly suggest that the neutrophil phenotype may be associated with the rate of cognitive decline and may thus constitute an innovative and prognostic blood biomarker in patients with Alzheimer's disease.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Metallothioneins are Neuroprotective Agents in Lysosomal Storage Disorders</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25161</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Lysosomal Storage Disorders (LSDs) are a broad class of inherited metabolic diseases caused by the defective activity of lysosomal enzymes. Central nervous system (CNS) manifestations are present in roughly 50% of LSD patients and represent an unmet medical need for them. We explored the therapeutic potential of Metallothioneins (MTs), a newly identified family of proteins with reported neuroprotective roles, in the murine models of two LSDs with CNS involvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: MT-1 over-expressing transgenic mice (MTtg) were crossed with the murine models of Batten and Krabbe diseases. Changes in the survival and in the manifestations of the disease in the MTtg setting were assessed. In addition, we analyzed the therapeutic effects of MT-1 CNS gene delivery in one of these LSD models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Constitutive expression of MT-1 exerted favorable phenotypic effects in both LSD models. MT-LSD mice showed a 5-10% increase in survival and slower disease progression as compared to not-transgenic LSD mice. Rescue of Purkinje cells from degeneration and apoptosis was also observed in the MT- LSD models. This phenotypic amelioration was accompanied by a modulation of the disease-associated activated inflammatory microglia phenotype, and by a reduction of oxidative stress. Importantly for the clinical translation of our findings, the very same effects were obtained when MTs were delivered to the brains by systemic AAV gene transfer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: MTs can be considered novel therapeutic agents (and targets) in LSDs and potentiate the effects of approaches aiming at correction of the disease-causing enzyme deficiency in the CNS.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Expression profiling suggests microglial impairment in HIV neuropathogenesis</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25160</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: CD16&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CD163&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; macrophages (MΦ)s and microglia accumulate in the brains of patients with HIV encephalitis (HIVE), a neuropathological correlate of the most severe form of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), HIV-associated dementia (HIV-D). Recently, we found that some parenchymal microglia in brain of HIV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; subjects without encephalitis (HIV/noE) but with varying degrees of neurocognitive impairment express CD16 and CD163, even in the absence of detectable virus production. To further our understanding of microglial activation in HIV, we investigated expression of specific genes by profiling parenchymal microglia from archival brain tissue of patients with HIVE, HIV/noE, and HIV&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Single-population microarray analyses were performed on ∼2,500 laser capture microdissected CD163&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, CD16&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or CD68&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; MΦs/microglia per case, using terminal continuation (TC) RNA amplification and a custom-designed array platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Several classes of microglial transcripts in HIVE and HIV/noE, were altered, relative to HIV&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; subjects, including factors related to cell stress, immune activation, and apoptosis. Additionally, several neurotrophic factors are reduced in HIV infection, suggesting an additional mechanism of neuropathogenesis. The majority of transcripts altered in HIVE displayed intermediate changes in HIV/noE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Our results support the notion that microglia contribute to the maintenance of brain homeostasis and their potential loss of function in the context of chronic inflammation contributes to neuropathogenesis. Furthermore, they indicate the utility of profiling MΦs/microglia to increase our understanding of microglia function, as well as ascertain alterations in specific pathways, genes, and, ostensibly, encoded proteins that may be amenable to targeted treatment modalities in diseases affecting the brain.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Neuromodulation Influences Synchronization and Intrinsic Read-out. (arXiv:q-bio/0507037v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0507037</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The roles of neuromodulation in a neural network, such as in a cortical
microcolumn, are still incompletely understood. Neuromodulation influences
neural processing by presynaptic and postsynaptic regulation of synaptic
efficacy. Synaptic efficacy modulation can be an effective way to rapidly alter
network density and topology. We show that altering network topology, together
with density, will affect its synchronization. Fast synaptic efficacy
modulation may therefore influence the amount of correlated spiking in a
network. Neuromodulation also affects ion channel regulation for intrinsic
excitability, which alters the neuron's activation function. We show that
synchronization in a network influences the read-out of these intrinsic
properties. Highly synchronous input drives neurons, such that differences in
intrinsic properties disappear, while asynchronous input lets intrinsic
properties determine output behavior. Thus, altering network topology can alter
the balance between intrinsically vs. synaptically driven network activity. We
conclude that neuromodulation may allow a network to shift between a more
synchronized transmission mode and a more asynchronous intrinsic read-out mode.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.08116</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Psychlab is a simulated psychology laboratory inside the first-person 3D game
world of DeepMind Lab (Beattie et al. 2016). Psychlab enables implementations
of classical laboratory psychological experiments so that they work with both
human and artificial agents. Psychlab has a simple and flexible API that
enables users to easily create their own tasks. As examples, we are releasing
Psychlab implementations of several classical experimental paradigms including
visual search, change detection, random dot motion discrimination, and multiple
object tracking. We also contribute a study of the visual psychophysics of a
specific state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning agent: UNREAL (Jaderberg
et al. 2016). This study leads to the surprising conclusion that UNREAL learns
more quickly about larger target stimuli than it does about smaller stimuli. In
turn, this insight motivates a specific improvement in the form of a simple
model of foveal vision that turns out to significantly boost UNREAL's
performance, both on Psychlab tasks, and on standard DeepMind Lab tasks. By
open-sourcing Psychlab we hope to facilitate a range of future such studies
that simultaneously advance deep reinforcement learning and improve its links
with cognitive science.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A neural model of the locust visual system for detection of object approaches with real-world scenes. (arXiv:1801.08108v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.08108</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the central nervous systems of animals like pigeons and locusts, neurons
were identified which signal objects approaching the animal on a direct
collision course. Unraveling the neural circuitry for collision avoidance, and
identifying the underlying computational principles, is promising for building
vision-based neuromorphic architectures, which in the near future could find
applications in cars or planes. At the present there is no published model
available for robust detection of approaching objects under real-world
conditions. Here we present a computational architecture for signalling
impending collisions, based on known anatomical data of the locust \emph{lobula
giant movement detector} (LGMD) neuron. Our model shows robust performance even
in adverse situations, such as with approaching low-contrast objects, or with
highly textured and moving backgrounds. We furthermore discuss which components
need to be added to our model to convert it into a full-fledged
real-world-environment collision detector. KEYWORDS: Locust, LGMD, collision

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Fractal analyses of networks of integrate-and-fire stochastic spiking neurons. (arXiv:1801.08087v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.08087</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Although there is increasing evidence of criticality in the brain, the
processes that guide neuronal networks to reach or maintain criticality remain
unclear. The present research examines the role of neuronal gain plasticity in
time-series of simulated neuronal networks composed of integrate-and-fire
stochastic spiking neurons, and the utility of fractal methods in assessing
network criticality. Simulated time-series were derived from a network model of
fully connected discrete-time stochastic excitable neurons. Monofractal and
multifractal analyses were applied to neuronal gain time-series. Fractal
scaling was greatest in networks with a mid-range of neuronal plasticity,
versus extremely high or low levels of plasticity. Peak fractal scaling
corresponded closely to additional indices of criticality, including average
branching ratio. Networks exhibited multifractal structure, or multiple scaling
relationships. Multifractal spectra around peak criticality exhibited elongated
right tails, suggesting that the fractal structure is relatively insensitive to
high-amplitude local fluctuations. Networks near critical states exhibited
mid-range multifractal spectra width and tail length, which is consistent with
literature suggesting that networks poised at quasi-critical states must be
stable enough to maintain organization but unstable enough to be adaptable.
Lastly, fractal analyses may offer additional information about critical state
dynamics of networks by indicating scales of influence as networks approach
critical states.

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Extracellular recording studies have revealed diverse and selective neural responses in the primary auditory cortex (A1) of awake animals. However, we have limited knowledge on subthreshold events that give rise to these responses, especially in non-human primates, as intracellular recordings in awake animals pose substantial technical challenges. We developed a novel intracellular recording technique in awake marmosets to systematically study subthreshold activity of A1 neurons that underlies their diverse and selective spiking responses. Our findings showed that in contrast to predominantly transient depolarization observed in A1 of anesthetized animals, both transient and sustained depolarization (during or beyond the stimulus period) were observed. Comparing with spiking responses, subthreshold responses were often longer lasting in duration and more broadly tuned in frequency, and showed narrower intensity tuning in non-monotonic neurons and lower response threshold in monotonic neurons. These observations demonstrated the enhancement of stimulus selectivity from subthreshold to spiking responses in individual A1 neurons. Furthermore, A1 neurons classified as regular- or fast-spiking subpopulation based on their spike shapes exhibited distinct response properties in frequency and intensity domains. These findings provide valuable insights into cortical integration and transformation of auditory information at the cellular level in auditory cortex of awake non-human primates.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Previous studies have demonstrated that cortical thickness (CT) is under strong genetic control across the life span. However, little is known about genetic influences that cause changes in cortical thickness (Î”CT) during brain development. We obtained 482 longitudinal MRI scans at ages 9, 12, and 17 years from 215 twins and applied structural equation modeling to estimate genetic influences on (1) cortical thickness between regions and across time, and (2) changes in cortical thickness between ages. Although cortical thickness is largely mediated by the same genetic factor throughout late childhood and adolescence, we found evidence for influences of distinct genetic factors on regions across space and time. In addition, we found genetic influences for cortical thinning during adolescence that is mostly due to fluctuating influences from the same genetic factor, with evidence of local influences from a second emerging genetic factor. This fluctuating core genetic factor and emerging novel genetic factor might be implicated in the rapid cognitive and behavioral development during childhood and adolescence, and could potentially be targets for investigation into the manifestation of psychiatric disorders that have their origin in childhood and adolescence.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Quantifying the genetic architecture of the cerebral cortex is necessary for understanding disease and changes to the brain across the lifespan. Prior work shows that both surface area (SA) and cortical thickness (CT) are heritable. However, we do not yet understand the extent to which region-specific genetic factors (i.e., independent of global effects) play a dominant role in the regional patterning or inter-regional associations across the cortex. Using a population sample of young adult twins (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 923), we show that the heritability of SA and CT varies widely across regions, generally independent of measurement error. When global effects are controlled for, we detected a complex pattern of genetically mediated clusters of inter-regional associations, which varied between hemispheres. There were generally weak associations between the SA of different regions, except within the occipital lobe, whereas CT was positively correlated within lobar divisions and negatively correlated across lobes, mostly due to genetic covariation. These findings were replicated in an independent sample of twins and siblings (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 698) from the Human Connectome Project.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Predicting peak spectral sensitivities of vertebrate cone visual pigments using atomistic molecular simulations</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/zs0zKBCg8z8/article</link>

Vision is the dominant sensory modality in many organisms for foraging, predator avoidance, and social behaviors including mate selection. Vertebrate visual perception is initiated when light strikes rod and cone photoreceptors within the neural retina of the eye. Sensitivity to individual colors, i.e., peak spectral sensitivities (λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) of visual pigments, are a function of the type of chromophore and the amino acid sequence of the associated opsin protein in the photoreceptors. Large differences in peak spectral sensitivities can result from minor differences in amino acid sequence of cone opsins. To determine how minor sequence differences could result in large spectral shifts we selected a spectrally-diverse group of 14 teleost Rh2 cone opsins for which sequences and λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; are experimentally known. Classical molecular dynamics simulations were carried out after embedding chromophore-associated homology structures within explicit bilayers and water. These simulations revealed structural features of visual pigments, particularly within the chromophore, that contributed to diverged spectral sensitivities. Statistical tests performed on all the observed structural parameters associated with the chromophore revealed that a two-term, first-order regression model was sufficient to accurately predict λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; over a range of 452–528 nm. The approach was accurate, efficient and simple in that site-by-site molecular modifications or complex quantum mechanics models were not required to predict λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;. These studies identify structural features associated with the chromophore that may explain diverged spectral sensitivities, and provide a platform for future, functionally predictive opsin modeling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zs0zKBCg8z8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Membraneless organelles important to intracellular compartmentalization have recently been shown to comprise assemblies of proteins which undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). However, many proteins involved in this phase separation are at least partially disordered. The molecular mechanism and the sequence determinants of this process are challenging to determine experimentally owing to the disordered nature of the assemblies, motivating the use of theoretical and simulation methods. This work advances a computational framework for conducting simulations of LLPS with residue-level detail, and allows for the determination of phase diagrams and coexistence densities of proteins in the two phases. The model includes a short-range contact potential as well as a simplified treatment of electrostatic energy. Interaction parameters are optimized against experimentally determined radius of gyration data for multiple unfolded or intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). These models are applied to two systems which undergo LLPS: the low complexity domain of the RNA-binding protein FUS and the DEAD-box helicase protein LAF-1. We develop a novel simulation method to determine thermodynamic phase diagrams as a function of the total protein concentration and temperature. We show that the model is capable of capturing qualitative changes in the phase diagram due to phosphomimetic mutations of FUS and to the presence or absence of the large folded domain in LAF-1. We also explore the effects of chain-length, or multivalency, on the phase diagram, and obtain results consistent with Flory-Huggins theory for polymers. Most importantly, the methodology presented here is flexible so that it can be easily extended to other pair potentials, be used with other enhanced sampling methods, and may incorporate additional features for biological systems of interest.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0oaYFiuLVmE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Sleep deprivation (SD), a common migraine trigger, induces transcriptional changes in astrocytes, reducing glycogen breakdown. We hypothesize that when glycogen utilization cannot match synaptic energy demand, extracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; can rise to levels that activate neuronal pannexin-1 channels and downstream inflammatory pathway, which might be one of the mechanisms initiating migraine headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Six-hour SD induced pannexin-1 mRNA. DAB and SD also lowered the cortical spreading depression (CSD) induction threshold, which was reversed by glucose or lactate supplement, suggesting that glycogen-derived energy substrates are needed to prevent CSD generation. Supporting this, knocking down the neuronal lactate transporter MCT2 with an antisense oligonucleotide or inhibiting glucose transport from vessels to astrocytes with intracerebroventricularly delivered phloretin reduced the CSD threshold. In vivo recordings with a K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-sensitive/selective fluoroprobe, Asante Potassium Green-4, revealed that DAB treatment or SD caused a significant rise in extracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; during whisker stimulation, illustrating the critical role of glycogen in extracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; clearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the genetic defect and molecular phenotype to improve understanding of pathogenic mechanisms associated with single, large-scale mtDNA deletions in skeletal muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25127-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We investigated 23 muscle biopsies taken from adult patients (6 males/17 females with a mean age of 43 years) with characterized single, large-scale mtDNA deletions. Mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency in skeletal muscle biopsies was quantified by immunoreactivity levels for complex I and complex IV proteins. Single muscle fibers with varying degrees of deficiency were selected from 6 patient biopsies for determination of mtDNA deletion level and copy number by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Single fiber analyses showed that fibers with greater respiratory chain deficiency harbored higher levels of mtDNA deletion with an increase in total mtDNA copy number. For the first time, we have demonstrated that threshold levels for complex I and complex IV deficiency differ based on deletion class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Furthermore, removal of mt-tRNA genes impacts specific complexes only at high deletion levels, when complex-specific protein-encoding genes remain. These novel findings provide valuable insight into the pathogenic mechanisms associated with these mutations. Ann Neurol 2018;83:115–130&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25124-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analyzed non-REM sleep SEEG recordings sampled at 2,048Hz of 30 patients. Ripples (Rs; 80–250Hz), fast ripples (FRs; 250–500Hz), and spikes were automatically detected. Rates of these markers and several combinations—spikes co-occurring with HFOs or FRs and cross-rate (Spk⊗HFO)—were compared to a quantified measure of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) by performing a receiver operating characteristic analysis for each patient individually. We used a Wilcoxon signed-rank test corrected for false-discovery rate to assess whether a marker was better than the others for predicting the SOZ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Nearly all of the stained protein is golden colored (overlap of red and green), indicating that it was stained with both antibodies because it was on the surface of the cell.

Sixty-seven of the patients continued in the open-label extension phase of the study with monitoring for 2 years. Nine patients were excluded by 2 years, for example, because of alternative therapy such as deep brain stimulation (n = 3) or inadequate thermal lesioning (n = 1). However, all patients in each follow-up period were analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The improvement in tremor score from baseline was durable at 1 year (53%; 8.9 ± 4.8; 70 patients) and at 2 years (56%; 8.8 ± 5.0; 67 patients). Similarly, the disability score at baseline (16.4 ± 4.5; 76 patients) improved by 64% at 6 months (5.4 ± 4.7; 75 patients). This improvement was also sustained at 1 year (5.4 ± 5.3; 70 patients) and at 2 years (6.5 ± 5.0; 67 patients). Paresthesias and gait disturbances were the most common adverse effects at 1 year—each observed in 10 patients with an additional 5 patients experiencing neurological adverse effects. None of the adverse events worsened over the period of follow-up, and 2 of these resolved. There were no new delayed complications at 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monoclonal antibodies that target CD20 expressing B cells represent an important new treatment option for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). B-cell-depleting therapy is highly effective against relapsing forms of the disease and is also the first treatment approach proven to protect against disability worsening in primary progressive MS. Moreover, evolving clinical experience with B-cell therapy, combined with a more sophisticated understanding of humoral immunity in preclinical models and in patients with MS, has led to major progress in deciphering the immune pathogenesis of MS. Here, we review the nuanced roles of B cells in MS autoimmunity, the clinical data supporting use of ocrelizumab and other anti-CD20 therapies in the treatment of MS, as well as safety and practical considerations for prescribing. Last, we summarize remaining unanswered questions regarding the proper role of anti-CD20 therapy in MS, its limitations, and the future landscape of B-cell-based approaches to treatment.

Primary outcome was the association of prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) administration with hematoma enlargement. Subanalyses were calculated for blood pressure management and its association with the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include associations with in-hospital mortality and functional outcome at 3 months assessed using the modified Rankin Scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Hematoma enlargement occurred in 49/146 (33.6%) patients with NOAC-related ICH. Parameters associated with hematoma enlargement were blood pressure ≥ 160mmHg within 4 hours and—in the case of factor Xa inhibitor ICH—anti-Xa levels on admission. PCC administration prior to follow-up imaging was not significantly associated with a reduced rate of hematoma enlargement either in overall NOAC-related ICH or in patients with factor Xa inhibitor intake (NOAC: risk ratio [RR] = 1.150, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.632–2.090; factor Xa inhibitor: RR = 1.057, 95% CI = 0.565–1.977), regardless of PCC dosage given or time interval until imaging or treatment. Systolic blood pressure levels &amp;lt; 160mmHg within 4 hours after admission were significantly associated with a reduction in the proportion of patients with hematoma enlargement (RR = 0.598, 95% CI = 0.365–0.978). PCC administration had no effect on mortality and functional outcome either at discharge or at 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Presynaptic GABAA Receptors Modulate Thalamocortical Inputs in Layer 4 of Rat V1</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Fast inhibitory GABAergic transmission plays a fundamental role in neural circuits. Current theories of cortical function assume that fast GABAergic inhibition acts via GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors on postsynaptic neurons, while presynaptic effects of GABA depend on GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor activation. Manipulations of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor activity in vivo produced different effects on cortical function, which were generally ascribed to the mode of action of a drug, more than its site of action. Here we show that in rodent primary visual cortex, α4-containing GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors can be located on subsets of glutamatergic and GABAergic presynaptic terminals and decrease synaptic transmission. Our data provide a novel mechanistic insight into the effects of changes in cortical inhibition; the ability to modulate inputs onto cortical circuits locally, via presynaptic regulation of release by GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Cortical Responses to Input From Distant Areas are Modulated by Local Spontaneous Alpha/Beta Oscillations</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx361/4823221?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Any given area in human cortex may receive input from multiple, functionally heterogeneous areas, potentially representing different processing threads. Alpha (8–13 Hz) and beta oscillations (13–20 Hz) have been hypothesized by other investigators to gate local cortical processing, but their influence on cortical responses to input from other cortical areas is unknown. To study this, we measured the effect of local oscillatory power and phase on cortical responses elicited by single-pulse electrical stimulation (SPES) at distant cortical sites, in awake human subjects implanted with intracranial electrodes for epilepsy surgery. In 4 out of 5 subjects, the amplitudes of corticocortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) elicited by distant SPES were reproducibly modulated by the power, but not the phase, of local oscillations in alpha and beta frequencies. Specifically, CCEP amplitudes were higher when average oscillatory power just before distant SPES (−110 to −10 ms) was high. This effect was observed in only a subset (0–33%) of sites with CCEPs and, like the CCEPs themselves, varied with stimulation at different distant sites. Our results suggest that although alpha and beta oscillations may gate local processing, they may also enhance the responsiveness of cortex to input from distant cortical sites.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Genital cortex microstimulation-evoked movements of legs, trunk and genitals, which showed sex-specific differences related to mating behaviors and included thrusting in males and lordosis-like movements in females. Erections/tumescence of penis or clitoris could not be evoked, however. Anterograde tracer injections into penis/clitoris cortex revealed eleven corticocortical and 10 subcortical projection targets, which were qualitatively similar in both sexes. Corticocortical genital-cortex-projections innervated about 3% of the cortical surface and most were analog to other somatosensory projections targeting motor cortex, secondary somatosensory cortex, parietal cortex and perirhinal cortex. Corticocortical projections that differed from other parts of somatosensory cortex targeted male scrotum cortex, female vulva cortex, the somatosensory–ear–auditory-cortex-region and the caudal parietal area. Aligning cytoarchitectonic borders with motor topography, sensory genital responses and corticocortical projections identified a candidate region for genital motor cortex. Most subcortical genital-cortex-projections were analog to other thalamic, tectal or pontine projections of somatosensory cortex. Genital-cortex-specific subcortical projections targeted amygdala and nucleus submedius and accumbens. Microstimulation-effects and projections support a sexual function of genital cortex and suggest that genital cortex is a major hub of sexual sensorimotor processing in rodents.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

While evidence identifying candidate brain areas for each of these processes is well established, the precise mechanistic role carried out by each brain region is still debated. In this article, we present a computational model that clarifies the unique contribution of frontoparietal cortex regions to intertemporal decision making. The model we develop samples reward and delay information stochastically on a moment-by-moment basis. As preference for the choice alternatives evolves, dynamic inhibitory processes are executed by way of asymmetric lateral inhibition. We find that it is these lateral inhibition processes that best explain the contribution of frontoparietal regions to intertemporal decision making exhibited in our data.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx354/4823218?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Encoding hand position by the cerebral cortex is essential not only for the neural representation of the body image but also for different actions based on eye–hand coordination. These include reaching for visual objects as well as complex movement sequences, such as tea-making, tool use, and object construction, among many others. All these functions depend on a continuous refreshing of the hand position representation, relying on both predictive signaling and afferent information. The hand position influence on neural activity in the parietofrontal system, together with eye position signals, are the basic elements of an eye–hand matrix from which all the above functions can emerge and could be regarded as key features of a network with several entry points, command nodes and outflow pathways, as confirmed by the discovery of a direct parietospinal projection for the control of hand action. The integrity of this system is crucial for daily life, as testified by the consequences of cortical lesions, spanning from severe paralysis to complex forms of apraxia. In this review, I will sketch my personal understanding of the scientific and conceptual trajectory of a line of investigation with many unexpected influences on cortical function and disease, from motor behavior to cognition.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Fear Extinction Recall Modulates Human Frontomedial Theta and Amygdala Activity</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx353/4823217?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) studies, as well as animal studies, indicate that the amygdala and frontomedial brain regions are critically involved in conditioned fear and that frontomedial oscillations in the theta range (4–8 Hz) may support communication between these brain regions. However, few studies have used a multimodal approach to probe interactions among these key regions in humans. Here, our goal was to bridge the gap between prior human fMRI, EEG, and animal findings. Using simultaneous EEG–fMRI recordings 24 h after fear conditioning and extinction, conditioned stimuli presented (CS+E, CS−E) and not presented during extinction (CS+N, CS−N) were compared to identify effects specific to extinction versus fear recall. Differential (CS+ vs. CS−) electrodermal, frontomedial theta (EEG) and amygdala responses (fMRI) were reduced for extinguished versus nonextinguished stimuli. Importantly, effects on theta power covaried with effects on amygdala activation. Fear and extinction recall as indicated by theta explained 60% of the variance for the analogous effect in the right amygdala. Our findings show for the first time the interplay of amygdala and frontomedial theta activity during fear and extinction recall in humans and provide insight into neural circuits consistently linked with top-down amygdala modulation in rodents.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/4F046xHmM_I/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Roman Goulard, Jean-Louis Vercher, Stéphane Viollet&lt;/p&gt;

To avoid crashing onto the floor, a free falling fly needs to trigger its wingbeats quickly and control the orientation of its thrust accurately and swiftly to stabilize its pitch and hence its speed. Behavioural data have suggested that the vertical optic flow produced by the fall and crossing the visual field plays a key role in this anti-crash response. Free fall behavior analyses have also suggested that flying insect may not rely on graviception to stabilize their flight. Based on these two assumptions, we have developed a model which accounts for hoverflies´ position and pitch orientation recorded in 3D with a fast stereo camera during experimental free falls. Our dynamic model shows that optic flow-based control combined with closed-loop control of the pitch suffice to stabilize the flight properly. In addition, our model sheds a new light on the visual-based feedback control of fly´s pitch, lift and thrust. Since graviceptive cues are possibly not used by flying insects, the use of a vertical reference to control the pitch is discussed, based on the results obtained on a complete dynamic model of a virtual fly falling in a textured corridor. This model would provide a useful tool for understanding more clearly how insects may or not estimate their absolute attitude.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4F046xHmM_I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: What drives the perceptual change resulting from speech motor adaptation? Evaluation of hypotheses in a Bayesian modeling framework</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/847yCSUjhhw/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Jean-François Patri, Pascal Perrier, Jean-Luc Schwartz, Julien Diard&lt;/p&gt;

Shifts in perceptual boundaries resulting from speech motor learning induced by perturbations of the auditory feedback were taken as evidence for the involvement of motor functions in auditory speech perception. Beyond this general statement, the precise mechanisms underlying this involvement are not yet fully understood. In this paper we propose a quantitative evaluation of some hypotheses concerning the motor and auditory updates that could result from motor learning, in the context of various assumptions about the roles of the auditory and somatosensory pathways in speech perception. This analysis was made possible thanks to the use of a Bayesian model that implements these hypotheses by expressing the relationships between speech production and speech perception in a joint probability distribution. The evaluation focuses on how the hypotheses can (1) predict the location of perceptual boundary shifts once the perturbation has been removed, (2) account for the magnitude of the compensation in presence of the perturbation, and (3) describe the correlation between these two behavioral characteristics. Experimental findings about changes in speech perception following adaptation to auditory feedback perturbations serve as reference. Simulations suggest that they are compatible with a framework in which motor adaptation updates both the auditory-motor internal model and the auditory characterization of the perturbed phoneme, and where perception involves both auditory and somatosensory pathways.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/847yCSUjhhw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Neonatal Hypoxia–Ischemia Causes Functional Circuit Changes in Subplate Neurons</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx358/4818253?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Neonatal hypoxia–ischemia (HI) in the preterm human results in damage to subcortical developing white matter and cognitive impairments. Subplate neurons (SPNs) are among the first-born cortical neurons and are necessary for normal cerebral development. While moderate or severe HI at P1 in rats leads to SPN loss, it is unclear if HI, esp. forms not associated with overt cell loss lead to altered SPN circuits. Thus, we used two HI models with different severities in P1 rats. Cauterization of the common carotid artery (CCA) causes a largely transient and thus milder ischemia (HI-Caut) while CCA ligation causes more severe ischemia (HI-Lig). While HI-Lig caused subplate damage, HI-Caut did not cause overt histological damage on the light microscopic level. We used laser-scanning photostimulation (LSPS) in acute thalamocortical slices of auditory cortex during P5–10 to study the functional connectivity of SPNs. Both HI categories resulted in hyperconnectivity of excitatory and inhibitory circuits to SPNs. Thus, alterations on the circuit level are present in the absence of cell loss. Our results show that SPN circuits are uniquely susceptible to HI. Given the key developmental role of SPNs, our results suggest that altered SPN circuits might underlie the abnormal development of cortical function after HI.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Neural Evidence for the Contribution of Active Suppression During Working Memory Filtering</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;In order to efficiently process incoming visual information, selective attention acts as a filter that enhances relevant and suppresses irrelevant information. In this study, we used an event-related potential (ERP) approach with systematic lateralization to investigate enhancement and suppression during encoding of information into visual working memory (WM) separately. We used a change detection task in which observers had to memorize some items while ignoring other items. We found that the to-be-ignored items elicited a PD component in the ERP, suggesting that irrelevant information is actively suppressed from WM. The PD amplitude increased with distractor load and decreased with the ability to group distractors according to Gestalt principles. This suggests that the PD can be used as an indicator of how efficiently items can be suppressed from entering WM. Furthermore, while lateral memory-targets elicited a “traditional” CDA (starting ~300 ms), lateral memory-distractors elicited a sustained positivity contralateral to memory-distractors (CDAp, starting ~400 ms). In sum the results suggest that inhibition of irrelevant information is an important factor for efficient WM and is reflected in spontaneous (PD) and sustained suppression (CDAp).&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Encoding of Auditory Temporal Gestalt in the Human Brain</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The perception of an acoustic rhythm is invariant to the absolute temporal intervals constituting a sound sequence. It is unknown where in the brain temporal Gestalt, the percept emerging from the relative temporal proximity between acoustic events, is encoded. Two different relative temporal patterns, each induced by three experimental conditions with different absolute temporal patterns as sensory basis, were presented to participants. A linear support vector machine classifier was trained to differentiate activation patterns in functional magnetic resonance imaging data to the 2 different percepts. Across the sensory constituents the classifier decoded which percept was perceived. A searchlight analysis localized activation patterns specific to the temporal Gestalt bilaterally to the temporoparietal junction, including the planum temporale and supramarginal gyrus, and unilaterally to the right inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis). We show that auditory areas not only process absolute temporal intervals, but also integrate them into percepts of Gestalt and that encoding of these percepts persists in high-level associative areas. The findings complement existing knowledge regarding the processing of absolute temporal patterns to the processing of relative temporal patterns relevant to the sequential binding of perceptual elements into Gestalt.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Static length changes of cochlear outer hair cells can tune low-frequency hearing</title>

The cochlea not only transduces sound-induced vibration into neural spikes, it also amplifies weak sound to boost its detection. Actuators of this active process are sensory outer hair cells in the organ of Corti, whereas the inner hair cells transduce the resulting motion into electric signals that propagate via the auditory nerve to the brain. However, how the outer hair cells modulate the stimulus to the inner hair cells remains unclear. Here, we combine theoretical modeling and experimental measurements near the cochlear apex to study the way in which length changes of the outer hair cells deform the organ of Corti. We develop a geometry-based kinematic model of the apical organ of Corti that reproduces salient, yet counter-intuitive features of the organ’s motion. Our analysis further uncovers a mechanism by which a static length change of the outer hair cells can sensitively tune the signal transmitted to the sensory inner hair cells. When the outer hair cells are in an elongated state, stimulation of inner hair cells is largely inhibited, whereas outer hair cell contraction leads to a substantial enhancement of sound-evoked motion near the hair bundles. This novel mechanism for regulating the sensitivity of the hearing organ applies to the low frequencies that are most important for the perception of speech and music. We suggest that the proposed mechanism might underlie frequency discrimination at low auditory frequencies, as well as our ability to selectively attend auditory signals in noisy surroundings.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XnGbn1GAfJQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Targeting key regulators of the cancer stem cell phenotype to overcome their critical influence on tumor growth is a promising new strategy for cancer treatment. Here we present a modeling framework that operates at both the cellular and molecular levels, for investigating IL-6 mediated, cancer stem cell driven tumor growth and targeted treatment with anti-IL6 antibodies. Our immediate goal is to quantify the influence of IL-6 on cancer stem cell self-renewal and survival, and to characterize the subsequent impact on tumor growth dynamics. By including the molecular details of IL-6 binding, we are able to quantify the temporal changes in fractional occupancies of bound receptors and their influence on tumor volume. There is a strong correlation between the model output and experimental data for primary tumor xenografts. We also used the model to predict tumor response to administration of the humanized IL-6R monoclonal antibody, tocilizumab (TCZ), and we found that as little as 1mg/kg of TCZ administered weekly for 7 weeks is sufficient to result in tumor reduction and a sustained deceleration of tumor growth.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9hxzc5PneJY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The shaping of individual cells requires a tight coordination of cell mechanics and growth. However, it is unclear how information about the mechanical state of the wall is relayed to the molecular processes building it, thereby enabling the coordination of cell wall expansion and assembly during morphogenesis. Combining theoretical and experimental approaches, we show that a mechanical feedback coordinating cell wall assembly and expansion is essential to sustain mating projection growth in budding yeast (&lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;). Our theoretical results indicate that the mechanical feedback provided by the Cell Wall Integrity pathway, with cell wall stress sensors Wsc1 and Mid2 increasingly activating membrane-localized cell wall synthases Fks1/2 upon faster cell wall expansion, stabilizes mating projection growth without affecting cell shape. Experimental perturbation of the osmotic pressure and cell wall mechanics, as well as compromising the mechanical feedback through genetic deletion of the stress sensors, leads to cellular phenotypes that support the theoretical predictions. Our results indicate that while the existence of mechanical feedback is essential to stabilize mating projection growth, the shape and size of the cell are insensitive to the feedback.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HJHfrBF1fQE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Education and training are two essential ingredients for a successful career. On one hand, universities provide students a curriculum for specializing in one’s field of study, and on the other, internships complement coursework and provide invaluable training experience for a fruitful career. Consequently, undergraduates and graduates are encouraged to undertake an internship during the course of their degree. The opportunity to explore one’s research interests in the early stages of their education is important for students because it improves their skill set and gives their career a boost. In the long term, this helps to close the gap between skills and employability among students across the globe and balance the research capacity in the field of computational biology. However, training opportunities are often scarce for computational biology students, particularly for those who reside in less-privileged regions. Aimed at helping students develop research and academic skills in computational biology and alleviating the divide across countries, the Student Council of the International Society for Computational Biology introduced its Internship Program in 2009. The Internship Program is committed to providing access to computational biology training, especially for students from developing regions, and improving competencies in the field. Here, we present how the Internship Program works and the impact of the internship opportunities so far, along with the challenges associated with this program.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6wQOmQXfI-k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A theory of how active behavior stabilises neural activity: Neural gain modulation by closed-loop environmental feedback</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/Rfk3vZoQIs4/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Christopher L. Buckley, Taro Toyoizumi&lt;/p&gt;

During active behaviours like running, swimming, whisking or sniffing, motor actions shape sensory input and sensory percepts guide future motor commands. Ongoing cycles of sensory and motor processing constitute a closed-loop feedback system which is central to motor control and, it has been argued, for perceptual processes. This closed-loop feedback is mediated by brainwide neural circuits but how the presence of feedback signals impacts on the dynamics and function of neurons is not well understood. Here we present a simple theory suggesting that closed-loop feedback between the brain/body/environment can modulate neural gain and, consequently, change endogenous neural fluctuations and responses to sensory input. We support this theory with modeling and data analysis in two vertebrate systems. First, in a model of rodent whisking we show that negative feedback mediated by whisking vibrissa can suppress coherent neural fluctuations and neural responses to sensory input in the barrel cortex. We argue this suppression provides an appealing account of a &lt;i&gt;brain state transition&lt;/i&gt; (a marked change in global brain activity) coincident with the onset of whisking in rodents. Moreover, this mechanism suggests a novel signal detection mechanism that selectively accentuates &lt;i&gt;active&lt;/i&gt;, rather than &lt;i&gt;passive&lt;/i&gt;, whisker touch signals. This mechanism is consistent with a predictive coding strategy that is sensitive to the consequences of motor actions rather than the difference between the predicted and actual sensory input. We further support the theory by re-analysing previously published two-photon data recorded in zebrafish larvae performing closed-loop optomotor behaviour in a virtual swim simulator. We show, as predicted by this theory, that the degree to which each cell contributes in linking sensory and motor signals well explains how much its neural fluctuations are suppressed by closed-loop optomotor behaviour. More generally we argue that our results demonstrate the dependence of neural fluctuations, across the brain, on closed-loop brain/body/environment interactions strongly supporting the idea that brain function cannot be fully understood through open-loop approaches alone.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Rfk3vZoQIs4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Roles of Left Versus Right Anterior Temporal Lobes in Semantic Memory: A Neuropsychological Comparison of Postsurgical Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Patients</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx362/4812493?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The presence and degree of specialization between the anterior temporal lobes (ATLs) is a key issue in debates about the neural architecture of semantic memory. Here, we comprehensively assessed multiple aspects of semantic cognition in a large group of postsurgical temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients with left versus right anterior temporal lobectomy (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 40). Both subgroups showed deficits in expressive and receptive verbal semantic tasks, word and object recognition, naming and recognition of famous faces and perception of faces and emotions. Graded differences in performance between the left and right groups were secondary to the overall mild semantic impairment; primarily, left resected TLE patients showed weaker performance on tasks that required naming or accessing semantic information from a written word. Right resected TLE patients were relatively more impaired at recognizing famous faces as familiar, although this effect was observed less consistently. These findings unify previous partial, inconsistent results and also align directly with fMRI and transcranial magnetic stimulation results in neurologically intact participants. Taken together, these data support a model in which the 2 ATLs act as a coupled bilateral system for the representation of semantic knowledge, and in which graded hemispheric specializations emerge as a consequence of differential connectivity to lateralized speech production and face perception regions.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Lack of Methyl-CpG Binding Protein 2 (MeCP2) Affects Cell Fate Refinement During Embryonic Cortical Development</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx360/4812492?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;During differentiation, neurons progressively restrict their fate repressing the expression of specific genes. Here we describe the involvement in such developmental steps of the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), an epigenetic factor that participates to chromatin folding and transcriptional regulation. We previously reported that, due to transcriptional impairments, the maturation of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mecp2&lt;/span&gt; null neurons is delayed. To evaluate whether this could stem from altered progenitors proliferation and differentiation, we investigated whether lack of Mecp2 affects these features both in vitro and in vivo. We show that in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mecp2&lt;/span&gt; null embryonic cortexes the expression of genes defining the identity of proliferating neuroprogenitors is enriched and that their permanence in the G1 phase is prolonged. Moreover, the number of cells transitioning from a stage of maturation to a more mature one is increased in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mecp2&lt;/span&gt; null embryonic cortices, in line with the central role of G1 for cell identity refinement. We thus suggest that, possibly due to the lack of proper transcriptional control normally exerted by Mecp2, fate refinement is impaired in developing null cells. We propose that the maturation delay affecting the developing &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mecp2&lt;/span&gt; null cortex originates, at least in part, from deranged mechanisms of cell fate refinement.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) are more resilient than those in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in aging, schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s disease. The current study compared glutamate and neuromodulatory actions in macaque V1 to those in dlPFC, and found striking regional differences. V1 neuronal firing to visual stimuli depended on AMPA receptors, with subtle NMDA receptor contributions, while dlPFC depends primarily on NMDA receptors. Neuromodulatory actions also differed between regions. In V1, cAMP signaling increased neuronal firing, and the phosphodiesterase PDE4A was positioned to regulate cAMP effects on glutamate release from axons. HCN channels in V1 were classically located on distal dendrites, and enhanced cell firing. These data contrast with dlPFC, where PDE4A and HCN channels are concentrated in thin spines, and cAMP-HCN signaling gates inputs and weakens firing. These regional differences may explain why V1 neurons are more resilient than dlPFC neurons to the challenges of age and disease.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: HaSAPPy: A tool for candidate identification in pooled forward genetic screens of haploid mammalian cells</title>

Haploid cells are increasingly used for screening of complex pathways in animal genomes. Hemizygous mutations introduced through viral insertional mutagenesis can be directly selected for phenotypic changes. Here we present HaSAPPy a tool for analysing sequencing datasets of screens using insertional mutations in large pools of haploid cells. Candidate gene prediction is implemented through identification of enrichment of insertional mutations after selection by simultaneously evaluating several parameters. We have developed HaSAPPy for analysis of genetic screens for silencing factors of X chromosome inactivation in haploid mouse embryonic stem cells. To benchmark the performance, we further analyse several datasets of genetic screens in human haploid cells for which candidates have been validated. Our results support the effective candidate prediction strategy of HaSAPPy. HaSAPPy is implemented in Python, licensed under the MIT license, and is available from https://github.com/gdiminin/HaSAPPy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3K4LRTS9Xj4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The E&lt;sup&gt;2.65&lt;/sup&gt;A mutation disrupts dynamic binding poses of SB269652 at the dopamine D2 and D3 receptors</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/vUXB3FyjueQ/article</link>

The dopamine D2 and D3 receptors (D2R and D3R) are important targets for antipsychotics and for the treatment of drug abuse. SB269652, a bitopic ligand that simultaneously binds both the orthosteric binding site (OBS) and a secondary binding pocket (SBP) in both D2R and D3R, was found to be a negative allosteric modulator. Previous studies identified Glu&lt;sup&gt;2.65&lt;/sup&gt; in the SBP to be a key determinant of both the affinity of SB269652 and the magnitude of its cooperativity with orthosteric ligands, as the E&lt;sup&gt;2.65&lt;/sup&gt;A mutation decreased both of these parameters. However, the proposed hydrogen bond (H-bond) between Glu&lt;sup&gt;2.65&lt;/sup&gt; and the indole moiety of SB269652 is not a strong interaction, and a structure activity relationship study of SB269652 indicates that this H-bond may not be the only element that determines its allosteric properties. To understand the structural basis of the observed phenotype of E&lt;sup&gt;2.65&lt;/sup&gt;A, we carried out molecular dynamics simulations with a cumulative length of ~77 μs of D2R and D3R wild-type and their E&lt;sup&gt;2.65&lt;/sup&gt;A mutants bound to SB269652. In combination with Markov state model analysis and by characterizing the equilibria of ligand binding modes in different conditions, we found that in both D2R and D3R, whereas the tetrahydroisoquinoline moiety of SB269652 is stably bound in the OBS, the indole-2-carboxamide moiety is dynamic and only intermittently forms H-bonds with Glu&lt;sup&gt;2.65&lt;/sup&gt;. Our results also indicate that the E&lt;sup&gt;2.65&lt;/sup&gt;A mutation significantly affects the overall shape and size of the SBP, as well as the conformation of the N terminus. Thus, our findings suggest that the key role of Glu&lt;sup&gt;2.65&lt;/sup&gt; in mediating the allosteric properties of SB269652 extends beyond a direct interaction with SB269652, and provide structural insights for rational design of SB269652 derivatives that may retain its allosteric properties.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vUXB3FyjueQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Gli2 Rescues Delays in Brain Development Induced by Kif3a Dysfunction</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The primary cilium in neural stem cells plays distinct roles in different stages during cortical development. Ciliary dysfunctions in human (i.e., ciliopathy) cause developmental defects in multiple organs, including brain developmental delays, which lead to intellectual disabilities and cognitive deficits. However, effective treatment to this devastating developmental disorder is still lacking. Here, we first investigated the effects of ciliopathy on neural stem cells by knocking down Kif3a, a kinesin II motor required for ciliogenesis, in the neurogenic stage of cortical development by in utero electroporation of mouse embryos. Brains electroporated with Kif3a shRNA showed defects in neuronal migration and differentiation, delays in neural stem cell cycle progression, and failures in interkinetic nuclear migration. Interestingly, introduction of Gli1 and Gli2 both can restore the cell cycle progression by elevating cyclin D1 in neural stem cells. Remarkably, enforced Gli2 expression, but not Gli1, partially restored the ability of Kif3a-knockdown neurons to differentiate and move from the germinal ventricular zone to the cortical plate. Moreover, Cyclin D1 knockdown abolished Gli2’s rescue effect. These findings suggest Gli2 may rescue neural stem cell proliferation, differentiation and migration through Cyclin D1 pathway and may serve as a potential therapeutic target for human ciliopathy syndromes through modulating the progression of neural stem cell cycle.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Such gating is observed across multiple sensory modalities and is modulated by age, but the mechanisms involved are not understood. In this study, we examined somatosensory gating in 68 healthy adults using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and advanced oscillatory and time-domain analysis methods. MEG data underwent source reconstruction and peak voxel time series data were extracted to evaluate the dynamics of somatosensory gating, and the impact of spontaneous neural activity immediately preceding the stimulation. We found that gating declined with increasing age and that older adults had significantly reduced gating relative to younger adults, suggesting impaired local inhibitory function. Most importantly, older adults had significantly elevated spontaneous activity preceding the stimulation, and this effect fully mediated the impact of aging on sensory gating. In conclusion, gating in the somatosensory system declines with advancing age and this effect is directly tied to increased spontaneous neural activity in the primary somatosensory cortices, which is likely secondary to age-related declines in local GABA inhibitory function.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Roles of Subdivisions of Human Insula in Emotion Perception and Auditory Processing</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx334/4802217?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Previous studies have shown insular activations involving sensory, motor, and affective processing. However, the functional roles of subdivisions within the human insula are still not well understood. In the present study, we used intracranial electroencephalography and electrical cortical stimulation to investigate the causal roles of subdivisions of the insula in auditory emotion perception in epilepsy patients implanted with depth electrodes in this brain region. The posterior and the anterior subdivisions of the human insula, identified based on structural and functional analyses, showed distinct response properties to auditory emotional stimuli. The posterior insula showed auditory responses that resemble those observed in Heschl’s gyrus, whereas the anterior insula (AI) responded to the emotional contents of the auditory stimuli in a similar way as observed in the amygdala. Furthermore, the degree of the differentiation between various emotion types increased from the posterior to the AI. Our findings suggest different roles played by the two regions of the human insula and a transformation from sensory to affective representations in auditory modality along the posterior-to-anterior axis in the human insula.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Morphological and Functional Characterization of Non-fast-Spiking GABAergic Interneurons in Layer 4 Microcircuitry of Rat Barrel Cortex</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx352/4796916?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;GABAergic interneurons are notorious for their heterogeneity, despite constituting a small fraction of the neuronal population in the neocortex. Classification of interneurons is crucial for understanding their widespread cortical functions as they provide a complex and dynamic network, balancing excitation and inhibition. Here, we investigated different types of non-fast-spiking (nFS) interneurons in Layer 4 (L4) of rat barrel cortex using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings with biocytin-filling. Based on a quantitative analysis on a combination of morphological and electrophysiological parameters, we identified 5 distinct types of L4 nFS interneurons: 1) &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;trans-columnar projecting interneurons,&lt;/span&gt;2) &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;locally projecting non-Martinotti-like interneurons,&lt;/span&gt; 3) &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;supra-granular projecting Martinotti-like interneurons,&lt;/span&gt;4) &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;intra-columnar projecting VIP-like interneurons&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;5) &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;locally projecting neurogliaform-like interneurons.&lt;/span&gt; Trans-columnar projecting interneurons are one of the most striking interneuron types, which have not been described so far in Layer 4. They feature extensive axonal collateralization not only in their home barrel but also in adjacent barrels. Furthermore, we identified that most of the L4 nFS interneurons express somatostatin, while few are positive for the transcription factor Prox1. The morphological and electrophysiological characterization of different L4 nFS interneuron types presented here provides insights into their synaptic connectivity and functional role in cortical information processing.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30250-3?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>Depressed individuals typically show poor memory for positive events, potentiated memory for negative events, and impaired recollection. These phenomena are clinically important but poorly understood. Compelling links between stress and depression suggest promising candidate mechanisms. Stress can suppress hippocampal neurogenesis, inhibit dopamine neurons, and sensitize the amygdala. We argue that these phenomena may impair pattern separation, disrupt the encoding of positive experiences, and bias retrieval toward negative events, respectively, thus recapitulating core aspects of memory disruption in depression.</content:encoded>
