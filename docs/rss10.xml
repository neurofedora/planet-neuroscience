	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Clinical, Biochemical, and Molecular Characterization of Metachromatic Leukodystrophy Among Egyptian Pediatric Patients: Expansion of the ARSA Mutational Spectrum</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01734-1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive demyelination due to deficiency of the enzyme arylsulfatase A (ARSA) in leukocytes, and consequently leads to impaired degradation and accumulation of cerebroside-3-sulfate (sulfatide). This study aimed to sequence the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ARSA&lt;/em&gt; gene in a total of 43 patients with metachromatic leukodystrophy descendant from 40 Egyptian families. In addition, four carrier parents from two families with children who had died from MLD came to the clinic for genetic analysis. Prenatal diagnosis was performed for four families with molecularly diagnosed MLD sibs. Different mutations were characterized in our cohort, including missense, nonsense, splice, and deletion. Overall, 21 different mutations in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ARSA&lt;/em&gt; gene were detected, with 12 novel mutations, i.e. p.Arg60Pro, p.Tyr65*, p.Val112Asp, p.Arg116*, p.Gly124Asp, p.Pro193Ser, p.Gln238*, p.Gln456*, p.Thr276Lys, and p.Gly311Arg, in addition to two new acceptor splice-site mutations 685-1G &amp;gt; A and c.954_956 delCTT. The amniotic fluid samples revealed two carrier fetuses with heterozygous monoallelic mutations, and two affected fetuses had the homozygous biallelic mutations. In conclusion, the current study sheds light on the underlying &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ARSA&lt;/em&gt; gene defect, with an expansion of the mutation spectrum. To our knowledge, this is the first molecular study of MLD among the Egyptian population.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Rodent Models of Vascular Cognitive Impairment</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01733-2</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) refers to the entire spectrum of vascular brain pathologies that contribute to cognitive deficits, ranging from subjective cognitive decline to dementia. The main pathologies in VCI are infarcts and white matter hyperintensities due to ischemia. VCI rodent models can be divided into surgical models (e.g., MCAO, BCAO, BCAS, 2-VO, 4-VO) and genetic models (e.g., SHR/SP, T2DM, CAA, CADASIL) based on construction methods. However, no single model can fully recapitulate the pathogenesis of VCI, and choosing the appropriate model for different research purposes would be of crucial importance. Here, we have summarized the commonly used rodent VCI models and discussed their advantages and limitations to provide a necessary reference for selecting suitable animal models to investigate the molecular pathways involved in VCI and develop therapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Investigation of the Role of Stimulation and Blockade of 5-HT 7 Receptors in Ketamine Anesthesia.</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01732-3</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Although several pieces of evidence have indicated the ability of the serotonin-7 receptor (5-HTR&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;) to modulate N-methyl-&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activation, the possible impact on ketamine anesthesia has not been examined directly. The purpose of the present study is thus to investigate the possible role of the 5-HTR&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; in ketamine anesthesia using a 5-HTR&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; agonist and/or antagonist. The influence of a 5-HTR&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; agonist/antagonist on ketamine anesthesia for behavioral impact was assessed by testing potential anesthetic parameters. Its functional impact was assessed by mRNA expression with real-time PCR and immunostaining in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of mice. Two different doses of ketamine—high and low—were administered to induce anesthesia. In the high-dose ketamine-applied group in particular, the administration of both the 5-HTR&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; agonist and antagonist intensified the anesthetic effect of ketamine. The reflection of the change in anesthesia parameters to 5-HTR&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; expression was observed as an increase in the hippocampus and a decrease in the prefrontal cortex in the anesthetized groups by stimulation of 5-HTR&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;. It is noteworthy that the results of NMDAR expressions are parallel to the results of the 5-HTR&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; expressions of both the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. The 5-HTR&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; may play a role in ketamine anesthesia. It may act through NMDAR in ketamine anesthesia, depending on the parallelism between both receptors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus-ventrolateral part (VMNvl) is an estradiol-sensitive structure that controls sex-specific behavior. Electrical reactivity of VMNvl neurons to hypoglycemia infers that cellular energy stability is monitored there. Current research investigated the hypothesis that estradiol elicits sex-dimorphic patterns of VMNvl metabolic sensor activation and gluco-regulatory neurotransmission during hypoglycemia. Rostral-, middle-, and caudal-VMNvl tissue was separately micropunch-dissected from letrozole (Lz)- or vehicle-injected male and estradiol- or vehicle-implanted ovariectomized (OVX) female rats for Western blot analysis of total and phosphorylated 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) protein expression and gluco-stimulatory [neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS); steroidogenic factor-1 (SF1) or -inhibitory (glutamate decarboxylase&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;65/67&lt;/sub&gt; (GAD)] transmitter marker proteins after &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;sc&lt;/em&gt; insulin (INS) or vehicle injection. In both sexes, hypoglycemic up-regulation of phosphoAMPK was estradiol-dependent in rostral and middle, but not caudal VMNvl. AMPK activity remained elevated after recovery from hypoglycemia over the rostro-caudal VMNvl in female, but only in the rostral segment in male. In each sex, hypoglycemia correspondingly augmented or suppressed nNOS profiles in rostral and middle versus caudal VMNvl; these segmental responses persisted longer in female. Rostral and middle segment SF1 protein was inhibited by estradiol-independent mechanisms in hypoglycemic males, but increased by estradiol-reliant mechanisms in female. After INS injection, GAD expression was inhibited in the male rostral VMNvl without estradiol involvement, but this hormone was required for broader suppression of this profile in the female. Neuroanatomical variability of VMNvl metabolic transmitter reactivity to hypoglycemia underscores the existence of functionally different subgroups in that structure. The regional distribution and estradiol sensitivity of hypoglycemia-sensitive VMNvl neurons of each neurochemical phenotype evidently vary between sexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Oxidative Stress Profile in Genetically Confirmed Cases of Leber’s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01729-y</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The mechanisms of the complex pathophysiology of Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) are still insufficiently clarified. The role of oxidative stress as an etiological factor has been proposed and demonstrated in vitro, but without conclusive data that rely on clinical samples. The aim of the study was to evaluate and characterize the existence of oxidative stress in the plasma of LHON patients and healthy individuals. Whole mitochondrial genome sequencing has been performed in order to identify primary LHON mutations. For the assessment of oxidative stress, the following biomarkers were determined in plasma: total oxidant status (TOS), total antioxidant status (TAS), and oxidative stress index (OSI), while oxidative damage of cellular proteins was estimated by quantifying advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP). All three primary LHON mutations (m.3460G &amp;gt; A, m.11778G &amp;gt; A and m.14484 T &amp;gt; C) were identified as a genetic cause of the disease, where the most prevalent one was m.11778G &amp;gt; A. LHON patients have a highly significant increase of TOS and a marked decrease of TAS levels, which suggests the existence of substantial oxidative stress. OSI is high in LHON patients, which definitely implies the presence of redox imbalance. Elevated level of AOPP in LHON patients refers to the significant deleterious effects of oxidative stress on cellular proteins. Oxidative stress parameters do not significantly differ between LHON individuals with different primary mutations. Both symptomatic and asymptomatic LHON patients have an augmented level of oxidative stress which suggests that primary mutations exhibit a pro-oxidative phenotype. Gender and smoking habit significantly influence examined biochemical parameters when LHON patients are compared with the control group. Different mitochondrial haplogroups are characterized by altered levels of OSI in LHON group. The absence of physiological correlations between redox parameters reflects the deregulation of homeostatic oxidative/antioxidative balance in LHON patients. This is the greatest series of LHON patients that were evaluated for oxidative stress and the first case-controlled study that evaluated TOS, TAS, OSI, and AOPP and their influence on disease phenotype. It is evident that the presence of oxidative stress represents an important pathophysiological event in LHON and that it could potentially serve as a circulatory biomarker for a therapy efficacy understanding.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: A Functional Polymorphism in HIF-3α Is Related to an Increased Risk of Ischemic Stroke</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Hypoxia-inducible factor-3α (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;HIF-3α&lt;/em&gt;), a member of HIF family, can mediate adaptive responses to low oxygen and ischemia. It is believed that HIF plays crucial roles in stroke-related diseases. However, there are no reports on the association between HIF-3α genetic variants and ischemic stroke (IS) susceptibility. Therefore, we examined the association between &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;HIF-&lt;/em&gt;3α gene polymorphisms (rs3826795, rs2235095, and rs3764609) and IS risk. The study population included 302 controls and 310 patients with ischemic stroke. Three polymorphisms in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;HIF-&lt;/em&gt;3α (rs3826795, rs2235095, and rs3764609) were genotyped using SNPscan technique. Our study showed a strong association of rs3826795 in HIF-3α with the risk of IS. The genotype and allele frequencies were shown to differ between the two groups. The rs3826795 in an intron of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;HIF-3α&lt;/em&gt; was related to a prominent increased IS risk (AA vs GG adjusted odd ratio [OR], 2.21; 95% confidence intervals [95% CI], 1.10–4.44; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.03; AA vs AG/GG OR = 1.74, 95% CI, 1.02–2.97, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.04; A vs G OR = 1.48, 95% CI, 1.05–2.07, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.02). Logistic regression analysis suggested that rs3826795 posed a risk factor for IS in addition to common factors. Furthermore, when compared to controls, increased levels of homocysteic acid and level of non-esterified fatty acid were found in the cases (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). However, no significant association was found between rs2235095 or rs3264609 and IS risk. These findings indicated that the rs3826795 polymorphism may be a potential target for predicting the risk of IS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Atherosclerotic plaque instability is a major cause of ischemic stroke. Researchers must develop novel strategies for the detection and treatment of unstable atherosclerotic plaque (UAP)-related stroke. We aimed to identify potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets of UAP-related stroke. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of UAP, ischemic stroke and smoking were identified by microarray analyses from the Gene Expression Omnibus. Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway functional enrichment analyses of DEGs were performed to analyze plaque destabilization and ischemic stroke physiopathology. An integrative analysis of UAP, ischemic stroke and smoking DEGs and functional annotations was performed to identify the underlying physiopathology and hub genes in UAP-related stroke and the relationship with smoking. Online search databases were applied to confirm hub gene biofunctions and their relationships with atherosclerosis and cerebrovascular diseases. Following integrative analysis, 18 co-DEGs of UAP and ischemic stroke, including 17 upregulated and one downregulated, were identified. Inflammation, immunity, extracellular matrix degradation, blood coagulation, apoptosis and nerve degeneration were the primary physiopathological processes in UAP-related stroke. Hub genes included MMP9, ITGAM, CCR1, NCF2 and CD163, among which MMP9 and ITGAM were top 10 genes for both UAP and stroke. Smoking may upregulate MMP9, NCF2, C5AR1 and ANPEP to accelerate plaque destabilization and UAP-related stroke. MMP9, ITGAM, CCR1, NCF2, CD163, hsa-miR-3123 and hsa-miR-144-3p are potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of UAP-related stroke. MMP9 and ITGAM are potential therapeutic targets of UAP-related stroke, which will contribute to the development of novel management strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The main objective of current work was to determine the effects of treadmill-running and swimming exercise on passive avoidance learning (PAL) and blood biochemical parameters in rats with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. Male Wistar rats were divided into the following 6 groups (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 6–8 per group): CON, healthy rats without exercise (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 8); STZ, diabetic rats without exercise (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 8); CON-SE, healthy rats subjected to swimming exercise (2 months; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 6); STZ-SE, diabetic rats subjected to swimming exercise (2 months; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 7); CON-TE, healthy rats subjected to treadmill exercise (2 months; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 8); STZ-TE, diabetic rats subjected to treadmill exercise (2 months; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 8). Diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg/kg STZ. Our results showed that STZ decreased the step-through latency in the retention test (STLr) and increased the time spent in the dark compartment (TDC) when compared with the CON group. However, treadmill-running and swimming exercise in STZ-treated rats increased the STLr and decreased the TDC when compared with STZ-treated rats without exercise in PAL. Blood low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglyceride (TG) levels in the STZ group were significantly higher than those in the CON group, whereas plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and levels of catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were lower in the STZ group compared with the CON group. The levels of LDL and TG decreased and the levels of TAC, CAT, and GPx increased in the exercise groups in comparison with the STZ group. The present results indicate that regular exercise enhances learning and memory in diabetic rats and that these effects may occur through activation of the antioxidant system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a heterogeneous disease both clinically and pathologically. Genetic mutation in microtubule-associated protein tau (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;MAPT&lt;/em&gt;) is the most common cause of FTD, and the phenotype is related to the mutation location. However, the phenotype and genotype correlation varies somewhat among different cohorts and ethnicities. Whole-genome next-generation sequencing (NGS) was carried out for 1351 patients with dementia at Peking Union Medical College Hospital. &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;MAPT&lt;/em&gt; variations classified as pathogenic and of uncertain significance were identified. Demographic information, clinical presentations, and neuroimaging were collected, and the phenotype-genotype correlation was analyzed with a concurrent literature review. Twenty-four patients were enrolled; 8 patients carrying the D177V mutation are discussed separately. The average onset age was young, and most of them had a positive family history. Cognitive dysfunction, behavior, and personality changes as well as aphasia were the most common presentations. Most structural MRIs showed asymmetrical atrophy of the temporal lobe, with/without similar changes in the frontal lobe. L266V carriers presented with youngest onset typical behavior variant FTD or aphasia; P301L carriers presented with behavior variant FTD or aphasia. Functional MRI and molecular imaging also showed that the involved areas were similar to those with structural atrophy. D296N carriers presented atypical parkinsonism and cognitive dysfunction at older ages. Eight D177V carriers had extraordinarily different manifestations. The clinical phenotype of most of them was not FTD, though cerebral vascular lesions were obvious in some of them. &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;MAPT&lt;/em&gt; mutation is rare in Chinese dementia patients. The phenotype and genotype correlation is specific and overlaps. The D177V mutation is possibly not directly pathogenic in our cohort. Some of the variants might increase the genetic risk of neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The vertebrate brain-derived neurotrophic factor (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;BDNF&lt;/em&gt;) gene produces a number of alternatively spliced transcripts only some of which generate the BDNF protein required for synaptic plasticity and learning. Many of the transcripts are uncharacterized and are of unknown biological significance. Previously, we described alternative splicing within the protein-coding sequence of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;BDNF&lt;/em&gt; gene in the pond turtle (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;tBDNF&lt;/em&gt;) that generates a functionally distinct truncated protein isoform (trcBDNF) that is regulated during a neural correlate of eyeblink classical conditioning in ex vivo brainstem preparations. We hypothesized that trcBDNF has a dominant negative function because of its anticorrelated expression pattern compared to its full-length BDNF counterpart. The data presented here suggests that trcBDNF functions as a transcriptional repressor of a conditioning-inducible downstream &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;tBDNF&lt;/em&gt; promoter that controls expression of full-length BDNF required for learning. First, expression of full-length transcripts is negatively correlated with trcBDNF; transcripts are inhibited when endogenous trcBDNF is ectopically induced and expressed when trcBDNF is inhibited. Second, ChIP-qPCR assays of a recombinant trcBDNF protein, RtrcBDNF, show strong binding to the downstream &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;tBDNF&lt;/em&gt; exon III promoter that corresponds with inhibition of conditioning. Third, deletions of the C-terminus of RtrcBDNF result in inhibition of promoter binding and conditioning acquisition when a tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) binding site is accounted for. Finally, microinjection of RtrcBDNF directly into brainstem preparations inhibits conditioning. These data reveal a new mechanism of activity-dependent &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;BDNF&lt;/em&gt; transcriptional regulation and suggest that &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;BDNF&lt;/em&gt; is an autoregulatory gene. How generalizable this mechanism is across plasticity genes remains to be elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have crucial roles in the pathogenesis of immune-related disorders. However, their role in the pathobiology of inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathies remains unclear. In the current study, we measured peripheral expression of four lncRNAs, namely &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TUG1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;FAS-AS1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;NEAT1&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;GAS5&lt;/em&gt;, in patients with acute/chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathies (AIDP/CIDP) compared with healthy subjects. Notably, all lncRNAs were over-expressed in patients compared with controls (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001 for all lncRNAs). When assessing their expressions in AIDP and CIDP groups separately, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TUG1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;NEAT1&lt;/em&gt; were up-regulated in both patient groups compared with controls, yet &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;FAS-AS1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;GAS5&lt;/em&gt; were only up-regulated in CIDP cases. There were remarkable pairwise correlations between expression levels of these lncRNAs in all study groups. Based on the above-mentioned data, we suggest participation of these for lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathies. Moreover, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;FAS-AS1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;GAS5&lt;/em&gt; lncRNAs have type-specific roles in this regard. Future functional studies are needed to elaborate the molecular mechanisms of the contribution of these transcripts in AIDP/CIDP.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute inflammatory polyradiculoneuropathy syndrome. Several genetic and environmental risk factors have been recognized for GBS. AS GBS is an immune-related disorder, abnormal functions of T cells, production of autoantibodies, and dysregulation of gene expression have been detected in GBS patients. Based on the critical role of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) in the regulation of immune responses, HLA alleles are among the mostly investigated loci in GBS. A number of polymorphisms within different genes, especially those linked with the regulation of immune responses, have been associated with GBS in different populations. Moreover, several studies have demonstrated abnormal expression of cytokine-coding genes in this disorder. Investigations in the animal model of GBS have also verified the aberrant regulation of Th1/Th2/Th17/Treg cytokines. In the current review, we describe the information about the role of these factors in GBS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Heritability of major depressive disorder (MDD) is between 36 and 44%, suggesting that up to nearly half of the phenotypic variability is attributable to genes. A number of genetic polymorphisms have been shown to predispose certain individuals to depression. Of particular interest are the polymorphisms of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene. Although the VDR gene has been well characterized and a vast number of polymorphisms have been identified, the association between &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Bsm&lt;/em&gt;I (rs1544410), &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Apa&lt;/em&gt;I (rs7975232) and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Taq&lt;/em&gt;I (rs731236) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), together with their haplotypes, and MDD risk have yet to be established. We conducted a matched case–control study with a total of 600 participants comprising 300 major depressive disorder (MDD) cases and 300 controls matched by age, gender and ethnicity in a 1:1 ratio, in four public hospitals in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor. Three adjacent SNPs of the VDR gene—&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Bsm&lt;/em&gt;I (rs1544410), &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Apa&lt;/em&gt;I (rs7975232) and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Taq&lt;/em&gt;I (rs731236)—were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained from conditional logistic regression using Stata 16. Linkage disequilibrium and haplotype association with MDD were analyzed using the online SNPStats program. None of the genotypes of the three SNPs was significantly associated with risk of developing MDD after adjusting for confounding factors.

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Accumulating evidence has elucidated that human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) exert profound analgesic effects on numerous animal models of neuropathic pain, including drug-induced peripheral nerves, diabetes-induced neuropathy, and chronic constriction injury. We aimed to address whether forcing expression of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) can enhance the efficacy of hMSCs on alleviation of pain sensation. A rat model of chronic constriction injury (CCI) mimicking peripheral nerve injury was incorporated in the study. Paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) and paw withdrawal latency (PWL) testing were used to measure pain-related behavior. Our results demonstrated that SIRT1 was decreased post-CCI surgery. Compared to hMSCs-control implantation, the hMSCs-SIRT1 (hMSCs overexpressing SIRT1) implantation exhibited superior effects on reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in serum and spinal dorsal horn, while ameliorating neuropathic pain in CCI rat. Engineering hMSCs such as overexpressing SIRT1 may serve as a promising strategy for the treatment of patients with neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Ghrelin (Ghre), a gut–brain peptide hormone, plays an important role in the entire olfactory system and in food behavior regulation. In the last years, it has aroused particular interest for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties. Our previous research showed that Ghre and its receptor are expressed by peculiar glial cells of the olfactory system: Olfactory Ensheathing Cells (OECs). These cells are able to secrete different neurotrophic factors, promote axonal growth, and show stem cell characteristics. The aim of this work was to study, in an in vitro model, the effect of Ghre on both cell viability and the expression of some neural markers, such as Nestin (Ne), Glial Fibrillary Acid Protein (GFAP), Neuregulin (Neu), and β-III-tubulin (Tuj1), in primary mouse OEC cultures. The MTT test and immunocytochemical procedures were used to highlight cell viability and marker expression, respectively. Our results demonstrate that Ghre, after 7 days of treatment, exerted a positive effect, stimulating OEC viability compared with cells without Ghre treatment. In addition, Ghre was able to modify the expression of some biomarkers, increasing Neu and Tuj1 expression, while GFAP was constant; on the contrary, the presence of positive Ne cells was drastically reduced after 7 days, and this showed a loss of stem cell characteristic and therefore the possible orientation towards an adult neural phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Microbes like viruses, bacteria, and fungi have all been reported in the brain of Alzheimer’s postmortem patients and/or AD mouse model; however, the relationship between brain microbes and Aβ plaque deposition remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we first analyzed bacteria populations in the brain of 4-, 5-, and 6-month-old APP/PS1 mice and then examined the Aβ-positive loads of APP/PS1 mouse at 9 months old to identify bacteria in the brain by 16S rDNA sequencing. Finally, blood–brain barrier permeability was measured by injecting dextrans through the tail vein. Surprisingly, the diversity of microbial community gradually decreased in APP/PS1 mouse while wild-type mouse showed no obvious regularity. Moreover, Aβ-positive deposits in the brain showed a significantly higher relative abundance of microbiota than Aβ-negative tissues and age-matched wild-type mouse brain tissues. In addition, an increase in blood–brain barrier permeability was also observed in APP/PS1 mouse. The present study revealed the exact location of microbes within the Aβ plaques in the brain and suggested the potential antimicrobial effect of the Aβ peptide. We strongly recommend that future research on microbiota-related AD pathology should focus on the migration route of microbiota into the brain and how the microbiota enhance AD progression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Neurodegenerative disorders have become the leading cause of chronic pain and death. Treatments available are not sufficient to help the patients as they only alleviate the symptoms and not the cause. In this regard, stem cells therapy has emerged as an upcoming option for the replacement of dead and damaged neurons. Stem cells, in general, are characterized as cells exhibiting potency properties, i.e., on being subjected to specific conditions they transform into cells of another lineage. Of all the types, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known for their pluripotent nature without the obstacle of ethical concern surrounding the procurement of other cell types. Although fibroblasts are quite similar to MSCs morphologically, certain markers like CD73, CD 90 are specific to MSCs, making both the cell types distinguishable from each other. This is implemented while procuring MSCs from a plethora of sources like umbilical cord blood, adipose tissue, bone marrow, etc. Among these, bone marrow MSCs are the most widely used type for neural regeneration. Neural regeneration is achieved via transdifferentiation. Several studies have either transplanted the stem cells into rodent models or have carried out transdifferentiation in vitro. The process involves a combination of growth factors, pre-treatment factors, and neuronal differentiation inducing mediums. The results obtained are characterized by neuron-like morphology, expression of markers, along with electrophysical activity in some. Recent attempts involve exploring biomaterials that may mimic the native ECM and therefore can be directly introduced at the site of interest. The review gives a brief description of MSCs, their sources and markers, and the different attempts that have been made towards achieving the goal of differentiating MSCs into neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cohen syndrome (CS) is an autosomal recessive congenital disorder characterized by mutation in the vacuolar protein sorting 13 homolog B (VPS13B; formerly COH1) gene. In the current study, a Chinese family has two young sibling cases having a developmental delay, physical obesity, high myopia, and a special face, which suspected to be CS. The purpose of the study was to identify variants and further analyze their pathogenicity for CS. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) revealed a compound heterozygous mutation in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;VPS13B&lt;/em&gt; gene in the proband, which comprises a frameshift mutation in NM_017890.4: c.10076_10077delCA (p.T3359fs*29) and a putative splice site mutation in c.6940 + 1G &amp;gt; T. Both Minigene assay in vitro and splicing assay in vivo confirmed that the splicing mutation in c.6940 + 1G &amp;gt; T generates a frameshift transcript with whole exon 38 skipping. Eventually, quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated that either of the two mutations can lead to degradation of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;VPS13B&lt;/em&gt; gene at the transcriptional level. Functional studies of variants identified in CS patients are essential for their subsequent genetic counseling and prenatal diagnoses and could also be the start point for new therapeutic approaches, currently based only on symptomatic treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The central nervous system (CNS) responds to diverse neurologic injuries with a vigorous activation of astrocytes. In addition to their role in the maintenance of CNS homeostasis and neuronal function, astrocytes are thought to participate in the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses in the CNS. Following antigen recognition, reactive astrocytes may participate in the initiation of innate immune responses, and modulate adaptive immune response leading to the recruitment of peripheral immune cells. Among activation, astrocytes undergo morphological changes and express several molecules, e.g., chemokines. Lipocalin 2 (LCN2) is involved in the control of innate immune responses, regulation of excess iron, and reactive oxygen production. Here, we investigated the influence of LCN2 on basic astrocytic functions linked to inflammatory responses. In vitro studies revealed a similar chemokine expression pattern in wild-type and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Lcn2&lt;/em&gt;-deficient astrocyte cultures after treatment with lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Increased wound closure and morphological changes upon LPS treatment are independent of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Lcn2&lt;/em&gt; expression. We conclude that LCN2 is not necessary for basic astrocytic functions in the context of inflammation. However, CNS-derived LCN2 might have a regulatory effect on other cells, e.g., endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The principle of constraint-induced therapy is widely practiced in rehabilitation. In hemiplegic cerebral palsy (CP) with impaired contralateral corticospinal projection due to unilateral injury, function improves after imposing a temporary constraint on limbs from the less affected hemisphere. This type of partially-reversible impairment in motor control by early brain injury bears a resemblance to the experience-dependent plastic acquisition and modification of neuronal response selectivity in the visual cortex. Previously, such mechanism was modeled within the framework of BCM (Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro) theory, a rate-based synaptic modification theory. Here, we demonstrate a minimally complex yet sufficient neural network model which provides a fundamental explanation for inter-hemispheric competition using a simplified spike-based model of information transmission and plasticity. We emulate the restoration of function in hemiplegic CP by simulating the competition between cells of the ipsilateral and contralateral corticospinal tracts. We use a high-speed hardware neural simulation to provide realistic numbers of spikes and realistic magnitudes of synaptic modification. We demonstrate that the phenomenon of constraint-induced partial reversal of hemiplegia can be modeled by simplified neural descending tracts with 2 layers of spiking neurons and synapses with spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). We further demonstrate that persistent hemiplegia following unilateral cortical inactivation or deprivation is predicted by the STDP-based model but is inconsistent with BCM model. Although our model is a highly simplified and limited representation of the corticospinal system, it offers an explanation of how constraint as an intervention can help the system to escape from a suboptimal solution. This is a display of an emergent phenomenon from the synaptic competition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Pain is a complex, multidimensional experience that involves dynamic interactions between sensory-discriminative and affective-emotional processes. Pain experiences have a high degree of variability depending on their context and prior anticipation. Viewing pain perception as a perceptual inference problem, we propose a predictive coding paradigm to characterize evoked and non-evoked pain. We record the local field potentials (LFPs) from the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of freely behaving rats—two regions known to encode the sensory-discriminative and affective-emotional aspects of pain, respectively. We further use predictive coding to investigate the temporal coordination of oscillatory activity between the S1 and ACC. Specifically, we develop a phenomenological predictive coding model to describe the macroscopic dynamics of bottom-up and top-down activity. Supported by recent experimental data, we also develop a biophysical neural mass model to describe the mesoscopic neural dynamics in the S1 and ACC populations, in both naive and chronic pain-treated animals. Our proposed predictive coding models not only replicate important experimental findings, but also provide new prediction about the impact of the model parameters on the physiological or behavioral read-out—thereby yielding mechanistic insight into the uncertainty of expectation, placebo or nocebo effect, and chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;An important problem in systems neuroscience is to understand how information is communicated among brain regions, and it has been proposed that communication is mediated by neuronal oscillations, such as rhythms in the gamma band. We sought to investigate this idea by using a network model with two components, a source (sending) and a target (receiving) component, both built to resemble local populations in the cerebral cortex. To measure the effectiveness of communication, we used population-level correlations in spike times between the source and target. We found that after correcting for a response time that is independent of initial conditions, spike-time correlations between the source and target are significant, due in large measure to the alignment of firing events in their gamma rhythms. But, we also found that regular oscillations cannot produce the results observed in our model simulations of cortical neurons. Surprisingly, it is the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;irregularity&lt;/em&gt; of gamma rhythms, the absence of internal clocks, together with the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;malleability&lt;/em&gt; of these rhythms and their tendency to align with external pulses — features that are known to be present in gamma rhythms in the real cortex — that produced the results observed. These findings and the mechanistic explanations we offered are our primary results. Our secondary result is a mathematical relationship between correlations and the sizes of the samples used for their calculation. As improving technology enables recording simultaneously from increasing numbers of neurons, this relationship could be useful for interpreting results from experimental recordings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Excitatory synaptic signaling in cortical circuits is thought to be metabolically expensive. Two fundamental brain functions, learning and memory, are associated with long-term synaptic plasticity, but we know very little about energetics of these slow biophysical processes. This study investigates the energy requirement of information storing in plastic synapses for an extended version of BCM plasticity with a decay term, stochastic noise, and nonlinear dependence of neuron’s firing rate on synaptic current (adaptation). It is shown that synaptic weights in this model exhibit bistability. In order to analyze the system analytically, it is reduced to a simple dynamic mean-field for a population averaged plastic synaptic current. Next, using the concepts of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, we derive the energy rate (entropy production rate) for plastic synapses and a corresponding Fisher information for coding presynaptic input. That energy, which is of chemical origin, is primarily used for battling fluctuations in the synaptic weights and presynaptic firing rates, and it increases steeply with synaptic weights, and more uniformly though nonlinearly with presynaptic firing. At the onset of synaptic bistability, Fisher information and memory lifetime both increase sharply, by a few orders of magnitude, but the plasticity energy rate changes only mildly. This implies that a huge gain in the precision of stored information does not have to cost large amounts of metabolic energy, which suggests that synaptic information is not directly limited by energy consumption. Interestingly, for very weak synaptic noise, such a limit on synaptic coding accuracy is imposed instead by a derivative of the plasticity energy rate with respect to the mean presynaptic firing, and this relationship has a general character that is independent of the plasticity type. An estimate for primate neocortex reveals that a relative metabolic cost of BCM type synaptic plasticity, as a fraction of neuronal cost related to fast synaptic transmission and spiking, can vary from negligible to substantial, depending on the synaptic noise level and presynaptic firing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;An inverse procedure is developed and tested to recover functional and structural information from global signals of brains activity. The method assumes a leaky-integrate and fire model with excitatory and inhibitory neurons, coupled via a directed network. Neurons are endowed with a heterogenous current value, which sets their associated dynamical regime. By making use of a heterogenous mean-field approximation, the method seeks to reconstructing from global activity patterns the distribution of in-coming degrees, for both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, as well as the distribution of the assigned currents. The proposed inverse scheme is first validated against synthetic data. Then, time-lapse acquisitions of a zebrafish larva recorded with a two-photon light sheet microscope are used as an input to the reconstruction algorithm. A power law distribution of the in-coming connectivity of the excitatory neurons is found. Local degree distributions are also computed by segmenting the whole brain in sub-regions traced from annotated atlas.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Human life consists of a multitude of diverse and interconnected events. However, extant research has focused on how humans segment and remember discrete events from continuous input, with far less attention given to how the structure of connections between events impacts memory. We conducted an fMRI study in which subjects watched and recalled a series of realistic audiovisual narratives. By transforming narratives into networks of events, we found that more central events-those with stronger semantic or causal connections to other events-were better remembered. During encoding, central events evoked larger hippocampal event boundary responses associated with memory consolidation. During recall, high centrality predicted stronger activation in cortical areas involved in episodic recollection, and more similar neural representations across individuals. Together, these results suggest that when humans encode and retrieve complex real-world experiences, the reliability and accessibility of memory representations is shaped by their location within a network of events.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Costs and benefits of using rhythmic rate codes</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.24.441276v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Neural oscillations are one of the most well known macroscopic phenomena observed in the nervous system, and the benefits of this kind of coding have been the topic of frequent analysis. Many of these studies focused on communication between populations which were already oscillating, and sought to understand how synchrony and communication interact. In this paper, take an alternative approach. We focus on measuring the costs, and benefits, of moving to an from an aperiodic code to a rhythmic one. We utilize a Linear-Nonlinear Poisson model, and assume a rate code. We report that no one factor seems to predict the costs, or benefits, of translating into a rhythmic code. Instead the synaptic connection type, strength, population size, and stimulus and oscillation firing rates interact in a variety of nonlinear ways. We suggest a number of experiments that might be used to confirm these predictions.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons selectively drive coordinated motor learning in mice</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.24.441273v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Motor control requires precise temporal and spatial encoding across distinct motor centers that is refined through the repetition of learning. The coordination of circuit refinement across motor regions requires modulatory input to shape circuit activity. Here we identify a role for the baso-cortical cholinergic pathway in the acquisition of a coordinated motor skill in mice. Targeted depletion of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons results in significant impairments in training on the rotarod task of coordinated movement. Cholinergic neuromodulation is required during training sessions as chemogenetic inactivation of cholinergic neurons also impairs task acquisition. Rotarod learning drives coordinated refinement of corticostriatal neurons arising in both medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and motor cortex, and we have found that cholinergic input to both motor regions is required for task acquisition. Critically, the effects of cholinergic neuromodulation are restricted to the acquisition stage, as depletion of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons after learning does not affect task execution. Our results indicate a critical role for cholinergic neuromodulation of distant cortical motor centers during coordinated motor learning.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.24.441237v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The development of the cerebral cortex relies on the controlled division of neural stem and progenitor cells. The requirement for precise spatiotemporal control of proliferation and cell fate places a high demand on the cell division machinery, and defective cell division can cause microcephaly and other brain malformations. Cell-extrinsic and intrinsic factors govern the capacity of cortical progenitors to produce large numbers of neurons and glia within a short developmental time window. In particular, ion channels shape the intrinsic biophysical properties of precursor cells and neurons and control their membrane potential throughout the cell cycle. We found that hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated cation (HCN)-channel subunits are expressed in mouse, rat, and human neural progenitors. Loss of HCN-channel function in rat neural stem cells impaired their proliferation by affecting the cell-cycle progression, causing G1 accumulation and dysregulation of genes associated with human microcephaly. Transgene-mediated, dominant-negative loss of HCN-channel function in the embryonic mouse telencephalon resulted in pronounced microcephaly. Together, our findings suggest a novel role for HCN-channel subunits as a part of a general mechanism influencing cortical development in mammals.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.23.441218v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The brain must extract behaviorally relevant latent variables from the signals streamed by the sensory organs. Such latent variables are often encoded in the dynamics that generated the signal rather than in the specific realization of the waveform. Therefore, one problem faced by the brain is to segment time series based on underlying dynamics. We present two algorithms for performing this segmentation task that are biologically plausible, which we define as acting in a streaming setting and all learning rules being local. One algorithm is model-based and can be derived from an optimization problem involving a mixture of autoregressive processes. This algorithm relies on feedback in the form of a prediction error, and can also be used for forecasting future samples. In some brain regions, such as the retina, the feedback connections necessary to use the prediction error for learning are absent. For this case, we propose a second, model-free algorithm that uses a running estimate of the autocorrelation structure of the signal to perform the segmentation. We show that both algorithms do well when tasked with segmenting signals drawn from autoregressive models with piecewise-constant parameters. In particular, the segmentation accuracy is similar to that obtained from oracle-like methods in which the ground-truth parameters of the autoregressive models are known. We provide implementations of our algorithms at https://github.com/ttesileanu/bio-time-series.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The cannabinoid agonist CB-13 produces peripherally mediated analgesia in mice but elicits tolerance and signs of CNS activity with repeated dosing</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.23.441212v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Activation of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) produces analgesia in a variety of preclinical models of pain; however, engagement of central CB1 receptors is accompanied by unwanted side effects, such as tolerance and dependence. Efforts to develop novel analgesics have focused on targeting peripheral CB1 receptors to circumvent central CB1-related side effects. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of acute and repeated dosing with the peripherally selective CB1-preferring agonist CB-13 on nociception and central CB1-related phenotypes in an inflammatory model of pain in mice. We also evaluated cellular mechanisms underlying CB-13-induced antinociception in vitro using cultured mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. CB-13 reduced inflammation-induced mechanical allodynia in a peripheral CB1 receptor-dependent manner and relieved inflammatory thermal hyperalgesia. In cultured mouse DRG neurons, CB-13 reduced TRPV1 sensitization and neuronal hyperexcitability induced by the inflammatory mediator prostaglandin E2, providing potential mechanistic explanations for the analgesic actions of peripheral CB1 receptor activation. With acute dosing, phenotypes associated with central CB1 receptor activation occurred only at a dose of CB-13 approximately 10-fold the ED50 for reducing allodynia. Strikingly, repeated dosing resulted in both analgesic tolerance and CB1 receptor dependence, even at a dose that did not produce central CB1 receptor-mediated phenotypes on acute dosing. This suggests repeated CB-13 dosing leads to increased CNS exposure and unwanted engagement of central CB1 receptors. Thus, caution is warranted regarding therapeutic use of CB-13 with the goal of avoiding CNS side effects. Nonetheless, the clear analgesic effect of acute peripheral CB1 receptor activation suggests that peripherally restricted cannabinoids are a viable target for novel analgesic development.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.23.441199v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Functional interactions between G protein-coupled receptors are poised to enhance neuronal sensitivity to neuromodulators and therapeutic drugs. Mu and Delta opioid receptors (MORs and DORs) can interact when overexpressed in the same cells, but whether co-expression of endogenous MORs and DORs in neurons leads to functional interactions is unclear. Here, we show that both MORs and DORs inhibit parvalbumin-expressing basket cells (PV-BCs) in hippocampal CA1 through partially occlusive signaling pathways that terminate on somato-dendritic potassium channels and presynaptic calcium channels. Using photoactivatable opioid neuropeptides, we find that DORs dominate the response to enkephalin in terms of both ligand-sensitivity and kinetics, which may be due to relatively low expression levels of MOR. Opioid-activated potassium channels do not show heterologous desensitization, indicating that MORs and DORs signal independently. In a direct test for heteromeric functional interactions, the DOR antagonist TIPP-Psi does not alter the kinetics or potency of either the potassium channel or synaptic responses to photorelease of the MOR agonist DAMGO. Thus, despite largely redundant and convergent signaling, MORs and DORs do not functionally interact in PV-BCs. These findings imply that crosstalk between MORs and DORs, either in the form of physical interactions or synergistic intracellular signaling, is not a preordained outcome of co-expression in neurons.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Class A G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) normally function as monomers, although evidence from heterologous expression systems suggests they may form homodimers and/or heterodimers. Detection of GPCR dimers in native tissues has however been challenging due to the lack of suitable tools. - and {delta}-Opioid receptors (MORs and DORs) co-expressed in transfected cells has been reported to form heterodimers. The co-localization of MORs and DORs in neurons has been studied in knock-in mice expressing genetically engineered receptors fused to fluorescent proteins. Here we report that single cholinergic neurons in the mouse striatum endogenously express both MORs and DORs. The receptors were fluorescently labeled in live brain slices with a ligand-directed labeling reagent, NAI-A594. The selective activation of MORs and DORs, with DAMGO (-agonist) and deltorphin ({delta}-agonist) inhibited spontaneous firing in all cells examined. In the continued presence of agonist, the firing rate returned to baseline with the application of deltorphin but was persistently inhibited with the application of DAMGO. In addition, agonist-induced internalization of DORs but not MORs was detected. When MORs and DORs were activated simultaneously with [Met5]enkephalin, desensitization of MORs was facilitated but internalization was not increased. Together, these results indicate that while MORs and DORs are expressed in single striatal cholinergic interneurons, the two receptors function independently.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Prevalence, symptoms, and treatment of depression all point toward major sex differences. Social stress-induced neurovascular pathology is associated with depressive symptoms in male mice however it remains unknown if it contributes to this sexual dimorphism. Here, we report that chronic social and subchronic variable stress promoted sex-specific blood-brain barrier (BBB) molecular and morphological alterations in mood-related brain regions. Viral-mediated functional manipulation leading to a targeted disruption of the BBB induced anxiety- and depression-like behaviors including social avoidance and anhedonia. Endothelium cell-specific transcriptomic profiling revealed key pathways and novel genes involved in maladaptive stress responses vs resilience. We also confirmed BBB leakiness in the brain of stressed females which led us to explore and identify circulating vascular biomarkers of chronic stress that could inform on diagnosis and treatment. Importantly, these pre-clinical findings were validated in human blood and postmortem brain samples from depressed women, thus highlighting their translational value. By revealing a sex-specific causal role of BBB dysfunction in stress responses and depression, our results implicate vascular impairment as a major factor underlying mood disorders.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.23.440964v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Cilia on neurons play critical roles in both the development and function of the central nervous system (CNS). While it remains challenging to elucidate the precise roles for neuronal cilia, it is clear that a subset of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) preferentially localize to the cilia membrane. Further, ciliary GPCR signaling has been implicated in regulating a variety of behaviors. Melanin concentrating hormone receptor 1 (Mchr1), is a GPCR expressed centrally in rodents known to be enriched in cilia. Here we have used MCHR1 as a model ciliary GPCR to develop a strategy to fluorescently tag receptors expressed from the endogenous locus in vivo. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we inserted the coding sequence of the fluorescent protein mCherry into the N-terminus of Mchr1. Analysis of the fusion protein (mCherryMCHR1) revealed its localization to neuronal cilia in the CNS, across multiple developmental time points and in various regions of the adult brain. Our approach simultaneously produced fortuitous in/dels altering the Mchr1 start codon resulting in a new MCHR1 knockout line. Functional studies using electrophysiology show a significant alteration of synaptic strength in MCHR1 knockout mice. A reduction in strength is also detected in mice homozygous for the mCherry insertion, suggesting that while the strategy is useful for monitoring the receptor, activity could be altered. However, both lines should aid in studies of MCHR1 function and contribute to our understanding of MCHR1 signaling in the brain. Additionally, this approach could be expanded to aid in the study of other ciliary GPCRs.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/r-92OwQVJvo/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Jan Stenum, Cristina Rossi, Ryan T. Roemmich&lt;/p&gt;

Human gait analysis is often conducted in clinical and basic research, but many common approaches (e.g., three-dimensional motion capture, wearables) are expensive, immobile, data-limited, and require expertise. Recent advances in video-based pose estimation suggest potential for gait analysis using two-dimensional video collected from readily accessible devices (e.g., smartphones). To date, several studies have extracted features of human gait using markerless pose estimation. However, we currently lack evaluation of video-based approaches using a dataset of human gait for a wide range of gait parameters on a stride-by-stride basis and a workflow for performing gait analysis from video. Here, we compared spatiotemporal and sagittal kinematic gait parameters measured with OpenPose (open-source video-based human pose estimation) against simultaneously recorded three-dimensional motion capture from overground walking of healthy adults. When assessing all individual steps in the walking bouts, we observed mean absolute errors between motion capture and OpenPose of 0.02 s for temporal gait parameters (i.e., step time, stance time, swing time and double support time) and 0.049 m for step lengths. Accuracy improved when spatiotemporal gait parameters were calculated as individual participant mean values: mean absolute error was 0.01 s for temporal gait parameters and 0.018 m for step lengths. The greatest difference in gait speed between motion capture and OpenPose was less than 0.10 m s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Mean absolute error of sagittal plane hip, knee and ankle angles between motion capture and OpenPose were 4.0°, 5.6° and 7.4°. Our analysis workflow is freely available, involves minimal user input, and does not require prior gait analysis expertise. Finally, we offer suggestions and considerations for future applications of pose estimation for human gait analysis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/r-92OwQVJvo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Many cell types display the remarkable ability to alter their cellular phenotype in response to specific external or internal signals. Such phenotypic plasticity is apparent in the nematode &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; when adverse environmental conditions trigger entry into the dauer diapause stage. This entry is accompanied by structural, molecular, and functional remodeling of a number of distinct tissue types of the animal, including its nervous system. The transcription factor (TF) effectors of 3 different hormonal signaling systems, the insulin-responsive DAF-16/FoxO TF, the TGFβ-responsive DAF-3/SMAD TF, and the steroid nuclear hormone receptor, DAF-12/VDR, a homolog of the vitamin D receptor (VDR), were previously shown to be required for entering the dauer arrest stage, but their cellular and temporal focus of action for the underlying cellular remodeling processes remained incompletely understood. Through the generation of conditional alleles that allowed us to spatially and temporally control gene activity, we show here that all 3 TFs are not only required to initiate tissue remodeling upon entry into the dauer stage, as shown before, but are also continuously required to maintain the remodeled state. We show that DAF-3/SMAD is required in sensory neurons to promote and then maintain animal-wide tissue remodeling events. In contrast, DAF-16/FoxO or DAF-12/VDR act cell-autonomously to control anatomical, molecular, and behavioral remodeling events in specific cell types. Intriguingly, we also uncover non-cell autonomous function of DAF-16/FoxO and DAF-12/VDR in nervous system remodeling, indicating the presence of several insulin-dependent interorgan signaling axes. Our findings provide novel perspectives into how hormonal systems control tissue remodeling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/KCzeoM6J2mE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Receptor-mediated yolk uptake is required for &lt;i&gt;oskar&lt;/i&gt; mRNA localization and cortical anchorage of germ plasm components in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; oocyte</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/4hWUnG5Fu1E/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Tsubasa Tanaka, Naoki Tani, Akira Nakamura&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; germ plasm is responsible for germ cell formation. Its assembly begins with localization of &lt;i&gt;oskar&lt;/i&gt; mRNA to the posterior pole of the oocyte. The &lt;i&gt;oskar&lt;/i&gt; translation produces 2 isoforms with distinct functions: short Oskar recruits germ plasm components, whereas long Oskar remodels actin to anchor the components to the cortex. The mechanism by which long Oskar anchors them remains elusive. Here, we report that Yolkless, which facilitates uptake of nutrient yolk proteins into the oocyte, is a key cofactor for long Oskar. Loss of Yolkless or depletion of yolk proteins disrupts the microtubule alignment and &lt;i&gt;oskar&lt;/i&gt; mRNA localization at the posterior pole of the oocyte, whereas microtubule-dependent localization of &lt;i&gt;bicoid&lt;/i&gt; mRNA to the anterior and &lt;i&gt;gurken&lt;/i&gt; mRNA to the anterior-dorsal corner remains intact. Furthermore, these mutant oocytes do not properly respond to long Oskar, causing defects in the actin remodeling and germ plasm anchoring. Thus, the yolk uptake is not merely the process for nutrient incorporation, but also crucial for &lt;i&gt;oskar&lt;/i&gt; mRNA localization and cortical anchorage of germ plasm components in the oocyte.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/4hWUnG5Fu1E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Avoiding organelle mutational meltdown across eukaryotes with or without a germline bottleneck</title>

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and plastid DNA (ptDNA) encode vital bioenergetic apparatus, and mutations in these organelle DNA (oDNA) molecules can be devastating. In the germline of several animals, a genetic “bottleneck” increases cell-to-cell variance in mtDNA heteroplasmy, allowing purifying selection to act to maintain low proportions of mutant mtDNA. However, most eukaryotes do not sequester a germline early in development, and even the animal bottleneck remains poorly understood. How then do eukaryotic organelles avoid Muller’s ratchet—the gradual buildup of deleterious oDNA mutations? Here, we construct a comprehensive and predictive genetic model, quantitatively describing how different mechanisms segregate and decrease oDNA damage across eukaryotes. We apply this comprehensive theory to characterise the animal bottleneck with recent single-cell observations in diverse mouse models. Further, we show that gene conversion is a particularly powerful mechanism to increase beneficial cell-to-cell variance without depleting oDNA copy number, explaining the benefit of observed oDNA recombination in diverse organisms which do not sequester animal-like germlines (for example, sponges, corals, fungi, and plants). Genomic, transcriptomic, and structural datasets across eukaryotes support this mechanism for generating beneficial variance without a germline bottleneck. This framework explains puzzling oDNA differences across taxa, suggesting how Muller’s ratchet is avoided in different eukaryotes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/mrvsEqfgoh4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by David S. Milner, Jeremy G. Wideman, Courtney W. Stairs, Cory D. Dunn, Thomas A. Richards&lt;/p&gt;

The overarching trend in mitochondrial genome evolution is functional streamlining coupled with gene loss; therefore, gene acquisition by mitochondria is considered to be exceedingly rare. Selfish elements in the form of self-splicing introns occur in many organellar genomes, but the wider diversity of selfish elements, and how they persist in the DNA of organelles, has not been explored. In the mitochondrial genome of a marine heterotrophic katablepharid protist, we identify a functional type II restriction modification (RM) system originating from a horizontal gene transfer (HGT) event involving bacteria related to flavobacteria. This RM system consists of an HpaII-like endonuclease and a cognate cytosine methyltransferase (CM). We demonstrate that these proteins are functional by heterologous expression in both bacterial and eukaryotic cells. These results suggest that a mitochondrial-encoded RM system can function as a toxin–antitoxin selfish element and that such elements could be co-opted by eukaryotic genomes to drive biased organellar inheritance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/z_T8RqQw6hU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

increased noise robustness, but most of them considered neither deep SNNs nor

SNNs with various neural coding methods and present a noise-robust deep SNN
with temporal information. With the proposed methods, we have achieved a deep

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: cMLSGA: A Co-Evolutionary Multi-Level Selection Genetic Algorithm for Multi-Objective Optimization. (arXiv:2104.11072v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11072</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In practical optimisation the dominant characteristics of the problem are
often not known prior. Therefore, there is a need to develop general solvers as
it is not always possible to tailor a specialised approach to each application.
The hybrid form of Multi-Level Selection Genetic Algorithm (MLSGA) already
shows good performance on range of problems due to its diversity-first
approach, which is rare among Evolutionary Algorithms. To increase the
generality of its performance this paper proposes a distinct set of
co-evolutionary mechanisms, which defines co-evolution as competition between
collectives rather than individuals. This distinctive approach to
co-evolutionary provides less regular communication between sub-populations and
different fitness definitions between individuals and collectives. This
encourages the collectives to act more independently creating a unique
sub-regional search, leading to the development of co-evolutionary MLSGA
(cMLSGA). To test this methodology nine genetic algorithms are selected to
generate several variants of cMLSGA, which incorporates these approaches at the
individual level. The new mechanisms are tested on over 100 different functions
and benchmarked against the 9 state-of-the-art competitors in order to find the
best general solver. The results show that the diversity of co-evolutionary
approaches is more important than their individual performances. This allows
the selection of two competing algorithms that improve the generality of
cMLSGA, without large loss of performance on any specific problem type. When
compared to the state-of-the-art, the proposed methodology is the most
universal and robust, leading to an algorithm more likely to solve complex
problems with limited knowledge about the search space.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Accurately predicting the performance of different optimization algorithms
for previously unseen problem instances is crucial for high-performing
algorithm selection and configuration techniques. In the context of numerical
optimization, supervised regression approaches built on top of exploratory
landscape analysis are becoming very popular. From the point of view of Machine
Learning (ML), however, the approaches are often rather naive, using default
regression or classification techniques without proper investigation of the
suitability of the ML tools. With this work, we bring to the attention of our
community the possibility to personalize regression models to specific types of
optimization problems. Instead of aiming for a single model that works well
across a whole set of possibly diverse problems, our personalized regression
approach acknowledges that different models may suite different types of
problems. Going one step further, we also investigate the impact of selecting
not a single regression model per problem, but personalized ensembles. We test
our approach on predicting the performance of numerical optimization heuristics
on the BBOB benchmark collection.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Differential brain connectivity patterns while listening to breakup and rebellious songs: A functional magnetic resonance imaging study. (arXiv:2104.10957v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10957</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Song appreciation involves a broad range of mental processes, and different
neural networks may be activated by different song types. The aim of the
present study was to show differential functional connectivity of the
prefrontal cortices while listening to breakup and rebellious songs. Breakup
songs describe romance and longing, whereas rebellious songs convey criticism
of conventional ideas or socio-cultural norms. We hypothesized that the medial
and lateral prefrontal cortices may interact with different brain regions in
response to these two song types. The functional magnetic resonance imaging
data of fifteen participants were collected while they were listening to two
complete breakup songs and two complete rebellious songs currently popular in
Taiwan. The results showed that listening to the breakup songs, compared to the
rebellious songs, enhanced the coupling between the medial prefrontal cortex
and several emotion-related regions, including the thalamus, caudate, amygdala,
hippocampus, and right inferior frontal gyrus. This coupling may reflect the
neural processes of pain empathy, reward processing, compassion, and
reappraisal in response to longing and sorrow expressed by the breakup songs.
Compared to the breakup songs, listening to the rebellious songs was associated
with enhanced coupling between subregions in the prefrontal and orbitofrontal
cortices. These areas might work in concert to support re-evaluation of
conventional ideas or socio-cultural norms as suggested by the rebellious
songs. This study advanced our understanding of the integration of brain
functions while processing complex information.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Continuous Learning and Adaptation with Membrane Potential and Activation Threshold Homeostasis. (arXiv:2104.10851v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10851</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Most classical (non-spiking) neural network models disregard internal neuron
dynamics and treat neurons as simple input integrators. However, biological
neurons have an internal state governed by complex dynamics that plays a
crucial role in learning, adaptation and the overall network activity and
behaviour. This paper presents the Membrane Potential and Activation Threshold
Homeostasis (MPATH) neuron model, which combines several biologically inspired
mechanisms to efficiently simulate internal neuron dynamics with a single
parameter analogous to the membrane time constant in biological neurons. The
model allows neurons to maintain a form of dynamic equilibrium by automatically
regulating their activity when presented with fluctuating input. One
consequence of the MPATH model is that it imbues neurons with a sense of time
without recurrent connections, paving the way for modelling processes that
depend on temporal aspects of neuron activity. Experiments demonstrate the
model's ability to adapt to and continually learn from its input.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Transitions among metastable states underlie context-dependent working memories in a multiple timescale network. (arXiv:2104.10829v1 [physics.bio-ph])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10829</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transitions between metastable states are commonly observed in the neural
system and underlie various cognitive functions such as working memory. In a
previous study, we have developed a neural network model with the slow and fast
populations, wherein simple Hebb-type learning enables stable and complex
(e.g., non-Markov) transitions between neural states. This model is distinct
from a network with asymmetric Hebbian connectivity and a network trained with
supervised machine learning methods: the former generates simple Markov
sequences. The latter generates complex but vulnerable sequences against
perturbation and its learning methods are biologically implausible. By using
our model, we propose and demonstrate a novel mechanism underlying stable
working memories: sequentially stabilizing and destabilizing task-related
states in the fast neural dynamics. The slow dynamics maintain a history of the
applied inputs, e.g., context signals, and enable the task-related states to be
stabilized in a context-dependent manner. We found that only a single (or a
few) state(s) is stabilized in each epoch (i.e., a period in the presence of
the context signal and a delayed period) in a working memory task, resulting in
a robust performance against noise and change in a task protocol. These results
suggest a simple mechanism underlying complex and stable processing in neural
systems.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The globus pallidus (GPe), as part of the basal ganglia, was once described
as a black box. As its functions were unclear, the GPe has been
underappreciated for decades. The advent of molecular tools has sparked a
resurgence in interest in the GPe. A recent flurry of publications has unveiled
the molecular landscape, synaptic organization, and functions of the GPe. It is
now clear that the GPe plays multifaceted roles in both motor and non-motor
functions, and is critically implicated in several motor disorders.
Accordingly, the GPe should no longer be considered as a mere homogeneous relay
within the so-called &quot;indirect pathway&quot;. Here we summarize the key findings,
challenges, consensuses, and disputes from the past few years.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Neuromorphic Algorithm-hardware Codesign for Temporal Pattern Learning. (arXiv:2104.10712v1 [cs.AR])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10712</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuromorphic computing and spiking neural networks (SNN) mimic the behavior
of biological systems and have drawn interest for their potential to perform
cognitive tasks with high energy efficiency. However, some factors such as
temporal dynamics and spike timings prove critical for information processing
but are often ignored by existing works, limiting the performance and
applications of neuromorphic computing. On one hand, due to the lack of
effective SNN training algorithms, it is difficult to utilize the temporal
neural dynamics. Many existing algorithms still treat neuron activation
statistically. On the other hand, utilizing temporal neural dynamics also poses
challenges to hardware design. Synapses exhibit temporal dynamics, serving as
memory units that hold historical information, but are often simplified as a
connection with weight. Most current models integrate synaptic activations in
some storage medium to represent membrane potential and institute a hard reset
of membrane potential after the neuron emits a spike. This is done for its
simplicity in hardware, requiring only a &quot;clear&quot; signal to wipe the storage
medium, but destroys temporal information stored in the neuron.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we derive an efficient training algorithm for Leaky Integrate
and Fire neurons, which is capable of training a SNN to learn complex spatial
temporal patterns. We achieved competitive accuracy on two complex datasets. We
also demonstrate the advantage of our model by a novel temporal pattern
association task. Codesigned with this algorithm, we have developed a CMOS
circuit implementation for a memristor-based network of neuron and synapses
which retains critical neural dynamics with reduced complexity. This circuit
implementation of the neuron model is simulated to demonstrate its ability to
react to temporal spiking patterns with an adaptive threshold.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: A Canonical Laminar Neocortical Circuit Whose Bottom-Up, Horizontal, and Top-Down Pathways Control Attention, Learning, and Prediction</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.650263</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;All perceptual and cognitive circuits in the human cerebral cortex are organized into layers. Specializations of a canonical laminar network of bottom-up, horizontal, and top-down pathways carry out multiple kinds of biological intelligence across different neocortical areas. This article describes what this canonical network is and notes that it can support processes as different as 3D vision and figure-ground perception; attentive category learning and decision-making; speech perception; and cognitive working memory (WM), planning, and prediction. These processes take place within and between multiple parallel cortical streams that obey computationally complementary laws. The interstream interactions that are needed to overcome these complementary deficiencies mix cell properties so thoroughly that some authors have noted the difficulty of determining what exactly constitutes a cortical stream and the differences between streams. The models summarized herein explain how these complementary properties arise, and how their interstream interactions overcome their computational deficiencies to support effective goal-oriented behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Spectrum Degradation of Hippocampal LFP During Euthanasia</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.647011</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The hippocampal local field potential (LFP) exhibits a strong correlation with behavior. During rest, the theta rhythm is not prominent, but during active behavior, there are strong rhythms in the theta, theta harmonics, and gamma ranges. With increasing running velocity, theta, theta harmonics and gamma increase in power and in cross-frequency coupling, suggesting that neural entrainment is a direct consequence of the total excitatory input. While it is common to study the parametric range between the LFP and its complementing power spectra between deep rest and epochs of high running velocity, it is also possible to explore how the spectra degrades as the energy is completely quenched from the system. Specifically, it is unknown whether the 1/f slope is preserved as synaptic activity becomes diminished, as low frequencies are generated by large pools of neurons while higher frequencies comprise the activity of more local neuronal populations. To test this hypothesis, we examined rat LFPs recorded from the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex during barbiturate overdose euthanasia. Within the hippocampus, the initial stage entailed a quasi-stationary LFP state with a power-law feature in the power spectral density. In the second stage, there was a successive erosion of power from high- to low-frequencies in the second stage that continued until the only dominant remaining power was &amp;lt;20 Hz. This stage was followed by a rapid collapse of power spectrum toward the absolute electrothermal noise background. As the collapse of activity occurred later in hippocampus compared with medial entorhinal cortex, it suggests that the ability of a neural network to maintain the 1/f slope with decreasing energy is a function of general connectivity. Broadly, these data support the energy cascade theory where there is a cascade of energy from large cortical populations into smaller loops, such as those that supports the higher frequency gamma rhythm. As energy is pulled from the system, neural entrainment at gamma frequency (and higher) decline first. The larger loops, comprising a larger population, are fault-tolerant to a point capable of maintaining their activity before a final collapse.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Influence of High Pass Filter Settings on Motor Evoked Potentials</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.665258</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;Motor evoked potentials (MEP), obtained by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) are a common tool in clinical research and diagnostic. Nevertheless, reports regarding the influence of filter settings on MEP are sparse. Here, we compared MEP amplitudes and signal to noise ratio (SNR) using multiple high pass filter (HPF) and notch filter settings.&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;Twenty healthy subjects were enrolled in the study. Recruitment curves were obtained with HPF settings varied at 10, 20, 50, and 100 Hz. The four HPF settings were tested both with and without 50 Hz active notch filter. Low pass filter was kept constant at 5 kHz.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;MEP amplitudes with HPF at 10 and 20 Hz were significantly higher than at 100 Hz, regardless of the notch filter. However, SNR did not differ among HPF settings. An active notch filter significantly improved SNR.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The reduction in MEP amplitudes with HPF above 20 Hz may be due to noise reduction, since the different HPF conditions did not alter SNR. Thus, higher HPF above 50 Hz may be an option to reduce noise, the use of a notch filter may even improve SNR.&lt;/p&gt;Significance&lt;p&gt;Our findings are relevant for the selection of filter settings and might be of importance to any researcher who utilizes TMS-MEP.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Modulation of Peak Alpha Frequency Oscillations During Working Memory Is Greater in Females Than Males</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.626406</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Peak alpha frequency is known to vary not just between individuals, but also within an individual over time. While variance in this metric between individuals has been tied to working memory performance, less understood are how short timescale modulations of peak alpha frequency during task performance may facilitate behavior. This gap in understanding may be bridged by consideration of a key difference between individuals: sex. Inconsistent findings in the literature regarding the relationship between peak alpha frequency and cognitive performance, as well as known sex-related-differences in peak alpha frequency and its modulation motivated our hypothesis that cognitive and neural processes underlying working memory—modulation of peak alpha frequency in particular—may differ based upon sex. Targeting sex as a predictive factor, we analyzed the EEG data of participants recorded while they performed four versions of a visual spatial working memory task. A significant difference between groups was present: females modulated peak alpha frequency more than males. Task performance did not differ by sex, yet a relationship between accuracy and peak alpha frequency was present in males, but not in females. These findings highlight the importance of considering sex as a factor in the study of oscillatory activity, particularly to further understanding of the neural mechanisms that underlie working memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Short-Term High-Intensity Interval Exercise Promotes Motor Cortex Plasticity and Executive Function in Sedentary Females</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.620958</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Previous research has demonstrated that regular exercise modulates motor cortical plasticity and cognitive function, but the influence of short-term high-intensity interval training (HIIT) remains unclear. In the present study, the effect of short-term HIIT on neuroplasticity and executive function was assessed in 32 sedentary females. Half of the participants undertook 2 weeks of HIIT. Paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (ppTMS) was used to measure motor cortical plasticity via short intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF). We further adapted the Stroop task using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to evaluate executive function in the participants. The results indicated that, compared with the control group, the HIIT group exhibited decreased ICF. In the Stroop task, the HIIT group displayed greater activation in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) even though no significant difference in task performance was observed. These findings indicate that short-term HIIT may modulate motor cortical plasticity and executive function at the neural level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Canavan Disease as a Model for Gene Therapy-Mediated Myelin Repair</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.661928</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the scientific and therapeutic fields for rare, genetic central nervous system (CNS) diseases such as leukodystrophies, or white matter disorders, have expanded significantly in part due to technological advancements in cellular and clinical screenings as well as remedial therapies using novel techniques such as gene therapy. However, treatments aimed at normalizing the pathological changes associated with leukodystrophies have especially been complicated due to the innate and variable effects of glial abnormalities, which can cause large-scale functional deficits in developmental myelination and thus lead to downstream neuronal impairment. Emerging research in the past two decades have depicted glial cells, particularly oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, as key, regulatory modulators in constructing and maintaining myelin function and neuronal viability. Given the significance of myelin formation in the developing brain, myelin repair in a time-dependent fashion is critical in restoring homeostatic functionality to the CNS of patients diagnosed with white matter disorders. Using Canavan Disease (CD) as a leukodystrophy model, here we review the hypothetical roles of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), one of the brain's most abundant amino acid derivatives, in Canavan disease's CNS myelinating pathology, as well as discuss the possible functions astrocytes serve in both CD and other leukodystrophies' time-sensitive disease correction. Through this analysis, we also highlight the potential remyelinating benefits of gene therapy for other leukodystrophies in which alternative CNS cell targeting for white matter disorders may be an applicable path for reparative treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Contribution of Microglia to the Development and Maturation of the Visual System</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.659843</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), were once considered quiescent cells that sat in readiness for reacting to disease and injury. Over the last decade, however, it has become clear that microglia play essential roles in maintaining the normal nervous system. The retina is an easily accessible part of the central nervous system and therefore much has been learned about the function of microglia from studies in the retina and visual system. Anatomically, microglia have processes that contact all synapses within the retina, as well as blood vessels in the major vascular plexuses. Microglia contribute to development of the visual system by contributing to neurogenesis, maturation of cone photoreceptors, as well as refining synaptic contacts. They can respond to neural signals and in turn release a range of cytokines and neurotrophic factors that have downstream consequences on neural function. Moreover, in light of their extensive contact with blood vessels, they are also essential for regulation of vascular development and integrity. This review article summarizes what we have learned about the role of microglia in maintaining the normal visual system and how this has helped in understanding their role in the central nervous system more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: The Neurotransmitter Receptor Architecture of the Mouse Olfactory System</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.632549</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The uptake, transmission and processing of sensory olfactory information is modulated by inhibitory and excitatory receptors in the olfactory system. Previous studies have focused on the function of individual receptors in distinct brain areas, but the receptor architecture of the whole system remains unclear. Here, we analyzed the receptor profiles of the whole olfactory system of adult male mice. We examined the distribution patterns of glutamatergic (AMPA, kainate, mGlu&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;, and NMDA), GABAergic (GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, GABA&lt;sub&gt;A(BZ)&lt;/sub&gt;, and GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;), dopaminergic (D&lt;sub&gt;1/5&lt;/sub&gt;) and noradrenergic (α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) neurotransmitter receptors by quantitative in vitro receptor autoradiography combined with an analysis of the cyto- and myelo-architecture. We observed that each subarea of the olfactory system is characterized by individual densities of distinct neurotransmitter receptor types, leading to a region- and layer-specific receptor profile. Thereby, the investigated receptors in the respective areas and strata showed a heterogeneous expression. Generally, we detected high densities of mGlu&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;Rs, GABA&lt;sub&gt;A(BZ)&lt;/sub&gt;Rs and GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs. Noradrenergic receptors revealed a highly heterogenic distribution, while the dopaminergic receptor D&lt;sub&gt;1/5&lt;/sub&gt; displayed low concentrations, except in the olfactory tubercle and the dorsal endopiriform nucleus. The similarities and dissimilarities of the area-specific multireceptor profiles were analyzed by a hierarchical cluster analysis. A three-cluster solution was found that divided the areas into the (1) olfactory relay stations (main and accessory olfactory bulb), (2) the olfactory cortex (anterior olfactory cortex, dorsal peduncular cortex, taenia tecta, piriform cortex, endopiriform nucleus, entorhinal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex) and the (3) olfactory tubercle, constituting its own cluster. The multimodal receptor-architectonic analysis of each component of the olfactory system provides new insights into its neurochemical organization and future possibilities for pharmaceutic targeting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) recordings (EEG-fMRI) can assess the interplay between complementary measures of brain activity and EEG changes to be localized to specific brain regions. We used a two-step approach, where we first examined changes related to a syndrome of mild cognitive impairment irrespective of pathology and then studied the specific impact of amyloid pathology. After detailed clinical and neuropsychological characterization as well as a positron emission tomography (PET) scans with the tracer 11-[C]-Pittsburgh Compound B to estimate cerebral amyloid deposition, 14 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (mean age 75.6 SD: 8.9) according to standard criteria and 21 cognitively healthy controls (HCS) (mean age 71.8 SD: 4.2) were assessed with EEG-fMRI. Thalamo-cortical alpha-fMRI signal coupling was only observed in HCS. Additional EEG-fMRI signal coupling differences between HCS and MCI were observed in parts of the default mode network, salience network, fronto-parietal network, and thalamus. Individuals with significant cerebral amyloid deposition (amyloid-positive MCI and HCS combined compared to amyloid-negative HCS) displayed abnormal EEG-fMRI signal coupling in visual, fronto-parietal regions but also in the parahippocampus, brain stem, and cerebellum. This finding was paralleled by stronger absolute fMRI signal in the parahippocampus and weaker absolute fMRI signal in the inferior frontal gyrus in amyloid-positive subjects. We conclude that the thalamocortical coupling in the alpha band in HCS more closely reflects previous findings observed in younger adults, while in MCI there is a clearly aberrant coupling in several networks dominated by an anticorrelation in the posterior cingulate cortex. While these findings may broadly indicate physiological changes in MCI, amyloid pathology was specifically associated with abnormal fMRI signal responses and disrupted coupling between brain oscillations and fMRI signal responses, which especially involve core regions of memory: the hippocampus, para-hippocampus, and lateral prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Post-transcriptional repression of circadian component CLOCK regulates cancer-stemness in murine breast cancer cells</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66155</link>
	<content:encoded>Disruption of the circadian clock machinery in cancer cells is implicated in tumor malignancy. Studies on cancer therapy reveal the presence of heterogeneous cells, including breast cancer stem-like cells (BCSCs), in breast tumors. BCSCs are often characterized by high aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, associated with the malignancy of cancers. In this study, we demonstrated the negative regulation of ALDH activity by the major circadian component CLOCK in murine breast cancer 4T1 cells. The expression of CLOCK was repressed in high-ALDH-activity 4T1, and enhancement of CLOCK expression abrogated their stemness properties, such as tumorigenicity and invasive potential. Furthermore, reduced expression of CLOCK in high-ALDH-activity 4T1 was post-transcriptionally regulated by microRNA: miR-182. Knockout of miR-182 restored the expression of CLOCK, resulted in preventing tumor growth. Our findings suggest that increased expression of CLOCK in BCSCs by targeting post-transcriptional regulation overcame stemness-related malignancy and may be a novel strategy for breast cancer treatments.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65962</link>
	<content:encoded>Many enveloped viruses induce multinucleated cells (syncytia), reflective of membrane fusion events caused by the same machinery that underlies viral entry. These syncytia are thought to facilitate replication and evasion of the host immune response. Here, we report that co-culture of human cells expressing the receptor ACE2 with cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike, results in synapse-like intercellular contacts that initiate cell-cell fusion, producing syncytia resembling those we identify in lungs of COVID-19 patients. To assess the mechanism of spike/ACE2-driven membrane fusion, we developed a microscopy-based, cell-cell fusion assay to screen ~6000 drugs and &amp;gt;30 spike variants. Together with quantitative cell biology approaches, the screen reveals an essential role for biophysical aspects of the membrane, particularly cholesterol-rich regions, in spike-mediated fusion, which extends to replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Our findings potentially provide a molecular basis for positive outcomes reported in COVID-19 patients taking statins, and suggest new strategies for therapeutics targeting the membrane of SARS-CoV-2 and other fusogenic viruses.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Tyramine induces dynamic RNP granule remodeling and translation activation in the Drosophila brain</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65742</link>
	<content:encoded>Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules are dynamic condensates enriched in regulatory RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and RNAs under tight spatiotemporal control. Extensive recent work has investigated the molecular principles underlying RNP granule assembly, unraveling that they form through the self-association of RNP components into dynamic networks of interactions. How endogenous RNP granules respond to external stimuli to regulate RNA fate is still largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate through high-resolution imaging of intact &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; brains that Tyramine induces a reversible remodeling of somatic RNP granules characterized by the decondensation of granule-enriched RBPs (e.g. Imp/ZBP1/IGF2BP) and helicases (e.g. Me31B/DDX-6/Rck). Furthermore, our functional analysis reveals that Tyramine signals both through its receptor TyrR and through the calcium-activated kinase CamkII to trigger RNP component decondensation. Finally, we uncover that RNP granule remodeling is accompanied by the rapid and specific translational activation of associated mRNAs. Thus, this work sheds new light on the mechanisms controlling cue-induced rearrangement of physiological RNP condensates.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>In humans, intradermal administration of β-alanine (ALA) and bovine adrenal medulla peptide 8–22 (BAM8-22) evokes the sensation of itch. Currently, it is unknown which human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons express the receptors of these pruritogens, MRGPRD and MRGPRX1, respectively, and which cutaneous afferents these pruritogens activate in primate. In situ hybridization studies revealed that MRGPRD and MRGPRX1 are co-expressed in a subpopulation of TRPV1+ human DRG neurons. In electrophysiological recordings in nonhuman primates (&lt;i&gt;Macaca nemestrina&lt;/i&gt;), subtypes of polymodal C-fiber nociceptors are preferentially activated by ALA and BAM8-22, with significant overlap. When pruritogens ALA, BAM8-22, and histamine, which activate different subclasses of C-fiber afferents, are administered in combination, human volunteers report itch and nociceptive sensations similar to those induced by a single pruritogen. Our results provide evidence for differences in pruriceptive processing between primates and rodents, and do not support the spatial contrast theory of coding of itch and pain.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63779</link>
	<content:encoded>Mechanical stress during cell migration may be a previously unappreciated source of genome instability, but the extent to which this happens in any animal &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; remains unknown. We consider an &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; system where the adult stem cells of planarian flatworms are required to migrate to a distal wound site. We observe a relationship between adult stem cell migration and ongoing DNA damage and repair during tissue regeneration. Migrating planarian stem cells undergo changes in nuclear shape and exhibit increased levels of DNA damage. Increased DNA damage levels reduce once stem cells reach the wound site. Stem cells in which DNA damage is induced prior to wounding take longer to initiate migration and migrating stem cell populations are more sensitive to further DNA damage than stationary stem cells. RNAi mediated knockdown of DNA repair pathway components blocks normal stem cell migration, confirming that active DNA repair pathways are required to allow successful migration to a distal wound site. Together these findings provide evidence that levels of Migration-Coupled-DNA-Damage (MCDD) are significant in adult stem cells and that ongoing migration requires DNA repair mechanisms. Our findings reveal that migration of normal stem cells in vivo represent an unappreciated source of damage, that could be a significant source of mutations in animals during development or during long term tissue homeostasis.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58591</link>
	<content:encoded>Peripheral nerves are organ-like structures containing diverse cell types to optimize function. This interactive assembly includes mostly axon-associated Schwann cells, but also endothelial cells of supporting blood vessels, immune system-associated cells, barrier-forming cells of the perineurium surrounding and protecting nerve fascicles, and connective tissue-resident cells within the intra-fascicular endoneurium and inter-fascicular epineurium. We have established transcriptional profiles of mouse sciatic nerve-inhabitant cells to foster the fundamental understanding of peripheral nerves. To achieve this goal, we have combined bulk RNA sequencing of developing sciatic nerves up to the adult with focused bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing of Schwann cells throughout postnatal development, extended by single-cell transcriptome analysis of the full sciatic nerve both perinatally and in the adult. The results were merged in the transcriptome resource Sciatic Nerve ATlas (SNAT: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.snat.ethz.ch&quot;&gt;https://www.snat.ethz.ch&lt;/a&gt;).

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55070</link>
	<content:encoded>The FOXM1 transcription factor is an oncoprotein and a top biomarker of poor prognosis in human cancer. Overexpression and activation of FOXM1 is frequent in high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), the most common and lethal form of human ovarian cancer, and is linked to copy number gains at chromosome 12p13.33. We show that &lt;i&gt;FOXM1&lt;/i&gt; is co-amplified and co-expressed with &lt;i&gt;RHNO1&lt;/i&gt;, a gene involved in the ATR-Chk1 signaling pathway that functions in the DNA replication stress (RS) response. We demonstrate that &lt;i&gt;FOXM1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;RHNO1&lt;/i&gt; are head-to-head (i.e. bidirectional) genes (BDG) regulated by a bidirectional promoter (BDP) (named F/R-BDP). FOXM1 and RHNO1 each promote oncogenic phenotypes in HGSC cells, including clonogenic growth, DNA homologous recombination repair (HR), and poly-ADP ribosylase (PARP) inhibitor resistance. FOXM1 and RHNO1 are one of the first examples of oncogenic BDG, and therapeutic targeting of FOXM1/RHNO1 BDG is a potential therapeutic approach for ovarian and other cancers.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.23.441147v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>While beta-band activity during motor planning is known to be modulated by uncertainty about where to act, less is known about its modulations to uncertainty about how to act. To investigate this issue, we recorded oscillatory brain activity with EEG while human participants (n = 17) performed a hand choice reaching task. The reaching hand was either predetermined or of participants choice, and the target was close to one of the two hands or at about equal distance from both. To measure neural activity in a motion-artifact-free time window, the location of the upcoming target was cued 1000-1500 ms before the presentation of the target, whereby the cue was valid in 50% of trials. As evidence for motor planning during the cueing phase, behavioral observations showed that the cue affected later hand choice. Furthermore, reaction times were longer in the choice than in the predetermined trials, supporting the notion of a competitive process for hand selection. Modulations of beta-band power over central cortical regions, but not alpha-band or theta-band power, were in line with these observations. During the cueing period, reaches in predetermined trials were preceded by larger decreases in beta-band power than reaches in choice trials. Cue direction did not affect reaction times or beta-band power, which may be due to the cue being invalid in 50% of trials, retaining effector uncertainty during motor planning. Our findings suggest that effector uncertainty, similar to target uncertainty, selectively modulates beta-band power during motor planning.

New &amp;amp; NoteworthyWhile reach-related beta-band power in central cortical areas is known to modulate with the number of potential targets, here we show, using a cueing paradigm, that the power in this frequency band, but not in the alpha or theta-band, is also modulated by the uncertainty of which hand to use. This finding supports the notion that multiple possible effector-specific actions can be specified in parallel up to the level of motor preparation.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: A key role of astrocytic calcium dynamics to link neuronal activity with the BOLD signal</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.23.441146v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) relies on the coupling between neuronal and vascular activity, but the mechanisms behind this coupling are still under discussion. Recent experimental evidence suggests that calcium signaling may play a significant role in neurovascular coupling. However, it is still controversial where this calcium signal is located (in neurons or elsewhere), how it operates and how relevant is its role. In this paper we introduce a biologically plausible model of the neurovascular coupling and we show that calcium signaling in astrocytes can explain the main aspects of the dynamics of the coupling. We find that calcium signaling can explain so-far unrelated features such as the linear and non-linear regimes, the negative vascular response (undershoot) and the emergence of a (calcium-driven) Hemodynamic Response Function. These features are reproduced here for the first time by a single model of the detailed neuronal-astrocyte-vascular pathway. Furthermore, we analyze how information is coded and transmitted from the neuronal to the vascular system and we find that frequency modulation of astrocytic calcium dynamics plays a key role in this process. Finally, our work provides a framework to link neuronal activity to the BOLD signal, and vice-versa, where neuronal activity can be inferred from the BOLD signal. This opens new ways to link known alterations of astrocytic calcium signaling in neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases) with detectable changes in neurovascular coupling.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are emerging as powerful players in cell-to-cell communication both in health and diseased brain. In Parkinson's disease (PD), characterized by selective dopaminergic (DAergic) neuron death in ventral midbrain (VMB) and degeneration of DAergic terminals in striatum (STR), astrocytes (AS) exert dual harmful/protective functions. When activated by chemokine CCL3, AS promote a robust DAergic neuroprotection both in cellular and pre-clinical models of PD, with mechanisms not fully elucidated. Here we used a combination of techniques to characterize AS-EVs derived from VMB and STR, and investigated their potential to exert neuroprotection. First, we show that: (i) AS of both regions secrete small EVs of 100 nm; (ii) VMB-AS release more EVs per cell than STR-AS under basal conditions; and (iii) only VMB-AS respond to CCL3 by producing more EVs, suggesting differential AS-EV secretion rate according to PD brain region. Next, addressing AS-EV potential against oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicity, we found that AS-EVs, especially CCL3-AS-EVs, fully counteract H2O2-induced caspase-3 activation. Furthermore, using high resolution respirometry, we demonstrated that AS-EVs rescue the neuronal mitochondrial complex I function impaired by MPP+, with VMB-AS-EVs fully restoring ATP production in MPP+-injured neurons, highlighting a regional diversity of AS-EVs with neuroprotective implications for PD.</content:encoded>

For context-dependent decision-making, one rich solution is to project task representations onto low-dimensional and orthogonal manifolds.

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.23.441123v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Previous researches demonstrate that major depression disorder (MDD) is associated with widespread network dysconnectivity, and the dynamics of functional connectivity networks are important to delineate the neural mechanisms of MDD. Cortical electroencephalography (EEG) oscillations act as coordinators to connect different brain regions, and various assemblies of oscillations can form different networks to support different cognitive tasks. Studies have demonstrated that the dysconnectivity of EEG oscillatory networks is related with MDD. In this study, we investigated the oscillatory hyperconnectivity and hypoconnectivity networks in MDD under a naturalistic and continuous stimuli condition of music listening. With the assumption that the healthy group and the MDD group share similar brain topology from the same stimuli and also retain individual brain topology for group differences, we applied the coupled nonnegative tensor decomposition algorithm on two adjacency tensors with the dimension of time x frequency x connectivity x subject, and imposed double-coupled constraints on spatial and spectral modes. The music-induced oscillatory networks were identified by a correlation analysis approach based on the permutation test between extracted temporal factors and musical features. We obtained three hyperconnectivity networks from the individual features of MDD and three hypoconnectivity networks from common features. The results demonstrated that the dysfunction of oscillation-modulated networks could affect the involvement in music perception for MDD patients. Those oscillatory dysconnectivity networks may provide promising references to reveal the pathoconnectomics of MDD and potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of MDD.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.23.441122v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Medial septal glutamatergic neurons are active during theta oscillations and locomotor activity. Prolonged optogenetic activation of medial septal glutamatergic neurons drives theta oscillations and locomotion for extended periods of time outlasting the stimulus duration. However, the cellular and circuit mechanisms supporting the maintenance of both theta oscillations and locomotion remain elusive. Specifically, it remains unclear whether the presence of theta oscillations is a necessary prerequisite for locomotion, and whether neuronal activity within the medial septum underlies its persistence. Here we show that a persistent theta oscillation can be induced by a brief transient activation of glutamatergic neurons. Moreover, persistent locomotion is initiated even if the theta oscillation is abolished by blocking synaptic transmission in the medial septum. We observe persistent spiking of medial septal neurons that outlasts the stimulus for several seconds, both in vivo and in vitro. This persistent activity is driven by intrinsic excitability of glutamatergic neurons.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.23.441107v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Mirror overflow is involuntary movement that accompanies unilateral voluntary movement on the opposite side of the body, and is commonly seen in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Children with ADHD show asymmetry in mirror overflow between dominant and non-dominant hand, yet there are competing mechanistic accounts of why this occurs. Using EEG during a sequential, unimanual finger-tapping task, we found that children with ADHD exhibited significantly more mirror overflow than typically developing (TD) controls, especially during the tapping of the non-dominant hand. Furthermore, source-level EEG oscillation analysis revealed that children with ADHD showed decreased alpha (8-12 Hz) event-related desynchronization (ERD) compared with controls in both hemispheres, but only during tapping of the non-dominant hand. Moreover, only the ERD ipsilateral to the mirror overflow during non-dominant hand movement correlated with both magnitude of overflow movements and higher ADHD symptom severity (Conners ADHD Hyperactivity/Impulsiveness scale) in children with ADHD. TD controls did not show these relationships. Our findings suggest that EEG differences in finger-tapping in ADHD are related primarily to voluntary movement in the non-dominant hand. Our results are also consistent with the Ipsilateral Corticospinal Tract (CST) Hypothesis, which posits that the atypical persistence of mirror overflow in ADHD may originate in the sensorimotor areas ipsilateral to mirror overflow and be transmitted via non-decussating CST fibers.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Trauma memories can appear dissociated from their original temporal context, and are often relived as they occur in the here-and-now. Potentially these temporal distortions already occur during encoding of the aversive experience as a consequence of stress. Here, 86 participants were subjected to either a stress or control induction, after which they learned the temporal structure of four virtual days. In these virtual days, time was scaled and participants could use clock cues to construe the passage of time within a day. We examined whether stress causes a shift in the learning strategy from one based on virtual time to one based on event sequence. Our results do not show a discernible impact of stress on memory for temporal context, in terms of both sequence memory and more fine-grained representations of time. The stress groups showed more extreme performance trajectories, either good or poor, across all measures. However, as time estimations were overall quite poor it is unclear to what extent this reflected a true strategy shift. Future avenues of research that can build on these findings are discussed.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Dopamine desynchronizes the retinal clock through a melanopsin-dependent regulation of acetylcholine retinal waves during development</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.23.441100v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Dopamine (DA) plays a critical role in retinal physiology, including resetting of the retinal circadian clock that in turn regulates DA release. DA acts on major classes of retinal cells by reconfiguring electrical and chemical synapses. Although a bidirectional regulation between intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin ganglion cells (ipRGCs) and dopaminergic cells has been demonstrated during development and adulthood, DA involvement in the ontogeny of the retinal clock is still unknown. Using wild-type Per2Luc and melanopsin knockout (Opn4-/-::Per2Luc) mice at different postnatal stages, we found that the retina can generate self-sustained circadian rhythms from postnatal day 5 that emerge in the absence of external time cues in both genotypes. Intriguingly, DA lengthens the endogenous period only in wild-type retinas, suggesting that this desynchronizing effect requires melanopsin. Furthermore, blockade of cholinergic retinal waves in wild-type retinas induces a shortening of the period, similarly to Opn4-/-::Per2Luc explants. Altogether, these data suggest that DA desynchronizes the retinal clock through a melanopsin-dependent regulation of acetylcholine retinal waves, thus offering a new role of melanopsin in setting the period of the retinal clock during development.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Narrative Event Segmentation in the Cortical Reservoir</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.23.441090v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>During continuous perception of movies or stories, awake humans display cortical activity patterns that reveal hierarchical segmentation of event structure.  Sensory areas like auditory cortex display high frequency segmentation related to the stimulus, while semantic areas like posterior middle cortex display a lower frequency segmentation related to transitions between events (Baldassano et al. 2017).  These hierarchical levels of segmentation are associated with different time constants for processing.  Chien and Honey (2020) observed that when two groups of participants heard the same sentence in a narrative, preceded by different contexts, neural responses for the groups were initially different and then gradually aligned.  The time constant for alignment followed the segmentation hierarchy: sensory cortices aligned most quickly, followed by mid-level regions, while some higher-order cortical regions took more than 10 seconds to align.  These hierarchical segmentation phenomena can be considered in the context of processing related to comprehension.  Uchida et al. (2021) recently described a model of discourse comprehension where word meanings are modeled by a language model pre-trained on a billion word corpus (Yamada et al 2020).  During discourse comprehension, word meanings are continuously integrated in a recurrent cortical network.  The model demonstrates novel discourse and inference processing, in part because of two fundamental characteristics: real-world event semantics are represented in the word embeddings, and these are integrated in a reservoir network which has an inherent gradient of functional time constants due to the recurrent connections.  Here we demonstrate how this model displays hierarchical narrative event segmentation properties.  The reservoir produces activation patterns that are segmented by the HMM of Baldassano et al (2017) in a manner that is comparable to that of humans.  Context construction displays a continuum of time constants across reservoir neuron subset, while context forgetting has a fixed time constant across these subsets.  Virtual areas formed by subgroups of reservoir neurons with faster time constants segmented with shorter events, while those with longer time constants preferred longer events.  This neurocomputational recurrent neural network simulates narrative event processing as revealed by the fMRI event segmentation algorithm of Baldassano et al (2017), and provides a novel explanation of the asymmetry in narrative forgetting and construction observed by Chien and Honey (2020).   The model extends the characterization of online integration processes in discourse to more extended narrative, and demonstrates how reservoir computing provides a useful model of cortical processing of narrative structure.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.23.441088v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>We propose here (the informed use) of a customised, data-driven machine-learning pipeline to analyse magnetoencephalography (MEG) in a theoretical source space, with respect to the processing of a regular beat. This hypothesis- and data-driven analysis pipeline allows us to extract the maximally relevant components in MEG source-space, with respect to the oscillatory power in the frequency band of interest and, most importantly, the beat-related modulation of that power. Our pipeline combines Spatio-Spectral Decomposition as a first step to seek activity in the frequency band of interest (SSD) with a Source Power Co-modulation analysis (SPoC), which extracts those components that maximally entrain their activity with the given target function, that is here with the periodicity of the beat in the frequency domain (hence, f-SPoC). MEG data (102 magnetometers) from 28 participants passively listening to a 5-min long regular tone sequence with a 400 ms beat period (the &quot;target function&quot; for SPoC) were segmented into epochs of two beat periods each to guarantee a sufficiently long time window. As a comparison pipeline to SSD and f-SpoC, we carried out a state-of-the-art cluster-based permutation analysis (CBPA). The time-frequency analysis (TFA) of the extracted activity showed clear regular patterns of periodically occurring peaks and troughs across the alpha and beta band (8-20 Hz) in the f-SPoC but not in the CBPA results, and both the depth and the specificity of modulation to the beat frequency yielded a significant advantage. Future applications of this pipeline will address target the relevance to behaviour and inform analogous analyses in the EEG, in order to finally work toward addressing dysfunctions in beat-based timing and their consequences.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: After-hyperpolarization promotes the firing of mitral cells through a voltage dependent modification of action potential threshold</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.23.441072v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In the olfactory bulb (OB), mitral cells (MCs) display a spontaneous firing that is characterized by bursts of action potentials intermixed with silent periods. Burst firing frequency and duration are heterogeneous among MCs and increase with membrane depolarization. By using patch clamp recording on rat slices, we dissected out the intrinsic properties responsible of this activity. We showed that the threshold of action potential (AP) generation dynamically changes as a function of the trajectory of the membrane potential; becoming more negative when the membrane was hyperpolarized and having a recovering rate, inversely proportional to the membrane repolarization rate. Such variations appeared to be produced by changes in the inactivation state of voltage dependent Na+ channels. Thus, the modification AP threshold favours the initiation of the burst following hyperpolarizing event such as negative membrane oscillations or inhibitory transmission. After the first AP, the following afterhyperpolarization (AHP) brought the threshold just below the membrane resting potential or within membrane oscillations and, as a consequence, the threshold was exceeded during the fast repolarization component of the AHP. In this way the fast AHP acts as a regenerative mechanism that sustains the firing. Bursts were stopped by the development of a slow repolarization component of the AHP. The AHP characteristics appeared as determining the bursting properties; AHP with larger amplitudes and faster repolarizations being associated with longer and higher frequency bursts. Thus, the increase of bursts length and frequency upon membrane depolarization would be attributable to the modifications of the AHP and of Na+ channels inactivation.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.23.441070v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Understanding the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease has been hampered by the lack of models that recapitulate all the critical factors underlying its development. Here, we generated functional induced dopaminergic neurons (iDANs) that were directly reprogrammed from adult human dermal fibroblasts of patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease to investigate disease-relevant pathology. We show that iDANs derived from Parkinson's disease patients exhibit lower basal chaperone-mediated autophagy as compared to iDANs of healthy donors. Furthermore, stress-induced autophagy resulted in an accumulation of macroautophagic structures in induced neurons (iNs) derived from Parkinson's disease patients, independently of the specific neuronal subtype but dependent on the age of the donor. Finally, we found that these impairments in patient-derived iNs lead to an accumulation of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein, a hallmark of Parkinson's disease pathology. Taken together, our results demonstrate that direct neural reprogramming provides a patient-specific model to study aged neuronal features relevant to idiopathic Parkinson's disease.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.23.441067v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Chronic and acute stress differentially affect behaviour, as well as the structural integrity of the hippocampus, a key brain region involved in cognition and memory. However, it remains unclear if and how the facilitatory effects of acute stress on hippocampal information coding are disrupted as the stress becomes chronic. To examine this, we compared the impact of acute and chronic stress on neural activity in the CA1 subregion of male mice subjected to a chronic immobilization stress paradigm. We observed that following first exposure to stress (acute stress), the spatial information encoded in the hippocampus sharpened and the neurons became increasingly tuned to the underlying theta oscillation in the local field potential (LFP). However, following repeated exposure to same stress (chronic stress), spatial tuning was poorer and the power of both the slow-gamma (30-50 Hz) and fast-gamma (55-90 Hz) oscillations, which correlate with excitatory inputs into the region, decreased. These results support the idea that acute and chronic stress differentially affect neural computations carried out by hippocampal circuits and suggest that acute stress may improve cognitive processing.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.23.441060v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The function of poly(ADP-ribosyl) polymerase 1 (PARP1) in myelination and remyelination of the central nervous system (CNS) remain enigmatic. Here we report that PARP1 is an intrinsic driver for oligodendroglial development and myelination. Genetic PARP1 depletion impairs the differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) into oligodendrocytes and impedes CNS myelination. Mechanistically, PARP1-mediated PARylation activity is not only necessary but also sufficient for OPC differentiation. At the molecular level, we identify the RNA-binding protein Myef2 as a novel PARylated target which we show controls OPC differentiation through PARylation-modulated de-repression of myelin protein expression. Furthermore, the enzymatic activity of PARP1 is necessary for oligodendrocyte and myelin regeneration after demyelination. Together, our findings suggest that PARP1-mediated PARylation activity may be a potential therapeutic target for promoting OPC differentiation and remyelination in neurological disorders characterized by arrested OPC differentiation and remyelination failure such as multiple sclerosis.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Altered synaptic connectivity and brain function in mice lacking microglial adapter protein Iba1</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.23.441023v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Growing evidence indicates that microglia impact brain function by regulating synaptic pruning and formation, as well as synaptic transmission and plasticity. Iba1 (Ionized Ca+2-binding adapter protein 1), encoded by the Allograft inflammatory factor 1 (Aif1) gene, is an actin-interacting protein in microglia. Although Iba1 has long been used as a cellular marker for microglia, its functional role remains unknown. Here, we used global Iba1-deficient (Aif1-/-) mice to characterize microglial activity, synaptic function and behavior. Microglial imaging in acute hippocampal slices and fixed tissues from juvenile mice revealed that Aif1-/- microglia display reductions in ATP-induced motility and ramification, respectively. Biochemical assays further demonstrated that Aif1-/- brain tissues exhibit an altered expression of microglial-enriched proteins associated with synaptic pruning. Consistent with these changes, juvenile Aif1-/- mice displayed deficits in excitatory synapse number and synaptic transmission assessed by neuronal labeling and whole-cell patch-clamp recording in acute hippocampal slices. Unexpectedly, microglial synaptic engulfment capacity was diminished in juvenile Aif1-/- mice. During early postnatal development when synapse formation is a predominant event in the hippocampus, excitatory synapse number was still reduced in Aif1-/- mice. Together these findings support an overall role of Iba1 in excitatory synaptic growth in juvenile mice. Lastly, postnatal synaptic deficits persisted in the adulthood and correlated with significant behavioral changes in adult Aif1-/- mice, which exhibited impairments in object recognition memory and social interaction. These results suggest that Iba1 critically contributes to microglial activity underlying essential neuro-glia developmental processes that may deeply influence behavior.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Olfactory receptor repertoires exhibit remarkable functional diversity, but how these proteins have evolved is poorly understood. Through analysis of extant and ancestrally-reconstructed drosophilid olfactory receptors from the Ionotropic Receptor (IR) family, we investigated evolution of two organic acid-sensing receptors, IR75a and IR75b. Despite their low amino acid identity, we identify a common 'hotspot' in their ligand-binding pocket that has a major effect on changing the specificity of both IRs, as well as at least two distinct functional transitions in IR75a during evolution. Ligand-docking into IR models predicts that the hotspot does not contact odor molecules, suggesting that this residue indirectly influences ligand/receptor interactions. Moreover, we show that odor specificity is refined by changes in additional, receptor-specific sites, including those outside the ligand-binding pocket. Our work reveals how a core, common determinant of ligand-tuning acts within epistatic and allosteric networks of substitutions to lead to functional evolution of olfactory receptors.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.23.440874v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Dravet syndrome (DS) is a developmental epileptic encephalopathy mainly caused by functional NaV1.1 haploinsufficiency in interneurons (IN). Recently, a new conditional mouse model expressing the recurrent human p.A1783V missense variant has become available. We here, provide a first electrophysiological characterization of this variant in tsA201 cells, revealing both altered voltage-dependence of activation and slow inactivation without reduced overall sodium peak current. Comparing the identified NaVA1783V gating properties to simulated 50% NaV1.1 haploinsufficiency in a Hodgkin-Huxley one-compartment IN model suggested surprisingly similar overall effects on action potential firing rates. Impaired NaVA1783V channel activation was predicted to have a significantly larger impact on channel function than altered slow inactivation and is therefore proposed as the main mechanism underlying IN dysfunction. The computational model was validated in cortical organotypic slice cultures derived from conditional Scn1aA1783V mice. Pan-neuronal activation of the p.A1783V variant in vitro confirmed the predicted IN firing deficit while demonstrating normal excitability of pyramidal neurons. Taken together these data demonstrate that despite overall physiological peak currents LOF gating properties may match effects of full haploinsufficiency on neuronal level, thereby causing DS.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Inherited retinal diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP) can be caused by thousands of different mutations, a small number of which have been successfully treated with gene replacement. However, this approach has yet to scale and may be infeasible in many cases, highlighting the need for interventions that could benefit more patients. Here, we found that microglial phagocytosis is upregulated during cone degeneration in RP, suggesting that expression of &quot;dont eat me&quot; signals such as CD47 might confer protection to cones. To test this, we delivered an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector expressing CD47 on cones, which promoted cone survival in three mouse models of RP and preserved visual function. Cone rescue with CD47 required signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRP) but not microglia or thrombospondin-1 (TSP1), suggesting that CD47 interacts with SIRP on non-microglial cells to alleviate degeneration. These findings establish augmentation of CD47-SIRP signaling as a potential treatment strategy for RP and possibly other forms of neurodegeneration.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The hippocampal-entorhinal region supports memory for episodic details, such as temporal relations of sequential events, and mnemonic constructions combining experiences for inferential reasoning. However, it is unclear whether hippocampal event representations reflect temporal relations derived from mnemonic constructions, event order, or elapsing time, and whether they generalize temporal relations across similar sequences. Here, participants mnemonically constructed times of events from multiple sequences using infrequent cues and their experience of passing time. After learning, event representations in the anterior hippocampus reflected sequence relations based on constructed times. These event representations generalized across sequences, revealing distinct representational formats for events from the same or different sequences. Structural knowledge about time patterns, abstracted from different sequences, biased the construction of specific event times. These findings demonstrate that the hippocampus reconciles representations of specific relations with the generalization across different episodes, consistent with memory-based constructions combining episodic details and general knowledge to simulate scenarios.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Meningeal CGRP‐Prolactin Interaction Evokes Female‐Specific Migraine Behavior</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26070?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Migraine is three times more common in women. CGRP plays a critical role in migraine pathology and causes female‐specific behavioral responses upon meningeal application. These effects are likely mediated through interactions of CGRP with signaling systems specific to females. Prolactin (PRL) levels have been correlated with migraine attacks. Here, we explore a potential interaction between CGRP and PRL in the meninges.


Methods
Prolactin, CGRP, and receptor antagonists CGRP8‐37 or Δ1‐9‐G129R‐hPRL were administered onto the dura of rodents followed by behavioral testing. Immunohistochemistry was used to examine PRL, CGRP and Prolactin receptor (Prlr) expression within the dura. Electrophysiology on cultured and back‐labeled trigeminal ganglia (TG) neurons was used to assess PRL‐induced excitability. Finally, the effects of PRL on evoked CGRP release from ex vivo dura were measured.


Results
We found that dural PRL produced sustained and long‐lasting migraine‐like behavior in cycling and ovariectomized female, but not male rodents. Prlr was expressed on dural afferent nerves in females with little‐to‐no presence in males. Consistent with this, PRL increased excitability only in female TG neurons innervating the dura and selectively sensitized CGRP release from female ex vivo dura. We demonstrate crosstalk between PRL and CGRP systems as CGRP8‐37 decreases migraine‐like responses to dural PRL. Reciprocally, Δ1‐9‐G129R‐hPRL attenuates dural CGRP‐induced migraine behaviors. Similarly, Prlr deletion from sensory neurons significantly reduced migraine‐like responses to dural CGRP.


Interpretation
This CGRP‐PRL interaction in the meninges is a mechanism by which these peptides could produce female‐selective responses and increase the prevalence of migraine in women. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Unraveling the mechanisms of surround suppression in early visual processing</title>

This paper uses mathematical modeling to study the mechanisms of surround suppression in the primate visual cortex. We present a large-scale neural circuit alistic modeling work are used. The remaining parameters are chosen to produce model outputs that emulate experimentally observed size-tuning curves. Our two main results are: (i) we discovered the character of the long-range connections in Layer 6 responsible for surround effects in the input layers; and (ii) we showed that a net-inhibitory feedback, i.e., feedback that excites I-cells more than E-cells, from Layer 6 to Layer 4 is conducive to producing surround properties consistent with experimental data. These results are obtained through parameter selection and model analysis. The effects of nonlinear recurrent excitation and inhibition are also discussed. A feature that distinguishes our model from previous modeling work on surround suppression is that we have tried to reproduce realistic lengthscales that are crucial for quantitative comparison with data. Due to its size and the large number of unknown parameters, the model is computationally challenging. We demonstrate a strategy that involves first locating baseline values for relevant parameters using a linear model, followed by the introduction of nonlinearities where needed. We find such a methodology effective, and propose it as a possibility in the modeling of complex biological systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bNCVOTWspsI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Nelson, Madison F. Walker, Kouki Kawakami, Asuka Inoue, Nevan J. Krogan, David J. Grunwald, Ruth Hüttenhain, Aashish Manglik, Benjamin R. Myers&lt;/p&gt;

The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is essential for organ development, homeostasis, and regeneration. Dysfunction of this cascade drives several cancers. To control expression of pathway target genes, the G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) Smoothened (SMO) activates glioma-associated (GLI) transcription factors via an unknown mechanism. Here, we show that, rather than conforming to traditional GPCR signaling paradigms, SMO activates GLI by binding and sequestering protein kinase A (PKA) catalytic subunits at the membrane. This sequestration, triggered by GPCR kinase (GRK)-mediated phosphorylation of SMO intracellular domains, prevents PKA from phosphorylating soluble substrates, releasing GLI from PKA-mediated inhibition. Our work provides a mechanism directly linking Hh signal transduction at the membrane to GLI transcription in the nucleus. This process is more fundamentally similar between species than prevailing hypotheses suggest. The mechanism described here may apply broadly to other GPCR- and PKA-containing cascades in diverse areas of biology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/kDoJwyIWoQQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Although exploratory landscape analysis (ELA) has shown its effectiveness in
various applications, most previous studies focused only on low- and
moderate-dimensional problems. Thus, little is known about the scalability of
the ELA approach for large-scale optimization. In this context, first, this
paper analyzes the computational cost of features in the flacco package. Our
results reveal that two important feature classes (ela_level and ela_meta)
cannot be applied to large-scale optimization due to their high computational
cost. To improve the scalability of the ELA approach, this paper proposes a
dimensionality reduction framework that computes features in a reduced
lower-dimensional space than the original solution space. We demonstrate that
the proposed framework can drastically reduce the computation time of ela_level
and ela_meta for large dimensions. In addition, the proposed framework can make
the cell-mapping feature classes scalable for large-scale optimization. Our
results also show that features computed by the proposed framework are
beneficial for predicting the high-level properties of the 24 large-scale BBOB

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The estimation of sparse hierarchical components reflecting patterns of the
brain's functional connectivity from rsfMRI data can contribute to our
understanding of the brain's functional organization, and can lead to
biomarkers of diseases. However, inter-scanner variations and other confounding
factors pose a challenge to the robust and reproducible estimation of
functionally-interpretable brain networks, and especially to reproducible
biomarkers. Moreover, the brain is believed to be organized hierarchically, and
hence single-scale decompositions miss this hierarchy. The paper aims to use
current advancements in adversarial learning to estimate interpretable
hierarchical patterns in the human brain using rsfMRI data, which are robust to
&quot;adversarial effects&quot; such as inter-scanner variations. We write the estimation
problem as a minimization problem and solve it using alternating updates.
Extensive experiments on simulation and a real-world dataset show high
reproducibility of the components compared to other well-known methods.

A diamond phase grating in an X-ray beam path creates a periodic excitation pattern on a sample via the Talbot effect. The response of the periodic excitation is probed by an optical pulse.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nphoton/rss/current/~4/AbD-i0nqmRE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: State Transitions During Discrimination Learning in the Gerbil Auditory Cortex Analyzed by Network Causality Metrics</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.641684</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This work studies the evolution of cortical networks during the transition from escape strategy to avoidance strategy in auditory discrimination learning in Mongolian gerbils trained by the well-established two-way active avoidance learning paradigm. The animals were implanted with electrode arrays centered on the surface of the primary auditory cortex and electrocorticogram (ECoG) recordings were made during performance of an auditory Go/NoGo discrimination task. Our experiments confirm previous results on a sudden behavioral change from the initial naïve state to an avoidance strategy as learning progresses. We employed two causality metrics using Granger Causality (GC) and New Causality (NC) to quantify changes in the causality flow between ECoG channels as the animals switched to avoidance strategy. We found that the number of channel pairs with inverse causal interaction significantly increased after the animal acquired successful discrimination, which indicates structural changes in the cortical networks as a result of learning. A suitable graph-theoretical model is developed to interpret the findings in terms of cortical networks evolving during cognitive state transitions. Structural changes lead to changes in the dynamics of neural populations, which are described as phase transitions in the network graph model with small-world connections. Overall, our findings underscore the importance of functional reorganization in sensory cortical areas as a possible neural contributor to behavioral changes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: The Renin–Angiotensin System Modulates Dopaminergic Neurotransmission: A New Player on the Scene</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.638519</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is an extrapyramidal disorder characterized by neuronal degeneration in several regions of the peripheral and central nervous systems. It is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer’s. It has become a major health problem, affecting 1% of the world population over 60 years old and 3% of people beyond 80 years. The main histological findings are intracellular Lewy bodies composed of misfolded α-synuclein protein aggregates and loss of dopaminergic neurons in the central nervous system. Neuroinflammation, apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, altered calcium homeostasis, abnormal protein degradation, and synaptic pathobiology have been put forward as mechanisms leading to cell death, α-synuclein deposition, or both. A progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra late in the neurodegeneration leads to developing motor symptoms like bradykinesia, tremor, and rigidity. The renin–angiotensin system (RAS), which is involved in regulating blood pressure and body fluid balance, also plays other important functions in the brain. The RAS is involved in the autocrine and paracrine regulation of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic synapses. Dopamine depletion, as in PD, increases angiotensin II expression, which stimulates or inhibits dopamine synthesis and is released via AT1 or AT2 receptors. Furthermore, angiotensin II AT1 receptors inhibit D1 receptor activation allosterically. Therefore, the RAS may have an important modulating role in the flow of information from the brain cortex to the basal ganglia. High angiotensin II levels might even aggravate neurodegeneration, activating the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase complex, which leads to increased reactive oxygen species production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Stress-Induced Enhanced Long-Term Potentiation and Reduced Threshold for N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor- and β-Adrenergic Receptor-Mediated Synaptic Plasticity in Rodent Ventral Subiculum</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.658465</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Stress is a biologically relevant signal and can modulate hippocampal synaptic plasticity. The subiculum is the major output station of the hippocampus and serves as a critical hub in the stress response network. However, stress-associated synaptic plasticity in the ventral subiculum has not been adequately addressed. Therefore, we investigated the impact of a single exposure to an inherently stressful two-way active avoidance conditioning on the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) at CA1—subiculum synapses in ventral hippocampal slices from young adult rats 1 day after stressor exposure. We found that acute stress enhanced LTP and lowered the induction threshold for a late-onset LTP at excitatory CA1 to subicular burst-spiking neuron synapses. This late-onset LTP was dependent on the activation of β-adrenergic and glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and independent of D1/D5 dopamine receptor activation. Thereby, we present a cellular mechanism that might contribute to behavioral stress adaptation after acute stressor exposure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Protect Others to Protect Myself: A Weakness of Western Countries in the Face of Current and Future Pandemics? Psychological and Neuroscientific Perspectives</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2021.608151</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic has generated a large number of publications in the medical and biological fields concerning the virus and its treatments, as well as in psychology, social sciences, and data sciences with regard to the spread of the virus. Surprisingly, far fewer neuroscientific articles have been published in this field of research and one might well ask whether the cognitive neurosciences have anything to say at all about this vital topic. In this article, we highlight a research perspective relating to differences in the individual perception of the pandemic in Western compared to Eastern countries. Although this problem is complex, multifaceted and subsumes many other social variables, we suggest that the cognitive neurosciences do have important and fundamental insights to contribute concerning the collective response observed within these populations. More precisely, we propose the hypothesis that differences in the propensity to adopt a holistic perception of contamination processes at the group level, involving brain structures that are also associated with perspective-taking and empathy such as, in particular, the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), could help explain the differences in the perception of the pandemic observed between Western and Eastern countries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Peritumoral Brain Edema in Meningiomas May Be Related to Glymphatic Dysfunction</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.674898</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The pathogenesis of peritumoral brain edema (PTBE) in meningiomas remains unclear. The glymphatic system is recently recognized as a pathway for waste clearance and maintaining fluid balance in the brain parenchymal interstitium. We aimed to investigate if the PTBE volume of meningiomas correlates with their glymphatic function. A total of 80 meningioma patients (mean age, 58.8 years; 37 men) and 44 normal subjects (mean age 53.3 years; 23 men) who had preoperative diffusion-tensor imaging for calculation of the analysis along the perivascular space (ALPS) index were retrospectively included. Information collected from each patient included sex, age, tumor grade, Ki-67 index, tumor location, tumor volume, PTBE volume and ALPS index. Comparisons of ALPS index among meningiomas without PTBE, meningiomas with PTBE, and normal subjects were performed using analysis of covariance with Bonferroni correction and adjustments for age and sex. Pearson correlation coefficient and multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with PTBE volume. Group comparisons revealed that the ALPS index was significantly higher (P &amp;lt; 0.05) in meningiomas without PTBE vs. meningiomas with PTBE and normal subjects. On the other hand, ALPS index was not different between meningiomas with PTBE and normal subjects. On Pearson correlation and multivariable linear regression analyses, the ALPS index was the only factor significantly (P &amp;lt; 0.05) associated with PTBE volume. In conclusion, PTBE volume inversely correlated with ALPS index in meningiomas. PTBE formation in meningiomas may be related to glymphatic dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Triadin Decrease Impairs the Expression of E-C Coupling Related Proteins in Muscles of MPTP-Induced Parkinson’s Disease Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.649688</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD), caused by destruction of dopaminergic neurons in the brain, leads to motor symptoms like bradykinesia, tremor, and walking impairments. While most research effort focuses on changes in neuronal pathology we examined how muscle proteins were altered in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD. A Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release channel complex, consisting of ryanodine receptors (RYR), triadin (TRDN), and calsequestrin (CSQ1), is important for excitation-contraction coupling in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane in muscles. Thus, we investigated changes in the RYR Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release channel components in PD mice model. Based on a report that TRDN deletion impairs skeletal muscle function, we also investigated how the knock-down of TRDN affects other components of the RYR channel in the PD model. In this study, the expression levels of the components of RYR channels decreased in the quadriceps femoris muscle of MPTP-induced PD mice and in C2C12 cells treated with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium. We show that decreased TRDN levels decrease RYR and CSQ1 levels. These results suggest that the levels of proteins related to Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel function decreased in this model, which could impair muscle function. We conclude that muscle function alterations could add to the bradykinesia and tremor in this model of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.591122</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rapid cost drops and advancements in next-generation sequencing have made profiling of cells at individual level a conventional practice in scientific laboratories worldwide. Single-cell transcriptomics [single-cell RNA sequencing (SC-RNA-seq)] has an immense potential of uncovering the novel basis of human life. The well-known heterogeneity of cells at the individual level can be better studied by single-cell transcriptomics. Proper downstream analysis of this data will provide new insights into the scientific communities. However, due to low starting materials, the SC-RNA-seq data face various computational challenges: normalization, differential gene expression analysis, dimensionality reduction, etc. Additionally, new methods like 10× Chromium can profile millions of cells in parallel, which creates a considerable amount of data. Thus, single-cell data handling is another big challenge. This paper reviews the single-cell sequencing methods, library preparation, and data generation. We highlight some of the main computational challenges that require to be addressed by introducing new bioinformatics algorithms and tools for analysis. We also show single-cell transcriptomics data as a big data problem.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.659005</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;More than half of the Top 10 supercomputing sites worldwide use GPU accelerators and they are becoming ubiquitous in workstations and edge computing devices. GeNN is a C++ library for generating efficient spiking neural network simulation code for GPUs. However, until now, the full flexibility of GeNN could only be harnessed by writing model descriptions and simulation code in C++. Here we present PyGeNN, a Python package which exposes all of GeNN's functionality to Python with minimal overhead. This provides an alternative, arguably more user-friendly, way of using GeNN and allows modelers to use GeNN within the growing Python-based machine learning and computational neuroscience ecosystems. In addition, we demonstrate that, in both Python and C++ GeNN simulations, the overheads of recording spiking data can strongly affect runtimes and show how a new spike recording system can reduce these overheads by up to 10×. Using the new recording system, we demonstrate that by using PyGeNN on a modern GPU, we can simulate a full-scale model of a cortical column faster even than real-time neuromorphic systems. Finally, we show that long simulations of a smaller model with complex stimuli and a custom three-factor learning rule defined in PyGeNN can be simulated almost two orders of magnitude faster than real-time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: QDECR: A Flexible, Extensible Vertex-Wise Analysis Framework in R</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.561689</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The cerebral cortex is fundamental to the functioning of the mind and body. In vivo cortical morphology can be studied through magnetic resonance imaging in several ways, including reconstructing surface-based models of the cortex. However, existing software for surface-based statistical analyses cannot accommodate “big data” or commonly used statistical methods such as the imputation of missing data, extensive bias correction, and non-linear modeling. To address these shortcomings, we developed the QDECR package, a flexible and extensible R package for group-level statistical analysis of cortical morphology. QDECR was written with large population-based epidemiological studies in mind and was designed to fully utilize the extensive modeling options in R. QDECR currently supports vertex-wise linear regression. Design matrix generation can be done through simple, familiar R formula specification, and includes user-friendly extensions for R options such as polynomials, splines, interactions and other terms. QDECR can handle unimputed and imputed datasets with thousands of participants. QDECR has a modular design, and new statistical models can be implemented which utilize several aspects from other generic modules which comprise QDECR. In summary, QDECR provides a framework for vertex-wise surface-based analyses that enables flexible statistical modeling and features commonly used in population-based and clinical studies, which have until now been largely absent from neuroimaging research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Wrist Position Sense in Two Dimensions: Between-Hand Symmetry and Anisotropic Accuracy Across the Space</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.662768</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A deep investigation of proprioceptive processes is necessary to understand the relationship between sensory afferent inputs and motor outcomes. In this work, we investigate whether and how perception of wrist position is influenced by the direction along which the movement occurs. Most previous studies have tested Joint Position Sense (JPS) through 1 degree of freedom (DoF) wrist movements, such as flexion/extension (FE) or radial/ulnar deviation (RUD). However, the wrist joint has 3-DoF and many activities of daily living produce combined movements, requiring at least 2-DoF wrist coordination. For this reason, in this study, target positions involved movement directions that combined wrist flexion or extension with radial or ulnar deviation. The chosen task was a robot-aided Joint Position Matching (JPM), in which blindfolded participants actively reproduced a previously passively assumed target joint configuration. The JPM performance of 20 healthy participants was quantified through measures of accuracy and precision, in terms of both perceived target direction and distance along each direction of movement. Twelve different directions of movement were selected and both hands tested. The left and right hand led to comparable results, both target extents and directions were differently perceived according to the target direction on the FE/RUD space. Moreover, during 2-DoF combined movements, subjects’ perception of directions was impaired when compared to 1-DoF target movements. In summary, our results showed that human perception of wrist position on the FE/RUD space is symmetric between hands but not isotropic among movement directions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Starting from the early 2000s, paired associative stimulation (PAS) protocols have been used in humans to study brain connectivity in motor and sensory networks by exploiting the intrinsic properties of timing-dependent cortical plasticity. In the last 10 years, PAS have also been developed to investigate the plastic properties of complex cerebral systems, such as the frontal ones, with promising results. In the present work, we review the most recent advances of this technique, focusing on protocols targeting frontal cortices to investigate connectivity and its plastic properties, subtending high-order cognitive functions like memory, decision-making, attentional, or emotional processing. Overall, current evidence reveals that PAS can be effectively used to assess, enhance or depress physiological connectivity within frontal networks in a timing-dependent way, in turn modulating cognitive processing in healthy and pathological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Brain Alteration of Seafarer Revealed by Activated Functional Connectivity Mode in fMRI Data Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.656638</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As a special occupational group, the working and living environments faced by seafarers are greatly different from those of land. It is easy to affect the psychological and physiological activities of seafarers, which inevitably lead to changes in the brain functional activities of seafarers. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the neural activity rules of seafarers’ brain. In view of this, this paper studied the seafarers’ brain alteration at the activated voxel level based on functional magnetic resonance imaging technology by comparing the differences in functional connectivities (FCs) between seafarers and non-seafarers. Firstly, the activated voxels of each group were obtained by independence component analysis, and then the distribution of these voxels in the brain and the common activated voxels between the two groups were statistically analyzed. Next, the FCs between the common activated voxels of the two groups were calculated and obtained the FCs that had significant differences between them through two-sample T-test. Finally, all FCs and FCs with significant differences (DFCs) between the common activated voxels were used as the features for the support vector machine to classify seafarers and non-seafarers. The results showed that DFCs between the activated voxels had better recognition ability for seafarers, especially for Precuneus_L and Precuneus_R, which may play an important role in the classification prediction of seafarers and non-seafarers, so that provided a new perspective for studying the specificity of neurological activities of seafarers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: A Methodological Review of fNIRS in Driving Research: Relevance to the Future of Autonomous Vehicles</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.637589</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As automobile manufacturers have begun to design, engineer, and test autonomous driving systems of the future, brain imaging with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) can provide unique insights about cognitive processes associated with evolving levels of autonomy implemented in the automobile. Modern fNIRS devices provide a portable, relatively affordable, and robust form of functional neuroimaging that allows researchers to investigate brain function in real-world environments. The trend toward “naturalistic neuroscience” is evident in the growing number of studies that leverage the methodological flexibility of fNIRS, and in doing so, significantly expand the scope of cognitive function that is accessible to observation via functional brain imaging (i.e., from the simulator to on-road scenarios). While more than a decade’s worth of study in this field of fNIRS driving research has led to many interesting findings, the number of studies applying fNIRS during autonomous modes of operation is limited. To support future research that directly addresses this lack in autonomous driving research with fNIRS, we argue that a cogent distillation of the methods used to date will help facilitate and streamline this research of tomorrow. To that end, here we provide a methodological review of the existing fNIRS driving research, with the overarching goal of highlighting the current diversity in methodological approaches. We argue that standardization of these approaches will facilitate greater overlap of methods by researchers from all disciplines, which will, in-turn, allow for meta-analysis of future results. We conclude by providing recommendations for advancing the use of such fNIRS technology in furthering understanding the adoption of safe autonomous vehicle technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Tapping Force Encodes Metrical Aspects of Rhythm</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.633956</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Humans possess the ability to extract highly organized perceptual structures from sequences of temporal stimuli. For instance, we can organize specific rhythmical patterns into hierarchical, or metrical, systems. Despite the evidence of a fundamental influence of the motor system in achieving this skill, few studies have attempted to investigate the organization of our motor representation of rhythm. To this aim, we studied—in musicians and non-musicians—the ability to perceive and reproduce different rhythms. In a first experiment participants performed a temporal order-judgment task, for rhythmical sequences presented via auditory or tactile modality. In a second experiment, they were asked to reproduce the same rhythmic sequences, while their tapping force and timing were recorded. We demonstrate that tapping force encodes the metrical aspect of the rhythm, and the strength of the coding correlates with the individual’s perceptual accuracy. We suggest that the similarity between perception and tapping-force organization indicates a common representation of rhythm, shared between the perceptual and motor systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.617318</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the present study, we examine the interactive effect of vowels on Mandarin fricative sibilants using a passive oddball paradigm to determine whether the HEIGHT features of vowels can spread on the surface and influence preceding consonants with unspecified features. The stimuli are two pairs of Mandarin words ([sa] ∼ [ʂa] and [su] ∼ [ʂu]) contrasting in vowel HEIGHT ([LOW] vs. [HIGH]). Each word in the same pair was presented both as standard and deviant, resulting in four conditions (/standard/&lt;sub&gt;[deviant]&lt;/sub&gt;: /sa/&lt;sub&gt;[ʂa]&lt;/sub&gt; ∼ /ʂa/&lt;sub&gt;[sa]&lt;/sub&gt; and /su/&lt;sub&gt;[ʂu]&lt;/sub&gt; ∼ /ʂu/&lt;sub&gt;[su]&lt;/sub&gt;). In line with the Featurally Underspecified Lexicon (FUL) model, asymmetric patterns of processing were found in the [su] ∼ [ʂu] word pair where both the MMN (mismatch negativity) and LDN (late discriminative negativity) components were more negative in /su/&lt;sub&gt;[ʂu]&lt;/sub&gt; (mismatch) than in /ʂu/&lt;sub&gt;[su]&lt;/sub&gt; (no mismatch), suggesting the spreading of the feature [HIGH] from the vowel [u] to [ʂ] on the surface. In the [sa] ∼ [ʂa] pair, however, symmetric negativities (for both MMN and LDN) were observed as there is no conflict between the surface feature [LOW] from [a] to [ʂ] and the underlying specified feature [LOW] of [s]. These results confirm that not all features are fully specified in the mental lexicon: features of vowels can spread on the surface and influence surrounding unspecified segments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Humans and some animal species are able to learn stimulus-response (S-R) associations by observing others' behavior. It saves energy and time and avoids the danger of trying the wrong actions. Observational learning (OL) depends on the capability of mapping the actions of others into our own behaviors, processing outcomes, and combining this knowledge to serve our goals. Observational learning plays a central role in the learning of social skills, cultural knowledge, and tool use. Thus, it is one of the fundamental processes in which infants learn about and from adults (Byrne and Russon, 1998). In this paper, we review current methodological approaches employed in observational learning research. We highlight the important role of the prefrontal cortex and cognitive flexibility to support this learning process, develop a new neural working model of observational learning, illustrate how imitation relates to observational learning, and provide directions for future research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Emergence of Neuronal Synchronisation in Coupled Areas</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.663408</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;One of the most fundamental questions in the field of neuroscience is the emergence of synchronous behaviour in the brain, such as phase, anti-phase, and shift-phase synchronisation. In this work, we investigate how the connectivity between brain areas can influence the phase angle and the neuronal synchronisation. To do this, we consider brain areas connected by means of excitatory and inhibitory synapses, in which the neuron dynamics is given by the adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire model. Our simulations suggest that excitatory and inhibitory connections from one area to another play a crucial role in the emergence of these types of synchronisation. Thus, in the case of unidirectional interaction, we observe that the phase angles of the neurons in the receiver area depend on the excitatory and inhibitory synapses which arrive from the sender area. Moreover, when the neurons in the sender area are synchronised, the phase angle variability of the receiver area can be reduced for some conductance values between the areas. For bidirectional interactions, we find that phase and anti-phase synchronisation can emerge due to excitatory and inhibitory connections. We also verify, for a strong inhibitory-to-excitatory interaction, the existence of silent neuronal activities, namely a large number of excitatory neurons that remain in silence for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this paper we present a Competitive Rate-Based Algorithm (CRBA) that approximates operation of a Competitive Spiking Neural Network (CSNN). CRBA is based on modeling of the competition between neurons during a sample presentation, which can be reduced to ranking of the neurons based on a dot product operation and the use of a discrete Expectation Maximization algorithm; the latter is equivalent to the spike time-dependent plasticity rule. CRBA's performance is compared with that of CSNN on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. The results show that CRBA performs on par with CSNN, while using three orders of magnitude less computational time. Importantly, we show that the weights and firing thresholds learned by CRBA can be used to initialize CSNN's parameters that results in its much more efficient operation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.668980</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synapses in the cerebral cortex constantly change and this dynamic property regulated by the action of neuromodulators such as dopamine (DA), is essential for reward learning and memory. DA modulates spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), a cellular model of learning and memory, in juvenile rodent cortical neurons. However, it is unknown whether this neuromodulation also occurs at excitatory synapses of cortical neurons in mature adult mice or in humans. Cortical layer V pyramidal neurons were recorded with whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology and an extracellular stimulating electrode was used to induce STDP. DA was either bath-applied or optogenetically released in slices from mice. Classical STDP induction protocols triggered non-hebbian excitatory synaptic depression in the mouse or no plasticity at human cortical synapses. DA reverted long term synaptic depression to baseline in mouse via dopamine 2 type receptors or elicited long term synaptic potentiation in human cortical synapses. Furthermore, when DA was applied during an STDP protocol it depressed presynaptic inhibition in the mouse but not in the human cortex. Thus, DA modulates excitatory synaptic plasticity differently in human vs. mouse cortex. The data strengthens the importance of DA in gating cognition in humans, and may inform on therapeutic interventions to recover brain function from diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: For Better or for Worse: A Look Into Neutrophils in Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.648076</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neutrophils are short-lived cells of the innate immune system and the first line of defense at the site of an infection and tissue injury. Pattern recognition receptors on neutrophils recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns or danger-associated molecular patterns, which recruit them to the destined site. Neutrophils are professional phagocytes with efficient granular constituents that aid in the neutralization of pathogens. In addition to phagocytosis and degranulation, neutrophils are proficient in creating neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) that immobilize pathogens to prevent their spread. Because of the cytotoxicity of the associated granular proteins within NETs, the microbes can be directly killed once immobilized by the NETs. The role of neutrophils in infection is well studied; however, there is less emphasis placed on the role of neutrophils in tissue injury, such as traumatic spinal cord injury. Upon the initial mechanical injury, the innate immune system is activated in response to the molecules produced by the resident cells of the injured spinal cord initiating the inflammatory cascade. This review provides an overview of the essential role of neutrophils and explores the contribution of neutrophils to the pathologic changes in the injured spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rare mutations in the mitochondrial protein coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain containing 2 (CHCHD2) are associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and other Lewy body disorders. CHCHD2 is a bi-organellar mediator of oxidative phosphorylation, playing crucial roles in regulating electron flow in the mitochondrial electron transport chain and acting as a nuclear transcription factor for a cytochrome c oxidase subunit (COX4I2) and itself in response to hypoxic stress. CHCHD2 also regulates cell migration and differentiation, mitochondrial cristae structure, and apoptosis. In this review, we summarize the known disease-associated mutations of CHCHD2 in Asian and Caucasian populations, the physiological functions of CHCHD2, how CHCHD2 mutations contribute to α-synuclein pathology, and current animal models of CHCHD2. Further, we discuss the necessity of continued investigation into the divergent functions of CHCHD2 and CHCHD10 to determine how mutations in these similar mitochondrial proteins contribute to different neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.649646</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is pathologically characterized by extracellular beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and intraneuronal tau tangles in the brain. A therapeutic strategy aims to prevent or clear these Aβ plaques and the Aβ-degrading enzyme neprilysin is a potent drug to degrade plaques. The major challenge is to deliver bioactive neprilysin into the brain via the blood-brain barrier. The aim of the present study is to explore if intranasal delivery of neprilysin can eliminate plaques in a transgenic AD mouse model (APP_SweDI). We will test if collagen or platelets are useful vehicles to deliver neprilysin into the brain. Using organotypic brain slices from adult transgenic APP_SweDI mice, we show that neprilysin alone or loaded in collagen hydrogels or in platelets cleared cortical plaques. Intransasal delivery of neprilysin alone increased small Aβ depositions in the middle and caudal cortex in transgenic mice. Platelets loaded with neprilysin cleared plaques in the frontal cortex after intranasal application. Intranasal delivery of collagen-loaded neprilysin was very potent to clear plaques especially in the middle and caudal parts of the cortex. Our data support that the Aβ degrading enzyme neprilysin delivered to the mouse brain can clear Aβ plaques and intranasal delivery (especially with collagen as a vehicle) is a fast and easy application. However, it must be considered that intranasal neprilysin may also activate more plaque production in the transgenic mouse brain as a side effect.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: UBTD1 regulates ceramide balance and endolysosomal positioning to coordinate EGFR signaling</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68348</link>
	<content:encoded>To adapt in an ever-changing environment, cells must integrate physical and chemical signals and translate them into biological meaningful information through complex signaling pathways. By combining lipidomic and proteomic approaches with functional analysis, we have shown that UBTD1 (Ubiquitin domain-containing protein 1) plays a crucial role in both the EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) self-phosphorylation and its lysosomal degradation. On the one hand, by modulating the cellular level of ceramides through ASAH1 (N-Acylsphingosine Amidohydrolase 1) ubiquitination, UBTD1 controls the ligand-independent phosphorylation of EGFR. On the other hand, UBTD1, &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; the ubiquitination of SQSTM1/p62 (Sequestosome 1) by RNF26 and endolysosome positioning, participates in the lysosomal degradation of EGFR. The coordination of these two ubiquitin-dependent processes contributes to the control of the duration of the EGFR signal. Moreover, we showed that UBTD1 depletion exacerbates EGFR signaling and induces cell proliferation emphasizing a &lt;i&gt;hitherto&lt;/i&gt; unknown function of UBTD1 in EGFR-driven human cell proliferation.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: T cell self-reactivity during thymic development dictates the timing of positive selection</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65435</link>
	<content:encoded>Functional tuning of T cells based on their degree of self-reactivity is established during positive selection in the thymus, although how positive selection differs for thymocytes with relatively low versus high self-reactivity is unclear. In addition, preselection thymocytes are highly sensitive to low-affinity ligands, but the mechanism underlying their enhanced TCR sensitivity is not fully understood. Here we show that murine thymocytes with low self-reactivity experience briefer TCR signals and complete positive selection more slowly than those with high self-reactivity. Additionally, we provide evidence that cells with low self-reactivity retain a preselection gene expression signature as they mature, including genes previously implicated in modulating TCR sensitivity and a novel group of ion channel genes. Our results imply that thymocytes with low self-reactivity down-regulate TCR sensitivity more slowly during positive selection, and associate membrane ion channel expression with thymocyte self-reactivity and progress through positive selection.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Anticipation of temporally structured events in the brain</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64972</link>
	<content:encoded>Learning about temporal structure is adaptive because it enables the generation of expectations. We examined how the brain uses experience in structured environments to anticipate upcoming events. During fMRI, individuals watched a 90-second movie clip six times. Using a Hidden Markov Model applied to searchlights across the whole brain, we identified temporal shifts between activity patterns evoked by the first vs. repeated viewings of the movie clip. In many regions throughout the cortex, neural activity patterns for repeated viewings shifted to precede those of initial viewing by up to 15 seconds. This anticipation varied hierarchically in a posterior (less anticipation) to anterior (more anticipation) fashion. We also identified specific regions in which the timing of the brain's event boundaries were related to those of human-labeled event boundaries, with the timing of this relationship shifting on repeated viewings. With repeated viewing, the brain's event boundaries came to precede human-annotated boundaries by 1-4 seconds on average. Together, these results demonstrate a hierarchy of anticipatory signals in the human brain and link them to subjective experiences of events.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: High-resolution imaging of skin deformation shows that afferents from human fingertips signal slip onset</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64679</link>
	<content:encoded>Human tactile afferents provide essential feedback for grasp stability during dexterous object manipulation. Interacting forces between an object and the fingers induce slip events that are thought to provide information about grasp stability. To gain insight into this phenomenon, we made a transparent surface slip against a fixed fingerpad while monitoring skin deformation at the contact. Using microneurography, we simultaneously recorded the activity of single tactile afferents innervating the fingertips. This unique combination allowed us to describe how afferents respond to slip events and to relate their responses to surface deformations taking place inside their receptive fields. We found that all afferents were sensitive to slip events, but FA-I afferents in particular faithfully encoded compressive strain rates resulting from those slips. Given the high density of FA-I afferents in fingerpads, they are well suited to detect incipient slips and to provide essential information for the control of grip force during manipulation.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Confinement discerns swarmers from planktonic bacteria</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64176</link>
	<content:encoded>Powered by flagella, many bacterial species exhibit collective motion on a solid surface commonly known as swarming. As a natural example of active matter, swarming is also an essential biological phenotype associated with virulence, chemotaxis, and host pathogenesis. Physical changes like cell elongation and hyper flagellation have been shown to accompany the swarming phenotype. Less studied, however, are the contrasts of collective motion between the swarming cells and their counterpart planktonic cells of comparable cell density. Here, we show that confining bacterial movement in circular microwells allows distinguishing bacterial swarming from collective swimming. On a soft agar plate, a novel bacterial strain &lt;i&gt;Enterobacter&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;. SM3 in swarming and planktonic states exhibited different motion patterns when confined to circular microwells of a specific range of sizes. When the confinement diameter was between 40 μm and 90 μm, swarming SM3 formed a single swirl motion pattern in the microwells whereas planktonic SM3 formed multiple swirls. Similar differential behavior is observed across several other species of gram-negative bacteria. We also observed 'rafting behavior' of swarming bacteria upon dilution. We hypothesize that the rafting behavior might account for the motion pattern difference. We were able to predict these experimental features via numerical simulations where swarming cells are modeled with stronger cell-cell alignment interaction. Our experimental design using PDMS microchip disk arrays enabled us to observe bacterial swarming on murine intestinal surface suggesting a new method for characterizing bacterial swarming under complex environments, such as in polymicrobial niches, and for &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; swarming exploration.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63713</link>
	<content:encoded>The Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes enabled the discovery of sequences that differ between modern and archaic humans, the majority of which are noncoding. However, our understanding of the regulatory consequences of these differences remains limited, in part due to the decay of regulatory marks in ancient samples. Here, we used a massively parallel reporter assay in embryonic stem cells, neural progenitor cells, and bone osteoblasts to investigate the regulatory effects of the 14,042 single-nucleotide modern human-specific variants. Overall, 1791 (13%) of sequences containing these variants showed active regulatory activity, and 407 (23%) of these drove differential expression between human groups. Differentially active sequences were associated with divergent transcription factor binding motifs, and with genes enriched for vocal tract and brain anatomy and function. This work provides insight into the regulatory function of variants that emerged along the modern human lineage and the recent evolution of human gene expression.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Identification of functionally distinct macrophage subpopulations in Drosophila</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58686</link>
	<content:encoded>Vertebrate macrophages are a highly heterogeneous cell population, but while &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; blood is dominated by a macrophage-like lineage (plasmatocytes), until very recently these cells were considered to represent a homogeneous population. Here, we present our identification of enhancer elements labelling plasmatocyte subpopulations, which vary in abundance across development. These subpopulations exhibit functional differences compared to the overall population, including more potent injury responses and differential localisation and dynamics in pupae and adults. Our enhancer analysis identified candidate genes regulating plasmatocyte behaviour: pan-plasmatocyte expression of one such gene (&lt;i&gt;Calnexin14D&lt;/i&gt;) improves wound responses, causing the overall population to resemble more closely the subpopulation marked by the &lt;i&gt;Calnexin14D&lt;/i&gt;-associated enhancer. Finally, we show that exposure to increased levels of apoptotic cell death modulates subpopulation cell numbers. Taken together this demonstrates macrophage heterogeneity in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, identifies mechanisms involved in subpopulation specification and function and facilitates the use of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; to study macrophage heterogeneity in vivo.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Alpha‐Synuclein Oligomers and Neurofilament Light Chain Predict Phenoconversion of Pure Autonomic Failure</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26089?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
To explore the role of alpha‐synuclein (αSyn) oligomers and neurofilament light chain (NfL) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with pure autonomic failure (PAF) as markers of future phenoconversion to multiple system atrophy (MSA).


Methods
Well‐characterized patients with PAF (n=32) were enrolled between June 2016 and February 2019 at Mayo Clinic Rochester and followed prospectively with annual visits to determine future phenoconversion to MSA, Parkinson's disease (PD), or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). ELISA was utilized to measure NfL and protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) to detect αSyn oligomers in CSF collected at baseline.


Results
Patients were followed for a median of 3.9 years. 5 patients converted to MSA, 2 to PD, and 2 to DLB. NfL at baseline was elevated only in patients who later developed MSA, perfectly separating those from future PD and DLB converters as well as non‐converters. ASyn‐PMCA was positive in all but 2 cases (94%). The PMCA reaction was markedly different in 5 samples with maximum fluorescence and reaction kinetics previously described in MSA patients; all of these patients later developed MSA.


Interpretation
αSyn‐PMCA is almost invariably positive in the CSF of patients with PAF establishing this condition as α‐synucleinopathy. Both NfL and the magnitude and reaction kinetics of αSyn PMCA faithfully predict which PAF patients will eventually phenoconvert to MSA. This finding has important implications not only for prognostication, but also for future trials of disease modifying therapies, allowing for differentiation of MSA from Lewy body synucleinopathies before motor symptoms develop.

Two of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines currently approved in the United States require 2 doses, administered 3 to 4 weeks apart. Constraints in vaccine supply and distribution capacity, together with a deadly wave of COVID-19 from November 2020 to January 2021 and the emergence of highly contagious Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants, sparked a policy debate on whether to vaccinate more individuals with the first dose of available vaccines and delay the second dose or to continue with the recommended 2-dose series as tested in clinical trials. We developed an agent-based model of COVID-19 transmission to compare the impact of these 2 vaccination strategies, while varying the temporal waning of vaccine efficacy following the first dose and the level of preexisting immunity in the population. Our results show that for Moderna vaccines, a delay of at least 9 weeks could maximize vaccination program effectiveness and avert at least an additional 17.3 (95% credible interval [CrI]: 7.8–29.7) infections, 0.69 (95% CrI: 0.52–0.97) hospitalizations, and 0.34 (95% CrI: 0.25–0.44) deaths per 10,000 population compared to the recommended 4-week interval between the 2 doses. Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines also averted an additional 0.60 (95% CrI: 0.37–0.89) hospitalizations and 0.32 (95% CrI: 0.23–0.45) deaths per 10,000 population in a 9-week delayed second dose (DSD) strategy compared to the 3-week recommended schedule between doses. However, there was no clear advantage of delaying the second dose with Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines in reducing infections, unless the efficacy of the first dose did not wane over time. Our findings underscore the importance of quantifying the characteristics and durability of vaccine-induced protection after the first dose in order to determine the optimal time interval between the 2 doses.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/d_fuvUtzhhI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
Neurodegenerative movement disorders, such as Huntington's disease (HD), share a progressive and relentless course with increasing motor disability, linked with neuropsychiatric impairment. These diseases exhibit diverse pathophysiological processes and are a topic of intense experimental and clinical research due to the lack of therapeutic options. Restorative therapies are promising approaches with the potential to restore brain circuits. However, there were less compelling results in the few clinical trials. In this review, we discuss cell replacement therapies applied to animal models and HD patients. We thoroughly describe the initial trials using fetal neural tissue transplantation and recent approaches based on alternative cell sources tested in several animal models. Stem cells were shown to generate the desired neuron phenotype and/or provide growth factors to the degenerating host cells. Besides, genetic approaches such as RNA interference and the CRISPR/Cas9 system have been studied in animal models and human‐derived cells. New genetic manipulations have revealed the capability to control or counteract the effect of human gene mutations as described by the use of antisense oligonucleotides in a clinical trial. In HD, innovative strategies are at forefront of human testing and thus other brain genetic diseases may follow similar therapeutic strategies.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Longitudinal Intravital Imaging Nerve Degeneration and Sprouting in the Toes of Spared Nerve Injured Mice</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25162?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>We have developed a method for the longitudinal intravital observation of changes in peripheral nerve fibers. This method provides a high‐resolution approach for investigating epidermal and dermal nerve terminals as well as nerve plexuses and were extremely stable for at least 28 days. Using the SNI model, we found that the degeneration of the peripheral nerve terminals and plexuses over 2–3 days was aligned closely with the initiation of mechanical hypersensitivity. In addition, we obtained clear images of sprouting in the lateral part of the paw, which may be related to the maintenance of neuropathic pain symptoms.







Abstract
Neuropathic pain is pain caused by damage to the somatosensory nervous system. Both degenerating injured nerves and neighboring sprouting nerves can contribute to neuropathic pain. However, the mesoscale changes in cutaneous nerve fibers over time after the loss of the parent nerve has not been investigated in detail. In this study, we followed the changes in nerve fibers longitudinally in the toe tips of mice that had undergone spared nerve injury (SNI). Nav1.8‐tdTomato, Thy1‐GFP and MrgD‐GFP mice were used to observe the small and large cutaneous nerve fibers. We found that peripheral nerve plexuses degenerated within three days of nerve injury, and free nerve endings in the epidermis degenerated within two days. The timing of degeneration paralleled the initiation of mechanical hypersensitivity. We also found that some of the Nav1.8‐positive nerve plexuses and free nerve endings in the fifth toe survived, and sprouting occurred mostly from 7–28 days. The timing of the sprouting of nerve fibers in the fifth toe paralleled the maintenance phase of mechanical hypersensitivity. Our results support the hypotheses that both injured and intact nerve fibers participate in neuropathic pain, and that, specifically, nerve degeneration is related to the initiation of evoked pain and nerve sprouting is related to the maintenance of evoked pain.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Evolutionary transitions occur when previously-independent replicating
entities unite to form more complex individuals. Such transitions have
profoundly shaped natural evolutionary history and occur in two forms:
fraternal transitions involve lower-level entities that are kin (e.g.,
transitions to multicellularity or to eusocial colonies), while egalitarian
transitions involve unrelated individuals (e.g., the origins of mitochondria).
The necessary conditions and evolutionary mechanisms for these transitions to
arise continue to be fruitful targets of scientific interest. Here, we examine
a range of fraternal transitions in populations of open-ended self-replicating
computer programs. These digital cells were allowed to form and replicate kin
groups by selectively adjoining or expelling daughter cells. The capability to
recognize kin-group membership enabled preferential communication and
cooperation between cells. We repeatedly observed group-level traits that are
characteristic of a fraternal transition. These included reproductive division
of labor, resource sharing within kin groups, resource investment in offspring
groups, asymmetrical behaviors mediated by messaging, morphological patterning,
and adaptive apoptosis. We report eight case studies from replicates where
transitions occurred and explore the diverse range of adaptive evolved
multicellular strategies.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10070</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Because LFPs arise from multiple sources in different spatial locations, they
do not easily reveal coordinated activity across neural populations on a
trial-to-trial basis. As we show here, however, once disparate source signals
are decoupled, their trial-to-trial fluctuations become more accessible, and
cross-population correlations become more apparent. To decouple sources we
introduce a general framework for estimation of current source densities
(CSDs). In this framework, the set of LFPs result from noise being added to the
transform of the CSD by a biophysical forward model, while the CSD is
considered to be the sum of a zero-mean, stationary, spatiotemporal Gaussian
process, having fast and slow components, and a mean function, which is the sum
of multiple time-varying functions distributed across space, each varying
across trials. We derived biophysical forward models relevant to the data we
analyzed. In simulation studies this approach improved identification of source
signals compared to existing CSD estimation methods. Using data recorded from
primate auditory cortex, we analyzed trial-to-trial fluctuations in both
steady-state and task-evoked signals. We found cortical layer-specific phase
coupling between two probes and showed that the same analysis applied directly
to LFPs did not recover these patterns. We also found task-evoked CSDs to be
correlated across probes, at specific cortical depths. Using data from
Neuropixels probes in mouse visual areas, we again found evidence for
depth-specific phase coupling of areas V1 and LM based on the CSDs.

novel BCNN based batch normalization function and weight initialization
function. Experimental results on Cifar10 and ImageNet using state-of-the-art
network models (e.g., ResNet, ResNetE and NIN) show that BCNN can achieve
better accuracy compared to the original BNN models. BCNN improves BNN by
strengthening its learning capability through complex representation and

BCNN will be released on GitHub.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10033</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This paper presents a new algorithm named spherical vector-based particle
swarm optimization (SPSO) to deal with the problem of path planning for
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in complicated environments subjected to
multiple threats. A cost function is first formulated to convert the path
planning into an optimization problem that incorporates requirements and
constraints for the feasible and safe operation of the UAV. SPSO is then used
to find the optimal path that minimizes the cost function by efficiently
searching the configuration space of the UAV via the correspondence between the
particle position and the speed, turn angle and climb/dive angle of the UAV. To
evaluate the performance of SPSO, eight benchmarking scenarios have been
generated from real digital elevation model maps. The results show that the
proposed SPSO outperforms not only other particle swarm optimization (PSO)
variants including the classic PSO, phase angle-encoded PSO and quantum-behave
PSO but also other state-of-the-art metaheuristic optimization algorithms
including the genetic algorithm (GA), artificial bee colony (ABC), and
differential evolution (DE) in most scenarios. In addition, experiments have
been conducted to demonstrate the validity of the generated paths for real UAV
operations. Source code of the algorithm can be found at

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Parallels between the signal processing tasks and biological neurons lead to
an understanding of the principles of self-organized optimization of input
signal recognition. In the present paper, we discuss such similarities among
biological and technical systems. We propose the addition to the well-known
STDP synaptic plasticity rule to directs the weight modification towards the
state associated with the maximal difference between the background noise and
correlated signals. The principle of physically constrained weight growth is
used as a basis for such control of the modification of the weights. It is
proposed, that biological synaptic straight modification is restricted by the
existence and production of bio-chemical 'substances' needed for plasticity
development. In this paper, the information about the noise-to-signal ratio is
used to control such a substances' production and storage and to drive the
neuron's synaptic pressures towards the state with the best signal-to-noise
ratio. Several experiments with different input signal regimes are considered
to understand the functioning of the proposed approach.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09884</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are general-purpose optimization algorithms,
inspired by natural evolution. Recent theoretical studies have shown that EAs
can achieve good approximation guarantees for solving the problem classes of
submodular optimization, which have a wide range of applications, such as
maximum coverage, sparse regression, influence maximization, document
summarization and sensor placement, just to name a few. Though they have
provided some theoretical explanation for the general-purpose nature of EAs,
the considered submodular objective functions are defined only over sets or
multisets. To complement this line of research, this paper studies the problem
class of maximizing monotone submodular functions over sequences, where the
objective function depends on the order of items. We prove that for each kind
of previously studied monotone submodular objective functions over sequences,
i.e., prefix monotone submodular functions, weakly monotone and strongly
submodular functions, and DAG monotone submodular functions, a simple
multi-objective EA, i.e., GSEMO, can always reach or improve the best known
approximation guarantee after running polynomial time in expectation. Note that
these best-known approximation guarantees can be obtained only by different
greedy-style algorithms before. Empirical studies on various applications,
e.g., accomplishing tasks, maximizing information gain, search-and-tracking and
recommender systems, show the excellent performance of the GSEMO.

structure prediction becomes an important method for discovering new materials.
In our previous work, we proposed a contact map-based crystal structure
prediction method, which uses global optimization algorithms such as genetic
algorithms to maximize the match between the contact map of the predicted
structure and the contact map of the real crystal structure to search for the
coordinates at the Wyckoff Positions(WP). However, when predicting the crystal
structure with high symmetry, we found that the global optimization algorithm
has difficulty to find an effective combination of WPs that satisfies the
chemical formula, which is mainly caused by the inconsistency between the
dimensionality of the contact map of the predicted crystal structure and the
dimensionality of the contact map of the target crystal structure. This makes
it challenging to predict the crystal structures of high-symmetry crystals. In
order to solve this problem, here we propose to use PyXtal to generate and
filter random crystal structures with given symmetry constraints based on the
information such as chemical formulas and space groups. With contact map as the
optimization goal, we use differential evolution algorithms to search for
non-special coordinates at the Wyckoff positions to realize the structure
prediction of high-symmetry crystal materials. Our experimental results show
that our proposed algorithm CMCrystalHS can effectively solve the problem of
inconsistent contact map dimensions and predict the crystal structures with
high symmetry.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09743</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A central goal of neuroscience is to understand the representations formed by
brain activity patterns and their connection to behavior. The classical
approach is to investigate how individual neurons encode the stimuli and how
their tuning determines the fidelity of the neural representation. Tuning
analyses often use the Fisher information to characterize the sensitivity of
neural responses to small changes of the stimulus. In recent decades,
measurements of large populations of neurons have motivated a complementary
approach, which focuses on the information available to linear decoders. The
decodable information is captured by the geometry of the representational
patterns in the multivariate response space. Here we review neural tuning and
representational geometry with the goal of clarifying the relationship between
them. The tuning induces the geometry, but different sets of tuned neurons can
induce the same geometry. The geometry determines the Fisher information, the
mutual information, and the behavioral performance of an ideal observer in a
range of psychophysical tasks. We argue that future studies can benefit from
considering both tuning and geometry to understand neural codes and reveal the
connections between stimulus, brain activity, and behavior.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Hypervolume-Optimal $\mu$-Distributions on Line/Plane-based Pareto Fronts in Three Dimensions. (arXiv:2104.09736v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09736</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hypervolume is widely used in the evolutionary multi-objective optimization
(EMO) field to evaluate the quality of a solution set. For a solution set with
$\mu$ solutions on a Pareto front, a larger hypervolume means a better solution
set. Investigating the distribution of the solution set with the largest
hypervolume is an important topic in EMO, which is the so-called hypervolume
optimal $\mu$-distribution. Theoretical results have shown that the $\mu$
solutions are uniformly distributed on a linear Pareto front in two dimensions.
However, the $\mu$ solutions are not always uniformly distributed on a
single-line Pareto front in three dimensions. They are only uniform when the
single-line Pareto front has one constant objective. In this paper, we further
investigate the hypervolume optimal $\mu$-distribution in three dimensions. We
consider the line- and plane-based Pareto fronts. For the line-based Pareto
fronts, we extend the single-line Pareto front to two-line and three-line
Pareto fronts, where each line has one constant objective. For the plane-based
Pareto fronts, the linear triangular and inverted triangular Pareto fronts are
considered. First, we show that the $\mu$ solutions are not always uniformly
distributed on the line-based Pareto fronts. The uniformity depends on how the
lines are combined. Then, we show that a uniform solution set on the
plane-based Pareto front is not always optimal for hypervolume maximization. It
is locally optimal with respect to a $(\mu+1)$ selection scheme. Our results
can help researchers in the community to better understand and utilize the
hypervolume indicator.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We introduce a new set of models and adaptive psychometric testing methods
for multidimensional psychophysics. In contrast to traditional adaptive
staircase methods like PEST and QUEST, the method is multi-dimensional and does
not require a grid over contextual dimensions, retaining sub-exponential
scaling in the number of stimulus dimensions. In contrast to more recent
multi-dimensional adaptive methods, our underlying model does not require a
parametric assumption about the interaction between intensity and the
additional dimensions. In addition, we introduce a new active sampling policy
that explicitly targets psychometric detection threshold estimation and does so
substantially faster than policies that attempt to estimate the full
psychometric function (though it still provides estimates of the function,
albeit with lower accuracy). Finally, we introduce AEPsych, a user-friendly
open-source package for nonparametric psychophysics that makes these
technically-challenging methods accessible to the broader community.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02720</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We study the problem of learning associative memory -- a system which is able
to retrieve a remembered pattern based on its distorted or incomplete version.
Attractor networks provide a sound model of associative memory: patterns are
stored as attractors of the network dynamics and associative retrieval is
performed by running the dynamics starting from a query pattern until it
converges to an attractor. In such models the dynamics are often implemented as
an optimization procedure that minimizes an energy function, such as in the
classical Hopfield network. In general it is difficult to derive a writing rule
for a given dynamics and energy that is both compressive and fast. Thus, most
research in energy-based memory has been limited either to tractable energy
models not expressive enough to handle complex high-dimensional objects such as
natural images, or to models that do not offer fast writing. We present a novel
meta-learning approach to energy-based memory models (EBMM) that allows one to
use an arbitrary neural architecture as an energy model and quickly store
patterns in its weights. We demonstrate experimentally that our EBMM approach
can build compressed memories for synthetic and natural data, and is capable of
associative retrieval that outperforms existing memory systems in terms of the
reconstruction error and compression rate.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03884</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This paper presents a formal, mathematical foundation for modeling and
reasoning about the behavior of $synchronous$, $stochastic$ $Spiking$ $Neural$
$Networks$ $(SNNs)$. We define a basic SNN model, in which a neuron's only
state is a Boolean value indicating whether the neuron is currently firing. We
also define the $external\ behavior$ of an SNN. We define two operators on
SNNs: a $composition\ operator$, which supports modeling of SNNs as
combinations of smaller SNNs, and a $hiding\ operator$, which reclassifies some
output behavior of an SNN as internal. We prove results describing how the
external behavior of a network built using these operators is related to the
external behavior of the component networks. Finally, we give a formal
definition of a $problem$ to be solved by an SNN, and give basic results
showing how the composition and hiding operators affect the problems that are
solved by the networks. We illustrate our definitions with three examples: a
Boolean circuit constructed from gates, an $Attention$ network constructed from
a $Winner$-$Take$-$All$ network and a $Filter$ network, and a toy example
involving combining two networks in a cyclic fashion.

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.595507</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A large focus of modern neuroscience has revolved around preselected brain regions of interest based on prior studies. While there are reasons to focus on brain regions implicated in prior work, the result has been a biased assessment of brain function. Thus, many brain regions that may prove crucial in a wide range of neurobiological problems, including neurodegenerative diseases and neuropsychiatric disorders, have been neglected. Advances in neuroimaging and computational neuroscience have made it possible to make unbiased assessments of whole-brain function and identify previously overlooked regions of the brain. This review will discuss the tools that have been developed to advance neuroscience and network-based computational approaches used to further analyze the interconnectivity of the brain. Furthermore, it will survey examples of neural network approaches that assess connectivity in clinical (i.e., human) and preclinical (i.e., animal model) studies and discuss how preclinical studies of neurodegenerative diseases and neuropsychiatric disorders can greatly benefit from the unbiased nature of whole-brain imaging and network neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Pathogenic Functions of Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Factor 6 Signaling Following Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.629910</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuroinflammation contributes to delayed (secondary) neurodegeneration following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) signaling may promote post-TBI neuroinflammation, thereby exacerbating secondary injury. This study investigated the pathogenic functions of TRAF6 signaling following TBI in vivo and in vitro. A rat TBI model was established by air pressure contusion while lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure was used to induce inflammatory-like responses in cultured astrocytes. Model rats were examined for cell-specific expression of TRAF6, NF-κB, phosphorylated (p)-NF-κB, MAPKs (ERK, JNK, and p38), p-MAPKs, chemokines (CCL2 and CXCL1), and chemokine receptors (CCR2 and CXCR2) by immunofluorescence, RT-qPCR, western blotting, and ELISA, for apoptosis by TUNEL staining, and spatial cognition by Morris water maze testing. These measurements were compared between TBI model rats receiving intracerebral injections of TRAF6-targeted RNAi vector (AAV9-TRAF6-RNAi), empty vector, MAPK/NF-κB inhibitors, or vehicle. Primary astrocytes were stimulated with LPS following TRAF6 siRNA or control transfection, and NF-κB, MAPKs, chemokine, and chemokine receptor expression levels evaluated by western blotting and ELISA. TRAF6 was expressed mainly in astrocytes and neurons of injured cortex, peaking 3 days post-TBI. Knockdown by AAV9-TRAF6-RNAi improved spatial learning and memory, decreased TUNEL-positive cell number in injured cortex, and downregulated expression levels of p-NF-κB, p-ERK, p-JNK, p-p38, CCL2, CCR2, CXCL1, and CXCR2 post-TBI. Inhibitors of NF-κB, ERK, JNK, and p38 significantly suppressed CCL2, CCR2, CXCL1, and CXCR2 expression following TBI. Furthermore, TRAF6-siRNA inhibited LPS-induced NF-κB, ERK, JNK, p38, CCL2, and CXCL1 upregulation in cultured astrocytes. Targeting TRAF6-MAPKs/NF-κB-chemokine signaling pathways may provide a novel therapeutic approach for reducing post-TBI neuroinflammation and concomitant secondary injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Occipital Horn Syndrome as a Result of Splice Site Mutations in ATP7A. No Activity of ATP7A Splice Variants Missing Exon 10 or Exon 15</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.532291</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Disease-causing variants in ATP7A lead to two different phenotypes associated with copper deficiency; a lethal form called Menkes disease (MD), leading to early death, and a much milder form called occipital horn syndrome (OHS). Some investigators have proposed that an ATP7A transcript missing exon 10 leads to a partly active protein product resulting in the OHS phenotype. Here, we describe an individual with OHS, a biology professor, who survived until age 62 despite a splice site mutation, leading to skipping of exon 15. ATP7A transcripts missing exon 10, or exon 15 preserve the reading frame, but it is unknown if either of these alternative transcripts encode functional protein variants. We have investigated the molecular consequence of splice site mutations leading to skipping of exon 10 or exon 15 which have been identified in individuals with OHS, or MD. By comparing ATP7A expression in fibroblasts from three individuals with OHS (OHS-fibroblasts) to ATP7A expression in fibroblasts from two individuals with MD (MD-fibroblasts), we demonstrate that transcripts missing either exon 10 or exon 15 were present in similar amounts in OHS-fibroblasts and MD-fibroblasts. No ATP7A protein encoded from these transcripts could be detected in the OHS and MD fibroblast. These results, combined with the observation that constructs encoding ATP7A cDNA sequences missing either exon 10, or exon 15 were unable to complement the high iron requirement of the ccc2Δ yeast strain, provide evidence that neither a transcript missing exon 10 nor a transcript missing exon 15 results in functional ATP7A protein. In contrast, higher amounts of wild-type ATP7A transcript were present in the OHS-fibroblasts compared with the MD-fibroblasts. We found that the MD-fibroblasts contained between 0 and 0.5% of wild-type ATP7A transcript, whereas the OHS-fibroblasts contained between 3 and 5% wild-type transcripts compared with the control fibroblasts. In summary these results indicate that protein variants encoded by ATP7A transcripts missing either exon 10 or exon 15 are not functional and not responsible for the OHS phenotype. In contrast, expression of only 3-5% of wild-type transcript compared with the controls permits the OHS phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Functional Connectivity of the Human Paraventricular Thalamic Nucleus: Insights From High Field Functional MRI</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2021.662293</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) is a small but highly connected nucleus of the dorsal midline thalamus. The PVT has garnered recent attention as a context-sensitive node within the thalamocortical arousal system that modulates state-dependent motivated behaviors. Once considered related to generalized arousal responses with non-specific impacts on behavior, accumulating evidence bolsters the contemporary view that discrete midline thalamic subnuclei belong to specialized corticolimbic and corticostriatal circuits related to attention, emotions, and cognition. However, the functional connectivity patterns of the human PVT have yet to be mapped. Here, we combined high-quality, high-resolution 7T and 3T resting state MRI data from 121 young adult participants from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and thalamic subnuclei atlas masks to investigate resting state functional connectivity of the human PVT. The 7T results demonstrated extensive positive functional connectivity with the brainstem, midbrain, ventral and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), anterior and posterior cingulate, ventral striatum, hippocampus, and amygdala. These connections persist upon controlling for functional connectivity of the rest of the thalamus. Whole-brain contrasts provided further evidence that, compared to three nearby midline thalamic subnuclei, functional connectivity of the PVT is strong with the hippocampus, amygdala, ventral and dorsal mPFC, and middle temporal gyrus. These findings suggest that, even during rest, the human PVT is functionally coupled with many regions known to be structurally connected to rodent and non-human primate PVT. Further, cosine similarity analysis results suggested the PVT is integrated into the default mode network (DMN), an intrinsic connectivity network associated with episodic memory and self-referential thought. The current work provides a much-needed foundation for ongoing and future work examining the functional roles of the PVT in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.643148</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We derive a theoretical construct that allows for the characterisation of both scalable and scale free systems within the dynamic causal modelling (DCM) framework. We define a dynamical system to be “scalable” if the same equation of motion continues to apply as the system changes in size. As an example of such a system, we simulate planetary orbits varying in size and show that our proposed methodology can be used to recover Kepler’s third law from the timeseries. In contrast, a “scale free” system is one in which there is no characteristic length scale, meaning that images of such a system are statistically unchanged at different levels of magnification. As an example of such a system, we use calcium imaging collected in murine cortex and show that the dynamical critical exponent, as defined in renormalization group theory, can be estimated in an empirical biological setting. We find that a task-relevant region of the cortex is associated with higher dynamical critical exponents in task vs. spontaneous states and vice versa for a task-irrelevant region.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The mainstream view has long been that persistent activity is the neural basis of working memory, but recent experiments have observed that activity-silent memory can also be correctly recalled. The underlying mechanism of activity-silent memory is considered to be an alternative scheme that rejects the theory of persistent activity. We propose a working memory model based on spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). Different from models based on spike-rate coding, our model adopts temporal patterns of action potentials to represent information, so it can flexibly encode new memory representation. The model can work in both persistent and silent states, i.e., it is compatible with both of these seemingly conflicting neural mechanisms. We conducted a simulation experiment, and the results are similar to the real experimental results, which suggests that our model is plausible in biology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Activity Stabilization in a Population Model of Working Memory by Sinusoidal and Noisy Inputs</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.647944</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;According to mechanistic theories of working memory (WM), information is retained as stimulus-dependent persistent spiking activity of cortical neural networks. Yet, how this activity is related to changes in the oscillatory profile observed during WM tasks remains a largely open issue. We explore joint effects of input gamma-band oscillations and noise on the dynamics of several firing rate models of WM. The considered models have a metastable active regime, i.e., they demonstrate long-lasting transient post-stimulus firing rate elevation. We start from a single excitatory-inhibitory circuit and demonstrate that either gamma-band or noise input could stabilize the active regime, thus supporting WM retention. We then consider a system of two circuits with excitatory intercoupling. We find that fast coupling allows for better stabilization by common noise compared to independent noise and stronger amplification of this effect by in-phase gamma inputs compared to anti-phase inputs. Finally, we consider a multi-circuit system comprised of two clusters, each containing a group of circuits receiving a common noise input and a group of circuits receiving independent noise. Each cluster is associated with its own local gamma generator, so all its circuits receive gamma-band input in the same phase. We find that gamma-band input differentially stabilizes the activity of the “common-noise” groups compared to the “independent-noise” groups. If the inter-cluster connections are fast, this effect is more pronounced when the gamma-band input is delivered to the clusters in the same phase rather than in the anti-phase. Assuming that the common noise comes from a large-scale distributed WM representation, our results demonstrate that local gamma oscillations can stabilize the activity of the corresponding parts of this representation, with stronger effect for fast long-range connections and synchronized gamma oscillations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: A Hypothesis for Theta Rhythm Frequency Control in CA1 Microcircuits</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.643360</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Computational models of neural circuits with varying levels of biophysical detail have been generated in pursuit of an underlying mechanism explaining the ubiquitous hippocampal theta rhythm. However, within the theta rhythm are at least two types with distinct frequencies associated with different behavioral states, an aspect that must be considered in pursuit of these mechanistic explanations. Here, using our previously developed excitatory-inhibitory network models that generate theta rhythms, we investigate the robustness of theta generation to intrinsic neuronal variability by building a database of heterogeneous excitatory cells and implementing them in our microcircuit model. We specifically investigate the impact of three key “building block” features of the excitatory cell model that underlie our model design: these cells' rheobase, their capacity for post-inhibitory rebound, and their spike-frequency adaptation. We show that theta rhythms at various frequencies can arise dependent upon the combination of these building block features, and we find that the speed of these oscillations are dependent upon the excitatory cells' response to inhibitory drive, as encapsulated by their phase response curves. Taken together, these findings support a hypothesis for theta frequency control that includes two aspects: (i) an internal mechanism that stems from the building block features of excitatory cell dynamics; (ii) an external mechanism that we describe as “inhibition-based tuning” of excitatory cell firing. We propose that these mechanisms control theta rhythm frequencies and underlie their robustness.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Altered Phase Separation and Cellular Impact in C9orf72-Linked ALS/FTD</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.664151</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Since the discovery of the C9orf72 repeat expansion mutation as causative for chromosome 9-linked amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) in 2011, a multitude of cellular pathways have been implicated. However, evidence has also been accumulating for a key mechanism of cellular compartmentalization—phase separation. Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is fundamental for the formation of membraneless organelles including stress granules, the nucleolus, Cajal bodies, nuclear speckles and the central channel of the nuclear pore. Evidence has now accumulated showing that the formation and function of these membraneless organelles is impaired by both the toxic arginine rich dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs), translated from the C9orf72 repeat RNA transcript, and the repeat RNA itself. Both the arginine rich DPRs and repeat RNA themselves undergo phase separation and disrupt the physiological phase separation of proteins involved in the formation of these liquid-like organelles. Hence abnormal phase separation may explain a number of pathological cellular phenomena associated with C9orf72-ALS/FTD. In this review article, we will discuss the principles of phase separation, phase separation of the DPRs and repeat RNA themselves and how they perturb LLPS associated with membraneless organelles and the functional consequences of this. We will then discuss how phase separation may impact the major pathological feature of C9orf72-ALS/FTD, TDP-43 proteinopathy, and how LLPS may be targeted therapeutically in disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.652647</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Stroke is the leading cause of disability and mortality in the world, but the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke (IS) is not completely clear and treatments are limited. Mounting evidence indicate that neovascularization is a critical defensive reaction to hypoxia that modulates the process of long-term neurologic recovery after IS. Angiogenesis is a complex process in which the original endothelial cells in blood vessels are differentiated, proliferated, migrated, and finally remolded into new blood vessels. Many immune cells and cytokines, as well as growth factors, are directly or indirectly involved in the regulation of angiogenesis. Inflammatory cells can affect endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and activation by secreting a variety of cytokines via various inflammation-relative signaling pathways and thus participate in the process of angiogenesis. However, the mechanism of inflammation-mediated angiogenesis has not been fully elucidated. Hence, this review aimed to discuss the mechanism of inflammation-mediated angiogenesis in IS and to provide new ideas for clinical treatment of IS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: The hippocampus and its subfields (HippSub) are reported to be diminished in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD). We examined these groups vs healthy controls (HC) to reveal HippSub alterations between diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We segmented 3T-MRI T2-weighted hippocampal images of 67 HC, 58 BD, and MDD patients from the AFFDIS study and 137 patients from the DELCODE study assessing cognitive decline, including subjective cognitive decline (SCD), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and AD, via Free Surfer 6.0 to compare volumes across groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Groups differed significantly in several HippSub volumes, particularly between patients with AD and mood disorders. In comparison to HC, significant lower volumes appear in aMCI and AD groups in specific subfields. Smaller volumes in the left presubiculum are detected in aMCI and AD patients, differing from the BD group. A significant linear regression is seen between left hippocampus volume and duration since the first depressive episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: HippSub volume alterations were observed in AD, but not in early-onset MDD and BD, reinforcing the notion of different neural mechanisms in hippocampal degeneration. Moreover, duration since the first depressive episode was a relevant factor explaining the lower left hippocampal volumes present in groups.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: DHCR24 Knock-Down Induced Tau Hyperphosphorylation at Thr181, Ser199, Thr231, Ser262, Ser396 Epitopes and Inhibition of Autophagy by Overactivation of GSK3β/mTOR Signaling</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.513605</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Accumulating evidences supported that knock-down of DHCR24 is linked to the pathological risk factors of AD, suggesting a potential role of DHCR24 in AD pathogenesis. However, the molecular mechanism link between DHCR24 and tauopathy remains unknown. Here, in order to elucidate the relationship between DHCR24 and tauopathy, we will focus on the effect of DHCR24 on the tau hyperphosphorylation at some toxic sites. In present study, we found that DHCR24 knock-down significantly lead to the hyperphosphorylation of tau sites at Thr181, Ser199, Thr231, Ser262, Ser396. Moreover, DHCR24 knock-down also increase the accumulation of p62 protein, simultaneously decreased the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I and the number of autophagosome compared to the control groups, suggesting the inhibition of autophagy activity. In contrast, DHCR24 knock-in obviously abolished the effect of DHCR24 knock-down on tau hyperphosphrylation and autophagy. In addition, to elucidate the association between DHCR24 and tauopathy, we further showed that the level of plasma membrane cholesterol, lipid raft-anchored protein caveolin-1, and concomitantly total I class PI3-K (p110α), phospho-Akt (Thr308 and Ser473) were significantly decreased, resulting in the disruption of lipid raft/caveola and inhibition of PI3-K/Akt signaling in silencing DHCR24 SH-SY5Y cells compared to control groups. At the same time, DHCR24 knock-down simultaneously decreased the level of phosphorylated GSK3β at Ser9 (inactive form) and increased the level of phosphorylated mTOR at Ser2448 (active form), leading to overactivation of GSK3β and mTOR signaling. On the contrary, DHCR24 knock-in largely increased the level of membrane cholesterol and caveolin-1, suggesting the enhancement of lipid raft/caveola. And synchronously DHCR24 knock-in also abolished the effect of DHCR24 knock-down on the inhibition of PI3-K/Akt signaling as well as the overactivation of GSK3β and mTOR signaling. Collectively, our data strongly supported DHCR24 knock-down lead to tau hyperphosphorylation and the inhibition of autophagy by a lipid raft-dependent PI3-K/Akt-mediated GSK3β and mTOR signaling. Taking together, our results firstly demonstrated that the decrease of plasma membrane cholesterol mediated by DHCR24 deficiency might contribute to the tauopathy in AD and other tauopathies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68848</link>
	<content:encoded>Animals exhibit behavioral and neural responses that persist on longer time scales than transient or fluctuating stimulus inputs. Here, we report that &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; uses feedback from the motor circuit to a sensory processing interneuron to sustain its motor state during thermotactic navigation. By imaging circuit activity in behaving animals, we show that a principal postsynaptic partner of the AFD thermosensory neuron, the AIY interneuron, encodes both temperature and motor state information. By optogenetic and genetic manipulation of this circuit, we demonstrate that the motor state representation in AIY is a corollary discharge signal. RIM, an interneuron that is connected with premotor interneurons, is required for this corollary discharge. Ablation of RIM eliminates the motor representation in AIY, allows thermosensory representations to reach downstream premotor interneurons, and reduces the animal's ability to sustain forward movements during thermotaxis. We propose that feedback from the motor circuit to the sensory processing circuit underlies a positive feedback mechanism to generate persistent neural activity and sustained behavioral patterns in a sensorimotor transformation.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Reduced activity of the insulin/IGF signalling network increases health during ageing in multiple species. Diverse and tissue-specific mechanisms drive the health improvement. Here, we performed tissue-specific transcriptional and proteomic profiling of long-lived &lt;i&gt;Drosophila dilp2-3,5&lt;/i&gt; mutants, and identified tissue-specific regulation of &amp;gt;3600 transcripts and &amp;gt;3700 proteins. Most expression changes were regulated post-transcriptionally in the fat body, and only in mutants infected with the endosymbiotic bacteria, &lt;i&gt;Wolbachia pipientis&lt;/i&gt;, which increases their lifespan. Bioinformatic analysis identified reduced co-translational ER targeting of secreted and membrane-associated proteins and increased DNA damage/repair response proteins. Accordingly, age-related DNA damage and genome instability were lower in fat body of the mutant, and overexpression of a minichromosome maintenance protein subunit extended lifespan. Proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism showed altered expression in the mutant intestine, and gut-specific overexpression of a lysosomal mannosidase increased autophagy, gut homeostasis, and lifespan. These processes are candidates for combatting ageing-related decline in other organisms.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/67027</link>
	<content:encoded>The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) form a family of neuromodulatory G protein-coupled receptors that contain both a seven-helix transmembrane domain (TMD) and a large extracellular ligand-binding domain (LBD) which enables stable dimerization. While numerous studies have revealed variability across subtypes in the initial activation steps at the level of LBD dimers, an understanding of inter-TMD interaction and rearrangement remains limited. Here we use a combination of single molecule fluorescence, molecular dynamics, functional assays, and conformational sensors to reveal that distinct TMD assembly properties drive differences between mGluR subtypes. We uncover a variable region within transmembrane helix 4 (TM4) that contributes to homo- and heterodimerization in a subtype-specific manner and tunes orthosteric, allosteric and basal activation. We also confirm a critical role for a conserved inter-TM6 interface in stabilizing the active state during orthosteric or allosteric activation. Together this study shows that inter-TMD assembly and dynamic rearrangement drive mGluR function with distinct properties between subtypes.</content:encoded>

We developed BonVision as an easy-to-use open-source software for the display of virtual or augmented reality, as well as standard visual stimuli. BonVision has been tested on humans and mice, and is capable of supporting new experimental designs in other animal models of vision. As the architecture is based on the open-source Bonsai graphical programming language, BonVision benefits from native integration with experimental hardware. BonVision therefore enables easy implementation of closed-loop experiments, including real-time interaction with deep neural networks, and communication with behavioural and physiological measurement and manipulation devices.</content:encoded>

In this work, non-invasive high-spatial resolution three-dimensional (3D) X-ray micro-computed tomography (μCT) of healthy mouse lung vasculature is performed. Methodologies are presented for filtering, segmenting, and skeletonizing the collected 3D images. Novel methods for the removal of spurious branch artefacts from the skeletonized 3D image are introduced, and these novel methods involve a combination of distance transform gradients, diameter-length ratios, and the fast marching method (FMM). These new techniques of spurious branch removal result in the consistent removal of spurious branches without compromising the connectivity of the pulmonary circuit. Analysis of the filtered, skeletonized, and segmented 3D images is performed using a newly developed Vessel Network Extraction algorithm to fully characterize the morphology of the mouse pulmonary circuit. The removal of spurious branches from the skeletonized image results in an accurate representation of the pulmonary circuit with significantly less variability in vessel diameter and vessel length in each generation. The branching morphology of a full pulmonary circuit is characterized by the mean diameter per generation and number of vessels per generation. The methods presented in this paper lead to a significant improvement in the characterization of 3D vasculature imaging, allow for automatic separation of arteries and veins, and for the characterization of generations containing capillaries and intrapulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses (IPAVA).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/h1OQ5sc_iwg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Identifying the animal reservoirs from which zoonotic viruses will likely emerge is central to understanding the determinants of disease emergence. Accordingly, there has been an increase in studies attempting zoonotic “risk assessment.” Herein, we demonstrate that the virological data on which these analyses are conducted are incomplete, biased, and rapidly changing with ongoing virus discovery. Together, these shortcomings suggest that attempts to assess zoonotic risk using available virological data are likely to be inaccurate and largely only identify those host taxa that have been studied most extensively. We suggest that virus surveillance at the human–animal interface may be more productive.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0mmobxPO1rg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Objective
Investigate the gut microbiome in progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) and how it relates to clinical disease.


Methods
We sequenced the microbiota from healthy controls, relapsing remitting MS (RRMS), and progressive MS patients and correlated the levels of bacteria with clinical features of disease, including EDSS, quality of life, and brain MRI lesions/atrophy. We colonized mice with MS‐derived Akkermansia and induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.


Results
Microbiota β‐diversity differed between MS patients vs. controls but did not differ between RRMS vs. progressive MS or differ based on disease modifying therapies. Disease status had the greatest effect on the microbiome β‐diversity, followed by BMI, race, and sex. In both progressive and RRMS, we found increased Clostridium bolteae, Ruthenibacterium lactatiformans and Akkermansia and decreased Blautia wexlerae, Dorea formicigenerans, and Erysipelotrichaceae CCM. Unique to progressive MS, we found elevated Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridium g24 FCEY and decreased Blautia and Agathobaculum. Several Clostridium species were associated with higher EDSS and fatigue scores. Contrary to the view that elevated Akkermansia in MS has a detrimental role, we found that Akkermansia was linked to lower disability, suggesting a beneficial role. Consistent with this, we found that Akkermansia isolated from MS patients ameliorated EAE, which was linked to a reduction in RORγt+ and IL‐17 producing γδ T cells.


Interpretation
While some microbiota alterations are shared in relapsing and progressive MS, we identified unique bacteria associated with progressive MS and clinical measures of disease. Furthermore, elevated Akkermansia in MS may be a compensatory beneficial response in the MS microbiome.

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Caring for People With Dementia Under COVID-19 Restrictions: A Pilot Study on Family Caregivers</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.652833</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction&lt;p&gt;The present pilot study examined to what extent the COVID-19 lockdown affected the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in people with dementia and worsened their family caregivers’ distress. The associations between changes in the BPSD of relatives with dementia (RwD) and in their caregivers’ distress, and sense of social and emotional loneliness, and resilience were also investigated.&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;Thirty-five caregivers of RwD attending formal healthcare services before the COVID-19 lockdown volunteered for the study, and were interviewed by phone during the lockdown. Caregivers completed the NeuroPsychiatric Inventory (NPI) to assess their care recipients’ BPSD and their own distress, and two questionnaires assessing their social and emotional loneliness, and their resilience.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;No clear changes emerged in either the BPSD of the RwD or the caregivers’ distress during lockdown compared with before the pandemic. Caregivers reporting more frequent and severe BPSD in their RwD before the lockdown scored higher on emotional loneliness. Those reporting more frequent and severe BPSD under lockdown, especially men and those taking care of RwD with more advanced dementia, scored higher on both social and emotional loneliness. A significant negative correlation also emerged between caregivers’ resilience and changes in their level of distress due to the lockdown, with female caregivers reporting greater resilience.&lt;/p&gt;Discussion&lt;p&gt;Our findings offer preliminary insight on the effects of loneliness and resilience, and on the influence of individual characteristics on the experience and consequences of informal caregiving for RwD in times of restrictions imposed by a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Cnr2 Is Important for Ribbon Synapse Maturation and Function in Hair Cells and Photoreceptors</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.624265</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The role of the cannabinoid receptor 2 (CNR2) is still poorly described in sensory epithelia. We found strong cnr2 expression in hair cells (HCs) of the inner ear and the lateral line (LL), a superficial sensory structure in fish. Next, we demonstrated that sensory synapses in HCs were severely perturbed in larvae lacking cnr2. Appearance and distribution of presynaptic ribbons and calcium channels (Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.3) were profoundly altered in mutant animals. Clustering of membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) in post-synaptic densities (PSDs) was also heavily affected, suggesting a role for cnr2 for maintaining the sensory synapse. Furthermore, vesicular trafficking in HCs was strongly perturbed suggesting a retrograde action of the endocannabinoid system (ECs) via cnr2 that was modulating HC mechanotransduction. We found similar perturbations in retinal ribbon synapses. Finally, we showed that larval swimming behaviors after sound and light stimulations were significantly different in mutant animals. Thus, we propose that cnr2 is critical for the processing of sensory information in the developing larva.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.668857</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Stem cell scientists have developed methods for the self-formation of artificial organs, often referred to as organoids. Organoids can be used as model systems for research in multiple biological disciplines. Yoshiki Sasai’s innovation for deriving mammalian retinal tissue from in vitro stem cells has had a large impact on the study of the biology of vision. New developments in retinal organoid technology provide avenues for in vitro models of human retinal diseases, studies of pathological mechanisms, and development of therapies for retinal degeneration, including electronic retinal implants and gene therapy. Moreover, these innovations have played key roles in establishing models for large-scale drug screening, studying the stages of retinal development, and providing a human model for personalized therapeutic approaches, like cell transplants to replace degenerated retinal cells. Here, we first discuss the importance of human retinal organoids to the biomedical sciences. Then, we review various functional features of retinal organoids that have been developed. Finally, we highlight the current limitations of retinal organoid technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Vascular Senescence: A Potential Bridge Between Physiological Aging and Neurogenic Decline</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.666881</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The adult mammalian brain contains distinct neurogenic niches harboring populations of neural stem cells (NSCs) with the capacity to sustain the generation of specific subtypes of neurons during the lifetime. However, their ability to produce new progeny declines with age. The microenvironment of these specialized niches provides multiple cellular and molecular signals that condition NSC behavior and potential. Among the different niche components, vasculature has gained increasing interest over the years due to its undeniable role in NSC regulation and its therapeutic potential for neurogenesis enhancement. NSCs are uniquely positioned to receive both locally secreted factors and adhesion-mediated signals derived from vascular elements. Furthermore, studies of parabiosis indicate that NSCs are also exposed to blood-borne factors, sensing and responding to the systemic circulation. Both structural and functional alterations occur in vasculature with age at the cellular level that can affect the proper extrinsic regulation of NSCs. Additionally, blood exchange experiments in heterochronic parabionts have revealed that age-associated changes in blood composition also contribute to adult neurogenesis impairment in the elderly. Although the mechanisms of vascular- or blood-derived signaling in aging are still not fully understood, a general feature of organismal aging is the accumulation of senescent cells, which act as sources of inflammatory and other detrimental signals that can negatively impact on neighboring cells. This review focuses on the interactions between vascular senescence, circulating pro-senescence factors and the decrease in NSC potential during aging. Understanding the mechanisms of NSC dynamics in the aging brain could lead to new therapeutic approaches, potentially include senolysis, to target age-dependent brain decline.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Serum Lp-PLA2 level was detected. According to the disease course and severity, PD patients were subdivided to analyze the clinical value of Lp-PLA2. Relationship between Lp-PLA2 and PD risk was analyzed by logistic regression. Diagnostic value of Lp-PLA2 in PD patients was investigated using receiver’s operator characteristic curves.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Lp-PLA2 level was significantly higher in the PD patients compared with the controls, and was significantly and positively correlated with the Hoehn-Yahr (H&amp;amp;Y) stage. The serum Lp-PLA2 level and H&amp;amp;Y stage of PD patients with a longer disease course were significantly higher than those with a shorter disease course. PD patients with milder conditions had significantly lower serum Lp-PLA2 levels than patients with severe conditions. Multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated higher Lp-PLA2 level was an independent risk factor of PD patients. Moreover, the area under the curve for Lp-PLA2 was 0.703, which was between those of homocysteine and serum amylase A.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that increased level of Lp-PLA2 is associated with the risk of PD. Lp-PLA2 may be used for early detection of PD, and provides an effective intervention target for clinical treatment of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Voxel-wise group analysis is presented as a novel feature selection (FS) technique for a deep learning (DL) approach to brain imaging data classification. The method, based on a voxel-wise two-sample t-test and denoted as t-masking, is integrated into the learning procedure as a data-driven FS strategy. t-Masking has been introduced in a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the test bench of binary classification of very-mild Alzheimer’s disease vs. normal control, using a structural magnetic resonance imaging dataset of 180 subjects. To better characterize the t-masking impact on CNN classification performance, six different experimental configurations were designed. Moreover, the performances of the presented FS method were compared to those of similar machine learning (ML) models that relied on different FS approaches. Overall, our results show an enhancement of about 6% in performance when t-masking was applied. Moreover, the reported performance enhancement was higher with respect to similar FS-based ML models. In addition, evaluation of the impact of t-masking on various selection rates has been provided, serving as a useful characterization for future insights. The proposed approach is also highly generalizable to other DL architectures, neuroimaging modalities, and brain pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Ventral Striatal Activation During Reward Anticipation of Different Reward Probabilities in Adolescents and Adults</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.649724</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Adolescence has been linked to an enhanced tolerance of uncertainty and risky behavior and is possibly connected to an increased response toward rewards. However, previous research has produced inconsistent findings. To investigate whether these findings are due to different reward probabilities used in the experimental design, we extended a monetary incentive delay (MID) task by including three different reward probabilities. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, 25 healthy adolescents and 22 adults were studied during anticipation of rewards in the VS. Differently colored cue stimuli indicated either a monetary or verbal trial and symbolized different reward probabilities, to which the participants were blinded. Results demonstrated faster reaction times for lower reward probabilities (33%) in both age groups. Adolescents were slower through all conditions and had less activation on a neural level. Imaging results showed a three-way interaction between age group x condition x reward probability with differences in percent signal change between adolescents and adults for the high reward probabilities (66%, 88%) while adolescents demonstrated differences for the lowest (33%). Therefore, previous inconsistent findings could be due to different reward probabilities, which makes examining these crucial for a better understanding of adolescent and adult behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Lost in Translation: Simple Steps in Experimental Design of Neurorehabilitation-Based Research Interventions to Promote Motor Recovery Post-Stroke</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.644335</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Stroke continues to be a leading cause of disability. Basic neurorehabilitation research is necessary to inform the neuropathophysiology of impaired motor control, and to develop targeted interventions with potential to remediate disability post-stroke. Despite knowledge gained from basic research studies, the effectiveness of research-based interventions for reducing motor impairment has been no greater than standard of practice interventions. In this perspective, we offer suggestions for overcoming translational barriers integral to experimental design, to augment traditional protocols, and re-route the rehabilitation trajectory toward recovery and away from compensation. First, we suggest that researchers consider modifying task practice schedules to focus on key aspects of movement quality, while minimizing the appearance of compensatory behaviors. Second, we suggest that researchers supplement primary outcome measures with secondary measures that capture emerging maladaptive compensations at other segments or joints. Third, we offer suggestions about how to maximize participant engagement, self-direction, and motivation, by embedding the task into a meaningful context, a strategy more likely to enable goal-action coupling, associated with improved neuro-motor control and learning. Finally, we remind the reader that motor impairment post-stroke is a multidimensional problem that involves central and peripheral sensorimotor systems, likely influenced by chronicity of stroke. Thus, stroke chronicity should be given special consideration for both participant recruitment and subsequent data analyses. We hope that future research endeavors will consider these suggestions in the design of the next generation of intervention studies in neurorehabilitation, to improve translation of research advances to improved participation and quality of life for stroke survivors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain structural covariance network (SCN) can delineate the brain synchronized alterations in a long-range time period.

Recently, causal analysis of structural covariance network (CaSCN), winner-take-all and cortex–subcortex covariance network (WTA-CSSCN), and modulation analysis of structural covariance network (MOD-SCN) have expended the technology breadth of SCN. However, the lack of user-friendly software limited the further application of SCN for the research. In this work, we developed the graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit of brain structural covariance connectivity based on MATLAB platform. The software contained the analysis of SCN, CaSCN, MOD-SCN, and WTA-CSSCN. Also, the group comparison and result-showing modules were included in the software.

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Pathophysiological Bases of Comorbidity in Migraine</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.640574</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Despite that it is commonly accepted that migraine is a disorder of the nervous system with a prominent genetic basis, it is comorbid with a plethora of medical conditions. Several studies have found bidirectional comorbidity between migraine and different disorders including neurological, psychiatric, cardio- and cerebrovascular, gastrointestinal, metaboloendocrine, and immunological conditions. Each of these has its own genetic load and shares some common characteristics with migraine. The bidirectional mechanisms that are likely to underlie this extensive comorbidity between migraine and other diseases are manifold. Comorbid pathologies can induce and promote thalamocortical network dysexcitability, multi-organ transient or persistent pro-inflammatory state, and disproportionate energetic needs in a variable combination, which in turn may be causative mechanisms of the activation of an ample defensive system with includes the trigeminovascular system in conjunction with the neuroendocrine hypothalamic system. This strategy is designed to maintain brain homeostasis by regulating homeostatic needs, such as normal subcortico-cortical excitability, energy balance, osmoregulation, and emotional response. In this light, the treatment of migraine should always involves a multidisciplinary approach, aimed at identifying and, if necessary, eliminating possible risk and comorbidity factors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Application of the Mirror Technique for Three-Dimensional Electron Microscopy of Neurochemically Identified GABA-ergic Dendrites</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.652422</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the nervous system synaptic input arrives chiefly on dendrites and their type and distribution have been assumed pivotal in signal integration. We have developed an immunohistochemistry (IH)-correlated electron microscopy (EM) method – the “mirror” technique – by which synaptic input to entire dendrites of neurochemically identified interneurons (INs) can be mapped due preserving high-fidelity tissue ultrastructure. Hence, this approach allows quantitative assessment of morphometric parameters of synaptic inputs along the whole length of dendrites originating from the parent soma. The method exploits the fact that adjoining sections have truncated or cut cell bodies which appear on the common surfaces in a mirror fashion. In one of the sections the histochemical marker of the GABAergic subtype, calbindin was revealed in cell bodies whereas in the other section the remaining part of the very same cell bodies were subjected to serial section EM to trace and reconstruct the synaptology of entire dendrites. Here, we provide exemplary data on the synaptic coverage of two dendrites belonging to the same calbindin-D&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt; immunopositive IN and determine the spatial distribution of asymmetric and symmetric synapses, surface area and volume of the presynaptic boutons, morphometric parameters of synaptic vesicles, and area extent of the active zones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Being the Family Caregiver of a Patient With Dementia During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Lockdown</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.653533</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Family caregivers of patients with dementia are at high risk of stress and burden, and quarantine due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may have increased the risk of psychological disturbances in this population. The current study was carried out during the national lockdown declared in March 2020 by the Italian government as a containment measure of the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic and is the first nationwide survey on the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the mental health of dementia informal caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Eighty-seven dementia centers evenly distributed on the Italian territory enrolled 4,710 caregiver–patient pairs. Caregivers underwent a telephone interview assessing classical symptoms of caregiver stress and concern for the consequences of COVID-19 infection on patient’s health. We calculated prevalence of symptoms and regressed them on various potential stress risk factors: caregivers’ sociodemographic characteristics and lifestyle, patients’ clinical features, and lockdown-related elements, like discontinuity in medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Approximately 90% of caregivers reported at least one symptom of stress, and nearly 30% reported four or more symptoms. The most prevalent symptoms were concern for consequences of COVID-19 on patient’s health (75%) and anxiety (46%). The main risk factors for stress were identified as a conflicting relationship with the patient and discontinuity in assistance, but caregiver’s female sex, younger age, lower education, and cohabitation with the patient also had an impact. Availability of help from institutions or private individuals showed a protective effect against sense of abandonment but a detrimental effect on concern about the risk for the patient to contract COVID-19. The only protective factor was mild dementia severity, which was associated with a lower risk of feeling isolated and abandoned; type of dementia, on the other hand, did not affect stress risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the large prevalence of stress in family caregivers of patients with dementia during the COVID-19 pandemic and have identified both caregivers and situations at a higher risk of stress, which should be taken into account in the planning of interventions in support of quarantined families and patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Co-registration Analysis of Fluorodopa and Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography for Differentiating Multiple System Atrophy Parkinsonism Type From Parkinson's Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.648531</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to differentiate between Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy parkinsonian subtype (MSA-P) because of the overlap of their signs and symptoms. Enormous efforts have been made to develop positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to differentiate these diseases. This study aimed to investigate the co-registration analysis of &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-fluorodopa and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flurodeoxyglucose PET images to visualize the difference between Parkinson's disease and MSA-P. We enrolled 29 Parkinson's disease patients, 28 MSA-P patients, and 10 healthy controls, who underwent both &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-fluorodopa and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flurodeoxyglucose PET scans. Patients with Parkinson's disease and MSA-P exhibited reduced bilateral striatal &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-fluorodopa uptake (p &amp;lt; 0.05, vs. healthy controls). Both regional specific uptake ratio analysis and statistical parametric mapping analysis of &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flurodeoxyglucose PET revealed hypometabolism in the bilateral putamen of MSA-P patients and hypermetabolism in the bilateral putamen of Parkinson's disease patients. There was a significant positive correlation between &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flurodeoxyglucose uptake and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-fluorodopa uptake in the contralateral posterior putamen of MSA-P patients (rs = 0.558, p = 0.002). Both &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flurodeoxyglucose and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-fluorodopa PET images showed that the striatum was rabbit-shaped in the healthy control group segmentation analysis. A defective rabbit-shaped striatum was observed in the &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-fluorodopa PET image of patients with Parkinson's disease and MSA-P. In the segmentation analysis of &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flurodeoxyglucose PET image, an intact rabbit-shaped striatum was observed in Parkinson's disease patients, whereas a defective rabbit-shaped striatum was observed in MSA-P patients. These findings suggest that there were significant differences in the co-registration analysis of &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flurodeoxyglucose and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-fluorodopa PET images, which could be used in the individual analysis to differentiate Parkinson's disease from MSA-P.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.646961</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;The risk of recurrent stroke following a minor stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) is high, when inflammation might play an important role. We aimed to evaluate the value of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in predicting composite cardiovascular events in patients with minor stroke and TIA.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Consecutive patients with acute minor stroke or TIA admitted within 24 h of symptoms onset during a 5-year period in a prospective stroke registry were analyzed. We calculated the NLR dividing absolute neutrophil count by absolute lymphocyte count tested within 24 h of admission. NLR ≥4th quartile was defined as high NLR. A composite outcome was defined as stroke, acute coronary syndrome or vascular death within 1 year. We investigated associations between NLR and the composite outcome in univariate and multivariate analyses, among all patients and in those aged over 60 years (i.e., older patients).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Overall, 841 patients (median age 68 years; 60.4% males) were recruited. No significant independent association was found between NLR and the composite outcome in multivariate analysis in the overall cohort. Among the 612 older patients (median age 73 years; 59.2% males), the median NLR was 2.76 (interquartile range 1.96−4.00) and 148 (24.2%) patients had high NLR. The composite outcome occurred in 77 (12.6%) older patients, who were more likely to have a high NLR (39.0% versus 22.1%; p = 0.001) than those without a composite outcome. In multivariate logistic regression, high NLR (adjusted odds ratio 2.00; 95% confidence interval 1.07−3.75; p = 0.031) was independently associated with the composite outcome in older patients.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;In older (aged ≥60 years) patients with acute minor stroke or TIA, a higher NLR, a marker of systemic inflammation that can be easily obtained in routine blood tests, is an independent predictor of subsequent cardiovascular events.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;This study screened potential fluid biomarkers and developed a prediction model based on the easily obtained information at initial inspection to identify ataxia patients more likely to have multiple system atrophy-cerebellar type (MSA-C).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We established a retrospective cohort with 125 ataxia patients from southwest China between April 2018 and June 2020. Demographic and laboratory variables obtained at the time of hospital admission were screened using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression and logistic regression to construct a diagnosis score. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and decision curve analyses were performed to assess the accuracy and net benefit of the model. Also, independent validation using 25 additional ataxia patients was carried out to verify the model efficiency. Then the model was translated into a visual and operable web application using the R studio and Shiny package.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;From 47 indicators, five variables were selected and integrated into the prediction model, including the age of onset (AO), direct bilirubin (DBIL), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), eGFR, and synuclein-alpha. The prediction model exhibited an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.929 for the training cohort and an AUC of 0.917 for the testing cohort. The decision curve analysis (DCA) plot displayed a good net benefit for this model, and external validation confirmed its reliability. The model also was translated into a web application that is freely available to the public.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The prediction model that was developed based on laboratory and demographic variables obtained from ataxia patients at admission to the hospital might help improve the ability to differentiate MSA-C from spinocerebellar ataxia clinically.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68128</link>
	<content:encoded>The multimodal sensory channel transient receptor potential vanilloid-3 (TRPV3) is expressed in epidermal keratinocytes and implicated in chronic pruritus, allergy, and inflammation-related skin disorders. Gain-of-function mutations of TRPV3 cause hair growth disorders in mice and Olmsted Syndrome in human. We here report that mouse and human TRPV3 channel is targeted by the clinical medication dyclonine that exerts a potent inhibitory effect. Accordingly, dyclonine rescued cell death caused by gain-of-function TRPV3 mutations and suppressed pruritus symptoms in vivo in mouse model. At the single-channel level, dyclonine inhibited TRPV3 open probability but not the unitary conductance. By molecular simulations and mutagenesis, we further uncovered key residues in TRPV3 pore region that could toggle the inhibitory efficiency of dyclonine. The functional and mechanistic insights obtained on dyclonine-TRPV3 interaction will help to conceive updated therapeutics for skin inflammation.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Bacterial members of the infant gut microbiota and bacterial-derived short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have been shown to be protective against childhood asthma, but a role for the fungal microbiota in asthma etiology remains poorly defined. We recently reported an association between overgrowth of the yeast &lt;i&gt;Pichia kudriavzevii &lt;/i&gt;in the gut microbiota of Ecuadorian infants and increased asthma risk. In the present study, we replicated these findings in Canadian infants and investigated a causal association between early life gut fungal dysbiosis and later allergic airway disease (AAD). In a mouse model, we demonstrate that overgrowth of &lt;i&gt;P. kudriavzevii &lt;/i&gt;within the neonatal gut exacerbates features of type-2 and -17 inflammation during AAD later in life. We further show that &lt;i&gt;P. kudriavzevii &lt;/i&gt;growth and adherence to gut epithelial cells are altered by SCFAs. Collectively, our results underscore the potential for leveraging inter-kingdom interactions when designing putative microbiota-based asthma therapeutics.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>To understand the spread of SARS-CoV2, in August and September 2020, the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (India), conducted a sero-survey across its constituent laboratories and centers across India. Of 10,427 volunteers, 1058 (10.14%) tested positive for SARS CoV2 anti-nucleocapsid (anti-NC) antibodies; 95% of which had surrogate neutralization activity. Three-fourth of these recalled no symptoms. Repeat serology tests at 3 (n=607) and 6 (n=175) months showed stable anti-NC antibodies but declining neutralization activity. Local sero-positivity was higher in densely populated cities and was inversely correlated with a 30 day change in regional test positivity rates (TPR). Regional seropositivity above 10% was associated with declining TPR. Personal factors associated with higher odds of sero-positivity were high-exposure work (Odds Ratio, 95% CI, p value; 2∙23, 1∙92–2∙59, &amp;lt;0.0001), use of public transport (1∙79, 1∙43–2∙24, &amp;lt;0.0001), not smoking (1∙52, 1∙16–1∙99, 0∙0257), non-vegetarian diet (1∙67, 1∙41–1∙99, &amp;lt;0.0001), and B blood group (1∙36,1∙15-1∙61, 0∙001).</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Nutrient dominance governs the assembly of microbial communities in mixed nutrient environments</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65948</link>
	<content:encoded>A major open question in microbial community ecology is whether we can predict how the components of a diet collectively determine the taxonomic composition of microbial communities. Motivated by this challenge, we investigate whether communities assembled in pairs of nutrients can be predicted from those assembled in every single nutrient alone. We find that although the null, naturally additive model generally predicts well the family-level community composition, there exist systematic deviations from the additive predictions that reflect generic patterns of nutrient dominance at the family level. Pairs of more-similar nutrients (e.g. two sugars) are on average more additive than pairs of more dissimilar nutrients (one sugar–one organic acid). Furthermore, sugar–acid communities are generally more similar to the sugar than the acid community, which may be explained by family-level asymmetries in nutrient benefits. Overall, our results suggest that regularities in how nutrients interact may help predict community responses to dietary changes.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) requires confirmation by Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Abbott ID NOW provides fast results but has been criticized for low sensitivity. Here we determine the sensitivity of ID NOW in an ambulatory population presenting for testing. The study enrolled 785 symptomatic patients, 21 of whom were positive by both ID NOW and RT-PCR, and 2 only by RT-PCR. All 189 asymptomatic patients tested negative. The positive percent agreement between the ID NOW assay and the RT-PCR assay was 91.3%, and negative percent agreement was 100%. The results from the current study were included into a larger systematic review of literature where at least 20 subjects were simultaneously tested using ID NOW and RT-PCR. The overall sensitivity for ID NOW assay was calculated at 84% (95% CI 55- 96%) and had the highest correlation to RT-PCR at viral loads most likely to be associated with transmissible infections.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64411</link>
	<content:encoded>Antimicrobial peptides form part of the innate immune response and play a vital role in host defense against pathogens. Here we report a new antimicrobial peptide belonging to the cathelicidin family, cathelicidin-MH (cath-MH), from the skin of &lt;i&gt;Microhyla heymonsivogt&lt;/i&gt; frog. Cath-MH has a single α-helical structure in membrane-mimetic environments and is antimicrobial against fungi and bacteria, especially Gram-negative bacteria. In contrast to other cathelicidins, cath-MH suppresses coagulation by affecting the enzymatic activities of tissue plasminogen activator, plasmin, β-tryptase, elastase, thrombin, and chymase. Cath-MH protects against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and cecal ligation and puncture-induced sepsis, effectively ameliorating multiorgan pathology and inflammatory cytokine through its antimicrobial, LPS-neutralizing, coagulation suppressing effects as well as suppression of MAPK signaling. Taken together, these data suggest that cath-MH is an attractive candidate therapeutic agent for the treatment of septic shock.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62952</link>
	<content:encoded>Aging is associated with distinct phenotypical, physiological, and functional changes, leading to disease and death. The progression of aging-related traits varies widely among individuals, influenced by their environment, lifestyle, and genetics. In this study, we conducted physiologic and functional tests cross-sectionally throughout the entire lifespan of male C57BL/6N mice. In parallel, metabolomics analyses in serum, brain, liver, heart, and skeletal muscle were also performed to identify signatures associated with frailty and age-dependent functional decline. Our findings indicate that declines in gait speed as a function of age and frailty are associated with a dramatic increase in the energetic cost of physical activity and decreases in working capacity. Aging and functional decline prompt organs to rewire their metabolism and substrate selection and towards redox-related pathways, mainly in liver and heart. Collectively, the data provide a framework to further understand and characterize processes of aging at the individual organism and organ levels.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Proteasome catalyzed peptide splicing (PCPS) of cancer-driving antigens could generate attractive neoepitopes to be targeted by TCR-based adoptive T cell therapy. Based on a spliced peptide prediction algorithm TCRs were generated against putative KRAS&lt;sup&gt;G12V&lt;/sup&gt; and RAC2&lt;sup&gt;P29L&lt;/sup&gt; derived neo-splicetopes with high HLA-A*02:01 binding affinity. TCRs generated in mice with a diverse human TCR repertoire specifically recognized the respective target peptides with high efficacy. However, we failed to detect any neo-splicetope specific T cell response when testing the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; neo-splicetope generation and obtained no experimental evidence that the putative KRAS&lt;sup&gt;G12V&lt;/sup&gt;- and RAC2&lt;sup&gt;P29L&lt;/sup&gt;-derived neo-splicetopes were naturally processed and presented. Furthermore, only the putative RAC2&lt;sup&gt;P29L&lt;/sup&gt;-derived neo-splicetopes was generated by &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; PCPS. The experiments pose severe questions on the notion that available algorithms or the &lt;i&gt;in vitro &lt;/i&gt;PCPS reaction reliably simulate &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; splicing and argue against the general applicability of an algorithm-driven 'reverse immunology' pipeline for the identification of cancer-specific neo-splicetopes.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: The biphasic and age-dependent impact of Klotho on hallmarks of aging and skeletal muscle function</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61138</link>
	<content:encoded>Aging is accompanied by disrupted information flow, resulting from accumulation of molecular mistakes. These mistakes ultimately give rise to debilitating disorders including skeletal muscle wasting, or sarcopenia. To derive a global metric of growing 'disorderliness' of aging muscle, we employed a statistical physics approach to estimate the state parameter, entropy, as a function of genes associated with hallmarks of aging. Escalating network entropy reached an inflection point at old age, while structural and functional alterations progressed into oldest-old age. To probe the potential for restoration of molecular 'order' and reversal of the sarcopenic phenotype, we systemically overexpressed the longevity protein, Klotho, via AAV. Klotho overexpression modulated genes representing all hallmarks of aging in old and oldest-old mice, but pathway enrichment revealed directions of changes were, for many genes, age-dependent. Functional improvements were also age-dependent. Klotho improved strength in old mice, but failed to induce benefits beyond the entropic tipping point.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Systematic comparison and prediction of the effects of missense mutations on protein-DNA and protein-RNA interactions</title>

The binding affinities of protein-nucleic acid interactions could be altered due to missense mutations occurring in DNA- or RNA-binding proteins, therefore resulting in various diseases. Unfortunately, a systematic comparison and prediction of the effects of mutations on protein-DNA and protein-RNA interactions (these two mutation classes are termed MPDs and MPRs, respectively) is still lacking. Here, we demonstrated that these two classes of mutations could generate similar or different tendencies for binding free energy changes in terms of the properties of mutated residues. We then developed regression algorithms separately for MPDs and MPRs by introducing novel geometric partition-based energy features and interface-based structural features. Through feature selection and ensemble learning, similar computational frameworks that integrated energy- and nonenergy-based models were established to estimate the binding affinity changes resulting from MPDs and MPRs, but the selected features for the final models were different and therefore reflected the specificity of these two mutation classes. Furthermore, the proposed methodology was extended to the identification of mutations that significantly decreased the binding affinities. Extensive validations indicated that our algorithm generally performed better than the state-of-the-art methods on both the regression and classification tasks.

The metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells creates metabolic vulnerabilities that can be therapeutically targeted. However, our understanding of metabolic dependencies and the pathway crosstalk that creates these vulnerabilities in cancer cells remains incomplete. Here, by integrating gene expression data with genetic loss-of-function and pharmacological screening data from hundreds of cancer cell lines, we identified metabolic vulnerabilities at the level of pathways rather than individual genes. This approach revealed that metabolic pathway dependencies are highly context-specific such that cancer cells are vulnerable to inhibition of one metabolic pathway only when activity of another metabolic pathway is altered. Notably, we also found that the no single metabolic pathway was universally essential, suggesting that cancer cells are not invariably dependent on any metabolic pathway. In addition, we confirmed that cell culture medium is a major confounding factor for the analysis of metabolic pathway vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, we found robust associations between metabolic pathway activity and sensitivity to clinically approved drugs that were independent of cell culture medium. Lastly, we used parallel integration of pharmacological and genetic dependency data to confidently identify metabolic pathway vulnerabilities. Taken together, this study serves as a comprehensive characterization of the landscape of metabolic pathway vulnerabilities in cancer cell lines.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QSI4-3h-Ths&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Sequence deeper without sequencing more: Bayesian resolution of ambiguously mapped reads</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/lxHOpbOVKoI/article</link>

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has transformed molecular biology and contributed to many seminal insights into genomic regulation and function. Apart from whole-genome sequencing, an NGS workflow involves alignment of the sequencing reads to the genome of study, after which the resulting alignments can be used for downstream analyses. However, alignment is complicated by the repetitive sequences; many reads align to more than one genomic locus, with 15–30% of the genome not being uniquely mappable by short-read NGS. This problem is typically addressed by discarding reads that do not uniquely map to the genome, but this practice can lead to systematic distortion of the data. Previous studies that developed methods for handling ambiguously mapped reads were often of limited applicability or were computationally intensive, hindering their broader usage. In this work, we present SmartMap: an algorithm that augments industry-standard aligners to enable usage of ambiguously mapped reads by assigning weights to each alignment with Bayesian analysis of the read distribution and alignment quality. SmartMap is computationally efficient, utilizing far fewer weighting iterations than previously thought necessary to process alignments and, as such, analyzing more than a billion alignments of NGS reads in approximately one hour on a desktop PC. By applying SmartMap to peak-type NGS data, including MNase-seq, ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq in three organisms, we can increase read depth by up to 53% and increase the mapped proportion of the genome by up to 18% compared to analyses utilizing only uniquely mapped reads. We further show that SmartMap enables the analysis of more than 140,000 repetitive elements that could not be analyzed by traditional ChIP-seq workflows, and we utilize this method to gain insight into the epigenetic regulation of different classes of repetitive elements. These data emphasize both the dangers of discarding ambiguously mapped reads and their power for driving biological discovery.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lxHOpbOVKoI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Mass Based Imaging (MBI) technologies such as Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging by time of flight (MIBI-TOF) and Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) allow for the simultaneous measurement of the expression levels of 40 or more proteins in biological tissue, providing insight into cellular phenotypes and organization &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt;. Imaging artifacts, resulting from the sample, assay or instrumentation complicate downstream analyses and require correction by domain experts. Here, we present MBI Analysis User Interface (MAUI), a series of graphical user interfaces that facilitate this data pre-processing, including the removal of channel crosstalk, noise and antibody aggregates. Our software streamlines these steps and accelerates processing by enabling real-time and interactive parameter tuning across multiple images.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OJnoGHD_DtQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Convolutional neural networks improve species distribution modelling by capturing the spatial structure of the environment</title>

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are statistical models suited for learning complex visual patterns. In the context of Species Distribution Models (SDM) and in line with predictions of landscape ecology and island biogeography, CNN could grasp how local landscape structure affects prediction of species occurrence in SDMs. The prediction can thus reflect the signatures of entangled ecological processes. Although previous machine-learning based SDMs can learn complex influences of environmental predictors, they cannot acknowledge the influence of environmental structure in local landscapes (hence denoted “punctual models”). In this study, we applied CNNs to a large dataset of plant occurrences in France (GBIF), on a large taxonomical scale, to predict ranked relative probability of species (by joint learning) to any geographical position. We examined the way local environmental landscapes improve prediction by performing alternative CNN models deprived of information on landscape heterogeneity and structure (“ablation experiments”). We found that the landscape structure around location crucially contributed to improve predictive performance of CNN-SDMs. CNN models can classify the predicted distributions of many species, as other joint modelling approaches, but they further prove efficient in identifying the influence of local environmental landscapes. CNN can then represent signatures of spatially structured environmental drivers. The prediction gain is noticeable for rare species, which open promising perspectives for biodiversity monitoring and conservation strategies. Therefore, the approach is of both theoretical and practical interest. We discuss the way to test hypotheses on the patterns learnt by CNN, which should be essential for further interpretation of the ecological processes at play.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/q7xKUcr8Ifw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Humans have the amazing ability to learn the dynamics of the body and environment to develop motor skills. Traditional motor studies using arm reaching paradigms have viewed this ability as the process of ‘internal model adaptation’. However, the behaviors have not been fully explored in the case when reaches fail to attain the intended target. Here we examined human reaching under two force fields types; one that induces failures (i.e., target errors), and the other that does not. Our results show the presence of a distinct failure-driven adaptation process that enables quick task success after failures, and before completion of internal model adaptation, but that can result in persistent changes to the undisturbed trajectory. These behaviors can be explained by considering a hierarchical interaction between internal model adaptation and the failure-driven adaptation of reach direction. Our findings suggest that movement failure is negotiated using hierarchical motor adaptations by humans.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/y64_0QXQutQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Estimating Transfer Entropy in Continuous Time Between Neural Spike Trains or Other Event-Based Data</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/it9Dz-VffxU/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by David P. Shorten, Richard E. Spinney, Joseph T. Lizier&lt;/p&gt;

Transfer entropy (TE) is a widely used measure of directed information flows in a number of domains including neuroscience. Many real-world time series for which we are interested in information flows come in the form of (near) instantaneous events occurring over time. Examples include the spiking of biological neurons, trades on stock markets and posts to social media, amongst myriad other systems involving events in continuous time throughout the natural and social sciences. However, there exist severe limitations to the current approach to TE estimation on such event-based data via discretising the time series into time bins: it is not consistent, has high bias, converges slowly and cannot simultaneously capture relationships that occur with very fine time precision as well as those that occur over long time intervals. Building on recent work which derived a theoretical framework for TE in continuous time, we present an estimation framework for TE on event-based data and develop a &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-nearest-neighbours estimator within this framework. This estimator is provably consistent, has favourable bias properties and converges orders of magnitude more quickly than the current state-of-the-art in discrete-time estimation on synthetic examples. We demonstrate failures of the traditionally-used source-time-shift method for null surrogate generation. In order to overcome these failures, we develop a local permutation scheme for generating surrogate time series conforming to the appropriate null hypothesis in order to test for the statistical significance of the TE and, as such, test for the conditional independence between the history of one point process and the updates of another. Our approach is shown to be capable of correctly rejecting or accepting the null hypothesis of conditional independence even in the presence of strong pairwise time-directed correlations. This capacity to accurately test for conditional independence is further demonstrated on models of a spiking neural circuit inspired by the pyloric circuit of the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion, succeeding where previous related estimators have failed.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/it9Dz-VffxU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: The dinucleotide composition of the Zika virus genome is shaped by conflicting evolutionary pressures in mammalian hosts and mosquito vectors</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/acvgEhXaVv8/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Jelke J. Fros, Imke Visser, Bing Tang, Kexin Yan, Eri Nakayama, Tessa M. Visser, Constantianus J. M. Koenraadt, Monique M. van Oers, Gorben P. Pijlman, Andreas Suhrbier, Peter Simmonds&lt;/p&gt;

Most vertebrate RNA viruses show pervasive suppression of CpG and UpA dinucleotides, closely resembling the dinucleotide composition of host cell transcriptomes. In contrast, CpG suppression is absent in both invertebrate mRNA and RNA viruses that exclusively infect arthropods. Arthropod-borne (arbo) viruses are transmitted between vertebrate hosts by invertebrate vectors and thus encounter potentially conflicting evolutionary pressures in the different cytoplasmic environments. Using a newly developed Zika virus (ZIKV) model, we have investigated how demands for CpG suppression in vertebrate cells can be reconciled with potentially quite different compositional requirements in invertebrates and how this affects ZIKV replication and transmission. Mutant viruses with synonymously elevated CpG or UpA dinucleotide frequencies showed attenuated replication in vertebrate cell lines, which was rescued by knockout of the zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP). Conversely, in mosquito cells, ZIKV mutants with elevated CpG dinucleotide frequencies showed substantially enhanced replication compared to wild type. Host-driven effects on virus replication attenuation and enhancement were even more apparent in mouse and mosquito models. Infections with CpG- or UpA-high ZIKV mutants in mice did not cause typical ZIKV-induced tissue damage and completely protected mice during subsequent challenge with wild-type virus, which demonstrates their potential as live-attenuated vaccines. In contrast, the CpG-high mutants displayed enhanced replication in &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes and a larger proportion of mosquitoes carried infectious virus in their saliva. These findings show that mosquito cells are also capable of discriminating RNA based on dinucleotide composition. However, the evolutionary pressure on the CpG dinucleotides of viral genomes in arthropod vectors directly opposes the pressure present in vertebrate host cells, which provides evidence that an adaptive compromise is required for arbovirus transmission. This suggests that the genome composition of arbo flaviviruses is crucial to maintain the balance between high-level replication in the vertebrate host and persistent replication in the mosquito vector.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/acvgEhXaVv8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Persisters represent a small subpopulation of non- or slow-growing bacterial cells that are tolerant to killing by antibiotics. Despite their prominent role in the recalcitrance of chronic infections to antibiotic therapy, the mechanism of their formation has remained elusive. We show that sorted cells of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; with low levels of energy-generating enzymes are better able to survive antibiotic killing. Using microfluidics time-lapse microscopy and a fluorescent reporter for in vivo ATP measurements, we find that a subpopulation of cells with a low level of ATP survives killing by ampicillin. We propose that these low ATP cells are formed stochastically as a result of fluctuations in the abundance of energy-generating components. These findings point to a general “low energy” mechanism of persister formation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/wLiBOMyGtAE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Reverse ecology is the inference of ecological information from patterns of genomic variation. One rich, heretofore underutilized, source of ecologically relevant genomic information is codon optimality or adaptation. Bias toward codons that match the tRNA pool is robustly associated with high gene expression in diverse organisms, suggesting that codon optimization could be used in a reverse ecology framework to identify highly expressed, ecologically relevant genes. To test this hypothesis, we examined the relationship between optimal codon usage in the classic galactose metabolism (&lt;i&gt;GAL&lt;/i&gt;) pathway and known ecological niches for 329 species of budding yeasts, a diverse subphylum of fungi. We find that optimal codon usage in the &lt;i&gt;GAL&lt;/i&gt; pathway is positively correlated with quantitative growth on galactose, suggesting that &lt;i&gt;GAL&lt;/i&gt; codon optimization reflects increased capacity to grow on galactose. Optimal codon usage in the &lt;i&gt;GAL&lt;/i&gt; pathway is also positively correlated with human-associated ecological niches in yeasts of the CUG-Ser1 clade and with dairy-associated ecological niches in the family Saccharomycetaceae. For example, optimal codon usage of &lt;i&gt;GAL&lt;/i&gt; genes is greater than 85% of all genes in the genome of the major human pathogen &lt;i&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt; (CUG-Ser1 clade) and greater than 75% of genes in the genome of the dairy yeast &lt;i&gt;Kluyveromyces lactis&lt;/i&gt; (family Saccharomycetaceae). We further find a correlation between optimization in the &lt;i&gt;GAL&lt;/i&gt;actose pathway genes and several genes associated with nutrient sensing and metabolism. This work suggests that codon optimization harbors information about the metabolic ecology of microbial eukaryotes. This information may be particularly useful for studying fungal dark matter—species that have yet to be cultured in the lab or have only been identified by genomic material.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/yGiZ_5eCky0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: The methodological quality of 176,620 randomized controlled trials published between 1966 and 2018 reveals a positive trend but also an urgent need for improvement</title>

Many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are biased and difficult to reproduce due to methodological flaws and poor reporting. There is increasing attention for responsible research practices and implementation of reporting guidelines, but whether these efforts have improved the methodological quality of RCTs (e.g., lower risk of bias) is unknown. We, therefore, mapped risk-of-bias trends over time in RCT publications in relation to journal and author characteristics. Meta-information of 176,620 RCTs published between 1966 and 2018 was extracted. The risk-of-bias probability (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of patients/personnel, and blinding of outcome assessment) was assessed using a risk-of-bias machine learning tool. This tool was simultaneously validated using 63,327 human risk-of-bias assessments obtained from 17,394 RCTs evaluated in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR). Moreover, RCT registration and CONSORT Statement reporting were assessed using automated searches. Publication characteristics included the number of authors, journal impact factor (JIF), and medical discipline. The annual number of published RCTs substantially increased over 4 decades, accompanied by increases in authors (5.2 to 7.8) and institutions (2.9 to 4.8). The risk of bias remained present in most RCTs but decreased over time for allocation concealment (63% to 51%), random sequence generation (57% to 36%), and blinding of outcome assessment (58% to 52%). Trial registration (37% to 47%) and the use of the CONSORT Statement (1% to 20%) also rapidly increased. In journals with a higher impact factor (&amp;gt;10), the risk of bias was consistently lower with higher levels of RCT registration and the use of the CONSORT Statement. Automated risk-of-bias predictions had accuracies above 70% for allocation concealment (70.7%), random sequence generation (72.1%), and blinding of patients/personnel (79.8%), but not for blinding of outcome assessment (62.7%). In conclusion, the likelihood of bias in RCTs has generally decreased over the last decades. This optimistic trend may be driven by increased knowledge augmented by mandatory trial registration and more stringent reporting guidelines and journal requirements. Nevertheless, relatively high probabilities of bias remain, particularly in journals with lower impact factors. This emphasizes that further improvement of RCT registration, conduct, and reporting is still urgently needed.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/KTBxyMjg_Vs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Delineating human cardiac pathologies and their basic molecular mechanisms relies on research conducted in model organisms. Yet translating findings from preclinical models to humans present a significant challenge, in part due to differences in cardiac protein expression between humans and model organisms. Proteins immediately determine cellular function, yet their large-scale investigation in hearts has lagged behind those of genes and transcripts. Here, we set out to bridge this knowledge gap: By analyzing protein profiles in humans and commonly used model organisms across cardiac chambers, we determine their commonalities and regional differences. We analyzed cardiac tissue from each chamber of human, pig, horse, rat, mouse, and zebrafish in biological replicates. Using mass spectrometry–based proteomics workflows, we measured and evaluated the abundance of approximately 7,000 proteins in each species. The resulting knowledgebase of cardiac protein signatures is accessible through an online database: atlas.cardiacproteomics.com. Our combined analysis allows for quantitative evaluation of protein abundances across cardiac chambers, as well as comparisons of cardiac protein profiles across model organisms. Up to a quarter of proteins with differential abundances between atria and ventricles showed opposite chamber-specific enrichment between species; these included numerous proteins implicated in cardiac disease. The generated proteomics resource facilitates translational prospects of cardiac studies from model organisms to humans by comparisons of disease-linked protein networks across species.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/4yRRIsy7RPQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: As above, so below: Whole transcriptome profiling demonstrates strong molecular similarities between avian dorsal and ventral pallial subdivisions</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25159?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Jarvis et al. and Chen et al. (2013) used the expression profiles of 50 genes to develop the continuum hypothesis of avian brain organization. It states that the subdivisions of the dorsal pallium develop continuously with those of the ventral pallium, resulting in a “partial mirror image” organization around the vestigial ventricle divide. However, these claims were challenged due to the small number of genes profiled. The present study uses RNA sequencing to profile the whole transcriptome (~20,000 genes) of the principal subdivisions of the avian telencephalon and confirms the remarkable molecularly similarities between the dorsal and ventral pallium. We recommend adopting a hierarchal nomenclature to reflect these robust molecular similarities.






Abstract
Over the last two decades, beginning with the Avian Brain Nomenclature Forum in 2000, major revisions have been made to our understanding of the organization and nomenclature of the avian brain. However, there are still unresolved questions on avian pallial organization, particularly whether the cells above the vestigial ventricle represent distinct populations to those below it or similar populations. To test these two hypotheses, we profiled the transcriptomes of the major avian pallial subdivisions dorsal and ventral to the vestigial ventricle boundary using RNA sequencing and a new zebra finch genome assembly containing about 22,000 annotated, complete genes. We found that the transcriptomes of neural populations above and below the ventricle were remarkably similar. Each subdivision in dorsal pallium (Wulst) had a corresponding molecular counterpart in the ventral pallium (DVR). In turn, each corresponding subdivision exhibited shared gene co‐expression modules that contained gene sets enriched in functional specializations, such as anatomical structure development, synaptic transmission, signaling, and neurogenesis. These findings are more in line with the continuum hypothesis of avian brain subdivision organization above and below the vestigial ventricle space, with the pallium as a whole consisting of four major cell populations (intercalated pallium, mesopallium, hyper‐nidopallium, and arcopallium) instead of seven (hyperpallium apicale, interstitial hyperpallium apicale, intercalated hyperpallium, hyperpallium densocellare, mesopallium, nidopallium, and arcopallium). We suggest adopting a more streamlined hierarchical naming system that reflects the robust similarities in gene expression, neural connectivity motifs, and function. These findings have important implications for our understanding of overall vertebrate brain evolution.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We estimate that 208,000 deep brain stimulation (DBS) devices have been implanted to address neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders worldwide. DBS Think Tank presenters pooled data and determined that DBS expanded in its scope and has been applied to multiple brain disorders in an effort to modulate neural circuitry. The DBS Think Tank was founded in 2012 providing a space where clinicians, engineers, researchers from industry and academia discuss current and emerging DBS technologies and logistical and ethical issues facing the field. The emphasis is on cutting edge research and collaboration aimed to advance the DBS field. The Eighth Annual DBS Think Tank was held virtually on September 1 and 2, 2020 (Zoom Video Communications) due to restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The meeting focused on advances in: (1) optogenetics as a tool for comprehending neurobiology of diseases and on optogenetically-inspired DBS, (2) cutting edge of emerging DBS technologies, (3) ethical issues affecting DBS research and access to care, (4) neuromodulatory approaches for depression, (5) advancing novel hardware, software and imaging methodologies, (6) use of neurophysiological signals in adaptive neurostimulation, and (7) use of more advanced technologies to improve DBS clinical outcomes. There were 178 attendees who participated in a DBS Think Tank survey, which revealed the expansion of DBS into several indications such as obesity, post-traumatic stress disorder, addiction and Alzheimer’s disease. This proceedings summarizes the advances discussed at the Eighth Annual DBS Think Tank.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: A comparative analysis of cone photoreceptor morphology in bowhead and beluga whales</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25101?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
The cetacean visual system is a product of selection pressures favoring underwater vision, yet relatively little is known about it across taxa. Previous studies report several mutations in the opsin genetic sequence in cetaceans, suggesting the evolutionary complete or partial loss of retinal cone photoreceptor function in mysticete and odontocete lineages, respectively. Despite this, limited anatomical evidence suggests cone structures are partially maintained but with absent outer and inner segments in the bowhead retina. The functional consequence and anatomical distributions associated with these unique cone morphologies remain unclear. The current study further investigates the morphology and distribution of cone photoreceptors in the bowhead whale and beluga retina and evaluates the potential functional capacity of these cells' alternative to photoreception. Refined histological and advanced microscopic techniques revealed two additional cone morphologies in the bowhead and beluga retina that have not been previously described. Two proteins involved in magnetosensation were present in these cone structures suggesting the possibility for an alternative functional role in responding to changes in geomagnetic fields. These findings highlight a revised understanding of the unique evolution of cone and gross retinal anatomy in cetaceans, and provide prefatory evidence of potential functional reassignment of these cells.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Defining vitamin D receptor expression in the brain using a novel VDRCre mouse</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25100?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>We generated a novel vitamin D receptor (VDR) VDRCre knockin mouse for the interrogation of VDR anatomy in the brain. In this article, we demonstrate through immunohistochemistry that VDRCre‐driven reporter expression colocalizes with VDR mRNA throughout the brain. Additionally, we demonstrate that tdTomato (+) neurons respond rapidly to vitamin D, which does not occur in tdTomato (−) neurons.







Abstract
Vitamin D action has been linked to several diseases regulated by the brain including obesity, diabetes, autism, and Parkinson's. However, the location of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in the brain is not clear due to conflicting reports. We found that two antibodies previously published as specific in peripheral tissues are not specific in the brain. We thus created a new knockin mouse with cre recombinase expression under the control of the endogenous VDR promoter (VDRCre). We demonstrated that the cre activity in the VDRCre mouse brain (as reported by a cre‐dependent tdTomato expression) is highly overlapping with endogenous VDR mRNAs. These VDR‐expressing cells were enriched in multiple brain regions including the cortex, amygdala, caudate putamen, and hypothalamus among others. In the hypothalamus, VDR partially colocalized with vasopressin, oxytocin, estrogen receptor‐α, and β‐endorphin to various degrees. We further functionally validated our model by demonstrating that the endogenous VDR agonist 1,25‐dihydroxyvitamin D activated all tested tdTomato+ neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamus but had no effect on neurons without tdTomato fluorescence. Thus, we have generated a new mouse tool that allows us to visualize VDR‐expressing cells and to characterize their functions.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25099?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Histological methods were used to localize a neuropeptide related to gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone in the central nervous system and periphery of Biomphalaria glabrata, an intermediate host for intestinal schistosomiasis.







Abstract
Freshwater snails of the genus Biomphalaria serve as obligatory hosts for the digenetic trematode Schistosoma mansoni, the causative agent for the most widespread form of intestinal schistosomiasis. Within Biomphalaria, S. mansoni larvae multiply and transform into the cercariae form that can infect humans. Trematode development and proliferation is thought to be facilitated by modifications of host behavior and physiological processes, including a reduction of reproduction known as “parasitic castration.” As neuropeptides participate in the control of reproduction across phylogeny, a neural transcriptomics approach was undertaken to identify peptides that could regulate Biomphalaria reproductive physiology. The present study identified a transcript in Biomphalaria alexandrina that encodes a peptide belonging to the gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) superfamily. The precursor and the predicted mature peptide, pQIHFTPDWGNN‐NH2 (designated Biom‐GnRH), share features with peptides identified in other molluscan species, including panpulmonates, opisthobranchs, and cephalopods. An antibody generated against Biom‐GnRH labeled neurons in the cerebral, pedal, and visceral ganglia of Biomphalaria glabrata. GnRH‐like immunoreactive fiber systems projected to all central ganglia. In the periphery, immunoreactive material was detected in the ovotestis, oviduct, albumen gland, and nidamental gland. As these structures serve crucial roles in the production, transport, nourishment, and encapsulation of eggs, disruption of the GnRH system of Biomphalaria could contribute to reduced reproductive activity in infected snails.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Acute Δ9‐tetrahydrocannabinol prompts rapid changes in cannabinoid CB1 receptor immunolabeling and subcellular structure in CA1 hippocampus of young adult male mice</title>

	<content:encoded>Acute exposure to Δ‐9‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) significantly decreases cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor density at inhibitory terminals and mitochondria. Besides, dendrites are significantly larger, have more spines and contain more mitochondria. CB1 receptors (arrows), inhibitory terminals (ter, red shading), mitochondria (m, purple shading), dendrites (blue shading), dendritic spines (sp, blue shading). Scale bars = 500 nm.







Abstract
The use and abuse of cannabis can be associated with significant pathophysiology, however, it remains unclear whether (1) acute administration of Δ‐9‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) during early adulthood alters the cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor localization and expression in cells of the brain, and (2) THC produces structural brain changes. Here we use electron microscopy and a highly sensitive pre‐embedding immunogold method to examine CB1 receptors in the hippocampus cornu ammonis subfield 1 (CA1) 30 min after male mice were exposed to a single THC injection (5 mg/kg). The findings show that acute exposure to THC can significantly decrease the percentage of CB1 receptor immunopositive terminals making symmetric synapses, mitochondria, and astrocytes. The percentage of CB1 receptor‐labeled terminals forming asymmetric synapses was unaffected. Lastly, CB1 receptor expression was significantly lower at terminals of symmetric and asymmetric synapses as well as in mitochondria. Structurally, CA1 dendrites were significantly larger, and contained more spines and mitochondria following acute THC administration. The area of the dendritic spines, synaptic terminals, mitochondria, and astrocytes decreased significantly following acute THC exposure. Altogether, these results indicate that even a single THC exposure can have a significant impact on CB1 receptor expression, and can alter CA1 ultrastructure, within 30 min of drug exposure. These changes may contribute to the behavioral alterations experienced by young individuals shortly after cannabis intoxication.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Neuroplasticity in N‐methyl‐d‐aspartic acid receptor signaling in subregions of the rat rostral ventrolateral medulla following sedentary versus physically active conditions</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25094?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>The mechanisms by which the brain undergoes neuroplasticity during sedentary versus active conditions are important in understanding how a sedentary lifestyle has become the leading cause of death due to modifiable risk factors. Neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) regulate ongoing sympathetic vasoconstriction and cardiac function under normal conditions, and their activity appears heightened in models of cardiovascular disease associated with sympathetic overactivity. The current study provides evidence of activity‐related neuroplasticity in the RVLM via increased glutamate levels and increased expression of N‐methyl‐d‐aspartic acid receptors in the RVLM of sedentary compared to active rats. These mechanisms produce a complex framework by which RVLM neurons increase their influence on sympathoexcitation in sedentary compared to physically active conditions.







Abstract
The rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) is a brain region involved in normal regulation of the cardiovascular system and heightened sympathoexcitatory states of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Among major risk factors for CVD, sedentary lifestyles contribute to higher mortality than other modifiable risk factors. Previous studies suggest excessive glutamatergic excitation of presympathetic neurons in the RVLM occurs in sedentary animals. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine neuroplasticity in the glutamatergic system in the RVLM of sedentary and physically active rats. We hypothesized that relative to active rats, sedentary rats would exhibit higher expression of glutamate N‐methyl‐d‐aspartic acid receptor subunits (GluN), phosphoGluN1, and the excitatory scaffold protein postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95), while achieving higher glutamate levels. Male Sprague–Dawley rats (4 weeks old) were divided into sedentary and active (running wheel) conditions for 10–12 weeks. We used retrograde tracing/triple‐labeling techniques, western blotting, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We report in sedentary versus physically active rats: 1) fewer bulbospinal non‐C1 neurons positive for GluN1, 2) significantly higher expression of GluN1 and GluN2B but lower levels of phosphoGluN1 (pSer896) and PSD95, and 3) higher levels of glutamate in the RVLM. Higher GluN expression is consistent with enhanced sympathoexcitation in sedentary animals; however, a more complex neuroplasticity occurs within subregions of the ventrolateral medulla. Our results in rodents may also indicate that alterations in glutamatergic excitation of the RVLM contribute to the increased incidence of CVD in humans who lead sedentary lifestyles. Thus, there is a strong need to further pursue mechanisms of inactivity‐related neuroplasticity in the RVLM.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Light and electron microscopic studies reveal that gonadal steroids may directly and indirectly influence PVN neurons via nuclear (a) and extranuclear (b) gonadal hormone receptors in a sex‐specific manner. AR, androgen receptor; ER, estrogen receptor; GPER, G‐protein–coupled estrogen receptor.







Abstract
Within the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), estrogen receptor (ER) β and other gonadal hormone receptors play a role in central cardiovascular processes. However, the influence of sex and age on the cellular and subcellular relationships of ERβ with ERα, G‐protein ER (GPER1), as well as progestin and androgen receptors (PR and AR) in the PVN is uncertain. In young (2‐ to 3‐month‐old) females and males, ERβ‐enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) containing neurons were approximately four times greater than ERα‐labeled and PR‐labeled nuclei in the PVN. In subdivisions of the PVN, young females, compared to males, had: (1) more ERβ‐EGFP neurons in neuroendocrine rostral regions; (2) fewer ERα‐labeled nuclei in neuroendocrine and autonomic projecting medial subregions; and (3) more ERα‐labeled nuclei in an autonomic projecting caudal region. In contrast, young males, compared to females, had approximately 20 times more AR‐labeled nuclei, which often colocalized with ERβ‐EGFP in neuroendocrine (approximately 70%) and autonomic (approximately 50%) projecting subregions. Ultrastructurally, in soma and dendrites, PVN ERβ‐EGFP colocalized primarily with extranuclear AR (approximately 85% soma) and GPER1 (approximately 70% soma). Aged (12‐ to 24‐month‐old) males had more ERβ‐EGFP neurons in a rostral neuroendocrine subregion compared to aged females and females with accelerated ovarian failure (AOF) and in a caudal autonomic subregion compared to post‐AOF females. Late‐aged (18‐ to 24‐month‐old) females compared to early‐aged (12‐ to 14‐month‐old) females and AOF females had fewer AR‐labeled nuclei in neuroendrocrine and autonomic projecting subregions. These findings indicate that gonadal steroids may directly and indirectly influence PVN neurons via nuclear and extranuclear gonadal hormone receptors in a sex‐specific manner.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Visual opsin expression and morphological characterization of retinal photoreceptors in the pouched lamprey (Geotria australis, Gray)</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25092?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>A multidisciplinary approach was applied to assign the expression of different visual opsin classes to specific photoreceptor subtypes in Geotria australis. Five discrete photoreceptor subtypes were identified in the retina, each containing one of five classes of visual opsin. This suggests that G. australis has the potential for complex color vision.







Abstract
Lampreys are extant members of the agnathan (jawless) vertebrates that diverged ~500 million years ago, during a critical stage of vertebrate evolution when image‐forming eyes first emerged. Among lamprey species assessed thus far, the retina of the southern hemisphere pouched lamprey, Geotria australis, is unique, in that it possesses morphologically distinct photoreceptors and expresses five visual photopigments. This study focused on determining the number of different photoreceptors present in the retina of G. australis and whether each cell type expresses a single opsin class. Five photoreceptor subtypes were identified based on ultrastructure and differential expression of one of each of the five different visual opsin classes (lws, sws1, sws2, rh1, and rh2) known to be expressed in the retina. This suggests, therefore, that the retina of G. australis possesses five spectrally and morphologically distinct photoreceptors, with the potential for complex color vision. Each photoreceptor subtype was shown to have a specific spatial distribution in the retina, which is potentially associated with changes in spectral radiance across different lines of sight. These results suggest that there have been strong selection pressures for G. australis to maintain broad spectral sensitivity for the brightly lit surface waters that this species inhabits during its marine phase. These findings provide important insights into the functional anatomy of the early vertebrate retina and the selection pressures that may have led to the evolution of complex color vision.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25091?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Respiratory motor activity can be modulated by higher brain inputs. We hypothesized that forebrain regions send descending inputs to the respiratory control areas in the midbrain, pons, and medulla. Our data imply that (a) volitional motor commands for vocalization are specifically relayed via the midbrain periaqueductal gray; (b) commands to coordinate breathing with other orofacial behaviors (e.g., sniffing, whisking, swallowing) target the pontine Kölliker‐Fuse nucleus, predominantly; and (c) limbic or autonomic (interoceptive) systems are connected to broadly distributed downstream brainstem respiratory networks, including the medullary Bötzinger complex (BötC), pre‐BötC, and caudal raphé nuclei. We provide a neural substrate to explain how volitional, state‐dependent, and emotional modulation of breathing is regulated by the forebrain.







Abstract
Eupnea is generated by neural circuits located in the ponto‐medullary brainstem, but can be modulated by higher brain inputs which contribute to volitional control of breathing and the expression of orofacial behaviors, such as vocalization, sniffing, coughing, and swallowing. Surprisingly, the anatomical organization of descending inputs that connect the forebrain with the brainstem respiratory network remains poorly defined. We hypothesized that descending forebrain projections target multiple distributed respiratory control nuclei across the neuroaxis. To test our hypothesis, we made discrete unilateral microinjections of the retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B in the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG), the pontine Kölliker‐Fuse nucleus (KFn), the medullary Bötzinger complex (BötC), pre‐BötC, or caudal midline raphé nuclei. We quantified the regional distribution of retrogradely labeled neurons in the forebrain 12–14 days postinjection. Overall, our data reveal that descending inputs from cortical areas predominantly target the PAG and KFn. Differential forebrain regions innervating the PAG (prefrontal, cingulate cortices, and lateral septum) and KFn (rhinal, piriform, and somatosensory cortices) imply that volitional motor commands for vocalization are specifically relayed via the PAG, while the KFn may receive commands to coordinate breathing with other orofacial behaviors (e.g., sniffing, swallowing). Additionally, we observed that the limbic or autonomic (interoceptive) systems are connected to broadly distributed downstream bulbar respiratory networks. Collectively, these data provide a neural substrate to explain how volitional, state‐dependent, and emotional modulation of breathing is regulated by the forebrain.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>N‐cadherin is involved in the formation and maintenance of synapses. It was mainly detected in type II cells and nerve fibers in taste buds. Immunoelectron microscopy detected N‐cadherin symmetrically in the membranes of contact sites between afferent fibers (N) and type II cells (II), including synapses. Arrowheads: atypical mitochondria.







Abstract
Taste buds, the receptor organs for taste, contain 50–100 taste bud cells. Although these cells undergo continuous turnover, the structural and functional integrity of taste buds is maintained. The molecular mechanisms by which synaptic connectivity between taste buds and afferent fibers is formed and maintained remain ambiguous. In the present study, we examined the localization of N‐cadherin in the taste buds of the mouse circumvallate papillae because N‐cadherin, one of the classical cadherins, is important for the formation and maintenance of synapses. At the light microscopic level, N‐cadherin was predominantly detected in type II cells and nerve fibers in the connective tissues in and around the vallate papillae. At the ultrastructural level, N‐cadherin immunoreactivity appears along the cell membrane and in the intracellular vesicles of type II cells. N‐cadherin immunoreactivity also is evident in the membranes of afferent terminals at the contact sites to N‐cadherin‐positive type II cells. At channel type synapses between type II cells and nerve fibers, N‐cadherin is present surrounding, but not within, the presumed neurotransmitter release zone, identified by large mitochondria apposed to the taste cells. The present results suggest that N‐cadherin is important for the formation or maintenance of type II cell afferent synapses in taste buds.</content:encoded>

Abstract
Scavenger receptor CD36 contributes significantly to lipid homeostasis, inflammation, and amyloid deposition, while CD36 deficiency is associated with restored cerebrovascular function in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model. Yet the distribution of CD36 has not been examined in the brain. Here, we characterized CD36 gene and protein expression in the brains of young, middle aged, aged, and elderly male and female C57BL/6J mice. Age‐related increases in CD36 mRNA expression were observed in the male hippocampus and female midbrain. Additionally, male mice had greater CD36 mRNA expression than females in the striatum, hippocampus, and midbrain. CD36 protein was primarily expressed intravascularly, and this expression differed by region, age, and sex in the mouse brain. Although male mice brains demonstrated an increase in CD36 protein with age in several cortices, basal ganglia, hippocampus, and midbrain, a decrease with age was observed in female mice in the same regions. These data suggest that distinctive age, region, and sex expression of CD36 in the brain may contribute to Aβ deposition and neuroinflammation in AD.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
The chemical synapse is the principal form of contact between neurons of the central nervous system. These synapses are typically configured as presynaptic axon terminations onto postsynaptic dendrites or somata, giving rise to axo‐dendritic and axo‐somatic synapses, respectively. Beyond these common synapse configurations are less‐studied, non‐canonical synapse types that are prevalent throughout the brain and significantly contribute to neural circuit function. Among these are the axo‐axonic synapses, which consist of an axon terminating on another axon or axon terminal. Here, we review evidence for axo‐axonic synapse contributions to neural signaling in the mammalian nervous system and survey functional neural circuit motifs enabled by these synapses. We also detail how recent advances in microscopy, transgenics, and biological sensors may be used to identify and functionally assay axo‐axonic synapses.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>We accomplished visualization and reconstruction of noradrenergic neurons projecting to the olfactory bulb (OB) by infection of adeno‐associated viruses into the locus coeruleus of dopamine beta hydroxylase‐Cre mice. An individual noradrenergic axon traveled while forming several branches and was distributed in multiple glomeruli that were located in different areas of the glomerular layer in the OB.







Abstract
Olfactory input is processed in the glomerulus of the main olfactory bulb (OB) and relayed to higher centers in the brain by projection neurons. Conversely, centrifugal inputs from other brain regions project to the OB. We have previously analyzed centrifugal inputs into the OB from several brain regions using single‐neuron labeling. In this study, we analyzed the centrifugal noradrenergic (NA) fibers derived from the locus coeruleus (LC), because their projection pathways and synaptic connections in the OB have not been clarified in detail. We analyzed the NA centrifugal projections by single‐neuron labeling and immunoelectron microscopy. Individual NA neurons labeled by viral infection were three‐dimensionally traced using Neurolucida software to visualize the projection pathway from the LC to the OB. Also, centrifugal NA fibers were visualized using an antibody for noradrenaline transporter (NET). NET immunoreactive (‐ir) fibers contained many varicosities and synaptic vesicles. Furthermore, electron tomography demonstrated that NET‐ir fibers formed asymmetrical synapses of varied morphology. Although these synapses were present at varicosities, the density of synapses was relatively low throughout the OB. The maximal density of synapses was found in the external plexiform layer; about 17% of all observed varicosities contained synapses. These results strongly suggest that NA‐containing fibers in the OB release NA from both varicosities and synapses to influence the activities of OB neurons. The present study provides a morphological basis for olfactory modulation by centrifugal NA fibers derived from the LC.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>During brain development, synapses form and are refined through the accumulation of different proteins. Here we examined the dynamic distribution of Synaptotagmin 2a (Syt2a) in the developing forebrain of zebrafish larvae with a focus on regions associated with social behavior. We show that Syt2a colocalized with tyrosine hydroxylase, a protein important for behavior. Further, we found that Syt2a localizes to synapses onto neurons implicated in social behavior, with an increase of Syt2a expression coinciding with the emergence of social behavior.







Abstract
As they form, synapses go through various stages of maturation and refinement. These steps are linked to significant changes in synaptic function, potentially resulting in emergence and maturation of behavioral outputs. Synaptotagmins are calcium‐sensing proteins of the synaptic vesicle exocytosis machinery, and changes in Synaptotagmin proteins at synapses have significant effects on vesicle release and synaptic function. Here, we examined the distribution of the synaptic vesicle protein Synaptotagmin 2a (Syt2a) during development of the zebrafish nervous system. Syt2a is widely distributed throughout the midbrain and hindbrain early during larval development but very weakly expressed in the forebrain. Later in development, Syt2a expression levels in the forebrain increase, particularly in regions associated with social behavior, and most intriguingly, around the time social behavior becomes apparent. We provide evidence that Syt2a localizes to synapses onto neurons implicated in social behavior in the ventral forebrain and show that Syt2a is colocalized with tyrosine hydroxylase, a biosynthetic enzyme in the dopamine pathway. Our results suggest a developmentally important role for Syt2a in maturing synapses in the forebrain, coinciding with the emergence of social behavior.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The Superficial Interneurons (SINs) of the zebrafish tectum comprise a diverse population. Here we demonstrate that despite their wide range of reported tuning properties and morphology, most SINs respond to light offset and possess large receptive fields. SINs were previously thought to be solely inhibitory, yet we report that a subset express glutamatergic markers. Finally, these cells are unlikely to be intrinsically photosensitive as removal of retinal input, eliminated nearly all light on and off responses in SINs.  (Image: Eva Laurell)







Abstract
The superficial interneurons, SINs, of the zebrafish tectum, have been implicated in a range of visual functions, including size discrimination, directional selectivity, and looming‐evoked escape. This raises the question if SIN subpopulations, despite their morphological similarities and shared anatomical position in the retinotectal processing stream, carry out diverse, task‐specific functions in visual processing, or if they have simple tuning properties in common. Here we have further characterized the SINs through functional imaging, electrophysiological recordings, and neurotransmitter typing in two transgenic lines, the widely used Gal4s1156t and the recently reported LCRRH2‐RH2‐2:GFP. We found that about a third of the SINs strongly responded to changes in whole‐field light levels, with a strong preference for OFF over ON stimuli. Interestingly, individual SINs were selectively tuned to a diverse range of narrow luminance decrements. Overall responses to whole‐field luminance steps did not vary with the position of the SIN cell body along the depth of the tectal neuropil or with the orientation of its neurites. We ruled out the possibility that intrinsic photosensitivity of Gal4s1156t+ SINs contribute to the measured visual responses. We found that, while most SINs express GABAergic markers, a substantial minority express an excitatory neuronal marker, the vesicular glutamate transporter, expanding the possible roles of SIN function in the tectal circuitry. In conclusion, SINs represent a molecularly, morphologically, and functionally heterogeneous class of interneurons, with subpopulations that detect a range of specific visual features, to which we have now added narrow luminance decrements.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Upregulation of eIF4E, but not other translation initiation factors, in dendritic spines during memory formation</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25158?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Memory formation requires initiation of new protein synthesis as well as protein synthesis in dendrites, but it is unknown whether initiation can happen within dendritic spines. We combined immunolabeling with serial section 3D electron microscopy to examine the distribution of three initiation factors, eIF4E, eIF4G1, and eIF2α in dendritic spines of the lateral amygdala during formation of a Pavlovian conditioning memory. Top row: Electron micrographs showing labeled spines (arrows) with synapses (arrowheads). Bottom left: Segment of dendrite reconstructed from serial sections with synapses shown in red. Bottom right: The percentage of spines containing labeling for eIF4E was higher after training, but there were no differences for eIF4G1 or eIF2α labeling.







Abstract
Local translation can provide a rapid, spatially targeted supply of new proteins in distal dendrites to support synaptic changes that underlie learning. Learning and memory are especially sensitive to manipulations of translational control mechanisms, particularly those that target the initiation step, and translation initiation at synapses could be a means of maintaining synapse specificity during plasticity. Initiation predominantly occurs via recruitment of ribosomes to the 5’ mRNA cap by complexes of eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs), and the interaction between eIF4E and eIF4G1 is a particularly important target of translational control pathways. Pharmacological inhibition of eIF4E‐eIF4G1 binding impairs formation of memory for aversive Pavlovian conditioning as well as the accompanying increase in polyribosomes in the heads of dendritic spines in the lateral amygdala (LA). This is consistent with a role for initiation at synapses in memory formation, but whether eIFs are even present near synapses is unknown. To determine whether dendritic spines contain eIFs and whether eIF distribution is affected by learning, we combined immunolabeling with serial section transmission electron microscopy (ssTEM) volume reconstructions of LA dendrites after Pavlovian conditioning. Labeling for eIF4E, eIF4G1, and eIF2α – another key target of regulation – occurred in roughly half of dendritic spines, but learning effects were only found for eIF4E, which was upregulated in the heads of dendritic spines. Our results support the possibility of regulated translation initiation as a means of synapse‐specific protein targeting during learning and are consistent with the model of eIF4E availability as a central point of control.

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: The metastable brain associated with autistic-like traits of typically developing individuals</title>

Metastability in the brain is thought to be a mechanism involved in dynamic organization of cognitive and behavioral functions across multiple spatiotemporal scales. However, it is not clear how such organization is realized in underlying neural oscillations in a high-dimensional state space. It was shown that macroscopic oscillations often form phase-phase coupling (PPC) and phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) which result in synchronization and amplitude modulation, respectively, even without external stimuli. These oscillations can also make spontaneous transitions across synchronous states at rest. Using resting-state electroencephalographic signals and the autism-spectrum quotient scores acquired from healthy humans, we show experimental evidence that the PAC combined with PPC allows amplitude modulation to be transient, and that the metastable dynamics with this transient modulation is associated with autistic-like traits. In individuals with a longer attention span, such dynamics tended to show fewer transitions between states by forming delta-alpha PAC. We identified these states as two-dimensional metastable states that could share consistent patterns across individuals. Our findings suggest that the human brain dynamically organizes inter-individual differences in a hierarchy of macroscopic oscillations with multiple timescales by utilizing metastability.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/d44_o2307G4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Transcript stability is associated with many biological processes, and the factors affecting mRNA stability have been extensively studied. However, little is known about the features related to human long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) stability. By inhibiting transcription and collecting samples in 10 time points, genome-wide RNA-seq studies was performed in human lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549) and RNA half-life datasets were constructed. The following observations were obtained. First, the half-life distributions of both lncRNAs and messanger RNAs (mRNAs) with one exon (lnc-human1 and m-human1) were significantly different from those of both lncRNAs and mRNAs with more than one exon (lnc-human2 and m-human2). Furthermore, some factors such as full-length transcript secondary structures played a contrary role in lnc-human1 and m-human2. Second, through the half-life comparisons of nucleus- and cytoplasm-specific and common lncRNAs and mRNAs, lncRNAs (mRNAs) in the nucleus were found to be less stable than those in the cytoplasm, which was derived from transcripts themselves rather than cellular location. Third, kmers-based protein−RNA or RNA−RNA interactions promoted lncRNA stability from lnc-human1 and decreased mRNA stability from m-human2 with high probability. Finally, through applying deep learning−based regression, a non-linear relationship was found to exist between the half-lives of lncRNAs (mRNAs) and related factors. The present study established lncRNA and mRNA half-life regulation networks in the A549 cell line and shed new light on the degradation behaviors of both lncRNAs and mRNAs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_x3OBdaRtTI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Long regulatory elements (LREs), such as CpG islands, polydA:dT tracts or AU-rich elements, are thought to play key roles in gene regulation but, as opposed to conventional binding sites of transcription factors, few methods have been proposed to formally and automatically characterize them. We present here a computational approach named DExTER (Domain Exploration To Explain gene Regulation) dedicated to the identification of candidate LREs (cLREs) and apply it to the analysis of the genomes of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;falciparum&lt;/i&gt; and other eukaryotes. Our analyses show that all tested genomes contain several cLREs that are somewhat conserved along evolution, and that gene expression can be predicted with surprising accuracy on the basis of these long regions only. Regulation by cLREs exhibits very different behaviours depending on species and conditions. In &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;falciparum&lt;/i&gt; and other Apicomplexan organisms as well as in &lt;i&gt;Dictyostelium discoideum&lt;/i&gt;, the process appears highly dynamic, with different cLREs involved at different phases of the life cycle. For multicellular organisms, the same cLREs are involved in all tissues, but a dynamic behavior is observed along embryonic development stages. In &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;falciparum&lt;/i&gt;, whose genome is known to be strongly depleted of transcription factors, cLREs are predictive of expression with an accuracy above 70%, and our analyses show that they are associated with both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation signals. Moreover, we assessed the biological relevance of one LRE discovered by DExTER in &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;falciparum&lt;/i&gt; using an &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; reporter assay.

Advancements in sequencing have led to the proliferation of multi-omic profiles of human cells under different conditions and perturbations. In addition, many databases have amassed information about pathways and gene “signatures”—patterns of gene expression associated with specific cellular and phenotypic contexts. An important current challenge in systems biology is to leverage such knowledge about gene coordination to maximize the predictive power and generalization of models applied to high-throughput datasets. However, few such integrative approaches exist that also provide interpretable results quantifying the importance of individual genes and pathways to model accuracy. We introduce AKLIMATE, a first kernel-based stacked learner that seamlessly incorporates multi-omics feature data with prior information in the form of pathways for either regression or classification tasks. AKLIMATE uses a novel multiple-kernel learning framework where individual kernels capture the prediction propensities recorded in random forests, each built from a specific pathway gene set that integrates all omics data for its member genes. AKLIMATE has comparable or improved performance relative to state-of-the-art methods on diverse phenotype learning tasks, including predicting microsatellite instability in endometrial and colorectal cancer, survival in breast cancer, and cell line response to gene knockdowns. We show how AKLIMATE is able to connect feature data across data platforms through their common pathways to identify examples of several known and novel contributors of cancer and synthetic lethality.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vLL7me8Kt6o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

ParAB&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;, the most widespread bacterial DNA segregation system, is composed of a centromeric sequence, &lt;i&gt;parS&lt;/i&gt;, and two proteins, the ParA ATPase and the ParB DNA binding proteins. Hundreds of ParB proteins assemble dynamically to form nucleoprotein &lt;i&gt;parS&lt;/i&gt;-anchored complexes that serve as substrates for ParA molecules to catalyze positioning and segregation events. The exact nature of this ParB&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; complex has remained elusive, what we address here by revisiting the Stochastic Binding model (SBM) introduced to explain the non-specific binding profile of ParB in the vicinity of &lt;i&gt;parS&lt;/i&gt;. In the SBM, DNA loops stochastically bring loci inside a sharp cluster of ParB. However, previous SBM versions did not include the negative supercoiling of bacterial DNA, leading to use unphysically small DNA persistences to explain the ParB binding profiles. In addition, recent super-resolution microscopy experiments have revealed a ParB cluster that is significantly smaller than previous estimations and suggest that it results from a liquid-liquid like phase separation. Here, by simulating the folding of long (≥ 30 kb) supercoiled DNA molecules calibrated with realistic DNA parameters and by considering different possibilities for the physics of the ParB cluster assembly, we show that the SBM can quantitatively explain the ChIP-seq ParB binding profiles without any fitting parameter, aside from the supercoiling density of DNA, which, remarkably, is in accord with independent measurements. We also predict that ParB assembly results from a non-equilibrium, stationary balance between an influx of produced proteins and an outflux of excess proteins, i.e., ParB clusters behave like liquid-like protein condensates with unconventional “leaky” boundaries.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O6fP88-FrSc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Diego Vidaurre&lt;/p&gt;

An important question in neuroscience is whether or not we can interpret spontaneous variations in the pattern of correlation between brain areas, which we refer to as functional connectivity or FC, as an index of dynamic neuronal communication in fMRI. That is, can we measure time-varying FC reliably? And, if so, can FC reflect information transfer between brain regions at relatively fast-time scales? Answering these questions in practice requires dealing with the statistical challenge of having high-dimensional data and a comparatively lower number of time points or volumes. A common strategy is to use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data, and then apply some model, such as the hidden Markov model (HMM) or a mixture model of Gaussian distributions, to find a set of distinct FC patterns or states. The distinct spatial properties of these FC states together with the time-resolved switching between them offer a flexible description of time-varying FC. In this work, I show that in this context PCA can suffer from systematic biases and loss of sensitivity for the purposes of finding time-varying FC. To get around these issues, I propose a novel variety of the HMM, named HMM-PCA, where the states are themselves PCA decompositions. Since PCA is based on the data covariance, the state-specific PCA decompositions reflect distinct patterns of FC. I show, theoretically and empirically, that fusing dimensionality reduction and time-varying FC estimation in one single step can avoid these problems and outperform alternative approaches, facilitating the quantification of transient communication in the brain.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zRfYbVrBeMo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26067?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Blood tests to monitor disease activity, attack severity, or treatment impact in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) have not been developed. This study investigated the relationship between serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP) concentration and NMOSD activity and assessed the impact of inebilizumab treatment.


Methods
N‐MOmentum was a prospective, multicenter, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, randomized clinical trial in adults with NMOSD. sGFAP levels were measured by single‐molecule arrays (SIMOA) in 1,260 serial and attack‐related samples from 215 N‐MOmentum participants (92% aquaporin 4‐immunoglobulin G‐seropositive) and in control samples (from healthy donors and patients with relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis).


Results
At baseline, 62 participants (29%) exhibited high sGFAP concentrations (≥170 pg/ml; ≥2 standard deviations above healthy donor mean concentration) and were more likely to experience an adjudicated attack than participants with lower baseline concentrations (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval], 3.09 [1.6–6.1], p = 0.001). Median (interquartile range [IQR]) concentrations increased within 1 week of an attack (baseline: 168.4, IQR = 128.9–449.7 pg/ml; attack: 2,160.1, IQR = 302.7–9,455.0 pg/ml, p = 0.0015) and correlated with attack severity (median fold change from baseline [FC], minor attacks: 1.06, IQR = 0.9–7.4; major attacks: 34.32, IQR = 8.7–107.5, p = 0.023). This attack‐related increase in sGFAP occurred primarily in placebo‐treated participants (FC: 20.2, IQR = 4.4–98.3, p = 0.001) and was not observed in inebilizumab‐treated participants (FC: 1.1, IQR = 0.8–24.6, p &amp;gt; 0.05). Five participants (28%) with elevated baseline sGFAP reported neurological symptoms leading to nonadjudicated attack assessments.


Interpretation
Serum GFAP may serve as a biomarker of NMOSD activity, attack risk, and treatment effects. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:895–910</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Noninvasive Mapping of Ripple Onset Predicts Outcome in Epilepsy Surgery</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26066?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Intracranial electroencephalographic (icEEG) studies show that interictal ripples propagate across the brain of children with medically refractory epilepsy (MRE), and the onset of this propagation (ripple onset zone [ROZ]) estimates the epileptogenic zone. It is still unknown whether we can map this propagation noninvasively. The goal of this study is to map ripples (ripple zone [RZ]) and their propagation onset (ROZ) using high‐density EEG (HD‐EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), and to estimate their prognostic value in pediatric epilepsy surgery.


Methods
We retrospectively analyzed simultaneous HD‐EEG and MEG data from 28 children with MRE who underwent icEEG and epilepsy surgery. Using electric and magnetic source imaging, we estimated virtual sensors (VSs) at brain locations that matched the icEEG implantation. We detected ripples on VSs, defined the virtual RZ and virtual ROZ, and estimated their distance from icEEG. We assessed the predictive value of resecting virtual RZ and virtual ROZ for postsurgical outcome. Interictal spike localization on HD‐EEG and MEG was also performed and compared with ripples.


Results
We mapped ripple propagation in all patients with HD‐EEG and in 27 (96%) patients with MEG. The distance from icEEG did not differ between HD‐EEG and MEG when mapping the RZ (26–27mm, p = 0.6) or ROZ (22–24mm, p = 0.4). Resecting the virtual ROZ, but not virtual RZ or the sources of spikes, was associated with good outcome for HD‐EEG (p = 0.016) and MEG (p = 0.047).


Interpretation
HD‐EEG and MEG can map interictal ripples and their propagation onset (virtual ROZ). Noninvasively mapping the ripple onset may augment epilepsy surgery planning and improve surgical outcome of children with MRE. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:911–925</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Genetic Variation in WNT9B Increases Relapse Hazard in Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26061?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Many multiple sclerosis (MS) genetic susceptibility variants have been identified, but understanding disease heterogeneity remains a key challenge. Relapses are a core feature of MS and a common primary outcome of clinical trials, with prevention of relapses benefiting patients immediately and potentially limiting long‐term disability accrual. We aim to identify genetic variation associated with relapse hazard in MS by analyzing the largest study population to date.


Methods
We performed a genomewide association study (GWAS) in a discovery cohort and investigated the genomewide significant variants in a replication cohort. Combining both cohorts, we captured a total of 2,231 relapses occurring before the start of any immunomodulatory treatment in 991 patients. For assessing time to relapse, we applied a survival analysis utilizing Cox proportional hazards models. We also investigated the association between MS genetic risk scores and relapse hazard and performed a gene ontology pathway analysis.


Results
The low‐frequency genetic variant rs11871306 within WNT9B reached genomewide significance in predicting relapse hazard and replicated (meta‐analysis hazard ratio (HR) = 2.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.70–2.78, p = 2.07 × 10−10). A pathway analysis identified an association of the pathway “response to vitamin D” with relapse hazard (p = 4.33 × 10−6). The MS genetic risk scores, however, were not associated with relapse hazard.


Interpretation
Genetic factors underlying disease heterogeneity differ from variants associated with MS susceptibility. Our findings imply that genetic variation within the Wnt signaling and vitamin D pathways contributes to differences in relapse occurrence. The present study highlights these cross‐talking pathways as potential modulators of MS disease activity. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:884–894</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Electroencephalographic Abnormalities are Common in COVID‐19 and are Associated with Outcomes</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26060?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
The aim was to determine the prevalence and risk factors for electrographic seizures and other electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) undergoing clinically indicated continuous electroencephalogram (cEEG) monitoring and to assess whether EEG findings are associated with outcomes.


Methods
We identified 197 patients with COVID‐19 referred for cEEG at 9 participating centers. Medical records and EEG reports were reviewed retrospectively to determine the incidence of and clinical risk factors for seizures and other epileptiform patterns. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis assessed the relationship between EEG patterns and clinical outcomes.


Results
Electrographic seizures were detected in 19 (9.6%) patients, including nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) in 11 (5.6%). Epileptiform abnormalities (either ictal or interictal) were present in 96 (48.7%). Preceding clinical seizures during hospitalization were associated with both electrographic seizures (36.4% in those with vs 8.1% in those without prior clinical seizures, odds ratio [OR] 6.51, p = 0.01) and NCSE (27.3% vs 4.3%, OR 8.34, p = 0.01). A pre‐existing intracranial lesion on neuroimaging was associated with NCSE (14.3% vs 3.7%; OR 4.33, p = 0.02). In multivariate analysis of outcomes, electrographic seizures were an independent predictor of in‐hospital mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 4.07 [1.44–11.51], p &amp;lt; 0.01). In competing risks analysis, hospital length of stay increased in the presence of NCSE (30 day proportion discharged with vs without NCSE: HR 0.21 [0.03–0.33] vs 0.43 [0.36–0.49]).


Interpretation
This multicenter retrospective cohort study demonstrates that seizures and other epileptiform abnormalities are common in patients with COVID‐19 undergoing clinically indicated cEEG and are associated with adverse clinical outcomes. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:872–883</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Selective Endothelial Hyperactivation of Oncogenic KRAS Induces Brain Arteriovenous Malformations in Mice</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26059?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) are a leading cause of hemorrhagic stroke and neurological deficits in children and young adults, however, no pharmacological intervention is available to treat these patients. Although more than 95% of bAVMs are sporadic without family history, the pathogenesis of sporadic bAVMs is largely unknown, which may account for the lack of therapeutic options. KRAS mutations are frequently observed in cancer, and a recent unprecedented finding of these mutations in human sporadic bAVMs offers a new direction in the bAVM research. Using a novel adeno‐associated virus targeting brain endothelium (AAV‐BR1), the current study tested if endothelial KRASG12V mutation induces sporadic bAVMs in mice.


Methods
Five‐week‐old mice were systemically injected with either AAV‐BR1‐GFP or ‐KRASG12V. At 8 weeks after the AAV injection, bAVM formation and characteristics were addressed by histological and molecular analyses. The effect of MEK/ERK inhibition on KRASG12V‐induced bAVMs was determined by treatment of trametinib, a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)‐approved MEK/ERK inhibitor.


Results
The viral‐mediated KRASG12V overexpression induced bAVMs, which were composed of a tangled nidus mirroring the distinctive morphology of human bAVMs. The bAVMs were accompanied by focal angiogenesis, intracerebral hemorrhages, altered vascular constituents, neuroinflammation, and impaired sensory/cognitive/motor functions. Finally, we confirmed that bAVM growth was inhibited by trametinib treatment.


Interpretation
Our innovative approach using AAV‐BR1 confirms that KRAS mutations promote bAVM development via the MEK/ERK pathway, and provides a novel preclinical mouse model of bAVMs which will be useful to develop a therapeutic strategy for patients with bAVM. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:926–941</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Postictal Death Is Associated with Tonic Phase Apnea in a Mouse Model of Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26053?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is an unpredictable and devastating comorbidity of epilepsy that is believed to be due to cardiorespiratory failure immediately after generalized convulsive seizures.


Methods
We performed cardiorespiratory monitoring of seizure‐induced death in mice carrying either a p.Arg1872Trp or p.Asn1768Asp mutation in a single Scn8a allele—mutations identified from patients who died from SUDEP—and of seizure‐induced death in pentylenetetrazole‐treated wild‐type mice.


Results
The primary cause of seizure‐induced death for all mice was apnea, as (1) apnea began during a seizure and continued for tens of minutes until terminal asystole, and (2) death was prevented by mechanical ventilation. Fatal seizures always included a tonic phase that was coincident with apnea. This tonic phase apnea was not sufficient to produce death, as it also occurred during many nonfatal seizures; however, all seizures that were fatal had tonic phase apnea. We also made the novel observation that continuous tonic diaphragm contraction occurred during tonic phase apnea, which likely contributes to apnea by preventing exhalation, and this was only fatal when breathing did not resume after the tonic phase ended. Finally, recorded seizures from a patient with developmental epileptic encephalopathy with a previously undocumented SCN8A likely pathogenic variant (p.Leu257Val) revealed similarities to those of the mice, namely, an extended tonic phase that was accompanied by apnea.


Interpretation
We conclude that apnea coincident with the tonic phase of a seizure, and subsequent failure to resume breathing, are the determining events that cause seizure‐induced death in Scn8a mutant mice. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:1023–1035</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Early Predictors of 9‐Year Disability in Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26052?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
The purpose of this study was to assess early predictors of 9‐year disability in pediatric patients with multiple sclerosis.


Methods
Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessments of 123 pediatric patients with multiple sclerosis were obtained at disease onset and after 1 and 2 years. A 9‐year clinical follow‐up was also performed. Cox proportional hazard and multivariable regression models were used to assess independent predictors of time to first relapse and 9‐year outcomes.


Results
Time to first relapse was predicted by optic nerve lesions (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.10, p = 0.02) and high‐efficacy treatment exposure (HR = 0.31, p = 0.005). Predictors of annualized relapse rate were: at baseline, presence of cerebellar (β = −0.15, p &amp;lt; 0.001), cervical cord lesions (β = 0.16, p = 0.003), and high‐efficacy treatment exposure (β = −0.14, p = 0.01); considering also 1‐year variables, number of relapses (β = 0.14, p = 0.002), and the previous baseline predictors; considering 2‐year variables, time to first relapse (2‐year: β = −0.12, p = 0.01) entered, whereas high‐efficacy treatment exposure exited the model. Predictors of 9‐year disability worsening were: at baseline, presence of optic nerve lesions (odds ratio [OR] = 6.45, p = 0.01); considering 1‐year and 2‐year variables, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) changes (1‐year: OR = 26.05, p &amp;lt; 0.001; 2‐year: OR = 16.38, p = 0.02), and ≥ 2 new T2‐lesions in 2 years (2‐year: OR = 4.91, p = 0.02). Predictors of higher 9‐year EDSS score were: at baseline, EDSS score (β = 0.58, p &amp;lt; 0.001), presence of brainstem lesions (β = 0.31, p = 0.04), and number of cervical cord lesions (β = 0.22, p = 0.05); considering 1‐year and 2‐year variables, EDSS changes (1‐year: β = 0.79, p &amp;lt; 0.001; 2‐year: β = 0.55, p &amp;lt; 0.001), and ≥ 2 new T2‐lesions (1‐year: β = 0.28, p = 0.03; 2‐year: β = 0.35, p = 0.01).

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Leucine Zipper 4 Autoantibody: A Novel Germ Cell Tumor and Paraneoplastic Biomarker</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26050?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
This study was undertaken to describe a novel biomarker of germ cell tumor and associated paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS).


Methods
Archival sera from patients with germ cell tumor–associated PNS were evaluated. We identified a common autoantigen in a human testicular cancer cell line (TCam‐2) by Western blot and mass spectrometry. Its identity was confirmed by recombinant‐protein Western blot, enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and cell‐based assay. Autoantibody specificity was confirmed by analyzing assorted control sera/cerebrospinal fluid.


Results
Leucine zipper 4 (LUZP4)–immunoglobulin G (IgG) was detected in 28 patients' sera, 26 of whom (93%) were men. The median age at neurological symptom onset was 45 years (range = 28–84). Median titer (ELISA) was 1:300 (1:50 to &amp;gt;1:6,400, normal value &amp;lt; 1:50). Coexistent kelchlike protein 11–IgG was identified in 18 cases (64%). The most common presenting phenotype was rhombencephalitis (17/28, 61%). Other presentations included limbic encephalitis (n = 5, 18%), seizures and/or encephalitis (n = 2, 7%), and motor neuronopathy/polyradiculopathy (n = 4, 14%). The most common malignancy among cancer‐evaluated PNS patients was seminoma (21/27, 78%). Nine of the 21 seminomas detected by whole‐body fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan (43%) were extratesticular. Both female patients had ovarian teratoma. Regressed testicular germ cell tumors were found in 4 patients. Exposure of T‐cell–dendritic‐cell cocultures from chronic immunosuppression‐naïve LUZP4‐IgG–seropositive patients to recombinant LUZP4 protein evoked a marked increase in CD69 expression on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells when compared to vehicle‐exposed and healthy control cultures.


Interpretation
LUZP4‐IgG represents a novel serological biomarker of PNS and has high predictive value for germ cell tumors. The demonstrated antigen‐specific T‐cell responses support a CD8+ T‐cell–mediated cytotoxic paraneoplastic and antitumor potential. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:1001–1010</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Onset of Preclinical Alzheimer Disease in Monozygotic Twins</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26048?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
The present work was undertaken to study the genetic contribution to the start of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with amyloid and tau biomarkers in cognitively intact older identical twins.


Methods
We studied in 96 monozygotic twin‐pairs relationships between amyloid‐beta (Aβ) aggregation as measured by the Aβ1–42/1–40 ratio in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; n = 126) and positron emission tomography (PET, n = 194), and CSF markers for Aβ production (beta‐secretase 1, Aβ1–40, and Aβ1–38) and CSF tau. Associations among markers were tested with generalized estimating equations including a random effect for twin status, adjusted for age, gender, and apolipoprotein E ε4 genotype. We used twin analyses to determine relative contributions of genetic and/or environmental factors to AD pathophysiological processes.


Results
Twenty‐seven individuals (14%) had an abnormal amyloid PET, and 14 twin‐pairs (15%) showed discordant amyloid PET scans. Within twin‐pairs, Aβ production markers and total‐tau (t‐tau) levels strongly correlated (r range = 0.73–0.86, all p &amp;lt; 0.0001), and Aβ aggregation markers and 181‐phosphorylated‐tau (p‐tau) levels correlated moderately strongly (r range = 0.50–0.64, all p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Cross‐twin cross‐trait analysis showed that Aβ1–38 in one twin correlated with Aβ1–42/1–40 ratios, and t‐tau and p‐tau levels in their cotwins (r range = −0.28 to 0.58, all p &amp;lt; .007). Within‐pair differences in Aβ production markers related to differences in tau levels (r range = 0.49–0.61, all p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Twin discordance analyses suggest that Aβ production and tau levels show coordinated increases in very early AD.


Interpretation
Our results suggest a substantial genetic/shared environmental background contributes to both Aβ and tau increases, suggesting that modulation of environmental risk factors may aid in delaying the onset of AD pathophysiological processes. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:987–1000</content:encoded>

The diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains problematic, with current diagnostic criteria (revised El Escorial [rEEC] and Awaji) being complex and prone to error. Consequently, the diagnostic utility of the recently proposed Gold Coast criteria was determined in ALS.


Methods
We retrospectively reviewed 506 patients (302 males, 204 females) to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the Gold Coast criteria to that of the Awaji and rEEC criteria (defined by the proportion of patients categorized as definite, probable, or possible ALS) in accordance with standards of reporting of diagnostic accuracy criteria.


Results
The sensitivity of Gold Coast criteria (92%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 88.7–94.6%) was comparable to that of Awaji (90.3%, 95% CI = 86.69–93.2%) and rEEC (88.6, 95% CI = 84.8–91.7%) criteria. Additionally, the Gold Coast criteria sensitivity was maintained across different subgroups, defined by site of onset, disease duration, and functional disability. In atypical ALS phenotypes, the Gold Coast criteria exhibited greater sensitivity and specificity.


Interpretation
The present study established the diagnostic utility of the Gold Coast criteria in ALS, with benefits evident in bulbar and limb onset disease patients, as well as atypical phenotypes. The Gold Coast criteria should be considered in clinical practice and therapeutic trials. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:979–986</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Assessing Dysferlinopathy Patients Over Three Years With a New Motor Scale</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26044?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Dysferlinopathy is a muscular dystrophy with a highly variable clinical presentation and currently unpredictable progression. This variability and unpredictability presents difficulties for prognostication and clinical trial design. The Jain Clinical Outcomes Study of Dysferlinopathy aims to establish the validity of the North Star Assessment for Limb Girdle Type Muscular Dystrophies (NSAD) scale and identify factors that influence the rate of disease progression using NSAD.


Methods
We collected a longitudinal series of functional assessments from 187 patients with dysferlinopathy over 3 years. Rasch analysis was used to develop the NSAD, a motor performance scale suitable for ambulant and nonambulant patients. Generalized estimating equations were used to evaluate the impact of patient factors on outcome trajectories.


Results
The NSAD detected significant change in clinical progression over 1 year. The steepest functional decline occurred during the first 10 years after symptom onset, with more rapid decline noted in patients who developed symptoms at a younger age (p = 0.04). The most rapidly deteriorating group over the study was patients 3 to 8 years post symptom onset at baseline.


Interpretation
The NSAD is the first validated limb girdle specific scale of motor performance, suitable for use in clinical practice and clinical trials. Longitudinal analysis showed it may be possible to identify patient factors associated with greater functional decline both across the disease course and in the short‐term for clinical trial preparation. Through further work and validation in this cohort, we anticipate that a disease model incorporating functional performance will allow for more accurate prognosis for patients with dysferlinopathy.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Apolipoprotein E4 Reduction with Antisense Oligonucleotides Decreases Neurodegeneration in a Tauopathy Model</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26043?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype is the strongest genetic risk factor for late‐onset Alzheimer's disease, with the ε4 allele increasing risk in a dose‐dependent fashion. In addition to ApoE4 playing a crucial role in amyloid‐β deposition, recent evidence suggests that it also plays an important role in tau pathology and tau‐mediated neurodegeneration. It is not known, however, whether therapeutic reduction of ApoE4 would exert protective effects on tau‐mediated neurodegeneration.


Methods
Herein, we used antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) against human APOE to reduce ApoE4 levels in the P301S/ApoE4 mouse model of tauopathy. We treated P301S/ApoE4 mice with ApoE or control ASOs via intracerebroventricular injection at 6 and 7.5 months of age and performed brain pathological assessments at 9 months of age.


Results
Our results indicate that treatment with ApoE ASOs reduced ApoE4 protein levels by ~50%, significantly protected against tau pathology and associated neurodegeneration, decreased neuroinflammation, and preserved synaptic density. These data were also corroborated by a significant reduction in levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL) protein in plasma of ASO‐treated mice.


Interpretation
We conclude that reducing ApoE4 levels should be explored further as a therapeutic approach for APOE4 carriers with tauopathy including Alzheimer's disease. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:952–966</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) can present with distinct neurological manifestations. This study shows that inflammatory neurological diseases were associated with increased levels of interleukin (IL)‐2, IL‐4, IL‐6, IL‐10, IL‐12, chemokine (C‐X‐C motif) ligand 8 (CXCL8), and CXCL10 in the cerebrospinal fluid. Conversely, encephalopathy was associated with high serum levels of IL‐6, CXCL8, and active tumor growth factor β1. Inflammatory syndromes of the central nervous system in COVID‐19 can appear early, as a parainfectious process without significant systemic involvement, or without direct evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 neuroinvasion. At the same time, encephalopathy is mainly influenced by peripheral events, including inflammatory cytokines. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:1041–1045</content:encoded>

Neurologic factors could also contribute to the motor function decline, chronic pain, and chronic fatigue that are commonly experienced by adults with CP. Based on a systematic literature review, we suggest (1) guidelines for neurologic surveillance and neurologist referral and (2) clinical research questions regarding the evolving neurologic risks for adults with CP.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Heritability Enrichment Implicates Microglia in Parkinson's Disease Pathogenesis</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26032?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Understanding how different parts of the immune system contribute to pathogenesis in Parkinson's disease is a burning challenge with important therapeutic implications. We studied enrichment of common variant heritability for Parkinson's disease stratified by immune and brain cell types.


Methods
We used summary statistics from the most recent meta‐analysis of genomewide association studies in Parkinson's disease and partitioned heritability using linkage disequilibrium score regression, stratified for specific cell types, as defined by open chromatin regions. We also validated enrichment results using a polygenic risk score approach and intersected disease‐associated variants with epigenetic data and expression quantitative loci to nominate and explore a putative microglial locus.


Results
We found significant enrichment of Parkinson's disease risk heritability in open chromatin regions of microglia and monocytes. Genomic annotations overlapped substantially between these 2 cell types, and only the enrichment signal for microglia remained significant in a joint model. We present evidence suggesting P2RY12, a key microglial gene and target for the antithrombotic agent clopidogrel, as the likely driver of a significant Parkinson's disease association signal on chromosome 3.


Interpretation
Our results provide further support for the importance of immune mechanisms in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis, highlight microglial dysregulation as a contributing etiological factor, and nominate a targetable microglial gene candidate as a pathogenic player. Immune processes can be modulated by therapy, with potentially important clinical implications for future treatment in Parkinson's disease. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:942–951</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Superficial Siderosis: A Clinical Review</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26083?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Superficial siderosis of the central nervous system results from subpial hemosiderin deposition due to chronic low‐grade bleeding into the subarachnoid space. The confluent and marginal subpial hemosiderin is best appreciated on iron‐sensitive magnetic resonance imaging sequences. With widespread use of magnetic resonance imaging, the disorder is increasingly being recognized, including in asymptomatic individuals. Gait ataxia, often with hearing impairment is a common clinical presentation. A clinical history of subarachnoid hemorrhage is generally not present. A macrovascular pathology is generally not causative. The most common etiology is dural disease, often dural tears. Prior or less commonly ongoing symptoms of craniospinal hypovolemia may be present. Common etiologies for dural tears include disc disease and trauma, including surgical trauma. Patients with dural tears due to herniated and calcified discs often have a ventral intraspinal fluid collection due to cerebrospinal fluid leak. A precise identification of the dural tear relies on multi‐modality imaging. It has been speculated that chronic bleeding from fragile blood vessels around the dural tear may be the likely underlying mechanism. Surgical correction of the bleeding source is a logical therapeutic strategy. Clinical outcomes are variable though neuroimaging evidence of successful dural tear repair is noted. The currently available data regarding use of deferiprone in patients with superficial siderosis is insufficient to recommend its routine use in patients.

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.667611</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Face recognition is an essential activity of social living, common to many primate species. Underlying processes in the brain have been investigated using various techniques and compared between species. Functional imaging studies have shown face-selective cortical regions and their degree of correspondence across species. However, the temporal dynamics of face processing, particularly processing speed, are likely different between them. Across sensory modalities activation of primary sensory cortices in macaque monkeys occurs at about 3/5 the latency of corresponding activation in humans, though this human simian difference may diminish or disappear in higher cortical regions. We recorded scalp event-related potentials (ERPs) to presentation of faces in macaques and estimated the peak latency of ERP components. Comparisons of latencies between macaques (112 ms) and humans (192 ms) suggested that the 3:5 ratio could be preserved in higher cognitive regions of face processing between those species.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Two-photon Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging is a leading technique for recording neuronal activities in vivo with cellular or subcellular resolution. However, during experiments, the images often suffer from corruption due to complex noises.

We present an approach that facilitates imaging data restoration through image denoising performed by a neural network combining spatiotemporal filtering and model blind learning. Tests with synthetic and real two-photon Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach enables efficient restoration of imaging data. In addition, we demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods by evaluating the qualities of the denoising performance of the models quantitatively. Therefore, our method provides an invaluable tool for denoising two-photon Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging data by model blind spatiotemporal processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Common methods to estimate capillary permeability have potential confounders, or require laborious and subjective semi-manual analysis.&lt;/p&gt;New method&lt;p&gt;Here we used snap frozen mouse and rat brain sections that were double-immunofluorescent labeled for immunoglobulin G (IgG; plasma protein) and laminin-α4 (capillary basement membrane). A Machine Learning Image Analysis program (Zeiss ZEN Intellisis) was trained to recognize and segment laminin-α4 to equivocally identify blood vessels in large sets of images. An IgG subclass based on a threshold intensity was segmented and quantitated only in extravascular regions. The residual parenchymal IgG fluorescence is indicative of blood-to-brain extravasation of IgG and was accurately quantitated.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Automated machine-learning and threshold based segmentation of only parenchymal IgG extravasation accentuates otherwise indistinct capillary permeability, particularly frequent in minor BBB leakage. Comparison with Existing Methods: Large datasets can be processed and analyzed quickly and robustly to provide an overview of vascular permeability throughout the brain.

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Effects of Perturbation Velocity, Direction, Background Muscle Activation, and Task Instruction on Long-Latency Responses Measured From Forearm Muscles</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.639773</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The central nervous system uses feedback processes that occur at multiple time scales to control interactions with the environment. The long-latency response (LLR) is the fastest process that directly involves cortical areas, with a motoneuron response measurable 50 ms following an imposed limb displacement. Several behavioral factors concerning perturbation mechanics and the active role of muscles prior or during the perturbation can modulate the long-latency response amplitude (LLRa) in the upper limbs, but the interactions among many of these factors had not been systematically studied before. We conducted a behavioral study on thirteen healthy individuals to determine the effect and interaction of four behavioral factors – background muscle torque, perturbation direction, perturbation velocity, and task instruction – on the LLRa evoked from the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) muscles after velocity-controlled wrist displacements. The effects of the four factors were quantified using both a 0D statistical analysis on the average perturbation-evoked EMG signal in the period corresponding to an LLR, and using a timeseries analysis of EMG signals. All factors significantly modulated LLRa, and their combination nonlinearly contributed to modulating the LLRa. Specifically, all the three-way interaction terms that could be computed without including the interaction between instruction and velocity significantly modulated the LLR. Analysis of the three-way interaction terms of the 0D model indicated that for the ECU muscle, the LLRa evoked when subjects are asked to maintain their muscle activation in response to the perturbations was greater than the one observed when subjects yielded to the perturbations (p &amp;lt; 0.001), but this effect was not measured for muscles undergoing shortening or in absence of background muscle activation. Moreover, higher perturbation velocity increased the LLRa evoked from the stretched muscle in presence of a background torque (p &amp;lt; 0.001), but no effects of velocity were measured in absence of background torque. Also, our analysis identified significant modulations of LLRa in muscles shortened by the perturbation, including an interaction between torque and velocity, and an effect of both torque and velocity. The time-series analysis indicated the significance of additional transient effects in the LLR region for muscles undergoing shortening.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.635687</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cross-sectional studies indicate that normal aging is accompanied by decreases in brain structure. Longitudinal studies, however, are relatively rare and inconsistent regarding their outcomes. Particularly the heterogeneity of methods, sample characteristics and the high inter-individual variability in older adults prevent the deduction of general trends. Therefore, the current study aimed to compare longitudinal age-related changes in brain structure (measured through cortical thickness) in two large independent samples of healthy older adults (n = 161 each); the Longitudinal Healthy Aging Brain (LHAB) database project at the University of Zurich, Switzerland, and 1000BRAINS at the Research Center Juelich, Germany. Annual percentage changes in the two samples revealed stable to slight decreases in cortical thickness over time. After correction for major covariates, i.e., baseline age, sex, education, and image quality, sample differences were only marginally present. Results suggest that general trends across time might be generalizable over independent samples, assuming the same methodology is used, and similar sample characteristics are present.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The functional connectome of white matter and graph theory were used to these participants. Two-sample t-test was used for the detection the abnormal graph properties in FD. Pearson correlation was used for the relationship between properties and the clinical and neuropshychological information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Patients with FD and healthy controls showed small-world properties in functional connectome of white matter.

Frontal lobe, insula, and thalamus were key regions in brain information exchange of FD. It provided some novel imaging evidences for the mechanism of FD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Dark Rearing Promotes the Recovery of Visual Cortical Responses but Not the Morphology of Geniculocortical Axons in Amblyopic Cat</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.637638</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Monocular deprivation (MD) of vision during early postnatal life induces amblyopia, and most neurons in the primary visual cortex lose their responses to the closed eye. Anatomically, the somata of neurons in the closed-eye recipient layer of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) shrink and their axons projecting to the visual cortex retract. Although it has been difficult to restore visual acuity after maturation, recent studies in rodents and cats showed that a period of exposure to complete darkness could promote recovery from amblyopia induced by prior MD. However, in cats, which have an organization of central visual pathways similar to humans, the effect of dark rearing only improves monocular vision and does not restore binocular depth perception. To determine whether dark rearing can completely restore the visual pathway, we examined its effect on the three major concomitants of MD in individual visual neurons, eye preference of visual cortical neurons and soma size and axon morphology of LGN neurons. Dark rearing improved the recovery of visual cortical responses to the closed eye compared with the recovery under binocular conditions. However, geniculocortical axons serving the closed eye remained retracted after dark rearing, whereas reopening the closed eye restored the soma size of LGN neurons. These results indicate that dark rearing incompletely restores the visual pathway, and thus exerts a limited restorative effect on visual function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Non-Cell-Autonomous Regulation of Optic Nerve Regeneration by Amacrine Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.666798</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Visual information is conveyed from the eye to the brain through the axons of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that course through the optic nerve and synapse onto neurons in multiple subcortical visual relay areas. RGCs cannot regenerate their axons once they are damaged, similar to most mature neurons in the central nervous system (CNS), and soon undergo cell death. These phenomena of neurodegeneration and regenerative failure are widely viewed as being determined by cell-intrinsic mechanisms within RGCs or to be influenced by the extracellular environment, including glial or inflammatory cells. However, a new concept is emerging that the death or survival of RGCs and their ability to regenerate axons are also influenced by the complex circuitry of the retina and that the activation of a multicellular signaling cascade involving changes in inhibitory interneurons – the amacrine cells (AC) – contributes to the fate of RGCs. Here, we review our current understanding of the role that interneurons play in cell survival and axon regeneration after optic nerve injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: NF-κB-Induced Upregulation of miR-146a-5p Promoted Hippocampal Neuronal Oxidative Stress and Pyroptosis via TIGAR in a Model of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.653881</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that places a heavy burden on patients and society. Hippocampal neuronal loss is a hallmark of AD progression. Therefore, understanding the mechanism underlying hippocampal neuronal death would be of great importance for the diagnosis and treatment of AD. This study aimed to explore the molecular mechanism via which nuclear factor kappa β (NF-κB) promotes hippocampal neuronal oxidative stress and pyroptosis in AD. We collected serum samples from 101 healthy elderly people and 112 patients with AD at the Affiliated Hospital of Kunming University of Science and Technology between January 2017 and January 2020. Commercially available human hippocampal neurons (HHNs) were used to establish an AD model (AD-HHN) following Aβ25–35 treatment. The mRNA expression levels of NF-κB and pyroptosis markers [NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3, caspase-1, interleukin (IL)-1β, and interleukin-18] mRNA and the expression level of miR-146a-5p in the serum samples of patients with AD and AD-HHNs were determined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Oxidative stress indices (reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and catalase) were measured by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The expression of proteins [NF-κB, TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR), and pyroptosis markers] was tested by western blotting. The relationship between miR-146a-5p and TIGAR was investigated using a dual luciferase reporter gene assay. We found that NF-κB and miR-146a-5p were highly expressed, while TIGAR was low expressed in patients with AD and AD-HHNs. In addition, there was a significant positive correlation between the expression levels of NF-κB and miR-146a-5p, but a negative correlation between NF-κB mRNA and TIGAR mRNA in patients with AD, as well as miR-146a-5p and TIGAR mRNA in patients with AD. In AD-HNNs, miR-146a-5p targeted and downregulated the expression of TIGAR. Knockdown of NF-κB or overexpression of TIGAR markedly attenuated oxidative stress and pyroptosis in AD-HHNs, while concurrent overexpression of miR-146a-5p inhibited these effects. In conclusion, NF-κB-induced upregulation of miR-146a-5p promoted oxidative stress and pyroptosis in AD-HNNs by targeting TIGAR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: 3D Reconstruction of the Morpho-Functional Topography of the Human Vagal Trigone</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.663399</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Vagal Trigone, often referred to as Ala Cinerea, is a triangular-shaped area of the floor of the fourth ventricle that is strictly involved in the network of chardiochronotropic, baroceptive, respiratory, and gastrointestinal control systems of the medulla oblongata. While it is frequently identified as the superficial landmark for the underlying Dorsal Motor Nucleus of the Vagus, this correspondence is not univocal in anatomical literature and is often oversimplified in neuroanatomy textbooks and neurosurgical atlases. As the structure represents an important landmark for neurosurgical procedures involving the floor of the fourth ventricle, accurate morphological characterization is required to avoid unwanted side effects (e.g., bradychardia, hypertension) during neuorphysiological monitoring and cranial nerve nuclei stimulation in intraoperative settings. The aim of this study was to address the anatomo-topographical relationships of the Vagal Trigone with the underlying nuclei. For this purpose, we have conducted an anatomo-microscopical examination of serial sections deriving from 54 Human Brainstems followed by 3D reconstruction and rendering of the specimens. Our findings indicate that the Vagal Trigone corresponds only partially with the Dorsal Motor Nucleus of the Vagus, while most of its axial profile is occupied by the dorsal regions of the Solitary Tract Nucleus. Furthermore, basing on literature and our findings we speculate that the neuroblasts of the Dorsal Motor Nucleus of the Vagus undergo neurobiotaxic migration induced by the neuroblasts of the dorsolaterally located solitary tract nucleus, giving rise to the Ala Cinerea, a topographically defined area for parasympathetic visceral control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Multiple Roles in Neuroprotection for the Exercise Derived Myokine Irisin</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.649929</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Exercise has multiple beneficial effects on health including decreasing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. Such effects are thought to be mediated (at least in part) by myokines, a collection of cytokines and other small proteins released from skeletal muscles. As an endocrine organ, skeletal muscle synthesizes and secretes a wide range of myokines which contribute to different functions in different organs, including the brain. One such myokine is the recently discovered protein Irisin, which is secreted into circulation from skeletal muscle during exercise from its membrane bound precursor Fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5). Irisin contributes to metabolic processes such as glucose homeostasis and browning of white adipose tissue. Irisin also crosses the blood brain barrier and initiates a neuroprotective genetic program in the hippocampus that culminates with increased expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Furthermore, exercise and FNDC5/Irisin have been shown to have several neuroprotective effects against injuries in ischemia and neurodegenerative disease models, including Alzheimer’s disease. In addition, Irisin has anxiolytic and antidepressant effects. In this review we present and summarize recent findings on the multiple effects of Irisin on neural function, including signaling pathways and mechanisms involved. We also discuss how exercise can positively influence brain function and mental health via the “skeletal muscle-brain axis.” While there are still many unanswered questions, we put forward the idea that Irisin is a potentially essential mediator of the skeletal muscle-brain crosstalk.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Role of mTOR-Regulated Autophagy in Synaptic Plasticity Related Proteins Downregulation and the Reference Memory Deficits Induced by Anesthesia/Surgery in Aged Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.628541</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Postoperative cognitive dysfunction increases mortality and morbidity in perioperative patients and has become a major concern for patients and caregivers. Previous studies demonstrated that synaptic plasticity is closely related to cognitive function, anesthesia and surgery inhibit synaptic function. In central nervous system, autophagy is vital to synaptic plasticity, homeostasis of synapticproteins, synapse elimination, spine pruning, proper axon guidance, and when dysregulated, is associated with behavioral and memory functions disorders. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) negatively regulates the process of autophagy. This study aimed to explore whether rapamycin can ameliorate anesthesia/surgery-induced cognitive deficits by inhibiting mTOR, activating autophagy and rising synaptic plasticity-related proteins in the hippocampus. Aged C57BL/6J mice were used to establish POCD models with exploratory laparotomy under isoflurane anesthesia. The Morris Water Maze (MWM) was used to measure reference memory after anesthesia and surgery. The levels of mTOR phosphorylation (p-mTOR), Beclin-1 and LC3-II were examined on postoperative days 1, 3 and 7 by western blotting. The levels of synaptophysin (SYN) and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) in the hippocampus were also examined by western blotting. Here we showed that anesthesia/surgery impaired reference memory and induced the activation of mTOR, decreased the expression of autophagy-related proteins such as Beclin-1 and LC3-II. A corresponding decline in the expression of neuronal/synaptic, plasticity-related proteins such as SYN and PSD-95 was also observed. Pretreating mice with rapamycin inhibited the activation of mTOR and restored autophagy function, also increased the expression of SYN and PSD-95. Furthermore, anesthesia/surgery-induced learning and memory deficits were also reversed by rapamycin pretreatment. In conclusion, anesthesia/surgery induced mTOR hyperactivation and autophagy impairments, and then reduced the levels of SYN and PSD-95 in the hippocampus. An mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, ameliorated anesthesia/surgery-related cognitive impairments by inhibiting the mTOR activity, inducing activation of autophagy, enhancing SYN and PSD-95 expression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The model showed good discrimination [Harrell’s concordance index (C-index) of 0.814; 95% confidence interval, 0.782–0.835] and good calibration. Comparable results were also seen in the validation cohort, which includes good discrimination (C-index, 0.772; 95% confidence interval, 0.776–0.818) and good calibration. Decision curve analysis demonstrated that the prediction nomogram was clinically useful.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This prediction nomogram provides a practical tool with all necessary predictors, which are accessible to practitioners.

	<title>Hippocampus: Probabilistic value learning in medial temporal lobe amnesia</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23317?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
A prevailing view in cognitive neuroscience suggests that different forms of learning are mediated by dissociable memory systems, with a mesolimbic (i.e., midbrain and basal ganglia) system supporting incremental trial‐and‐error reinforcement learning and a hippocampal‐based system supporting episodic memory. Yet, growing evidence suggests that the hippocampus may also be important for trial‐and‐error learning, particularly value or reward‐based learning. In the present report, we use a lesion‐based neuropsychological approach to clarify hippocampal contributions to such learning. Six amnesic patients with medial temporal lobe damage and a group of healthy controls were administered a simple value‐based learning task involving probabilistic trial‐and‐error acquisition of stimulus–response‐outcome (reward or none) contingencies modeled after Li et al. (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
, 2011, 108
(1), 55–60). As predicted, patients were significantly impaired on the task, demonstrating reduced learning of the contingencies. Our results provide further supportive evidence that the hippocampus' role in cognition extends beyond episodic memory tasks and call for further refinement of theoretical models of hippocampal functioning.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Dorsal and ventral mossy cells differ in their axonal projections throughout the dentate gyrus of the mouse hippocampus</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23314?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Glutamatergic hilar mossy cells (MCs) have axons that terminate both near and far from their cell body but stay within the DG, making synapses primarily in the molecular layer. The long‐range axons are considered the primary projection, and extend throughout the DG ipsilateral to the soma, and project to the contralateral DG. The specificity of MC axons for the inner molecular layer (IML) has been considered to be a key characteristic of the DG. In the present study, we made the surprising finding that dorsal MC axons are an exception to this rule. We used two mouse lines that allow for Cre‐dependent viral labeling of MCs and their axons: dopamine receptor D2 (Drd2‐Cre) and calcitonin receptor‐like receptor (Crlr‐Cre). A single viral injection into the dorsal DG to label dorsal MCs resulted in labeling of MC axons in both the IML and middle molecular layer (MML). Interestingly, this broad termination of dorsal MC axons occurred throughout the septotemporal DG. In contrast, long‐range axons of ventral MCs terminated in the IML, consistent with the literature. Taken together, these results suggest that dorsal and ventral MCs differ significantly in their axonal projections. Since MC projections in the ML are thought to terminate primarily on GCs, the results suggest a dorsal–ventral difference in MC activation of GCs. The surprising difference in dorsal and ventral MC projections should therefore be considered when evaluating dorsal–ventral differences in DG function.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Sodium salicylate enhances neural excitation via reducing GABAergic transmission in the dentate gyrus area of rat hippocampus in vivo</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23312?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Sodium salicylate, one of the non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, is widely prescribed in the clinic, but a high dose of usage can cause hyperactivity in the central nervous system, including the hippocampus. At present, the neural mechanism underlying the induced hyperactivity is not fully understood, in particular, in the hippocampus under an in vivo condition. In this study, we found that systemic administration of sodium salicylate increased the field excitatory postsynaptic potential slope and the population spike amplitude in a dose‐dependent manner in the hippocampal dentate gyrus area of rats with in vivo field potential extracellular recordings, which indicates that sodium salicylate enhances basal synaptic transmission and neural excitation. In the presence of picrotoxin, a GABA‐A receptor antagonist, sodium salicylate failed to increase the initial slope of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential and the amplitude of the population spike in vivo. To further explore how sodium salicylate enhances the neural excitation, we made whole‐cell patch‐clamp recordings from hippocampal slices. We found that perfusion of the slice with sodium salicylate decreased electrically evoked GABA receptor‐mediated currents, increased paired‐pulse ratio, and lowered frequency and amplitude of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents. Together, these results demonstrate that sodium salicylate enhances the neural excitation through suppressing GABAergic synaptic transmission in presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms in the hippocampal dentate gyrus area. Our findings may help understand the side effects caused by sodium salicylate in the central nervous system.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
Memorizing the locations of environmental cues is crucial for survival and depends on the hippocampus. We recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from the hippocampus of freely moving mice during an object location task. The power of beta‐band (23–30 Hz) oscillations increased immediately before approaching objects in a memory‐encoding phase. The exploration‐induced beta oscillations gradually decreased during the memory‐encoding session. Mice that exhibited stronger beta oscillation power exhibited better performance in the subsequent memory‐retrieval test. These results suggest that beta oscillations in the hippocampal CA1 region are involved in the memory encoding of object‐location associations.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
Reelin plays a key role in neuronal migration and lamination in the cortex and hippocampus. Animal studies have shown that reelin expression decreases with age. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of reelin in all layers of the human hippocampal formation across three age groups. We used immunohistochemistry in formalin fixed and paraffin embedded hippocampal tissue from infants (1–10 months; n = 9), children (4–10 years; n = 4), and adults (45–60 years; n = 6) to stain for reelin. Expression was quantified (measured as the number of positive reelin cells/mm2) in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus (DG), the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (ML), the hippocampal fissure (HF), stratum lacunosum moleculare (SLM), CA4/Hilus and the stratum pyramidale layer of CA3, CA2, and CA1. Expression of reelin was highest in the HF irrespective of age, followed by the SLM and ML. Minimal to no expression was seen in the stratum pyramidale layer of CA1‐3. With age, reelin expression decreased and was statistically significant from infancy to childhood in the HF (p = .02). This study confirms that reelin expression decreases with age in the human hippocampus, and shows for the first time that the major decrease occurs between infancy and early childhood.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Cross‐regional phase amplitude coupling supports the encoding of episodic memories</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23309?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Phase amplitude coupling (PAC) between theta and gamma oscillations represents a key neurophysiological mechanism that promotes the temporal organization of oscillatory activity. For this reason, PAC has been implicated in item/context integration for episodic processes, including coordinating activity across multiple cortical regions. While data in humans has focused principally on PAC within a single brain region, data in rodents has revealed evidence that the phase of the hippocampal theta oscillation modulates gamma oscillations in the cortex (and vice versa). This pattern, termed cross‐regional PAC (xPAC), has not previously been observed in human subjects engaged in mnemonic processing. We use a unique dataset with intracranial electrodes inserted simultaneously into the hippocampus and seven cortical regions across 40 human subjects to (1) test for the presence of significant cross‐regional PAC (xPAC), (2) to establish that the magnitude of xPAC predicts memory encoding success, (3) to describe specific frequencies within the broad 2–9 Hz theta range that govern hippocampal‐cortical interactions in xPAC, and (4) compare anterior versus posterior hippocampal xPAC patterns. We find that strong functional xPAC occurs principally between the hippocampus and other mesial temporal structures, namely entorhinal and parahippocampal cortices, and that xPAC is overall stronger for posterior hippocampal connections. We also show that our results are not confounded by alternative factors such as inter‐regional phase synchrony, local PAC occurring within cortical regions, or artifactual theta oscillatory waveforms.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Influence of regional white matter hyperintensity volume and apolipoprotein E ε4 status on hippocampal volume in healthy older adults</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23308?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
While total white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been associated with hippocampal atrophy, less is known about how the regional distribution of WMH volume may differentially affect the hippocampus in healthy aging. Additionally, apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carriers may be at an increased risk for greater WMH volumes and hippocampal atrophy in aging. The present study sought to investigate whether regional WMH volume mediates the relationship between age and hippocampal volume and if this association is moderated by APOE ε4 status in a group of 190 cognitively healthy adults (APOE ε4 status [carrier/non‐carrier] = 59/131), ages 50–89. Analyses revealed that temporal lobe WMH volume significantly mediated the relationship between age and average bilateral hippocampal volume, and this effect was moderated by APOE ε4 status (−0.020 (SE = 0.009), 95% CI, [−0.039, −0.003]). APOE ε4 carriers, but not non‐carriers, showed negative indirect effects of age on hippocampal volume through temporal lobe WMH volume (APOE ε4 carriers: −0.016 (SE = 0.007), 95% CI, [−0.030, −0.003]; APOE ε4 non‐carriers: .005 (SE = 0.006), 95% CI, [−0.006, 0.017]). These findings remained significant after additionally adjusting for sex, years of education, hypertension status and duration, cholesterol status, diabetes status, Body Mass Index, history of smoking, and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale‐IV Full Scale IQ. There were no significant moderated mediation effects for frontal, parietal, and occipital lobe WMH volumes, with or without covariates.

Cardiac anatomy plays a crucial role in determining cardiac function. However, there is a poor understanding of how specific and localised anatomical changes affect different cardiac functional outputs. In this work, we test the hypothesis that in a statistical shape model (SSM), the modes that are most relevant for describing anatomy are also most important for determining the output of cardiac electromechanics simulations. We made patient-specific four-chamber heart meshes (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 20) from cardiac CT images in asymptomatic subjects and created a SSM from 19 cases. Nine modes captured 90% of the anatomical variation in the SSM. Functional simulation outputs correlated best with modes 2, 3 and 9 on average (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; = 0.49 ± 0.17, 0.37 ± 0.23 and 0.34 ± 0.17 respectively). We performed a global sensitivity analysis to identify the different modes responsible for different simulated electrical and mechanical measures of cardiac function. Modes 2 and 9 were the most important for determining simulated left ventricular mechanics and pressure-derived phenotypes. Mode 2 explained 28.56 ± 16.48% and 25.5 ± 20.85, and mode 9 explained 12.1 ± 8.74% and 13.54 ± 16.91% of the variances of mechanics and pressure-derived phenotypes, respectively. Electrophysiological biomarkers were explained by the interaction of 3 ± 1 modes. In the healthy adult human heart, shape modes that explain large portions of anatomical variance do not explain equivalent levels of electromechanical functional variation. As a result, in cardiac models, representing patient anatomy using a limited number of modes of anatomical variation can cause a loss in accuracy of simulated electromechanical function.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eTlBJyE2pCY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Repeat proteins are abundant in eukaryotic proteomes. They are involved in many eukaryotic specific functions, including signalling. For many of these proteins, the structure is not known, as they are difficult to crystallise. Today, using direct coupling analysis and deep learning it is often possible to predict a protein’s structure. However, the unique sequence features present in repeat proteins have been a challenge to use direct coupling analysis for predicting contacts. Here, we show that deep learning-based methods (trRosetta, DeepMetaPsicov (DMP) and PconsC4) overcomes this problem and can predict intra- and inter-unit contacts in repeat proteins. In a benchmark dataset of 815 repeat proteins, about 90% can be correctly modelled. Further, among 48 PFAM families lacking a protein structure, we produce models of forty-one families with estimated high accuracy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NC-_vO_A2A8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Brain networks exhibit very variable and dynamical functional connectivity and flexible configurations of information exchange despite their overall fixed structure. Brain oscillations are hypothesized to underlie time-dependent functional connectivity by periodically changing the excitability of neural populations. In this paper, we investigate the role of the connection delay and the detuning between the natural frequencies of neural populations in the transmission of signals. Based on numerical simulations and analytical arguments, we show that the amount of information transfer between two oscillating neural populations could be determined by their connection delay and the mismatch in their oscillation frequencies. Our results highlight the role of the collective phase response curve of the oscillating neural populations for the efficacy of signal transmission and the quality of the information transfer in brain networks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rB0tSDpOfkI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Speech biomarkers in rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and Parkinson's disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26085?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
This multi‐language study employed simple speech recording and high‐end pattern analysis to provide sensitive and reliable non‐invasive biomarkers of prodromal vs. manifest alpha‐synucleinopathy in patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (iRBD) and early‐stage Parkinson's disease (PD).


Methods
We performed a multicentre study across the Czech, English, German, French and Italian languages at seven centres in Europe and North America. A total of 448 participants (337 males) including 150 with iRBD (mean duration of iRBD across language groups 0.5–3.4 years), 149 with PD (mean duration of disease across language groups 1.7–2.5 years), and 149 healthy controls were recorded; 350 of the participants completed the 12‐month follow‐up. We developed a fully‐automated acoustic quantitative assessment approach for the seven distinctive patterns of hypokinetic dysarthria.


Results
No language differences that impacted clinical parkinsonian phenotypes were found. Compared to the controls, we found significant abnormalities of an overall acoustic speech severity measure via composite dysarthria index for both iRBD (p = 0.002) and PD (p &amp;lt; 0.001). By contrast, only PD (p &amp;lt; 0.001) was perceptually distinct in a blinded subjective analysis. We found significant group differences between PD and controls for monopitch (p &amp;lt; 0.001), prolonged pauses (p &amp;lt; 0.001) and imprecise consonants (p = 0.03); only monopitch was able to differentiate iRBD patients from controls (p = 0.004). At the 12‐month follow‐up, a slight progression of overall acoustic speech impairment was noted for the iRBD (p = 0.04) and PD (p = 0.03) groups.


Interpretation
Automated speech analysis may provide a useful additional biomarker of parkinsonism for the assessment of disease progression and therapeutic interventions.

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Controlling for activity‐dependent genes and behavioral states is critical for determining brain relationships within and across species</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25157?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>In 2016, Puelles et al. sought to determine the relationship of avian and mammalian pallial regions using the expression profile of the NR4A2 nuclear orphan receptor, concluding that the lateral avian mesopallium was most like the mammalian claustrum, not layer 2 of the cortex as found by Suzuki and Hirata (2014). However, we found that the NR4A2 expression patterns were characteristic of an activity‐dependent gene. Looking at different behavioral contexts in the zebra finch, we found induced expression of NR4A2 in regions across the pallium associated with visual, somatosensory, and motor activity, confounding and contradicting previous findings. Accordingly, we do not believe NR4A2 is a suitable gene for assessing homologous brain anatomy without understanding the animal's behavioral state.







Abstract
The genetic profile of vertebrate pallia has long driven debate on homology across distantly related clades. Based on an expression profile of the orphan nuclear receptor NR4A2 in mouse and chicken brains, Puelles et al. (2016) concluded that the avian lateral mesopallium is homologous to the mammalian claustrum, and the medial mesopallium homologous to the insula cortex. They argued that their findings contradict conclusions by Jarvis et al. (2013) and Chen et al. (2013) that the hyperpallium densocellare is instead a mesopallium cell population, and by Suzuki and Hirata (2013) that the avian mesopallium is homologous to mammalian cortical layers 2/3. Here, we find that NR4A2 is an activity‐dependent gene and cannot be used to determine brain organization or species relationships without considering behavioral state. Activity‐dependent NR4A2 expression has been previously demonstrated in the rodent brain, with the highest induction occurring within the claustrum, amygdala, deep and superficial cortical layers, and hippocampus. In the zebra finch, we find that NR4A2 is constitutively expressed in the arcopallium, but induced in parts of the mesopallium, and in sparse cells within the hyperpallium, depending on animal stimulus or behavioral state. Basal and induced NR4A2 expression patterns do not discount the previously named avian hyperpallium densocellare as dorsal mesopallium and conflict with proposed homology between the avian mesopallium and mammalian claustrum/insula at the exclusion of other brain regions. Broadly, these findings highlight the importance of controlling for behavioral state and neural activity to genetically define brain cell population relationships within and across species.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Cerebrovascular Neuroprotection after Acute Concussion in Adolescents</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26082?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
To assess acute cerebrovascular function in concussed adolescents (14‐21 years of age), whether it related to resting cerebral hemodynamics, and whether it recovered chronically.


Methods
Cerebral vasoreactivity and autoregulation, based on middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity, were assessed in 28 concussed participants (≤14 days of injury) and 29 matched controls. The participants in the concussion group returned for an 8‐week follow‐up assessment. Over the course of those 8‐weeks, participants recorded aerobic exercise frequency and duration.


Results
Between group demographic, clinical, and hemodynamic variables were not significantly different. Vasoreactivity was significantly higher in the concussed group (p=0.02). Within the concussed group, 60% of the variability in resting cerebral blood flow velocity was explained by vasoreactivity and two components of autoregulation – falling slope and effectiveness of autoregulation (adjusted R2=0.60, p&amp;lt;0.001). Moreover, lower mean arterial pressure, lower responses to increases in arterial pressure, and lower vasoreactivity were significantly associated with larger symptom burden (adjusted R2=0.72, p&amp;lt;0.01). By the 8‐week timepoint, symptom burden, but not vasoreactivity, improved in all but four concussed participants (p&amp;lt;0.01). 8‐week change in vasoreactivity was positively associated with aerobic exercise volume (adjusted R2=0.19, p=0.02).


Interpretation
Concussion resulted in changes in cerebrovascular regulatory mechanisms, which in turn explained the variability in resting cerebral blood flow velocity and acute symptom burden. Furthermore, these alterations persisted chronically despite symptom resolution, but was positively modified by aerobic exercise volume. These findings provide a mechanistic framework for further investigation into underlying cerebrovascular related symptomatology.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Motility Profile of Captive-Bred Marmosets Revealed by a Long-Term In-Cage Monitoring System</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.645308</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A quantitative evaluation of motility is crucial for studies employing experimental animals. Here, we describe the development of an in-cage motility monitoring method for new world monkeys using off-the-shelf components, and demonstrate its capability for long-term operation (e.g., a year). Based on this novel system, we characterized the motility of the common marmoset over different time scales (seconds, hours, days, and weeks). Monitoring of seven young animals belonging to two different age groups (sub-adult and young-adult) over a 231-day period revealed: (1) strictly diurnal activity (97.3% of movement during daytime), (2) short-cycle (∼20 s) transition in activity, and (3) bimodal diurnal activity including a “siesta” break. Additionally, while the mean duration of short-cycle activity, net daily activity, and diurnal activity changed over the course of development, 24-h periodicity remained constant. Finally, the method allowed for detection of progressive motility deterioration in a transgenic marmoset. Motility measurement offers a convenient way to characterize developmental and pathological changes in animals, as well as an economical and labor-free means for long-term evaluation in a wide range of basic and translational studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: The Forward Model: A Unifying Theory for the Role of the Cerebellum in Motor Control and Sense of Agency</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.644059</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For more than two decades, there has been converging evidence for an essential role of the cerebellum in non-motor functions. The cerebellum is not only important in learning and sensorimotor processes, some growing evidences show its implication in conditional learning and reward, which allows building our expectations about behavioral outcomes. More recent work has demonstrated that the cerebellum is also required for the sense of agency, a cognitive process that allows recognizing an action as our own, suggesting that the cerebellum might serve as an interface between sensorimotor function and cognition. A unifying model that would explain the role of the cerebellum across these processes has not been fully established. Nonetheless, an important heritage was given by the field of motor control: the forward model theory. This theory stipulates that movements are controlled based on the constant interactions between our organism and its environment through feedforward and feedback loops. Feedforward loops predict what is going to happen, while feedback loops confront the prediction with what happened so that we can react accordingly. From an anatomical point of view, the cerebellum is at an ideal location at the interface between the motor and sensory systems, as it is connected to cerebral, striatal, and spinal entities via parallel loops, so that it can link sensory and motor systems with cognitive processes. Recent findings showing that the cerebellum participates in building the sense of agency as a predictive and comparator system will be reviewed together with past work on motor control within the context of the forward model theory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Naturalistic Spike Trains Drive State-Dependent Homeostatic Plasticity in Superficial Layers of Visual Cortex</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.663282</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The history of neural activity determines the synaptic plasticity mechanisms employed in the brain. Previous studies report a rapid reduction in the strength of excitatory synapses onto layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons of the primary visual cortex (V1) following two days of dark exposure and subsequent re-exposure to light. The abrupt increase in visually driven activity is predicted to drive homeostatic plasticity, however, the parameters of neural activity that trigger these changes are unknown. To determine this, we first recorded spike trains in vivo from V1 layer 4 (L4) of dark exposed (DE) mice of both sexes that were re-exposed to light through homogeneous or patterned visual stimulation. We found that delivering the spike patterns recorded in vivo to L4 of V1 slices was sufficient to reduce the amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) of V1 L2/3 neurons in DE mice, but not in slices obtained from normal reared (NR) controls. Unexpectedly, the same stimulation pattern produced an up-regulation of mEPSC amplitudes in V1 L2/3 neurons from mice that received 2 h of light re-exposure (LE). A Poisson spike train exhibiting the same average frequency as the patterns recorded in vivo was equally effective at depressing mEPSC amplitudes in L2/3 neurons in V1 slices prepared from DE mice. Collectively, our results suggest that the history of visual experience modifies the responses of V1 neurons to stimulation and that rapid homeostatic depression of excitatory synapses can be driven by non-patterned input activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Myosin V Regulates Spatial Localization of Different Forms of Neurotransmitter Release in Central Synapses</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.650334</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synaptic active zone (AZ) contains multiple specialized release sites for vesicle fusion. The utilization of release sites is regulated to determine spatiotemporal organization of the two main forms of synchronous release, uni-vesicular (UVR) and multi-vesicular (MVR). We previously found that the vesicle-associated molecular motor myosin V regulates temporal utilization of release sites by controlling vesicle anchoring at release sites in an activity-dependent manner. Here we show that acute inhibition of myosin V shifts preferential location of vesicle docking away from AZ center toward periphery, and results in a corresponding spatial shift in utilization of release sites during UVR. Similarly, inhibition of myosin V also reduces preferential utilization of central release sites during MVR, leading to more spatially distributed and temporally uniform MVR that occurs farther away from the AZ center. Using a modeling approach, we provide a conceptual framework that unites spatial and temporal functions of myosin V in vesicle release by controlling the gradient of release site release probability across the AZ, which in turn determines the spatiotemporal organization of both UVR and MVR. Thus myosin V regulates both temporal and spatial utilization of release sites during two main forms of synchronous release.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Visual Outcomes in Experimental Rodent Models of Blast-Mediated Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.659576</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Blast-mediated traumatic brain injuries (bTBI) cause long-lasting physical, cognitive, and psychological disorders, including persistent visual impairment. No known therapies are currently utilized in humans to lessen the lingering and often serious symptoms. With TBI mortality decreasing due to advancements in medical and protective technologies, there is growing interest in understanding the pathology of visual dysfunction after bTBI. However, this is complicated by numerous variables, e.g., injury location, severity, and head and body shielding. This review summarizes the visual outcomes observed by various, current experimental rodent models of bTBI, and identifies data showing that bTBI activates inflammatory and apoptotic signaling leading to visual dysfunction. Pharmacologic treatments blocking inflammation and cell death pathways reported to alleviate visual deficits in post-bTBI animal models are discussed. Notably, techniques for assessing bTBI outcomes across exposure paradigms differed widely, so we urge future studies to compare multiple models of blast injury, to allow data to be directly compared.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurons have high metabolic demands that are almost exclusively met by glucose supplied from the bloodstream. Glucose is utilized in complex metabolic interactions between neurons and glia cells, described by the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS) hypothesis. The neural retina faces similar energy demands to the rest of the brain, with additional high anabolic needs to support continuous renewal of photoreceptor outer segments. This demand is met by a fascinating variation of the ANLS in which photoreceptors are the central part of a metabolic landscape, using glucose and supplying surrounding cells with metabolic intermediates. In this review we summarize recent evidence on how neurons, in particular photoreceptors, meet their energy and biosynthetic requirements by comprising a metabolic landscape of interdependent cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.647451</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Protein–protein interaction networks and signaling complexes are essential for normal brain function and are often dysregulated in neurological disorders. Nevertheless, unraveling neuron- and synapse-specific proteins interaction networks has remained a technical challenge. New techniques, however, have allowed for high-resolution and high-throughput analyses, enabling quantification and characterization of various neuronal protein populations. Over the last decade, mass spectrometry (MS) has surfaced as the primary method for analyzing multiple protein samples in tandem, allowing for the precise quantification of proteomic data. Moreover, the development of sophisticated protein-labeling techniques has given MS a high temporal and spatial resolution, facilitating the analysis of various neuronal substructures, cell types, and subcellular compartments. Recent studies have leveraged these novel techniques to reveal the proteomic underpinnings of well-characterized neuronal processes, such as axon guidance, long-term potentiation, and homeostatic plasticity. Translational MS studies have facilitated a better understanding of complex neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Schizophrenia (SCZ), and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Proteomic investigation of these diseases has not only given researchers new insight into disease mechanisms but has also been used to validate disease models and identify new targets for research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) regulate each other and have been implicated in several neuronal mechanisms, including neuroplasticity. We have investigated the effects of BDNF on serotonergic neurons by deleting BDNF receptor TrkB from serotonergic neurons in the adult brain. The transgenic mice show increased 5-HT and Tph2 levels with abnormal behavioral phenotype. In spite of increased food intake, the transgenic mice are significantly leaner than their wildtype littermates, which may be due to increased metabolic activity. Consistent with increased 5-HT, the proliferation of hippocampal progenitors is significantly increased, however, long-term survival of newborn cells is unchanged. Our data indicates that BDNF-TrkB signaling regulates the functional phenotype of 5-HT neurons with long-term behavioral consequences.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Management and Quality Control of Large Neuroimaging Datasets: Developments From the Barcelonaβeta Brain Research Center</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.633438</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent decades have witnessed an increasing number of large to very large imaging studies, prominently in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. The datasets collected during these studies form essential resources for the research aiming at new biomarkers. Collecting, hosting, managing, processing, or reviewing those datasets is typically achieved through a local neuroinformatics infrastructure. In particular for organizations with their own imaging equipment, setting up such a system is still a hard task, and relying on cloud-based solutions, albeit promising, is not always possible. This paper proposes a practical model guided by core principles including user involvement, lightweight footprint, modularity, reusability, and facilitated data sharing. This model is based on the experience from an 8-year-old research center managing cohort research programs on Alzheimer’s disease. Such a model gave rise to an ecosystem of tools aiming at improved quality control through seamless automatic processes combined with a variety of code libraries, command line tools, graphical user interfaces, and instant messaging applets. The present ecosystem was shaped around XNAT and is composed of independently reusable modules that are freely available on GitLab/GitHub. This paradigm is scalable to the general community of researchers working with large neuroimaging datasets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The vital role of reward in guiding visual attention has been supported by previous literatures. Here, we examined the motivational impact of monetary reward feedback stimuli on visual attention selection using an event-related potential (ERP) component called stimulus-preceding negativity (SPN) and a standard contextual cueing (CC) paradigm. It has been proposed that SPN reflects affective and motivational processing. We focused on whether incidentally learned context knowledge could be affected by reward. Both behavior and brain data demonstrated that contexts followed by reward feedback not only gave rise to faster implicit learning but also obtained a larger CC effect.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Hemodynamic Signal Changes During Motor Imagery Task Performance Are Associated With the Degree of Motor Task Learning</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.603069</link>
	<content:encoded>Purpose&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to investigate whether oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) generated during a motor imagery (MI) task is associated with the motor learning level of the task.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We included 16 right-handed healthy participants who were trained to perform a ball rotation (BR) task. Hemodynamic brain activity was measured using near-infrared spectroscopy to monitor changes in oxy-Hb concentration during the BR MI task. The experimental protocol used a block design, and measurements were performed three times before and after the initial training of the BR task as well as after the final training. The BR count during training was also measured. Furthermore, subjective vividness of MI was evaluated three times after NIRS measurement using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The results showed that the number of BRs increased significantly with training (P &amp;lt; 0.001). VAS scores also improved with training (P &amp;lt; 0.001). Furthermore, oxy-Hb concentration and the region of interest (ROI) showed a main effect (P = 0.001). An interaction was confirmed (P &amp;lt; 0.001), and it was ascertained that the change in oxy-Hb concentrations due to training was different for each ROI. The most significant predictor of subjective MI vividness was supplementary motor area (SMA) oxy-Hb concentration (coefficient = 0.365).&lt;/p&gt;Discussion&lt;p&gt;Hemodynamic brain activity during MI tasks may be correlated with task motor learning levels, since significant changes in oxy-Hb concentrations were observed following initial and final training in the SMA. In particular, hemodynamic brain activity in the SMA was suggested to reflect the MI vividness of participants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Striatal Dopamine Transporter Function Is Facilitated by Converging Biology of α-Synuclein and Cholesterol</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.658244</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Striatal dopamine transporters (DAT) powerfully regulate dopamine signaling, and can contribute risk to degeneration in Parkinson’s disease (PD). DATs can interact with the neuronal protein α-synuclein, which is associated with the etiology and molecular pathology of idiopathic and familial PD. Here, we tested whether DAT function in governing dopamine (DA) uptake and release is modified in a human-α-synuclein-overexpressing (SNCA-OVX) transgenic mouse model of early PD. Using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FCV) in ex vivo acute striatal slices to detect DA release, and biochemical assays, we show that several aspects of DAT function are promoted in SNCA-OVX mice. Compared to background control α-synuclein-null mice (Snca-null), the SNCA-OVX mice have elevated DA uptake rates, and more pronounced effects of DAT inhibitors on evoked extracellular DA concentrations ([DA]&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;) and on short-term plasticity (STP) in DA release, indicating DATs play a greater role in limiting DA release and in driving STP. We found that DAT membrane levels and radioligand binding sites correlated with α-synuclein level. Furthermore, DAT function in Snca-null and SNCA-OVX mice could also be promoted by applying cholesterol, and using Tof-SIMS we found genotype-differences in striatal lipids, with lower striatal cholesterol in SNCA-OVX mice. An inhibitor of cholesterol efflux transporter ABCA1 or a cholesterol chelator in SNCA-OVX mice reduced the effects of DAT-inhibitors on evoked [DA]&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;. Together these data indicate that human α-synuclein in a mouse model of PD promotes striatal DAT function, in a manner supported by extracellular cholesterol, suggesting converging biology of α-synuclein and cholesterol that regulates DAT function and could impact DA function and PD pathophysiology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a type of neurodegenerative disease that is associated with the accumulation of amyloid plaques. Increasing non-amyloidogenic processing and/or manipulating amyloid precursor protein signaling could reduce AD amyloid pathology and cognitive impairment. D-penicillamine (D-Pen) is a water-soluble metal chelator and can reduce the aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) with metals in vitro. However, the potential mechanism of D-Pen for treating neurodegenerative disorders remains unexplored. In here, a novel type of chitosan-based hydrogel to carry D-Pen was designed and the D-Pen-CS/β-glycerophosphate hydrogel were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and HPLC. Behavior tests investigated the learning and memory levels of APP/PS1 mice treated through the D-Pen hydrogel nasal delivery. In vivo and in vitro findings showed that nasal delivery of D-Pen-CS/β-GP hydrogel had properly chelated metal ions that reduced Aβ deposition. Furthermore, D-Pen mainly regulated A disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10) expression via melatonin receptor 1 (MTNR1α) and the downstream PKA/ERK/CREB pathway. The present data demonstrated D-Pen significantly improved the cognitive ability of APP/PS1 mice and reduced Aβ generation through activating ADAM10 and accelerating non-amyloidogenic processing. Hence, these findings indicate the potential of D-Pen as a promising agent for treating AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;Low-intensity transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique with high spatial resolution and feasible penetration depth. To date, the mechanisms of TUS modulated neural oscillations are not fully understood. This study designed a very low acoustic intensity (AI) TUS system that produces considerably reduced AI Ultrasound pulses (I&lt;sub&gt;SPTA&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0.5 W/cm2) when compared to previous methods used to measure regional neural oscillation patterns under different TUS parameters.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We recorded the local field potential (LFP) of five brain nuclei under TUS with three groups of simulating parameters. Spectrum estimation, time-frequency analysis (TFA), and relative power analysis methods have been applied to investigate neural oscillation patterns under different stimulation parameters.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Under PRF, 500 Hz and 1 kHz TUS, high-amplitude LFP activity with the auto-rhythmic pattern appeared in selected nuclei when I&lt;sub&gt;SPTA&lt;/sub&gt; exceeded 12 mW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. With TFA, high-frequency energy (slow gamma and high gamma) was significantly increased during the auto-rhythmic patterns. We observed an initial plateau in nuclei response when I&lt;sub&gt;SPTA&lt;/sub&gt; reached 16.4 mW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for RPF 500 Hz and 20.8 mW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for RPF 1 kHz. The number of responding nuclei started decreasing while I&lt;sub&gt;SPTA&lt;/sub&gt; continued increasing. Under 1.5 kHz TUS, no auto-rhythmic patterns have been observed, but slow frequency power was increased during TUS. TUS inhibited most of the frequency band and generated obvious slow waves (theta and delta band) when stimulated at RPF = 1.5 kHz, I&lt;sub&gt;SPTA&lt;/sub&gt; = 8.8 mW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These results demonstrate that very low intensity Transcranial Ultrasound Stimulation (VLTUS) exerts significant neuromodulator effects under specific parameters in rat models and may be a valid tool to study neuronal physiology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Both groups received 15 min of mind-motor training followed by 45 min of either HIIT or MCT. Participants exercised in total 60 min/day, 3 days/week for 6 months. We assessed changes in global cognitive functioning (GCF), Trail-Making Test (TMT), systolic and diastolic BP, and cardiorespiratory fitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Participants in both groups improved diastolic BP [F&lt;sub&gt;(1, 87.32)&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.392, p = 0.039], with greatest effect within the HIIT group [estimated mean change (95% CI): −2.64 mmHg, (−4.79 to −0.48), p = 0.017], but no between-group differences were noted (p = 0.17). Both groups also improved cardiorespiratory fitness [F&lt;sub&gt;(1, 69)&lt;/sub&gt; = 34.795, p &amp;lt; 0.001], and TMT A [F&lt;sub&gt;(1, 81.51)&lt;/sub&gt; = 26.871, p &amp;lt; 0.001] and B [F&lt;sub&gt;(1, 79.49)&lt;/sub&gt; = 23.107, p &amp;lt; 0.001]. There were, however, no within- or between-group differences in GCF and systolic BP at follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Despite improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness, exercise of high- or moderate-intensity, combined with mind-motor training, did not improve GCF or systolic BP in individuals with hypertension and SCD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration:ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03545958).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;There is growing evidence that testosterone may be implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We aimed to examine the relationship between plasma total testosterone levels and change in brain glucose metabolism over time among non-demented older people.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The association of plasma total testosterone levels with change in brain glucose metabolism among non-demented older people was investigated cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Given a significant difference in levels of plasma total testosterone between gender, we performed our analysis in a sex-stratified way. At baseline, 228 non-demented older people were included: 152 males and 76 females.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;In the cross-sectional analysis, no significant relationship between plasma total testosterone levels and brain glucose metabolism was found in males or females. In the longitudinal analysis, we found a significant association of plasma total testosterone levels with change in brain glucose metabolism over time in males, but not in females. More specifically, in males, higher levels of total testosterone in plasma at baseline were associated with slower decline in brain glucose metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;We found that higher levels of total testosterone in plasma at baseline were associated with slower decline in brain glucose metabolism in males without dementia, indicating that testosterone may have beneficial effects on brain function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: CX3CR1 mutation alters synaptic and astrocytic protein expression, topographic gradients, and response latencies in the auditory brainstem</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25150?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Mice lacking the microglial receptor CX3CR1 display several phenotypes in the auditory brainstem. They have normal pruning in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) and increased expression of mature astrocyte markers. They have normal auditory brainstem recording (ABR) thresholds, but the ABR latencies are decreased. They show increased expression of inhibitory presynaptic terminal markers, possibly reflecting impaired inhibitory pruning. Finally, CX3CR1−/− mice lack the tonotopic gradients seen for cell body size and calyx of Held size in the MNTB.







Abstract
The precise and specialized circuitry in the auditory brainstem develops through adaptations of cellular and molecular signaling. We previously showed that elimination of microglia during development impairs synaptic pruning that leads to maturation of the calyx of Held, a large encapsulating synapse that terminates on neurons of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). Microglia depletion also led to a decrease in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker for mature astrocytes. Here, we investigated the role of signaling through the fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1), which is expressed by microglia and mediates communication with neurons. CX3CR1−/− and wild‐type mice were studied before and after hearing onset and at 9 weeks of age. Levels of GFAP were significantly increased in the MNTB in mutants at 9 weeks. Pruning was unaffected at the calyx of Held, but we found an increase in expression of glycinergic synaptic marker in mutant mice at P14, suggesting an effect on maturation of inhibitory inputs. We observed disrupted tonotopic gradients of neuron and calyx size in MNTB in mutant mice. Auditory brainstem recording (ABR) revealed that CX3CR1−/− mice had normal thresholds and amplitudes but decreased latencies and interpeak latencies, particularly for the highest frequencies. These results demonstrate that disruption of fractalkine signaling has a significant effect on auditory brainstem development. Our findings highlight the importance of neuron–microglia–astrocyte communication in pruning of inhibitory synapses and establishment of tonotopic gradients early in postnatal development.</content:encoded>

Voltage imaging enables monitoring neural activity at sub-millisecond and sub-cellular scale, unlocking the study of subthreshold activity, synchrony, and network dynamics with unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution. However, high data rates (&amp;gt;800MB/s) and low signal-to-noise ratios create bottlenecks for analyzing such datasets. Here we present &lt;i&gt;VolPy&lt;/i&gt;, an automated and scalable pipeline to pre-process voltage imaging datasets. &lt;i&gt;VolPy&lt;/i&gt; features motion correction, memory mapping, automated segmentation, denoising and spike extraction, all built on a highly parallelizable, modular, and extensible framework optimized for memory and speed. To aid automated segmentation, we introduce a corpus of 24 manually annotated datasets from different preparations, brain areas and voltage indicators. We benchmark &lt;i&gt;VolPy&lt;/i&gt; against ground truth segmentation, simulations and electrophysiology recordings, and we compare its performance with existing algorithms in detecting spikes. Our results indicate that &lt;i&gt;VolPy&lt;/i&gt;’s performance in spike extraction and scalability are state-of-the-art.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/owh1qdr10M0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Differential contributions of synaptic and intrinsic inhibitory currents to speech segmentation via flexible phase-locking in neural oscillators</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/xayrvjSozD8/article</link>

Current hypotheses suggest that speech segmentation—the initial division and grouping of the speech stream into candidate phrases, syllables, and phonemes for further linguistic processing—is executed by a hierarchy of oscillators in auditory cortex. Theta (∼3-12 Hz) rhythms play a key role by phase-locking to recurring acoustic features marking syllable boundaries. Reliable synchronization to quasi-rhythmic inputs, whose variable frequency can dip below cortical theta frequencies (down to ∼1 Hz), requires “flexible” theta oscillators whose underlying neuronal mechanisms remain unknown. Using biophysical computational models, we found that the flexibility of phase-locking in neural oscillators depended on the types of hyperpolarizing currents that paced them. Simulated cortical theta oscillators flexibly phase-locked to slow inputs when these inputs caused both (i) spiking and (ii) the subsequent buildup of outward current sufficient to delay further spiking until the next input. The greatest flexibility in phase-locking arose from a synergistic interaction between intrinsic currents that was not replicated by synaptic currents at similar timescales. Flexibility in phase-locking enabled improved entrainment to speech input, optimal at mid-vocalic channels, which in turn supported syllabic-timescale segmentation through identification of vocalic nuclei. Our results suggest that synaptic and intrinsic inhibition contribute to frequency-restricted and -flexible phase-locking in neural oscillators, respectively. Their differential deployment may enable neural oscillators to play diverse roles, from reliable internal clocking to adaptive segmentation of quasi-regular sensory inputs like speech.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xayrvjSozD8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Abnormal Intrinsic Functional Interactions Within Pain Network in Cervical Discogenic Pain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.671280</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cervical discogenic pain (CDP) is mainly induced by cervical disc degeneration. However, how CDP modulates the functional interactions within the pain network remains unclear. In the current study, we studied the changed resting-state functional connectivities of pain network with 40 CDP patients and 40 age-, gender-matched healthy controls. We first defined the pain network with the seeds of the posterior insula (PI). Then, whole brain and seed-to-target functional connectivity analyses were performed to identify the differences in functional connectivity between CDP and healthy controls. Finally, correlation analyses were applied to reveal the associations between functional connectivities and clinical measures. Whole-brain functional connectivity analyses of PI identified increased functional connectivity between PI and thalamus (THA) and decreased functional connectivity between PI and middle cingulate cortex (MCC) in CDP patients. Functional connectivity analyses within the pain network further revealed increased functional connectivities between bilateral PI and bilateral THA, and decreased functional connectivities between left PI and MCC, between left postcentral gyrus (PoCG) and MCC in CDP patients. Moreover, we found that the functional connectivities between right PI and left THA, between left PoCG and MCC were negatively and positively correlated with the visual analog scale, respectively. Our findings provide direct evidence of how CDP modulates the pain network, which may facilitate understanding of the neural basis of CDP.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Effect of Low Intensity Transcranial Ultrasound Stimulation on Neuromodulation in Animals and Humans: An Updated Systematic Review</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.620863</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Although low-intensity transcranial ultrasound stimulation (LI-TUS) has received more recognition for its neuromodulation potential, there remains a crucial knowledge gap regarding the neuromodulatory effects of LI-TUS and its potential for translation as a therapeutic tool in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: In this review, we summarized the findings reported by recently published studies regarding the effect of LI-TUS on neuromodulation in both animals and humans. We also aim to identify challenges and opportunities for the translation process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A literature search of PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, and Web of Science was performed from January 2019 to June 2020 with the following keywords and Boolean operators: [transcranial ultrasound OR transcranial focused ultrasound OR ultrasound stimulation] AND [neuromodulation]. The methodological quality of the animal studies was assessed by the SYRCLE's risk of bias tool, and the quality of human studies was evaluated by the PEDro score and the NIH quality assessment tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 26 manuscripts (24 animal studies and two human studies) out of 508 reports were included in this systematic review. Although both inhibitory (10 studies) and excitatory (16 studies) effects of LI-TUS were observed in animal studies, only inhibitory effects have been reported in primates (five studies) and human subjects (two studies). The ultrasonic parameters used in animal and human studies are different. The SYRCLE quality score ranged from 25 to 43%, with a majority of the low scores related to performance and detection bias. The two human studies received high PEDro scores (9/10).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: LI-TUS appears to be capable of targeting both superficial and deep cerebral structures to modulate cognitive or motor behavior in both animals and humans. Further human studies are needed to more precisely define the effective modulation parameters and thereby translate this brain modulatory tool into the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Spatial-Temporal Functional Mapping Combined With Cortico-Cortical Evoked Potentials in Predicting Cortical Stimulation Results</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.661976</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Functional human brain mapping is commonly performed during invasive monitoring with intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) electrodes prior to resective surgery for drug­ resistant epilepsy. The current gold standard, electrocortical stimulation mapping (ESM), is time ­consuming, sometimes elicits pain, and often induces after discharges or seizures. Moreover, there is a risk of overestimating eloquent areas due to propagation of the effects of stimulation to a broader network of language cortex. Passive iEEG spatial-temporal functional mapping (STFM) has recently emerged as a potential alternative to ESM. However, investigators have observed less correspondence between STFM and ESM maps of language than between their maps of motor function. We hypothesized that incongruities between ESM and STFM of language function may arise due to propagation of the effects of ESM to cortical areas having strong effective connectivity with the site of stimulation. We evaluated five patients who underwent invasive monitoring for seizure localization, whose language areas were identified using ESM. All patients performed a battery of language tasks during passive iEEG recordings. To estimate the effective connectivity of stimulation sites with a broader network of task-activated cortical sites, we measured cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) elicited across all recording sites by single-pulse electrical stimulation at sites where ESM was performed at other times. With the combination of high gamma power as well as CCEPs results, we trained a logistic regression model to predict ESM results at individual electrode pairs. The average accuracy of the classifier using both STFM and CCEPs results combined was 87.7%, significantly higher than the one using STFM alone (71.8%), indicating that the correspondence between STFM and ESM results is greater when effective connectivity between ESM stimulation sites and task-activated sites is taken into consideration. These findings, though based on a small number of subjects to date, provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that incongruities between ESM and STFM may arise in part from propagation of stimulation effects to a broader network of cortical language sites activated by language tasks, and suggest that more studies, with larger numbers of patients, are needed to understand the utility of both mapping techniques in clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This paper proposed a novel tactile-stimuli P300 paradigm for Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), which potentially targeted at people with less learning ability or difficulty in maintaining attention. The new paradigm using only two types of stimuli was designed, and different targets were distinguished by frequency and spatial information. The classification algorithm was developed by introducing filters for frequency bands selection and conducting optimization with common spatial pattern (CSP) on the tactile evoked EEG signals. It features a combination of spatial and frequency information, with the spatial information distinguishing the sites of stimuli and frequency information identifying target stimuli and disturbances. We investigated both electrical stimuli and vibration stimuli, in which only one target site was stimulated in each block. The results demonstrated an average accuracy of 94.88% for electrical stimuli and 95.21% for vibration stimuli, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Magnetoencephalography Responses to Unpredictable and Predictable Rare Somatosensory Stimuli in Healthy Adult Humans</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.641273</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mismatch brain responses to unpredicted rare stimuli are suggested to be a neural indicator of prediction error, but this has rarely been studied in the somatosensory modality. Here, we investigated how the brain responds to unpredictable and predictable rare events. Magnetoencephalography responses were measured in adults frequently presented with somatosensory stimuli (FRE) that were occasionally replaced by two consecutively presented rare stimuli [unpredictable rare stimulus (UR) and predictable rare stimulus (PR); p = 0.1 for each]. The FRE and PR were electrical stimulations administered to either the little finger or the forefinger in a counterbalanced manner between the two conditions. The UR was a simultaneous electrical stimulation to both the forefinger and the little finger (for a smaller subgroup, the UR and FRE were counterbalanced for the stimulus properties). The grand-averaged responses were characterized by two main components: one at 30–100 ms (M55) and the other at 130–230 ms (M150) latency. Source-level analysis was conducted for the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) and the secondary somatosensory cortex (SII). The M55 responses were larger for the UR and PR than for the FRE in both the SI and the SII areas and were larger for the UR than for the PR. For M150, both investigated areas showed increased activity for the UR and the PR compared to the FRE. Interestingly, although the UR was larger in stimulus energy (stimulation of two fingers at the same time) and had a larger prediction error potential than the PR, the M150 responses to these two rare stimuli did not differ in source strength in either the SI or the SII area. The results suggest that M55, but not M150, can possibly be associated with prediction error signals. These findings highlight the need for disentangling prediction error and rareness-related effects in future studies investigating prediction error signals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Objectives&lt;p&gt;Working memory is essential for daily life skills like reading comprehension, reasoning, and problem-solving. Healthy aging of the brain goes along with working memory decline that can affect older people’s independence in everyday life. Interventions in the form of cognitive training are a promising tool for delaying age-related working memory decline, yet the underlying structural plasticity of white matter is hardly studied.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We conducted a longitudinal diffusion tensor imaging study to investigate the effects of an intensive four-week adaptive working memory training on white matter integrity quantified by global and tract-wise mean diffusivity. We compared diffusivity measures of fiber tracts that are associated with working memory of 32 young and 20 older participants that were randomly assigned to a working memory training group or an active control group.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The behavioral analysis showed an increase in working memory performance after the four-week adaptive working memory training. The neuroanatomical analysis revealed a decrease in mean diffusivity in the working memory training group after the training intervention in the right inferior longitudinal fasciculus for the older adults. There was also a decrease in mean diffusivity in the working memory training group in the right superior longitudinal fasciculus for the older and young participants after the intervention.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This study shows that older people can benefit from working memory training by improving their working memory performance that is also reflected in terms of improved white matter integrity in the superior longitudinal fasciculus and the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, where the first is an essential component of the frontoparietal network known to be essential in working memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: A Computational Framework for Controlling the Self-Restorative Brain Based on the Free Energy and Degeneracy Principles</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.590019</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The brain is a non-linear dynamical system with a self-restoration process, which protects itself from external damage but is often a bottleneck for clinical treatment. To treat the brain to induce the desired functionality, formulation of a self-restoration process is necessary for optimal brain control. This study proposes a computational model for the brain's self-restoration process following the free-energy and degeneracy principles. Based on this model, a computational framework for brain control is established. We posited that the pre-treatment brain circuit has long been configured in response to the environmental (the other neural populations') demands on the circuit. Since the demands persist even after treatment, the treated circuit's response to the demand may gradually approximate the pre-treatment functionality. In this framework, an energy landscape of regional activities, estimated from resting-state endogenous activities by a pairwise maximum entropy model, is used to represent the pre-treatment functionality. The approximation of the pre-treatment functionality occurs via reconfiguration of interactions among neural populations within the treated circuit. To establish the current framework's construct validity, we conducted various simulations. The simulations suggested that brain control should include the self-restoration process, without which the treatment was not optimal. We also presented simulations for optimizing repetitive treatments and optimal timing of the treatment. These results suggest a plausibility of the current framework in controlling the non-linear dynamical brain with a self-restoration process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.643230</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The CA1, an important subregion of the hippocampus, is anatomically and functionally heterogeneous in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus. Here, to dissect the distinctions between the dorsal (dCA1) and ventral CA1 (vCA1) in anatomical connections, we systematically analyzed the direct inputs to dCA1 and vCA1 projection neurons (PNs) with the rabies virus-mediated retrograde trans-monosynaptic tracing system in Thy1-Cre mice. Our mapping results revealed that the input proportions and distributions of dCA1 and vCA1 PNs varied significantly. Inside the hippocampal region, dCA1 and vCA1 PNs shared the same upstream brain regions, but with distinctive distribution patterns along the rostrocaudal axis. The intrahippocampal inputs to the dCA1 and vCA1 exhibited opposite trends, decreasing and increasing gradually along the dorsoventral axis, respectively. For extrahippocampal inputs, dCA1 and vCA1 shared some monosynaptic projections from certain regions such as pallidum, striatum, hypothalamus, and thalamus. However, vCA1, not dCA1, received innervations from the subregions of olfactory areas and amygdala nuclei. Characterization of the direct input networks of dCA1 and vCA1 PNs may provide a structural basis to understand the differential functions of dCA1 and vCA1.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Single-Cell Multiomic Approaches Reveal Diverse Labeling of the Nervous System by Common Cre-Drivers</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.648570</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural crest development involves a series of dynamic, carefully coordinated events that result in human disease when not properly orchestrated. Cranial neural crest cells acquire unique multipotent developmental potential upon specification to generate a broad variety of cell types. Studies of early mammalian neural crest and nervous system development often use the Cre-loxP system to lineage trace and mark cells for further investigation. Here, we carefully profile the activity of two common neural crest Cre-drivers at the end of neurulation in mice. RNA sequencing of labeled cells at E9.5 reveals that Wnt1-Cre2 marks cells with neuronal characteristics consistent with neuroepithelial expression, whereas Sox10-Cre predominantly labels the migratory neural crest. We used single-cell mRNA and single-cell ATAC sequencing to profile the expression of Wnt1 and Sox10 and identify transcription factors that may regulate the expression of Wnt1-Cre2 in the neuroepithelium and Sox10-Cre in the migratory neural crest. Our data identify cellular heterogeneity during cranial neural crest development and identify specific populations labeled by two Cre-drivers in the developing nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Oral-Gut-Brain AXIS: The Influence of Microbes in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.633735</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most frequently diagnosed neurodegenerative disorders worldwide and poses a major challenge for both affected individuals and their caregivers. AD is a progressive neurological disorder associated with high rates of brain atrophy. Despite its durable influence on human health, understanding AD has been complicated by its enigmatic and multifactorial nature. Neurofibrillary tangles and the deposition of amyloid-beta (Aβ) protein are typical pathological features and fundamental causes of cognitive impairment in AD patients. Dysbiosis of oral and gut microbiota has been reported to induce and accelerate the formation of Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. For instance, some oral microbes can spread to the brain through cranial nerves or cellular infections, which has been suggested to increase the risk of developing AD. Importantly, the interaction between intestinal microbiota and brain cells has been recognized as influencing the development of AD as well as other neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, the metabolites produced by certain intestinal microorganisms can affect the activity of microglia and further mediate neuroinflammation, which is a leading cause of neuronal necrosis and AD pathogenesis. Which pathogens and associated pathways are involved in the development and progression of AD remains to be elucidated; however, it is well-known that gut microbiota and their metabolites can affect the brain by both direct and indirect means. Understanding the specific mechanisms involved in the interaction between these pathogens and the nervous system is vital for the early intervention in AD. In this review, we aim to comprehensively discuss the possible mechanistic pathways underlying the oral-brain, the gut-brain and the oral-gut-brain associations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.628908</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Stem cell transplantation offers promise in the treatment of ischemic stroke. Here we utilized systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression to study the biological effect of stem cell treatments in animal models of ischemic stroke. A total of 98 eligible publications were included by searching PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science from inception to August 1, 2020. There are about 141 comparisons, involving 5,200 animals, that examined the effect of stem cell transplantation on neurological function and infarct volume as primary outcome measures in animal models for stroke. Stem cell-based therapy can improve both neurological function (effect size, −3.37; 95% confidence interval, −3.83 to −2.90) and infarct volume (effect size, −11.37; 95% confidence interval, −12.89 to −9.85) compared with controls. These results suggest that stem cell therapy could improve neurological function deficits and infarct volume, exerting potential neuroprotective effect for experimental ischemic stroke, but further clinical studies are still needed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Myelin Repair: From Animal Models to Humans</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.604865</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It is widely thought that brain repair does not occur, but myelin regeneration provides clear evidence to the contrary. Spontaneous remyelination may occur after injury or in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the efficiency of remyelination varies considerably between MS patients and between the lesions of each patient. Myelin repair is essential for optimal functional recovery, so a profound understanding of the cells and mechanisms involved in this process is required for the development of new therapeutic strategies. In this review, we describe how animal models and modern cell tracing and imaging methods have helped to identify the cell types involved in myelin regeneration. In addition to the oligodendrocyte progenitor cells identified in the 1990s as the principal source of remyelinating cells in the central nervous system (CNS), other cell populations, including subventricular zone-derived neural progenitors, Schwann cells, and even spared mature oligodendrocytes, have more recently emerged as potential contributors to CNS remyelination. We will also highlight the conditions known to limit endogenous repair, such as aging, chronic inflammation, and the production of extracellular matrix proteins, and the role of astrocytes and microglia in these processes. Finally, we will present the discrepancies between observations in humans and in rodents, discussing the relationship of findings in experimental models to myelin repair in humans. These considerations are particularly important from a therapeutic standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Exercise Training-Increased FBXO32 and FOXO1 in a Gender-Dependent Manner in Mild Cognitively Impaired African Americans: GEMS-1 Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.641758</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) and FOXOs transcription factors play a pivotal role in cellular clearance and minimizing the accumulation of Aβ in neurodegeneration (ND). In African Americans (AAs) with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the role of components of UPS and FOXOs; and whether they are amenable to exercise effects is unknown. We hypothesized that exercise can enhance cellular clearance systems during aging and ND by increasing expressions of FBXO32 and FOXO1. To test this hypothesis, we used TaqMan gene expression analysis in peripheral blood (PB) to investigate the component of UPS and FOXOs; and provide mechanistic insight at baseline, during exercise, and in both genders. At baseline, levels of FBXO32 were higher in women than in men. In our attempt to discern gender-specific exercise-related changes, we observed that levels of FBXO32 increased in men but not in women. Similarly, levels of FOXO1 increased in men only. These data suggest that a graded dose of FBXO32 and FOXO1 may be beneficial when PB cells carrying FBXO32 and FOXO1 summon into the brain in response to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) perturbation (docking station PB cells). Our observation is consistent with emerging studies that exercise allows the trafficking of blood factors. Given the significance of FBXO32 and FOXO1 to ND and associated muscle integrity, our findings may explain, at least in part, the benefits of exercise on memory, associated gait, and balance perturbation acknowledged to herald the emergence of MCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Investigating Neuroimaging Correlates of Early Frailty in Patients With Behavioral Variant Frontotemporal Dementia: A MRI and FDG-PET Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.637796</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Frailty is a dynamic clinical condition characterized by the reduction of interconnections among different psychobiological domains, which leads to a homeostatic vulnerability. The association between physical frailty and cognitive dysfunctions is a possible predictor of poor prognosis in patients with neurodegenerative disorders. However, this construct has not been fully analyzed by a multidimensional neuropsychogeriatric assessment matched with multimodal neuroimaging methods in patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). We have investigated cognitive dysfunctions and frailty status, assessed by both a neuropsychological evaluation and the Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI), in a sample of 18 bvFTD patients and compared to matched healthy controls. Gray matter (GM) volume (as assessed by voxel-based morphometry) and metabolism (on &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography) were first separately compared between groups, then voxelwise compared and correlated to each other within patients. Linear regression of the MPI was performed on those voxels presenting a significant correlation between altered GM volume and metabolism. The neuropsychological assessment reflected the diagnoses and the functional–anatomical alterations documented by neuroimaging analyses. In particular, the majority of patients presented significant executive dysfunction and mood changes in terms of apathy, depression, and anxiety. In the overall MPI score, the patients fell in the lower range (indicating an early frailty status). On imaging, they exhibited a bilateral decrease of GM density and hypometabolism involving the frontal pole, the anterior opercular region, and the anterior cingulate cortex. Greater atrophy than hypometabolism was observed in the bilateral orbitofrontal cortex, the triangular part of the inferior frontal gyrus, and the ventral striatum, whereas the contrary was detected in the bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and pre-supplementary motor area. MPI scores significantly correlated only with the co-occurrence of a decrease of GM density and hypometabolism in the right anterior insular cortex, but not with the separate pathological phenomena. Our results show a correlation between a specific pattern of co-occurring GM atrophy and hypometabolism with early frailty in bvFTD patients. These aspects, combined with executive dysfunction and mood changes, may lead to an increased risk of poor prognosis, highlighting a potentially critical and precocious role of the insula in the pathogenesis of frailty.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Nomogram to Predict Cognitive Dysfunction After a Minor Ischemic Stroke in Hospitalized-Population</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.637363</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An easily scoring system to predict the risk of cognitive impairment after minor ischemic stroke has not been available. We aimed to develop and externally validate a nomogram for predicting the probability of post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) among hospitalized population with minor stroke. Moreover, the association of Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) with PSCI is also investigated. We prospectively conducted a developed cohort on collected data in stroke center from June 2017 to February 2018, as well as an external validation cohort between June 2018 and February 2019. The main outcome is cognitive impairment defined as &amp;lt;22 Montreal Cognition Assessment (MoCA) score points 6 – 12 months following a minor stroke onset. Based on multivariate logistic models, the nomogram model was generated. Plasma TMAO levels were assessed at admission using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 228 participants completed the follow-up data for generating the nomogram. After multivariate logistic regression, seven variables remained independent predictors of PSCI to compose the nomogram included age, female, Fazekas score, educational level, number of intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS), HbA1c, and cortical infarction. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUC-ROC) curve of model was 0.829, C index was good (0.810), and the AUC-ROC of the model applied in validation cohort was 0.812. Plasma TMAO levels were higher in patients with cognitive impairment than in them without cognitive dysfunction (median 4.56 vs. 3.22 μmol/L; p ≤ 0.001). In conclusion, this scoring system is the first nomogram developed and validated in a stroke center cohort for individualized prediction of cognitive impairment after minor stroke. Higher plasma TMAO level at admission suggests a potential marker of PSCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Iron Deposition Characteristics of Deep Gray Matter in Elderly Individuals in the Community Revealed by Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping and Multiple Factor Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.611891</link>
	<content:encoded>Purpose&lt;p&gt;The objective of this study was to determine which factors influence brain iron concentrations in deep gray matter in elderly individuals and how these factors influence regional brain iron concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A total of 105 elderly individuals were enrolled in this study. All participants underwent detailed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations from October 2018 to August 2019. Among them, 44 individuals had undergone a previous MRI examination from July 2010 to August 2011. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) was utilized as an indirect quantitative marker of brain iron, and the susceptibility values of deep gray matter structures were obtained. Univariate analysis and multiple linear regression analysis were used to investigate 11 possible determinants for cerebral iron deposition.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Our results showed no sex- or hemisphere-related differences in susceptibility values in any of the regions studied. Aging was significantly correlated with increased insusceptibility values in almost all analyzed brain regions (except for the thalamus) when we compared the susceptibility values at the two time points. In a cross-sectional analysis, the relationship between gray matter nucleus susceptibility values and age was conducted using Pearson’s linear regression. Aging was significantly correlated with the susceptibility values of the globus pallidus (GP), putamen (Put), and caudate nucleus (CN), with the Put having the strongest correlations. In multiple linear regression models, associations with increased susceptibility values were found in the CN, Put, red nucleus, and dentate nucleus for individuals with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the patients with hypertension showed significantly reduced susceptibility values in the red nucleus and dentate nucleus. Our data suggested that smokers had increased susceptibility values in the thalamus. No significant associations were found for individuals with a history of hypercholesterolemia and Apolipoprotein E4 carrier status.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our data revealed that aging, T2DM, and smoking could increase iron deposition in some deep gray matter structures. However, hypertension had the opposite effects in the red nuclei and dentate nuclei. Brain iron metabolism could be influenced by many factors in different modes. In future studies, we should strictly control for confounding factors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Modulation of stimulated dopamine release in rat nucleus accumbens shell by GABA in vitro: Effect of sub‐chronic phencyclidine pretreatment</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24843?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Using fast‐scan cyclic voltammetry in rat brain slices in vitro, we showed an attenuation of electrically‐stimulated dopamine release by agonists at both GABA‐A (muscimol) and GABA‐B (baclofen) receptors. The attenuation by the baclofen was abolished in slices from animals pretreated with phencyclidine, modelling schizophrenia. 

Abstract
Dopamine signaling in nucleus accumbens (NAc) is modulated by γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA), acting through GABA‐A and GABA‐B receptors: dysregulation of GABAergic control of dopamine function may be important in behavioral deficits in schizophrenia. We investigated the effect of GABA‐A (muscimol) and GABA‐B (baclofen) receptor agonists on electrically stimulated dopamine release. Furthermore, we explored whether drug‐induced changes were disrupted by pretreatment with phencyclidine, which provides a well‐validated model of schizophrenia. Using brain slices from female rats, fast‐scan cyclic voltammetry was used to measure electrically stimulated dopamine release in NAc shell. Both muscimol and baclofen caused concentration‐dependent attenuation of evoked dopamine release: neither effect was changed by dihydro‐β‐erythroidine, a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, or the α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)‐type glutamate receptor antagonist, 6‐cyano‐7‐nitroquinoxaline‐2,3‐dione (CNQX), precluding indirect mechanisms using these transmitter systems in the GABAergic actions. In slices taken from rats pretreated with phencyclidine, the attenuation of evoked dopamine release by baclofen was abolished, but the attenuation by muscimol was unaffected. Since phencyclidine pretreatment was followed by drug‐free washout period of at least a week, the drug was not present during recording. Therefore, disruption of GABA‐B modulation of dopamine is due to long‐term functional changes resulting from the treatment, rather than transient changes due to the drug's presence at test. This enduring dysregulation of GABA‐B modulation of accumbal dopamine release provides a plausible mechanism through which GABA dysfunction influences accumbal dopamine leading to behavioral changes seen in schizophrenia and may provide a route for novel therapeutic strategies to treat the condition.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Neurocognitive processing efficiency for discriminating human non-alarm rather than alarm scream calls</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/yAAgcDOmmTs/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Sascha Frühholz, Joris Dietziker, Matthias Staib, Wiebke Trost&lt;/p&gt;

Across many species, scream calls signal the affective significance of events to other agents. Scream calls were often thought to be of generic alarming and fearful nature, to signal potential threats, with instantaneous, involuntary, and accurate recognition by perceivers. However, scream calls are more diverse in their affective signaling nature than being limited to fearfully alarming a threat, and thus the broader sociobiological relevance of various scream types is unclear. Here we used 4 different psychoacoustic, perceptual decision-making, and neuroimaging experiments in humans to demonstrate the existence of at least 6 psychoacoustically distinctive types of scream calls of both alarming and non-alarming nature, rather than there being only screams caused by fear or aggression. Second, based on perceptual and processing sensitivity measures for decision-making during scream recognition, we found that alarm screams (with some exceptions) were overall discriminated the worst, were responded to the slowest, and were associated with a lower perceptual sensitivity for their recognition compared with non-alarm screams. Third, the neural processing of alarm compared with non-alarm screams during an implicit processing task elicited only minimal neural signal and connectivity in perceivers, contrary to the frequent assumption of a threat processing bias of the primate neural system. These findings show that scream calls are more diverse in their signaling and communicative nature in humans than previously assumed, and, in contrast to a commonly observed threat processing bias in perceptual discriminations and neural processes, we found that especially non-alarm screams, and positive screams in particular, seem to have higher efficiency in speeded discriminations and the implicit neural processing of various scream types in humans.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/yAAgcDOmmTs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Unravelling the Neural Basis of Spatial Delusions After Stroke</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26079?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Knowing explicitly where we are is an interpretation of our spatial representations. Reduplicative paramnesia is a disrupting syndrome in which patients present a firm belief of spatial mislocation. Here, we studied the largest sample of patients with delusional misidentifications of space (ie, reduplicative paramnesia) after stroke to shed light on their neurobiology.


Methods
In a prospective, cumulative, case‐control study, we screened 400 patients with acute right‐hemispheric stroke. We included 64 cases and 233 controls. First, lesions were delimited and normalized. Then, we computed structural and functional disconnection maps using methods of lesion‐track and network‐mapping. The maps were compared, controlling for confounders. Second, we built a multivariate logistic model, including clinical, behavioral, and neuroimaging data. Finally, we performed a nested cross‐validation of the model with a support‐vector machine analysis.


Results
The most frequent misidentification subtype was confabulatory mislocation (56%), followed by place reduplication (19%), and chimeric assimilation (13%). Our results indicate that structural disconnection is the strongest predictor of the syndrome and included 2 distinct streams, connecting right fronto‐thalamic and right occipitotemporal structures. In the multivariate model, the independent predictors of reduplicative paramnesia were the structural disconnection map, lesion sparing of right dorsal fronto‐parietal regions, age, and anosognosia. Good discrimination accuracy was demonstrated (area under the curve = 0.80 [0.75–0.85]).


Interpretation
Our results localize the anatomic circuits that may have a role in the abnormal spatial‐emotional binding and in the defective updating of spatial representations underlying reduplicative paramnesia. This novel data may contribute to better understand the pathophysiology of delusional syndromes after stroke. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Effects of the combination therapy of electric field stimulation and polyethylene glycol in the ex vivo spinal cord of female rats after compression</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24839?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>In the present study, the effects of electrical field stimulation (EFS) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) were determined in the compression model of ex vivo spinal cords by using a double sucrose gap recording chamber (DSGRC). The effects of the combination therapy are better than those of the individual treatments of PEG and EFS. The methods of establishing ex vivo spinal cord compression model in the DSGRC can be useful in the fundamental and the clinical applications of the spinal cord injury in future.

Abstract
The application of electric field stimulation (EFS) can reduce the cation influx after spinal cord injury. However, regenerated cation influx and reestablished injury potential are observed after EFS. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is popular as an effective cell membrane fusion agent. This study aims to determine the effects of the combination therapy of EFS and PEG in the ex vivo spinal cord after compression. The ex vivo spinal cords of female rats with compression injury were incubated in a double sucrose gap recording chamber (DSGRC) and randomly divided into the following four groups: (1) compression group: compression only, (2) EFS group: EFS for 15 min, (3) PEG group: PEG treatment for 4 min, and (4) EFS + PEG group: EFS for 15 min and PEG treatment for 4 min. The hematoxylin–eosin staining was performed to measure the necrotic area of the spinal cords. The gap potential was detected, and the area under the curve of the gap potential was calculated. The intracellular cation concentration, membrane permeability, and compound action potential were measured and quantified. Results revealed no significant difference in the necrotic areas among different groups, and the compression model of the ex vivo spinal cord in the DSGRC had high consistency and stability. The combination therapy could attenuate cation inflow, promote cell membrane restoration, and promote the functional recovery of the spinal cord conduction after compression in ex vivo spinal cords.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Sex differences in synaptic plasticity underlying learning</title>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
Although sex differences in learning behaviors are well documented, sexual dimorphism in the synaptic processes of encoding is only recently appreciated. Studies in male rodents have built upon the discovery of long‐term potentiation (LTP), and acceptance of this activity‐dependent increase in synaptic strength as a mechanism of encoding, to identify synaptic receptors and signaling activities that coordinate the activity‐dependent remodeling of the subsynaptic actin cytoskeleton that is critical for enduring potentiation and memory. These molecular substrates together with other features of LTP, as characterized in males, have provided an explanation for a range of memory phenomena including multiple stages of consolidation, the efficacy of spaced training, and the location of engrams at the level of individual synapses. In the present report, we summarize these findings and describe more recent results from our laboratories showing that in females the same actin regulatory mechanisms are required for hippocampal LTP and memory but, in females only, the engagement of both modulatory receptors such as TrkB and synaptic signaling intermediaries including Src and ERK1/2 requires neuron‐derived estrogen and signaling through membrane‐associated estrogen receptor α (ERα). Moreover, in association with the additional ERα involvement, females exhibit a higher threshold for hippocampal LTP and spatial learning. We propose that the distinct LTP threshold in females contributes to as yet unappreciated sex differences in information processing and features of learning and memory.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Validation of Olfactory Network Based on Brain Structural Connectivity and Its Association With Olfactory Test Scores</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.638053</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Olfactory perception is a complicated process involving multiple cortical and subcortical regions, of which the underlying brain dynamics are still not adequately mapped. Even in the definition of the olfactory primary cortex, there is a large degree of variation in parcellation templates used for investigating olfaction in neuroimaging studies. This complicates comparison between human olfactory neuroimaging studies. The present study aims to validate an olfactory parcellation template derived from both functional and anatomical data that applies structural connectivity (SC) to ensure robust connectivity to key secondary olfactory regions. Furthermore, exploratory analyses investigate if different olfactory parameters are associated with differences in the strength of connectivity of this structural olfactory fingerprint. By combining diffusion data with an anatomical atlas and advanced probabilistic tractography, we found that the olfactory parcellation had a robust SC network to key secondary olfactory regions. Furthermore, the study indicates that higher ratings of olfactory significance were associated with increased intra- and inter-hemispheric SC of the primary olfactory cortex. Taken together, these results suggest that the patterns of SC between the primary olfactory cortex and key secondary olfactory regions has potential to be used for investigating the nature of olfactory significance, hence strengthening the theory that individual differences in olfactory behaviour are encoded in the structural network fingerprint of the olfactory cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Ocular Health of Octodon degus as a Clinical Marker for Age-Related and Age-Independent Neurodegeneration</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2021.665467</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The aging process and age-related diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), are very heterogeneous and multifactorial, making it challenging to diagnose the disease based solely on genetic, behavioral tests, or clinical history. It is yet to be explained what ophthalmological tests relate specifically to aging and AD. To this end, we have selected the common degu (Octodon degus) as a model for aging which develops AD-like signs to conduct ophthalmological screening methods that could be clinical markers of aging and AD. We investigated ocular health using ophthalmoscopy, fundus photography, intraocular pressure (IOP), and pupillary light reflex (PLR). The results showed significant presence of cataracts in adult degus and IOP was also found to increase significantly with advancing age. Age had a significant effect on the maximum pupil constriction but other pupil parameters changed in an age-independent manner (PIPR retention index, resting pupil size, constriction velocity, redilation plateau). We concluded that degus have underlying factors at play that regulate PLR and may be connected to sympathetic, parasympathetic, and melanopsin retinal ganglion cell (ipRGC) deterioration. This study provides the basis for the use of ocular tests as screening methods for the aging process and monitoring of neurodegeneration in non-invasive ways.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Optimized Parameters for Transducing the Locus Coeruleus Using Canine Adenovirus Type 2 (CAV2) Vector in Rats for Chemogenetic Modulation Research</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.663337</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction&lt;p&gt;The locus coeruleus noradrenergic (LC-NA) system is studied for its role in various neurological and psychiatric disorders such as epilepsy and Major Depression Dissorder. Chemogenetics is a powerful technique for specific manipulation of the LC to investigate its functioning. Local injection of AAV2/7 viral vectors has limitations with regards to efficiency and specificity of the transduction, potentially due to low tropism of AAV2/7 for LC neurons. In this study we used a canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV2) vector with different volumes and viral particle numbers to achieve high and selective expression of hM3Dq, an excitatory Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD), for chemogenetic modulation of LC neurons.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected in the LC with different absolute numbers of CAV2-PRSx8-hM3Dq-mCherry physical particles (0.1E9, 1E9, 5E9,10E9, or 20E9 pp) using different volumes (LowV = 3 nl × 300 nl, MediumV = 3 × 600 nl, HighV = 3 × 1200 nl). Two weeks post-injection, double-labeling immunohistochemistry for dopamine β hydroxylase (DBH) and mCherry was performed to determine hM3Dq expression and its specificity for LC neurons. The size of the transduced LC was compared to the contralateral LC to identify signs of toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Administration of Medium volume (3 × 600 nl) and 1E9 particles resulted in high expression levels with 87.3 ± 9.8% of LC neurons expressing hM3Dq, but low specificity with 36.2 ± 17.3% of hM3Dq expression in non-LC neurons. The most diluted conditions (Low volume_0.1E pp and Medium Volume_0.1E pp) presented similar high transduction of LC neurons (70.9 ± 12.7 and 77.2 ± 9.8%) with lower aspecificity (5.5 ± 3.5 and 4.0 ± 1.9%, respectively). Signs of toxicity were observed in all undiluted conditions as evidenced by a decreased size of the transduced LC.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This study identified optimal conditions (Low and Medium Volume with 0.1E9 particles of CAV2-PRSx8-hM3Dq-mCherry) for safe and specific transduction of LC neurons with excitatory DREADDs to study the role of the LC-NA system in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
