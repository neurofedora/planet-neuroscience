	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The Pathway Coexpression Network: Revealing pathway relationships</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/C39wpIQO--A/article</link>

A goal of genomics is to understand the relationships between biological processes. Pathways contribute to functional interplay within biological processes through complex but poorly understood interactions. However, limited functional references for global pathway relationships exist. Pathways from databases such as KEGG and Reactome provide discrete annotations of biological processes. Their relationships are currently either inferred from gene set enrichment within specific experiments, or by simple overlap, linking pathway annotations that have genes in common. Here, we provide a unifying interpretation of functional interaction between pathways by systematically quantifying coexpression between 1,330 canonical pathways from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) to establish the Pathway Coexpression Network (PCxN). We estimated the correlation between canonical pathways valid in a broad context using a curated collection of 3,207 microarrays from 72 normal human tissues. PCxN accounts for shared genes between annotations to estimate significant correlations between pathways with related functions rather than with similar annotations. We demonstrate that PCxN provides novel insight into mechanisms of complex diseases using an Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) case study. PCxN retrieved pathways significantly correlated with an expert curated AD gene list. These pathways have known associations with AD and were significantly enriched for genes independently associated with AD. As a further step, we show how PCxN complements the results of gene set enrichment methods by revealing relationships between enriched pathways, and by identifying additional highly correlated pathways. PCxN revealed that correlated pathways from an AD expression profiling study include functional clusters involved in cell adhesion and oxidative stress. PCxN provides expanded connections to pathways from the extracellular matrix. PCxN provides a powerful new framework for interrogation of global pathway relationships. Comprehensive exploration of PCxN can be performed at http://pcxn.org/.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/C39wpIQO--A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Studies using anatomical, electrophysiological, imaging and optogenetic approaches revealed that the CEA network consists of recurrent inhibitory circuits comprised of precisely connected functionally and genetically defined cell types that can select and control specific behavioral outputs [3,4,5&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;,6&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;,7–9,11,12]. While bivalent functionality of the CEA in adaptive behavior has been clearly demonstrated, we are just beginning to understand to which degree individual CEA circuit elements are functionally segregated or overlapping. Importantly, recent studies seem to suggest that optogenetic manipulations of the same, or overlapping cell populations can give rise to distinct, or sometimes even opposite, behavioral phenotypes [5&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;,6&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;,9–12]. In this review, we discuss recent progress in our understanding of how defined CEA circuits can control defensive and appetitive behaviors, and how seemingly contradictory results could point to an integrated concept of CEA function. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Publication date: June 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Guosong   Hong, Xiao   Yang, Tao   Zhou, Charles M   Lieber&lt;br /&gt; Existing implantable neurotechnologies for understanding the brain and treating neurological diseases have intrinsic properties that have limited their capability to achieve chronically-stable brain interfaces with single-neuron spatiotemporal resolution. These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to ‘look and behave’ like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Human neuroimaging studies consistently show a hunger-dependent, selective enhancement of responses to images of food in association cortex and amygdala. More recently, cellular-resolution imaging combined with circuit mapping experiments in behaving mice have revealed underlying neuronal population dynamics and enabled tracing of pathways by which hunger circuits influence the assignment of value to visual objects in visual association cortex, insular cortex, and amygdala. These experiments begin to provide a mechanistic understanding of motivation-specific neural processing of need-relevant cues in healthy humans and in disease states such as obesity and other eating disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Since the earliest days of embryology, lineage questions have been addressed with methods of increasing specificity, capacity, and resolution. Yet, a full realization of individual cell lineages remains challenging for complex systems. A recent explosion of technical advances in genome-editing and single-cell sequencing has enabled lineage analysis in an unprecedented scale, speed, and depth across different species. In this review, we discuss the application of available as well as future genetic labeling techniques for tracking neural lineages in vivo in the mammalian nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Safe propagation of action potentials relies on specific ion channel expression at strategic points of the axon such as nodes of Ranvier or axonal branch points. However, while action potentials are generally considered as the quantum of neuronal information, their signaling is not entirely digital. In fact, both their shape and their conduction speed have been shown to be modulated by activity, leading to regulations of synaptic latency and synaptic strength. We report here newly identified mechanisms of (1) safe spike propagation along the axon, (2) compartmentalization of action potential shape in the axon, (3) analog modulation of spike-evoked synaptic transmission and (4) alteration in conduction time after persistent regulation of axon morphology in central neurons. We discuss the contribution of these regulations in information processing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

This neural activity reflects internal processes by which the brain plans and executes volitional movements. The study of motor planning offers an opportunity to understand how the structure and dynamics of neural circuits support persistent internal states and how these states influence behavior. Recent advances in large-scale neural recordings are beginning to decipher the relationship of the dynamics of populations of neurons during motor planning and movements. New behavioral tasks in rodents, together with quantified perturbations, link dynamics in specific nodes of neural circuits to behavior. These studies reveal a neural network distributed across multiple brain regions that collectively supports motor planning. We review recent advances and highlight areas where further work is needed to achieve a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying motor planning and related cognitive processes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

To be effective, these systems must be able to simultaneously record and stimulate neural activity, a task made difficult by persistent stimulation artifacts that distort and obscure underlying biomarkers. To enable simultaneous stimulation and recording, several techniques have been proposed. These techniques involve artifact-preventing system configurations, resilient recording front-ends, and back-end signal processing for removing recorded artifacts. Co-designing and integrating these artifact cancellation techniques will be key to enabling neuromodulation systems to stimulate and record at the same time. Here, we review the state-of-the-art for these techniques and their role in achieving artifact-free neuromodulation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Microelectrode arrays based on complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, such as Neuropixels probes, look set to transform these methods. Neuropixels probes provide ∼1000 recording sites on an extremely narrow shank, with on-board amplification, digitization, and multiplexing. They deliver low-noise recordings from hundreds of neurons, providing a step change in the type of data available to neuroscientists. Here we discuss the opportunities afforded by these probes for large-scale electrophysiology, the challenges associated with data processing and anatomical localization, and avenues for further improvements of the technology. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

With vast cell number and diversity, mammalian nervous systems present a daunting challenge for achieving specific and comprehensive cell type access—prerequisite to circuit analysis. Genetic approaches in the mouse have relied on germline engineering to access marker-defined cell populations. Combinatorial strategies that engage marker intersection, anatomy and projection pattern (e.g. antero-grade and retro-grade viral vectors), and developmental lineage substantially increase the specificity of cell type targeting. While increasing number of mouse cell types are becoming experimentally accessible, comprehensive coverage requires larger coordinated efforts with strategic infrastructural and fiscal planning. CRISPR-based genome editing may enable cell type access in other species, but issues of time, cost and ethics remain, especially for primates. Novel approaches that bypass the germline, such as somatic cell engineering and cell surface-based gene delivery, may reduce the barrier of genetic access to mammalian cell types. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Despite extensive characterization of individual brain areas involved in parental care, we do not fully understand how discrete aspects of this behavior are orchestrated at the neural circuit level. Recent progress in identifying genetically specified neuronal populations critical for parenting, and the use of genetic and viral tools for circuit-cracking now allow us to deconstruct the underlying circuitry and, thus, to elucidate how different aspects of parental care are controlled. Here we review the latest advances, outline possible organizational principles of parental circuits and discuss future challenges. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Autocrine signals have been discovered in many neuronal contexts, providing insights into their regulation and function. The growing realization of the importance of cell-autonomous signaling stems from advances in both conditional genetic approaches and in sophisticated analyses of growth factor dynamics, which combine to enable rigorous in vivo dissection of signaling pathways. Here we review recent studies defining autocrine roles for growth factors such as BDNF, and classical morphogens, including Wnts and BMPs, in regulating neuronal development and plasticity. Collectively, these studies highlight an intimate relationship between activity-dependent autocrine signaling and synaptic plasticity, and further suggest a common principle for coordinating paracrine and autocrine signaling in the nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

When synaptic vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, these membranes and the attached proteins are endocytosed and either recycled or degraded. This turnover needs to be tightly regulated in a timely and spatially confined manner. Increasing evidence suggests that these mechanisms do not only serve for the removal of defective synaptic vesicles or structural proteins of the active zone but also contribute to pathways regulating synaptic strength. The corresponding presynaptic autophagy system thus appears also important for synaptic maintenance and plasticity.

In this review, we will discuss recent human and rodent studies showing the sex-specific involvement of the neuropeptides vasopressin and oxytocin in social and anxiety-related behaviors. We discuss that sex differences can be evident at pre-pubertal ages as seen in the sex-specific regulation of social recognition, social play, and anxiety by the vasopressin system in juvenile rats. We further discuss that the oxytocin system in humans and rodents alters brain activation, anxiety, and sociosexual motivation in sex-specific ways. Finally, we propose that knowledge of vasopressin and oxytocin mediated sex-specific brain mechanisms can provide essential insights into how these neuropeptide systems contribute to sex-specific vulnerability as well as resilience to perturbations, with subsequent relevance to social and emotional disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Individual network components in the mushroom bodies of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster represent cues, learning signals and behavioral outcomes of learned experience. Recent findings have highlighted the importance of dopamine-driven plasticity and activity in feedback and feedforward connections, between various elements of the mushroom body neural network. These computational motifs have been shown to be crucial for long term olfactory memory consolidation, integration of internal states, re-evaluation and updating of learned information. The often recurrent circuit anatomy and a prolonged requirement for activity in parts of these underlying networks, suggest that self-sustained and precisely timed activity is a fundamental feature of network computations in the insect brain. Together these processes allow flies to continuously adjust the content of their learned knowledge and direct their behavior in a way that best represents learned expectations and serves their most pressing current needs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

These devices, usually sensing cell activity via microelectrodes, should be characterized by safe working conditions in the biological milieu together with a well-controlled operation-life. The stable device/neuronal electrical coupling at the interface requires tight interactions between the electrode surface and the cell membrane. This neuro-electrode hybrid represents the hyphen between the soft nature of neural tissue, generating electrical signals via ion motions, and the rigid realm of microelectronics and medical devices, dealing with electrons in motion. Efficient integration of these entities is essential for monitoring, analyzing and controlling neuronal signaling but poses significant technological challenges. Improving the cell/electrode interaction and thus the interface performance requires novel engineering of (nano)materials: tuning at the nanoscale electrode's properties may lead to engineer interfacing probes that better camouflaged with their biological target. In this brief review, we highlight the most recent concepts in nanotechnologies and nanomaterials that might help reducing the mismatch between tissue and electrode, focusing on the device's mechanical properties and its biological integration with the tissue. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Many such works posit that input from entorhinal grid cells is critical to the formation of place fields, a prediction that has received mixed experimental support. Potentially reconciling seemingly conflicting findings is recent work indicating that subpopulations of pyramidal neurons are functionally distinct and may be driven to varying degrees by different inputs. Additionally, new studies have demonstrated that hippocampal principal neurons encode a myriad of features extending beyond current position. Here, we highlight recent evidence for how extensive heterogeneity in connectivity and genetic expression could interact with membrane biophysics to enable place cells to encode a diverse range of stimuli. These recent findings highlight the need for more computational models that integrate these heterogeneous features of hippocampal principal neurons. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06288</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Working memory is a cognitive process that is responsible for temporarily
holding and manipulating information. Most of the empirical neuroscience
research on working memory has focused on measuring sustained activity in
prefrontal cortex (PFC) and/or parietal cortex during simple delayed-response
tasks, and most of the models of working memory have been based on neural
integrators. But working memory means much more than just holding a piece of
information online. We describe a new theory of working memory, based on a
recurrent neural circuit that we call ORGaNICs (Oscillatory Recurrent GAted
Neural Integrator Circuits). ORGaNICs are a variety of Long Short Term Memory
units (LSTMs), imported from machine learning and artificial intelligence.
ORGaNICs can be used to explain the complex dynamics of delay-period activity
in prefrontal cortex (PFC) during a working memory task. The theory is
analytically tractable so that we can characterize the dynamics, and the theory
provides a means for reading out information from the dynamically varying
responses at any point in time, in spite of the complex dynamics. ORGaNICs can
be implemented with a biophysical (electrical circuit) model of pyramidal
cells, combined with shunting inhibition via a thalamocortical loop. Although
introduced as a computational theory of working memory, ORGaNICs are also
applicable to models of sensory processing, motor preparation and motor
control. ORGaNICs offer computational advantages compared to other varieties of
LSTMs that are commonly used in AI applications. Consequently, ORGaNICs are a
framework for canonical computation in brains and machines.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06180</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Our mysterious brain is believed to operate near a non-equilibrium point and
generate critical self-organized avalanches in neuronal activity. Recent
experimental evidence has revealed significant heterogeneity in both synaptic
input and output connectivity, but whether the structural heterogeneity
participates in the regulation of neuronal avalanches remains poorly
understood. By computational modelling, we predict that different types of
structural heterogeneity contribute distinct effects on avalanche
neurodynamics. In particular, neuronal avalanches can be triggered at an
intermediate level of input heterogeneity, but heterogeneous output
connectivity cannot evoke avalanche dynamics. In the criticality region, the
co-emergence of multi-scale cortical activities is observed, and both the
avalanche dynamics and neuronal oscillations are modulated by the input
heterogeneity. Remarkably, we show similar results can be reproduced in
networks with various types of in- and out-degree distributions. Overall, these
findings not only provide details on the underlying circuitry mechanisms of
nonrandom synaptic connectivity in the regulation of neuronal avalanches, but
also inspire testable hypotheses for future experimental studies.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reliable diagnosis of depressive disorder is essential for both optimal
treatment and prevention of fatal outcomes. In this study, we aimed to
elucidate the effectiveness of two non-linear measures, Higuchi Fractal
Dimension (HFD) and Sample Entropy (SampEn), in detecting depressive disorders
when applied on EEG. HFD and SampEn of EEG signals were used as features for
seven machine learning algorithms including Multilayer Perceptron, Logistic
Regression, Support Vector Machines with the linear and polynomial kernel,
Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes classifier, discriminating EEG
between healthy control subjects and patients diagnosed with depression. We
confirmed earlier observations that both non-linear measures can discriminate
EEG signals of patients from healthy control subjects. The results suggest that
good classification is possible even with a small number of principal
components. Average accuracy among classifiers ranged from 90.24% to 97.56%.
Among the two measures, SampEn had better performance. Using HFD and SampEn and
a variety of machine learning techniques we can accurately discriminate
patients diagnosed with depression vs controls which can serve as a highly
sensitive, clinically relevant marker for the diagnosis of depressive
disorders.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Low Rank plus Sparse Decomposition of ODFs for Improved Detection of Group-level Differences and Variable Correlations in White Matter. (arXiv:1803.05938v1 [physics.med-ph])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05938</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A novel approach is presented for group statistical analysis of diffusion
weighted MRI datasets through voxelwise Orientation Distribution Functions
(ODF). Recent advances in MRI acquisition make it possible to use high quality
diffusion weighted protocols (multi-shell, large number of gradient directions)
for routine in vivo study of white matter architecture. The dimensionality of
these data sets is however often reduced to simplify statistical analysis.
While these approaches may detect large group differences, they do not fully
capitalize on all acquired image volumes. Incorporation of all available
diffusion information in the analysis however risks biasing the outcome by
outliers. Here we propose a statistical analysis method operating on the ODF,
either the diffusion ODF or fiber ODF. To avoid outlier bias and reliably
detect voxelwise group differences and correlations with demographic or
behavioral variables, we apply the Low-Rank plus Sparse (L + S) matrix
decomposition on the voxelwise ODFs which separates the sparse individual
variability in the sparse matrix S whilst recovering the essential ODF features
in the low-rank matrix L. We demonstrate the performance of this ODF L + S
approach by replicating the established negative association between global
white matter integrity and physical obesity in the Human Connectome dataset.
The volume of positive findings agrees with and expands on the volume found by
TBSS, Connectivity based fixel enhancement and Connectometry. In the same
dataset we further localize the correlations of brain structure with
neurocognitive measures such as fluid intelligence and episodic memory. The
presented ODF L + S approach will aid in the full utilization of all acquired
diffusion weightings leading to the detection of smaller group differences in
clinically relevant settings as well as in neuroscience applications.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells treated with okadaic acid express phosphorylated high molecular weight tau immunoreactive protein species</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/284265v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Recent data suggest that early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are characterized by an abnormally high phosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein tau and truncation of its C-terminus. Tau hyperphosphorylation may result from the downregulation of phosphatases, especially protein phosphatase 2A. In an attempt to model and analyze these molecular events we treated SH-SY5Y cells with okadaic acid (OA), an inhibitor of protein phosphatases. In addition to the low molecular weight tau, such treatment lead to the appearance of heat-stable protein species with apparent high molecular weight around 100 kDa, which were immunoreactive to tau antibodies against phosphorylated Ser202 and phosphorylated Ser396. Based on the observation that high molecular weight tau-immunoreactive proteins (HMW-TIP) correspond to the predicted size of two monomers of tau, one possibility is that HMW-TIP represent tau oligomers. The absence of HMW-TIP detection by anti-total tau antibodies used may be a consequence of epitope masking, or a combination of epitope masking and protein truncation. We noted the stability of HMW-TIP in the presence of strong denaturing agents, such as urea and guanidine, as well as upon partial dephosphorylation by the alkaline phosphatase. Moreover, as HMW-TIP did not dissociate the presence of {beta}-mercaptoethanol, it was also independent from disulfide bonds. Taken together, these data show that OA treatment of SH-SY5Y cells induces the appearance of HMW-TIP, which may represent tau oligomer or tau-crossreactive phospho-proteins. Our findings have implications for further studies of tau under the conditions of protein phosphatase downregulation.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/284497v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Calcium imaging is commonly used to measure the neural activity of large groups of neurons in mice. Genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) can be delivered for this purpose using non-invasive genetic methods. Compared to viral gene transfer, transgenic targeting of GECIs provides stable long-term expression and obviates the need for invasive viral injections. Transgenic mice expressing the green GECI GCaMP6 are already widely used. Here we present the generation and characterizarion of transgenic mice expressing the sensitive red GECI jRGECO1a, driven by the Thy1 promoter. Four transgenic lines with different expression patterns showed sufficiently high expression for cellular in vivo imaging. We used two-photon microscopy to characterize visual responses of individual neurons in the visual cortex in vivo. The signal-to-noise ratio in transgenic mice was comparable to, or better than, for mice transduced with adeno-associated virus.We also show that Thy1-jRGECO1a transgenic mice are useful for transcranial population imaging and functional mapping using widefield fluorescecnce microscopy. We also demonstrate imaging of visual responses in retinal ganglion cells. Thy1-jRGECO1a transgenic mice are therefore a useful addition to the toolbox for imaging activity in intact neural networks.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Cyto-nuclear shuttling of afadin is required for rapid estradiol-mediated modifications of histone H3</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/284422v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Estrogens have been shown to rapidly regulate local signalling events at both synapses and within the nucleus. The result of these signalling events is to rapidly modulate synapse structure and function, as well as epigenetic mechanisms including histone modifications. Ultimately these mechanisms are thought to contribute to long-lasting changes in neural circuitry, and thus influences cognitive functions such as learning and memory. However, the mechanisms by which estrogen-mediated local synaptic and nuclear signalling events are coordinated are not well understood. In this study we have found that the scaffold protein afadin, (also known as AF-6), undergoes a bi-directional trafficking to both synaptic and nuclear compartment in response to acute 17{beta}-estradiol (estradiol) treatment. Interestingly, nuclear accumulation of afadin was coincidental with an increase in the phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 (H3S10p). This histone modification is associated with the remodelling of chromatin into an open euchromatin state, allowing for transcriptional activation and related learning and memory processes. Critically, the cyto-nuclear trafficking of afadin was required for estradiol-dependent H3S10p. We further determined that nuclear accumulation of afadin is sufficient to induce phosphorylation of the mitogentic kinases ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) within the nucleus. Moreover, nuclear pERK1/2 was required for estradiol-dependent H3S10p. Taken together, we propose a model whereby estradiol incudes the bi-directional trafficking of afadin to synaptic and nuclear sub-compartments. Within the nucleus, afadin is required for increased pERK1/2 which in turn is required for H3S10p. Therefore this represents a mechanism through which estrogens may be able to coordinate both synaptic and nucleosomal events within the same neuronal population.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Human sensory Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) predicts visual memory performance and is modulated by the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met polymorphism</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/284315v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) is recognised as a core neuronal process underlying long-term memory. However, a direct relationship between LTP and human memory performance is yet to be demonstrated. The first aim of the current study was thus to assess the relationship between LTP and human long-term memory performance. With this also comes an opportunity to explore factors thought to mediate the relationship between LTP and long-term memory, and to gain additional insight into variations in memory function and memory decline. The second aim of the current study was to explore the relationship between LTP and memory in groups differing with respect to BDNF Val66Met; a single nucleotide polymorphism implicated in memory function. Methods: 28 participants (15 female) were split into three genotype groups (Val/Val, Val/Met, Met/Met) and were presented with both an EEG paradigm for inducing LTP-like enhancements of the visually-evoked response, and a test of visual memory. Results: The magnitude of LTP 40 minutes after induction was predictive of long-term memory performance. Additionally, the BDNF Met allele was associated with both reduced LTP and reduced memory performance. Conclusions: The current study not only presents the first evidence for a relationship between sensory LTP and human memory performance, but also demonstrates how targeting this relationship can provide insight into factors implicated in variation in human memory performance. It is anticipated that this will be of utility to future clinical studies of disrupted memory function.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Transdiagnostic multimodal neuroimaging in psychosis: structural, resting-state, and task MRI correlates of cognitive control</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/284273v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, are associated with impairments in regulation of goal-directed behavior, termed cognitive control. Cognitive control related neural alterations have been studied in psychosis. However, studies are typically unimodal and relationships across modalities of brain function and structure remain unclear. Thus, we performed transdiagnostic multimodal analyses to examine cognitive control related neural variation in psychosis. Methods: Structural, resting, and working memory task imaging and behavioral data for 31 controls, 27 bipolar, and 23 schizophrenia patients were collected and processed identically to the Human Connectome Project (HCP), enabling identification of relationships with prior multimodal work. Two cognitive control related independent components (ICs) derived from the HCP using multiset canonical correlation analysis + joint independent component analysis (mCCA+jICA) were used to predict performance in psychosis. de novo mCCA+jICA was performed, and resultant IC weights were correlated with cognitive control. Results: A priori ICs significantly predicted cognitive control in psychosis (3/5 modalities significant). De novo mCCA+jICA identified an IC correlated with cognitive control that also discriminated groups. Structural contributions included insular, somatomotor, cingulate, and visual regions; task contributions included precentral, posterior parietal, cingulate, and visual regions; and resting-state contributions highlighted canonical network organization. Follow-up analyses suggested de novo correlations with cognitive control were primarily influenced by schizophrenia patients. Conclusions: A priori components partially predicted performance in transdiagnostic psychosis and de novo analyses identified novel contributions in somatomotor and visual regions in schizophrenia. Together, results suggest joint contributions across modalities related to cognitive control across the healthy-to-psychosis spectrum.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/284158v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Current models propose that the brain uses a multi-layered architecture to reduce the high dimensional visual input to lower dimensional representations that support face, object and scene categorizations. However, understanding the brain mechanisms that support such information reduction for behavior remains challenging. We addressed the challenge using a novel information theoretic framework that quantifies the relationships between three key variables: single-trial information randomly sampled from an ambiguous scene, source-space MEG responses and perceptual decision behaviors. In each observer, behavioral analysis revealed the scene features that subtend their decisions. Independent source space analyses revealed the flow of these and other features in cortical activity. We show where (at the junction between occipital cortex and ventral regions), when (up until 170 ms post stimulus) and how (by separating task-relevant and irrelevant features) brain regions reduce the high-dimensional scene to construct task-relevant feature representations in the right fusiform gyrus that support decisions. Our results inform the occipito-temporal pathway mechanisms that reduce and select information to produce behavior.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/284141v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction: Bile acids (BAs) are the end products of cholesterol metabolism produced by human and gut microbiome co-metabolism. Recent evidence suggests gut microbiota influence pathological features of Alzheimers disease (AD) including neuroinflammation and amyloid-beta deposition. Method: Serum levels of 20 primary and secondary BA metabolites from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (n=1562) were measured using targeted metabolomic profiling. We assessed the association of BAs with the A/T/N (Amyloid, Tau and Neurodegeneration) biomarkers for AD: CSF biomarkers, atrophy (MRI), and brain glucose metabolism ([18F]FDG-PET). Results: Of 23 BA and relevant calculated ratios, three BA signatures were associated with CSF A{beta}1-42 (A) and three with CSF p-tau181 (T) (corrected p&amp;lt;0.05). Furthermore, three, twelve, and fourteen BA signatures were associated with CSF t-tau, glucose metabolism, and atrophy (N), respectively (corrected p&amp;lt;0.05). Conclusion: This is the first study to show serum-based BA metabolites are associated with A/T/N AD biomarkers, providing further support for a role of BA pathways in AD pathophysiology. Prospective clinical observations and validation in model systems are needed to assess causality and specific mechanisms underlying this association.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: External and Internally Generated Task Predictions are Integrated in Prefrontal Cortex to Jointly Guide Cognitive Control</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/284059v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Cognitive control proactively configures information processing to suit expected task demands. Predictions of forthcoming demand can be driven by explicit external cues or be generated internally, based on past experience (cognitive history). However, it is not known whether and how the brain reconciles these two sources of information to guide control. Pairing a probabilistic task-switching paradigm with computational modeling, we found that external and internally generated predictions jointly guide task preparation, with a bias for internal predictions. Using model-based neuroimaging, we then show that the two sources of task prediction are integrated in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and jointly inform a representation of the likelihood of a change in task demand, encoded in frontoparietal cortex. Upon task-stimulus onset, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex encoded the need for reactive task-set adjustment. These data reveal, for the first time, how the human brain integrates external cues and cognitive history to prepare for an upcoming task.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/283853v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Brief (2-3d) monocular deprivation (MD) during the critical period induces a profound loss of responsiveness within layer 4 of primary visual cortex (V1). This has largely been ascribed to long-term depression (LTD) at thalamocortical synapses onto pyramidal neurons, while a contribution from intracortical inhibition has been controversial. Here we used optogenetics to probe feedforward thalamocortical and feedback intracortical excitation-inhibition (E-I) ratios following brief MD. While thalamocortical inputs onto pyramidal neurons were depressed, there was stronger depression onto PV+ interneurons, which shifted the thalamocortical-evoked E-I ratio toward excitation. In contrast, feedback intracortical E-I ratio was shifted toward inhibition, and a computational model of layer 4 demonstrated that these opposing shifts produced an overall suppression of layer 4 excitability. Thus, feedforward and feedback E-I ratios onto the same postsynaptic target can be independently regulated by visual experience, and enhanced feedback inhibition is the primary driving force behind loss of visual responsiveness.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/283846v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have increasingly revealed potential neural substrates of individual differences in diverse types of brain function and dysfunction. Although most previous studies have been inherently limited to state-specific characterizations of related brain networks and their functions, several recent studies have examined the potential state-unspecific nature of functional brain networks, such as their global similarities across different experimental conditions (i.e., states) including both task and rest. However, no previous studies have carried out direct, systematic characterizations of state-unspecific brain networks, or their functional implications. Here, we quantitatively identified several modes of state-unspecific individual variation in whole-brain functional connectivity patterns, called &quot;Common Neural Modes (CNMs)&quot;, from a large fMRI dataset including eight task/rest states, obtained from the Human Connectome Project. Furthermore, we tested how CNMs account for variability in individual behavioral measures. The results revealed that three CNMs were robustly extracted under various different preprocessing conditions. Each of these CNMs was significantly correlated with different aspects of behavioral measures of both fluid and crystalized intelligence. The three CNMs were also able to predict several life outcomes, such as income and life satisfaction, achieving the highest performance when combined with behavioral intelligence measures as inputs. Our findings highlight the importance of state-unspecific brain networks to characterize fundamental individual variation.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/283838v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Perception and cognition oscillate with fluctuating bodily states. For example, visual processing has been shown to change with alternating cardiac phases. Here, we study the heartbeat's role for active information sampling-testing whether humans implicitly act upon their environment so that relevant signals appear during preferred cardiac phases. During the encoding period of a visual memory experiment, participants clicked through a set of emotional pictures to memorize them for a later recognition test. By self-paced key press, they actively prompted the onset of shortly (100-ms) presented pictures. Simultaneously recorded electrocardiograms allowed us to analyse the self-initiated picture onsets relative to the heartbeat. We find that self-initiated picture onsets vary across the cardiac cycle, showing an increase during cardiac systole, while memory performance was not affected by the heartbeat. We conclude that active information sampling integrates heart-related signals, thereby extending previous findings on the association between body-brain interactions and behaviour.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/282467v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Improving extinction learning is essential to optimize psychotherapy for persistent fear-related disorders. In two independent studies (both n=24), we found that goal-directed eye movements activate a dorsal fronto-parietal network and transiently deactivate the amygdala. Connectivity analyses revealed this down-regulation engages a ventromedial prefrontal pathway known to be involved in cognitive regulation of emotion. Critically, when eye movements followed memory reactivation during extinction learning, this reduced spontaneous fear recovery 24 hours later. Stronger amygdala deactivation furthermore predicted a stronger reduction in subsequent fear recovery after reinstatement. In conclusion, we show that extinction learning can be improved with a non-invasive eye-movement intervention that triggers a transient suppression of the amygdala. Our finding that another task which taxes working memory leads to a similar amygdala suppression furthermore indicates that this effect is likely not specific to eye movements, which is in line with a large body of behavioral studies. This study contributes to the understanding of a widely used treatment for traumatic symptoms by providing a parsimonious account for how working memory tasks and goal-directed eye movements can enhance extinction-based psychotherapy, namely through neural circuits similar to those that support cognitive control of emotion.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/284042v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>At a typical synapse, the precise juxtaposition between the active zone and postsynaptic receptors ensures local and precise neurotransmitter release and detection. Dopamine neurons release neurotransmitter more diffusely using volume-transmission, where precise pre- and post-synaptic alignment is lacking. It is unknown whether Dopaminergic presynaptic terminals have typical active zone structures and how they develop. Here we show that presynaptic terminals of the C. elegans dopaminergic neuron PDE contain bona fide AZ proteins, including SYD-2/Liprin- and CLA-1/Piccolo. During development, synaptic vesicles (SVs) and active zone proteins (AZs) coalesce within minutes behind the advancing growth cone. Precise regulation of UNC-104/Kinesin-3-mediated SV transport through kinesin autoinhibition is required to pause transported SVs at synapses. SYD-1 and SYD-2 recruit and cluster the transiting SVs, while ELKS-1 aggregates through a distinct mechanism.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Climbing fibers (CFs) provide instructive signals driving cerebellar learning. Experimental studies have drawn conflicting conclusions about the reliability of CF-mediated Ca2+ influx in Purkinje cell (PC) distal dendrites. Mechanisms causing the wide variation in duration and spikelet numbers of complex spikes (CSs) have not been explored systematically. Using a new experimentally validated PC model, we describe the full range of modifiability of CF responses to explain experimental data and to make new predictions. We find that voltage state gates initiation and propagation of dendritic spikes. PC dendrites exhibit inhomogeneous excitability with individual branches as computational units for CF input. Somatic CSs are regulated by voltage state, CF activation phase, and instantaneous CF firing rate. Concurrent synaptic inputs affect CSs by modulating dendritic responses in a spatially precise way. These voltage- and branch-specific CF responses can increase dendritic computational capacity and enable PCs to actively integrate CF signals.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/283994v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>There is large individual variability in human neural responses and perceptual abilities. The factors that give rise to these individual differences, however, remain largely unknown. To examine these factors, we separately measured fMRI responses to moving gratings in the motion-selective region MT, and perceptual duration thresholds for motion direction discrimination within the same group of male and female subjects. Further, we acquired MR spectroscopy data that allowed us to quantify an index of neurotransmitter levels in the region surrounding MT. We show that individual differences in the Glx (glutamate + glutamine) signal in the MT region are associated with both higher fMRI responses and improved psychophysical task performance. Our results suggest that individual differences in baseline levels of glutamate within MT contribute to motion perception by increasing neural responses in this region.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/283960v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Studies in multiple species have revealed the existence of neural signals that lawfully co-vary with different aspects of the decision-making process, including choice, sensory evidence that supports the choice, and reaction time. These signals, often interpreted as the representation of a decision variable (DV), have been identified in several motor preparation circuits and provide insight about mechanisms underlying the decision-making process. However, single-trial dynamics of this process or its representation at the neural population level remain poorly understood. Here, we examine the representation of the DV in simultaneously recorded neural populations of dorsal premotor (PMd) and primary motor (M1) cortices of monkeys performing a random dots direction discrimination task with arm movements as the behavioral report. We show that single-trial DVs covary with stimulus difficulty in both areas but are stronger and appear earlier in PMd compared to M1 when the stimulus duration is fixed and predictable. When temporal uncertainty is introduced by making the stimulus duration variable, single-trial DV dynamics are accelerated across the board and the two areas become largely indistinguishable throughout the entire trial. These effects are not trivially explained by the faster emergence of motor kinematic signals in PMd and M1. All key aspects of the data were replicated by a computational model that relies on progressive recruitment of units with stable choice-related modulation of neural population activity. In contrast with several recent results in rodents, decision signals in PMd and M1 are not carried by short sequences of activity in non-overlapping groups of neurons but are instead distributed across many neurons, which once recruited, represent the decision stably during individual behavioral epochs of the trial.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/283879v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Long-term forms of brain plasticity share a requirement for changes in gene expression induced by neuronal activity. Mechanisms that determine how the distinct and overlapping functions of multiple activity-responsive transcription factors, including nuclear factor kappa B (NF-{kappa}B), give rise to stimulus-appropriate neuronal responses remain unclear. We report that the p65/RelA subunit of NF-{kappa}B confers subcellular enrichment at neuronal dendritic spines and engineer a p65 mutant that lacks spine-enrichment ( SEp65) but retains inherent transcriptional activity equivalent to wild-type p65. Wild-type p65 or SEp65 both rescue NF-{kappa}B-dependent gene expression in p65-deficient murine hippocampal neurons responding to diffuse (PMA/ionomycin) stimulation. In contrast, neurons lacking spine-enriched NF-{kappa}B are selectively impaired in NF-{kappa}B-dependent gene expression induced by elevated excitatory synaptic stimulation (bicuculline or glycine). We used the setting of excitatory synaptic activity during development that produces NF-{kappa}B-dependent growth of dendritic spines to test physiological function of spine-enriched NF-{kappa}B in an activity-dependent response. Expression of wild-type p65, but not SEp65, is capable of rescuing spine density to normal levels in p65-deficient pyramidal neurons. Collectively, these data reveal that spatial localization in dendritic spines contributes unique capacities to the NF-{kappa}B transcription factor in synaptic activity-dependent responses.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/283820v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The ventromedial hypothalamus is a central node of the mammalian predator defense network. Stimulation of this structure in rodents and primates elicits abrupt defensive responses, including flight, freezing, sympathetic activation, and panic, while inhibition reduces defensive responses to predators. The major efferent target of the ventromedial hypothalamus is the dorsal periaqueductal grey, and stimulation of this structure also elicits flight, freezing, and sympathetic activation. However, reversible inhibition experiments suggest that the ventromedial hypothalamus and periaqueductal grey play distinct roles in the control of defensive behavior, with the former proposed to encode an internal state necessary for the motivation of defensive responses, while the latter serves as a motor pattern initiator. Here we used electrophysiological recordings of single units in behaving mice exposed to a rat to investigate the encoding of predator fear in the dorsomedial division of the ventromedial hypothalamus and the dorsal periaqueductal grey. Distinct correlates of threat intensity and motor responses were found in both structures, suggesting a distributed encoding of sensory and motor features in the medial hypothalamic-brainstem instinctive network.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/283705v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that currently affects 36 million people worldwide with no effective treatment available. Development of AD follows a distinctive pattern in the brain and is poorly modelled in animals. Therefore, it is vital to widen both the spatial scope of the study of AD and prioritise the study of human brains. Here we show that functionally distinct human brain regions show varying and region-specific changes in protein expression. These changes provide novel insights into the progression of disease, novel AD-related pathways, the presence of a gradient of protein expression change from less to more affected regions, and the presence of a protective protein expression profile in the cerebellum. This spatial proteomics analysis provides a framework which can underpin current research and opens new avenues of interest to enhance our understanding of molecular pathophysiology of AD, provides new targets for intervention and broadens the conceptual frameworks for future AD research.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/281956v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction: Increasing evidence suggests a role for the gut microbiome in central nervous system disorders and specific role for the gut-brain axis in neurodegeneration. Bile acids (BA), products of cholesterol metabolism and clearance, are produced in the liver and are further metabolized by gut bacteria. They have major regulatory and signaling functions and seem dysregulated in Alzheimer disease (AD). Methods: Serum levels of 15 primary and secondary BAs and their conjugated forms were measured in 1,464 subjects including 370 cognitively normal older adults (CN), 284 with early mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 505 with late MCI, and 305 AD cases enrolled in the AD Neuroimaging Initiative. We assessed associations of BA profiles including selected ratios with diagnosis, cognition, and AD-related genetic variants, adjusting for cofounders and multiple testing. Results: In AD compared to CN, we observed significantly lower serum concentrations of a primary BA (cholic acid CA) and increased levels of the bacterially produced, secondary BA, deoxycholic acid (DCA), and its glycine and taurine conjugated forms. An increased ratio of DCA:CA, which reflects 7-dehydroxylation of CA by gut bacteria, strongly associated with cognitive decline, a finding replicated in serum and brain samples in the Rush Religious Orders and Memory and Aging Project. Several genetic variants in immune response related genes implicated in AD showed associations with BA profiles. Conclusion: We report for the first time an association between altered BA profile, genetic variants implicated in AD and cognitive changes in disease using a large multicenter study. These findings warrant further investigation of gut dysbiosis and possible role of gut liver brain axis in the pathogenesis of AD.</content:encoded>

The folding of proteins with a complex knot is still an unresolved question. Based on representative members of Ubiquitin C-terminal Hydrolases (UCHs) that contain the 5&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; knot in the native state, we explain how UCHs are able to unfold and refold &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; reversibly within the structure-based model. In particular, we identify two, topologically different folding/unfolding pathways and corroborate our results with experiment, recreating the chevron plot. We show that confinement effect of chaperonin or weak crowding greatly facilitates folding, simultaneously slowing down the unfolding process of UCHs, compared with bulk conditions. Finally, we analyze the existence of knots in the denaturated state of UCHs. The results of the work show that the crowded environment of the cell should have a positive effect on the kinetics of complex knotted proteins, especially when proteins with deeper knots are found in this family.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IQnzANgGzpM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Dopaminergic Drug Effects on Probability Weighting during Risky Decision-Making</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0330-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Dopamine has been associated with risky decision-making, as well as with pathological gambling, a behavioural addiction characterized by excessive risk-taking behaviour. However, the specific mechanisms through which dopamine might act to foster risk-taking and pathological gambling remain elusive. Here we test the hypothesis that this might be achieved, in part, via modulation of subjective probability weighting during decision-making. Human healthy controls (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 21) and pathological gamblers (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 16) played a decision-making task involving choices between sure monetary options and risky gambles both in the gain and loss domains. Each participant played the task twice, either under placebo or the dopamine D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonist sulpiride, in a double-blind counter-balanced design. A prospect theory modelling approach was used to estimate subjective probability weighting and sensitivity to monetary outcomes. Consistent with prospect theory, we found that participants presented a distortion in the subjective weighting of probabilities, i.e. they overweighted low probabilities and underweighted moderate to high probabilities, both in the gain and loss domains. Compared with placebo, sulpiride attenuated this distortion in the gain domain. Across drugs, the groups did not differ in their probability weighting, although gamblers consistently underweighted losing probabilities in the placebo condition. Overall, our results reveal that dopamine D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonism modulates the subjective weighting of probabilities in the gain domain, in the direction of more objective, economically rational decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Dopamine has been implicated in risky decision-making and gambling addiction, but the exact mechanisms underlying this influence remain partly elusive. Here we tested the hypothesis that dopamine modulates subjective probability weighting, by examining the effect of a dopaminergic drug on risk-taking behavior, both in healthy individuals and pathologic gamblers. We found that selectively blocking dopamine D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptors diminished the typically observed distortion of winning probabilities, characterized by an overweighting of low probabilities and underweighting of high probabilities. This made participants more linear in their subjective estimation of probabilities and thus more rational in their decision-making behavior. Healthy participants and pathologic gamblers did not differ in their risk-taking behavior, except in the placebo condition in which gamblers consistently underweighted losing probabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Excitatory Neuronal Responses of Ca2+ Transients in Interstitial Cells of Cajal in the Small Intestine</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0080-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) regulate smooth muscle excitability and motility in the gastrointestinal tract. ICC in the deep muscular plexus (ICC-DMP) of the small intestine are aligned closely with varicosities of enteric motor neurons and thought to transduce neural responses. ICC-DMP generate Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients that activate Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activated Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; channels and generate electrophysiological responses. We tested the hypothesis that excitatory neurotransmitters regulate Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients in ICC-DMP as a means of regulating intestinal muscles. High-resolution confocal microscopy was used to image Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients in ICC-DMP within murine small intestinal muscles with cell-specific expression of GCaMP3. Intrinsic nerves were stimulated by electrical field stimulation (EFS). ICC-DMP exhibited ongoing Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients before stimuli were applied. EFS caused initial suppression of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients, followed by escape during sustained stimulation, and large increases in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients after cessation of stimulation. Basal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activity and the excitatory phases of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; responses to EFS were inhibited by atropine and neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1) antagonists, but not by NK2 receptor antagonists. Exogenous ACh and substance P increased Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients, atropine and NK1 antagonists decreased Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients. Neurokinins appear to be released spontaneously (tonic excitation) in small intestinal muscles and are the dominant excitatory neurotransmitters. Subcellular regulation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release events in ICC-DMP may be a means by which excitatory neurotransmission organizes intestinal motility patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) are innervated by enteric motor neurons and thought to transduce neural responses in GI muscles. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients, due to Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release from Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; intracellular stores, mediate electrophysiological events in ICC by activation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; channels. Neural responses in ICC in the deep muscular plexus of the small intestine (ICC-DMP) were studied by confocal imaging of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients in these cells. Excitatory neural input was due to cholinergic and peptidergic neurotransmitters (acetylcholine and neurokinins), as excitatory effects on Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients were blocked by atropine and neurokinin receptor antagonists. Neurokinins are the dominant excitatory regulators of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients in ICC-DMP. ICC-DMP are innervated by enteric motor neurons and mediate significant excitatory responses in intestinal muscles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05897</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Biological and artificial neural systems are composed of many local
processors, and their capabilities depend upon the transfer function that
relates each local processor's outputs to its inputs. This paper uses a recent
advance in the foundations of information theory to study the properties of
local processors that use contextual input to amplify or attenuate transmission
of information about their driving inputs. This advance enables the information
transmitted by processors with two distinct inputs to be decomposed into those
components unique to each input, that shared between the two inputs, and that
which depends on both though it is in neither, i.e. synergy. The decompositions
that we report here show that contextual modulation has information processing
properties that contrast with those of all four simple arithmetic operators,
that it can take various forms, and that the form used in our previous studies
of artificial neural nets composed of local processors with both driving and
contextual inputs is particularly well-suited to provide the distinctive
capabilities of contextual modulation under a wide range of conditions. We
argue that the decompositions reported here could be compared with those
obtained from empirical neurobiological and psychophysical data under
conditions thought to reflect contextual modulation. That would then shed new
light on the underlying processes involved. Finally, we suggest that such
decompositions could aid the design of context-sensitive machine learning
algorithms.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The estimation of causal network architectures in the brain is fundamental
for understanding cognitive information processes. However, access to the
dynamic processes underlying cognition is limited to indirect measurements of
the hidden neuronal activity, for instance through fMRI data. Thus, estimating
the network structure of the underlying process is challenging. In this
article, we embed an adaptive importance sampler called Adaptive Path Integral
Smoother (APIS) into the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to obtain point
estimates of causal connectivity. We demonstrate on synthetic data that this
procedure finds not only the correct network structure but also the direction
of effective connections from random initializations of the connectivity
matrix. In addition--motivated by contradictory claims in the literature--we
examine the effect of the neuronal timescale on the sensitivity of the BOLD
signal to changes in the connectivity and on the maximum likelihood solutions
of the connectivity. We conclude with two warnings: First, the connectivity
estimates under the assumption of slow dynamics can be extremely biased if the
data was generated by fast neuronal processes. Second, the faster the time
scale, the less sensitive the BOLD signal is to changes in the incoming
connections to a node. Hence, connectivity estimation using realistic neural
dynamics timescale requires extremely high-quality data and seems infeasible in
many practical data sets.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Receptive profiles induce functional architecture of V1. (arXiv:1803.05783v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05783</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this work we show how to construct connectivity kernels induced by the
receptive profiles of simple cells of the primary visual cortex (V1). These
kernels are directly defined by the shape of such profiles: this provides a
metric model for the functional architecture of V1, whose global geometry is
determined by the reciprocal interactions between local elements. Our
construction adapts to any bank of filters chosen to represent the set of
receptive profiles of simple cells, since it does not require any structure on
the parameterization on the family. The connectivity kernel that we define
carries a geometrical structure consistent with the well-known properties of
long-range horizontal connections in V1, and it is compatible with the
perceptual rules synthesized by the concept of association field. These
characteristics are still present when the kernel is constructed from a bank of
filters arising from an unsupervised learning algorithm.

	<content:encoded>A predominant view of perirhinal cortex (PRC) and postrhinal/parahippocampal cortex (POR/PHC) function contends that these structures are tuned to represent objects and spatial information, respectively. However, known anatomical connectivity, together with recent electrophysiological, neuroimaging, and lesion data, indicate that both brain areas participate in spatial and nonspatial processing. Instead of content-based organization, the PRC and PHC/POR may participate in two computationally distinct cortical–hippocampal networks: one network that is tuned to process coarse information quickly, forming gist-like representations of scenes/environments, and a second network tuned to process information about the specific sensory details that are necessary for discrimination across sensory modalities.</content:encoded>

Understanding the control of epigenetic regulation is key to explain and modify the aging process. Because histone-modifying enzymes are sensitive to shifts in availability of cofactors (e.g. metabolites), cellular epigenetic states may be tied to changing conditions associated with cofactor variability. The aim of this study is to analyse the relationships between cofactor fluctuations, epigenetic landscapes, and cell state transitions. Using Approximate Bayesian Computation, we generate an ensemble of epigenetic regulation (ER) systems whose heterogeneity reflects variability in cofactor pools used by histone modifiers. The heterogeneity of epigenetic metabolites, which operates as regulator of the kinetic parameters promoting/preventing histone modifications, stochastically drives phenotypic variability. The ensemble of ER configurations reveals the occurrence of distinct epi-states within the ensemble. Whereas resilient states maintain large epigenetic barriers refractory to reprogramming cellular identity, plastic states lower these barriers, and increase the sensitivity to reprogramming. Moreover, fine-tuning of cofactor levels redirects plastic epigenetic states to re-enter epigenetic resilience, and vice versa. Our ensemble model agrees with a model of metabolism-responsive loss of epigenetic resilience as a cellular aging mechanism. Our findings support the notion that cellular aging, and its reversal, might result from stochastic translation of metabolic inputs into resilient/plastic cell states via ER systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O1S3sVW-8ko&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Imbalanced amplification: A mechanism of amplification and suppression from local imbalance of excitation and inhibition in cortical circuits</title>

Understanding the relationship between external stimuli and the spiking activity of cortical populations is a central problem in neuroscience. Dense recurrent connectivity in local cortical circuits can lead to counterintuitive response properties, raising the question of whether there are simple arithmetical rules for relating circuits’ connectivity structure to their response properties. One such arithmetic is provided by the mean field theory of balanced networks, which is derived in a limit where excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents precisely balance on average. However, balanced network theory is not applicable to some biologically relevant connectivity structures. We show that cortical circuits with such structure are susceptible to an amplification mechanism arising when excitatory-inhibitory balance is broken at the level of local subpopulations, but maintained at a global level. This amplification, which can be quantified by a linear correction to the classical mean field theory of balanced networks, explains several response properties observed in cortical recordings and provides fundamental insights into the relationship between connectivity structure and neural responses in cortical circuits.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FNF84rL9qos&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

We present a new educational initiative called Meet-U that aims to train students for collaborative work in computational biology and to bridge the gap between education and research. Meet-U mimics the setup of collaborative research projects and takes advantage of the most popular tools for collaborative work and of cloud computing. Students are grouped in teams of 4–5 people and have to realize a project from A to Z that answers a challenging question in biology. Meet-U promotes &quot;coopetition,&quot; as the students collaborate within and across the teams and are also in competition with each other to develop the best final product. Meet-U fosters interactions between different actors of education and research through the organization of a meeting day, open to everyone, where the students present their work to a jury of researchers and jury members give research seminars. This very unique combination of education and research is strongly motivating for the students and provides a formidable opportunity for a scientific community to unite and increase its visibility. We report on our experience with Meet-U in two French universities with master’s students in bioinformatics and modeling, with protein–protein docking as the subject of the course. Meet-U is easy to implement and can be straightforwardly transferred to other fields and/or universities. All the information and data are available at www.meet-u.org.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uLDwRntm3uo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

It is generally acknowledged that, for reproducibility and progress of human genomic research, data sharing is critical. For every sharing transaction, a successful data exchange is produced between a data consumer and a data provider. Providers of human genomic data (e.g., publicly or privately funded repositories and data archives) fulfil their social contract with data donors when their shareable data conforms to FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles. Based on our experiences via Repositive (https://repositive.io), a leading discovery platform cataloguing all shared human genomic datasets, we propose guidelines for data providers wishing to maximise their shared data’s FAIRness.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RmCLx4LfFZo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Short-term synaptic plasticity (STSP) affects the efficiency of synaptic
transmission for persistent presynaptic activities. We consider attractor
neural networks, for which the attractors are given, in the absence of STSP, by
cell assemblies of excitatory cliques. We show that STSP may transform these
attracting states into attractor relics, inducing ongoing transient-state
dynamics in terms of sequences of transiently activated cell assemblies, the
former attractors. Subsequent cell assemblies may be both disjoint or partially
overlapping. It may hence be possible to use the resulting dynamics for the
generation of motor control sequences.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05117</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Modern deep learning enabled artificial neural networks, such as Deep Neural
Network (DNN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), have achieved a series of
breaking records on a broad spectrum of recognition applications. However, the
enormous computation and storage requirements associated with such deep and
complex neural network models greatly challenge their implementations on
resource-limited platforms. Time-based spiking neural network has recently
emerged as a promising solution in Neuromorphic Computing System designs for
achieving remarkable computing and power efficiency within a single chip.
However, the relevant research activities have been narrowly concentrated on
the biological plausibility and theoretical learning approaches, causing
inefficient neural processing and impracticable multilayer extension thus
significantly limitations on speed and accuracy when handling the realistic
cognitive tasks. In this work, a practical multilayer time-based spiking
neuromorphic architecture, namely &quot;MT-Spike&quot;, is developed to fill this gap.
With the proposed practical time-coding scheme, average delay response model,
temporal error backpropagation algorithm, and heuristic loss function,
&quot;MT-Spike&quot; achieves more efficient neural processing through flexible neural
model size reduction while offering very competitive classification accuracy
for realistic recognition tasks. Simulation results well validated that the
algorithmic power of deep multi-layer learning can be seamlessly merged with
the efficiency of time-based spiking neuromorphic architecture, demonstrating
great potentials of &quot;MT-Spike&quot; in resource and power constrained embedded
platforms.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05109</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;One of the most exciting advancements in AI over the last decade is the wide
adoption of ANNs, such as DNN and CNN, in many real-world applications.
However, the underlying massive amounts of computation and storage requirement
greatly challenge their applicability in resource-limited platforms like the
drone, mobile phone, and IoT devices etc. The third generation of neural
network model--Spiking Neural Network (SNN), inspired by the working mechanism
and efficiency of human brain, has emerged as a promising solution for
achieving more impressive computing and power efficiency within light-weighted
devices (e.g. single chip). However, the relevant research activities have been
narrowly carried out on conventional rate-based spiking system designs for
fulfilling the practical cognitive tasks, underestimating SNN's energy
efficiency, throughput, and system flexibility. Although the time-based SNN can
be more attractive conceptually, its potentials are not unleashed in realistic
applications due to lack of efficient coding and practical learning schemes. In
this work, a Precise-Time-Dependent Single Spike Neuromorphic Architecture,
namely &quot;PT-Spike&quot;, is developed to bridge this gap. Three constituent
hardware-favorable techniques: precise single-spike temporal encoding,
efficient supervised temporal learning, and fast asymmetric decoding are
proposed accordingly to boost the energy efficiency and data processing
capability of the time-based SNN at a more compact neural network model size
when executing real cognitive tasks. Simulation results show that &quot;PT-Spike&quot;
demonstrates significant improvements in network size, processing efficiency
and power consumption with marginal classification accuracy degradation when
compared with the rate-based SNN and ANN under the similar network
configuration.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The study of correlations between brain regions is an important chapter of
the analysis of large-scale brain spatiotemporal dynamics. In particular, novel
methods suited to extract dynamic changes in mutual correlations are needed.
Here we scrutinize a recently reported metric dubbed &quot;Multiplication of
Temporal Derivatives&quot; (MTD) which is based on the temporal derivative of each
time series. The formal comparison of the MTD formula with the Pearson
correlation of a time derivative reveals only minor differences, which we find
negligible in practice. A comparison with the sliding window Pearson
correlation of the raw time series in several stationary and non-stationary
set-ups do not indicate any mathematical advantages of the proposed metric over
commonly used correlation methods. Additionally, the results of our analysis
show that a metric based on derivatives performs worse in a realistic scenario
of stationary network detection.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02838</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We examine the hypothesis, that short-term synaptic plasticity (STSP) may
generate self-organized motor patterns. We simulated sphere-shaped autonomous
robots, within the LPZRobots simulation package, containing three weights
moving along orthogonal internal rods. The position of a weight is controlled
by a single neuron receiving excitatory input from the sensor, measuring its
actual position, and inhibitory inputs from the other two neurons. The
inhibitory connections are transiently plastic, following physiologically
inspired STSP-rules. We find that a wide palette of motion patterns are
generated through the interaction of STSP, robot, and environment (closed-loop
configuration), including various forward meandering and circular motions,
together with chaotic trajectories. The observed locomotion is robust with
respect to additional interactions with obstacles. In the chaotic phase the
robot is seemingly engaged in actively exploring its environment. We believe
that our results constitute a concept of proof that transient synaptic
plasticity, as described by STSP, may potentially be important for the
generation of motor commands and for the emergence of complex locomotion
patterns, adapting seamlessly also to unexpected environmental feedback. We
observe spontaneous and collision induced mode switchings, finding in addition,
that locomotion may follow transiently limit cycles which are otherwise
unstable. Regular locomotion corresponds to stable limit cycles in the
sensorimotor loop, which may be characterized in turn by arbitrary angles of
propagation. This degeneracy is, in our analysis, one of the drivings for the
chaotic wandering observed for selected parameter settings, which is induced by
the smooth diffusion of the angle of propagation.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04338</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We investigate the sensorimotor loop of simple robots simulated within the
LPZRobots environment from the point of view of dynamical systems theory. For a
robot with a cylindrical shaped body and an actuator controlled by a single
proprioceptual neuron we find various types of periodic motions in terms of
stable limit cycles. These are self-organized in the sense, that the dynamics
of the actuator kicks in only, for a certain range of parameters, when the
barrel is already rolling, stopping otherwise. The stability of the resulting
rolling motions terminates generally, as a function of the control parameters,
at points where fold bifurcations of limit cycles occur. We find that several
branches of motion types exist for the same parameters, in terms of the
relative frequencies of the barrel and of the actuator, having each their
respective basins of attractions in terms of initial conditions. For low
drivings stable limit cycles describing periodic and drifting back-and-forth
motions are found additionally. These modes allow to generate symmetry breaking
explorative behavior purely by the timing of an otherwise neutral signal with
respect to the cyclic back-and-forth motion of the robot.

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Humans commonly operate within 3D environments such as multifloor buildings and yet there is a surprising dearth of studies that have examined how these spaces are represented in the brain. Here, we had participants learn the locations of paintings within a virtual multilevel gallery building and then used behavioral tests and fMRI repetition suppression analyses to investigate how this 3D multicompartment space was represented, and whether there was a bias in encoding vertical and horizontal information. We found faster response times for within-room egocentric spatial judgments and behavioral priming effects of visiting the same room, providing evidence for a compartmentalized representation of space. At the neural level, we observed a hierarchical encoding of 3D spatial information, with left anterior hippocampus representing local information within a room, while retrosplenial cortex, parahippocampal cortex, and posterior hippocampus represented room information within the wider building. Of note, both our behavioral and neural findings showed that vertical and horizontal location information was similarly encoded, suggesting an isotropic representation of 3D space even in the context of a multicompartment environment. These findings provide much-needed information about how the human brain supports spatial memory and navigation in buildings with numerous levels and rooms.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

The Dynamic Regulatory Events Miner (DREM) software reconstructs dynamic regulatory networks by integrating static protein-DNA interaction data with time series gene expression data. In recent years, several additional types of high-throughput time series data have been profiled when studying biological processes including time series miRNA expression, proteomics, epigenomics and single cell RNA-Seq. Combining all available time series and static datasets in a unified model remains an important challenge and goal. To address this challenge we have developed a new version of DREM termed interactive DREM (iDREM). iDREM provides support for all data types mentioned above and combines them with existing interaction data to reconstruct networks that can lead to novel hypotheses on the function and timing of regulators. Users can interactively visualize and query the resulting model. We showcase the functionality of the new tool by applying it to microglia developmental data from multiple labs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/73xX3n_LGQE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Role of Mesolimbic Circuitry in Buffering Election-Related Distress</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2887?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The 2016 U.S. presidential election yielded distress among many individuals who identify with historically marginalized groups. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging and psychological measures to test the hypotheses that neural response to reward, probing the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and social support would ameliorate the effects of election distress among those who felt negatively affected by the result. Within 4 months of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, we tested human participants who felt affected by the election result (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 40, &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;age&lt;/sub&gt; = 21.9 years, 28 female) and control participants (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 20, &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;age&lt;/sub&gt; = 20.25 years, 12 female) who did not feel affected by the election result. Election-related distress significantly differed between the groups, and distress accounted for over half of the relationship between discrimination experiences and depression symptoms among affected individuals. NAcc activation, connectivity between the NAcc and mPFC, and family support moderated the associations between election distress and depression symptoms. Prior work has primarily investigated mesolimbic circuitry in reward and motivation contexts, but our findings extend the relevance of functioning in this circuitry to ameliorating psychological manifestations of acute distress after shifts in political climate. These findings highlight the psychological effects of this important historic event and identify neurobiological and social mechanisms associated with individual differences in response to election distress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The 2016 U.S. presidential election was psychologically distressing for many individuals. In this study, election-related distress was linked to depression symptomology for affected individuals but not control individuals. However, among individuals distressed by the election, those with greater neural response to reward and higher family support were protected against these depressive symptoms. Previous research has examined how neural response to reward after a discrete event ameliorates clinical symptoms. The current study extends this knowledge by demonstrating that both the brain and social support may play influential roles in dampening affective responses to ongoing and anticipated distress related to political climate. Leveraging this finding to enact interventions that dampen continuous distress, political or otherwise, is a promising endeavor for future research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2877?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Prenatal maternal immune activation (MIA) is associated with altered brain development and risk of psychiatric disorders in offspring. Translational human studies of MIA are few in number. Alterations of the salience network have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the same psychiatric disorders associated with MIA. If MIA is pathogenic, then associated abnormalities in the salience network should be detectable in neonates immediately after birth. We tested the hypothesis that third trimester MIA of adolescent women who are at risk for high stress and inflammation is associated with the strength of functional connectivity in the salience network of their neonate. Thirty-six women underwent blood draws to measure interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) and electrocardiograms to measure fetal heart rate variability (FHRV) at 34–37 weeks gestation. Resting-state imaging data were acquired in the infants at 40–44 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). Functional connectivity was measured from seeds placed in the anterior cingulate cortex and insula. Measures of cognitive development were obtained at 14 months PMA using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development–Third Edition (BSID-III). Both sexes were studied. Regions in which the strength of the salience network correlated with maternal IL-6 or CRP levels included the medial prefrontal cortex, temporoparietal junction, and basal ganglia. Maternal CRP level correlated inversely with FHRV acquired at the same gestational age. Maternal CRP and IL-6 levels correlated positively with measures of cognitive development on the BSID-III. These results suggest that MIA is associated with short- and long-term influences on offspring brain and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Preclinical studies in rodents and nonhuman primates and epidemiological studies in humans suggest that maternal immune activation (MIA) alters the development of brain circuitry and associated behaviors, placing offspring at risk for psychiatric illness. Consistent with preclinical findings, we show that maternal third trimester interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein levels are associated with neonatal functional connectivity and with both fetal and toddler behavior. MIA-related functional connectivity was localized to the salience, default mode, and frontoparietal networks, which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders. Our results suggest that MIA alters functional connectivity in the neonatal brain, that those alterations have consequences for cognition, and that these findings may provide pathogenetic links between preclinical and epidemiological studies associating MIA with psychiatric risk in offspring.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Control of Homeostatic Synaptic Plasticity by AKAP-Anchored Kinase and Phosphatase Regulation of Ca2+-Permeable AMPA Receptors</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2863?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal information processing requires multiple forms of synaptic plasticity mediated by NMDARs and AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs). These plasticity mechanisms include long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), which are Hebbian, homosynaptic mechanisms locally regulating synaptic strength of specific inputs, and homeostatic synaptic scaling, which is a heterosynaptic mechanism globally regulating synaptic strength across all inputs. In many cases, LTP and homeostatic scaling regulate AMPAR subunit composition to increase synaptic strength via incorporation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-permeable receptors (CP-AMPAR) containing GluA1, but lacking GluA2, subunits. Previous work by our group and others demonstrated that anchoring of the kinase PKA and the phosphatase calcineurin (CaN) to A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) 150 play opposing roles in regulation of GluA1 Ser845 phosphorylation and CP-AMPAR synaptic incorporation during hippocampal LTP and LTD. Here, using both male and female knock-in mice that are deficient in PKA or CaN anchoring, we show that AKAP150-anchored PKA and CaN also play novel roles in controlling CP-AMPAR synaptic incorporation during homeostatic plasticity in hippocampal neurons. We found that genetic disruption of AKAP-PKA anchoring prevented increases in Ser845 phosphorylation and CP-AMPAR synaptic recruitment during rapid homeostatic synaptic scaling-up induced by combined blockade of action potential firing and NMDAR activity. In contrast, genetic disruption of AKAP-CaN anchoring resulted in basal increases in Ser845 phosphorylation and CP-AMPAR synaptic activity that blocked subsequent scaling-up by preventing additional CP-AMPAR recruitment. Thus, the balanced, opposing phospho-regulation provided by AKAP-anchored PKA and CaN is essential for control of both Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity mechanisms that require CP-AMPARs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neuronal circuit function is shaped by multiple forms of activity-dependent plasticity that control excitatory synaptic strength, including LTP/LTD that adjusts strength of individual synapses and homeostatic plasticity that adjusts overall strength of all synapses. Mechanisms controlling LTP/LTD and homeostatic plasticity were originally thought to be distinct; however, recent studies suggest that CP-AMPAR phosphorylation regulation is important during both LTP/LTD and homeostatic plasticity. Here we show that CP-AMPAR regulation by the kinase PKA and phosphatase CaN coanchored to the scaffold protein AKAP150, a mechanism previously implicated in LTP/LTD, is also crucial for controlling synaptic strength during homeostatic plasticity. These novel findings significantly expand our understanding of homeostatic plasticity mechanisms and further emphasize how intertwined they are with LTP and LTD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Visual Information Present in Infragranular Layers of Mouse Auditory Cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2854?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The cerebral cortex is a major hub for the convergence and integration of signals from across the sensory modalities; sensory cortices, including primary regions, are no exception. Here we show that visual stimuli influence neural firing in the auditory cortex of awake male and female mice, using multisite probes to sample single units across multiple cortical layers. We demonstrate that visual stimuli influence firing in both primary and secondary auditory cortex. We then determine the laminar location of recording sites through electrode track tracing with fluorescent dye and optogenetic identification using layer-specific markers. Spiking responses to visual stimulation occur deep in auditory cortex and are particularly prominent in layer 6. Visual modulation of firing rate occurs more frequently at areas with secondary-like auditory responses than those with primary-like responses. Auditory cortical responses to drifting visual gratings are not orientation-tuned, unlike visual cortex responses. The deepest cortical layers thus appear to be an important locus for cross-modal integration in auditory cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The deepest layers of the auditory cortex are often considered its most enigmatic, possessing a wide range of cell morphologies and atypical sensory responses. Here we show that, in mouse auditory cortex, these layers represent a locus of cross-modal convergence, containing many units responsive to visual stimuli. Our results suggest that this visual signal conveys the presence and timing of a stimulus rather than specifics about that stimulus, such as its orientation. These results shed light on both how and what types of cross-modal information is integrated at the earliest stages of sensory cortical processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neural Decoding of Bistable Sounds Reveals an Effect of Intention on Perceptual Organization</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2844?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Auditory signals arrive at the ear as a mixture that the brain must decompose into distinct sources based to a large extent on acoustic properties of the sounds. An important question concerns whether listeners have voluntary control over how many sources they perceive. This has been studied using pure high (H) and low (L) tones presented in the repeating pattern HLH-HLH-, which can form a bistable percept heard either as an integrated whole (HLH-) or as segregated into high (H-H-) and low (-L-) sequences. Although instructing listeners to try to integrate or segregate sounds affects reports of what they hear, this could reflect a response bias rather than a perceptual effect. We had human listeners (15 males, 12 females) continuously report their perception of such sequences and recorded neural activity using MEG. During neutral listening, a classifier trained on patterns of neural activity distinguished between periods of integrated and segregated perception. In other conditions, participants tried to influence their perception by allocating attention either to the whole sequence or to a subset of the sounds. They reported hearing the desired percept for a greater proportion of time than when listening neutrally. Critically, neural activity supported these reports; stimulus-locked brain responses in auditory cortex were more likely to resemble the signature of segregation when participants tried to hear segregation than when attempting to perceive integration. These results indicate that listeners can influence how many sound sources they perceive, as reflected in neural responses that track both the input and its perceptual organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Can we consciously influence our perception of the external world? We address this question using sound sequences that can be heard either as coming from a single source or as two distinct auditory streams. Listeners reported spontaneous changes in their perception between these two interpretations while we recorded neural activity to identify signatures of such integration and segregation. They also indicated that they could, to some extent, choose between these alternatives. This claim was supported by corresponding changes in responses in auditory cortex. By linking neural and behavioral correlates of perception, we demonstrate that the number of objects that we perceive can depend not only on the physical attributes of our environment, but also on how we intend to experience it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Multisensory Integration Enhances Temporal Coding in Ventral Cochlear Nucleus Bushy Cells</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2832?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Temporal coding of auditory stimuli is critical for understanding communication signals. The bushy cell, a major output neuron of the ventral cochlear nucleus, can &quot;phase-lock&quot; precisely to pure tones and the envelopes of complex stimuli. Bushy cells are also putative recipients of brainstem somatosensory projections and could therefore play a role in perception of communication signals because multisensory integration is required for such complex sound processing. Here, we examine the role of multisensory integration in temporal coding in bushy cells by activating the spinal trigeminal nucleus (Sp5) while recording responses from bushy cells. In normal-hearing guinea pigs of either sex, bushy cell single unit responses to amplitude-modulated (AM) broadband noise were compared with those in the presence of preceding Sp5 electrical stimulation (i.e., bimodal stimuli). Responses to the AM stimuli were also compared with those obtained 45 min after the bimodal stimulation. Bimodal auditory–Sp5 stimulation resulted in enhanced envelope coding for low modulation frequencies, which persisted for up to 45 min. AM detection thresholds were significantly improved 45 min after bimodal auditory–Sp5 stimulation, but not during bimodal auditory–Sp5 stimulation. Anterograde labeling of Sp5 projections was found within the dendritic fields of bushy cells and their inhibitory interneurons, D-stellate cells. Therefore, enhanced AM responses and improved AM sensitivity of bushy cells were likely facilitated by Sp5 neurons through monosynaptic excitatory projections and indirect inhibitory projections. These somatosensory projections may be involved in the improved perception of communication stimuli with multisensory stimulation, consistent with psychophysical studies in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Multisensory integration is crucial for sensory coding because it improves sensitivity to unimodal stimuli and enhances responses to external stimuli. Although multisensory integration has typically been described in the cerebral cortex, the cochlear nucleus in the brainstem is also innervated by multiple sensory systems, including the somatosensory and auditory systems. Here, we showed that convergence of these two sensory systems in the cochlear nucleus results in improved temporal coding in bushy cells, principal output neurons that send projections to higher auditory structures. The improved temporal coding instilled by bimodal auditory–Sp5 stimulation may be important in priming the neurons for coding biologically relevant sounds such as communication signals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Missense Mutation A384P Associated with Human Hyperekplexia Reveals a Desensitization Site of Glycine Receptors</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2818?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hyperekplexia, an inherited neuronal disorder characterized by exaggerated startle responses with unexpected sensory stimuli, is caused by dysfunction of glycinergic inhibitory transmission. From analysis of newly identified human hyperekplexia mutations in the glycine receptor (GlyR) α1 subunit, we found that an alanine-to-proline missense mutation (A384P) resulted in substantially higher desensitization level and lower agonist sensitivity of homomeric α1 GlyRs when expressed in HEK cells. The incorporation of the β subunit fully reversed the reduction in agonist sensitivity and partially reversed the desensitization of α1&lt;sup&gt;A384P&lt;/sup&gt;. The heteromeric α1&lt;sup&gt;A384P&lt;/sup&gt;β GlyRs showed enhanced desensitization but unchanged agonist-induced maximum responses, surface expression, main channel conductance, and voltage dependence compared with that of the wild-type α1β (α1&lt;sup&gt;WT&lt;/sup&gt;β) GlyRs. Coexpression of the R392H and A384P mutant α1 subunits, which mimic the expression of the compound heterozygous mutation in a hyperekplexia patient, resulted in channel properties similar to those with α1&lt;sup&gt;A384P&lt;/sup&gt; subunit expression alone. In comparison, another human hyperekplexia mutation α1&lt;sup&gt;P250T&lt;/sup&gt;, which was previously reported to enhance desensitization, caused a strong reduction in maximum currents in addition to the altered desensitization. These results were further confirmed by overexpression of α1&lt;sup&gt;P250T&lt;/sup&gt; or α1&lt;sup&gt;A384P&lt;/sup&gt; subunits in cultured neurons isolated from SD rats of either sex. Moreover, the IPSC-like responses of cells expressing α1&lt;sup&gt;A384P&lt;/sup&gt;β induced by repeated glycine pulses showed a stronger frequency-dependent reduction than those expressing α1&lt;sup&gt;WT&lt;/sup&gt;β. Together, our findings demonstrate that A384 is associated with the desensitization site of the α1 subunit and its proline mutation produced enhanced desensitization of GlyRs, which contributes to the pathogenesis of human hyperekplexia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Human startle disease is caused by impaired synaptic inhibition in the brainstem and spinal cord, which is due to either direct loss of GlyR channel function or reduced number of synaptic GlyRs. Considering that fast decay kinetics of GlyR-mediated inhibitory synaptic responses, the question was raised whether altered desensitization of GlyRs will cause dysfunction of glycine transmission and disease phenotypes. Here, we found that the α1 subunit mutation A384P, identified from startle disease patients, results in enhanced desensitization and leads to rapidly decreasing responses in the mutant GlyRs when they are activated repeatedly by the synaptic-like simulation. These observations suggest that the enhanced desensitization of postsynaptic GlyRs could be the primary pathogenic mechanism of human startle disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Longitudinal Trajectory of Default Mode Network Connectivity in Healthy Older Adults Varies As a Function of Age and Is Associated with Changes in Episodic Memory and Processing Speed</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2809?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The default mode network (DMN) supports memory functioning and may be sensitive to preclinical Alzheimer's pathology. Little is known, however, about the longitudinal trajectory of this network's intrinsic functional connectivity (FC). In this study, we evaluated longitudinal FC in 111 cognitively normal older human adults (ages 49–87, 46 women/65 men), 92 of whom had at least three task-free fMRI scans (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 353 total scans). Whole-brain FC and three DMN subnetworks were assessed: (1) within-DMN, (2) between anterior and posterior DMN, and (3) between medial temporal lobe network and posterior DMN. Linear mixed-effects models demonstrated significant baseline age &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; time interactions, indicating a nonlinear trajectory. There was a trend toward increasing FC between ages 50–66 and significantly accelerating declines after age 74. A similar interaction was observed for whole-brain FC. &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; status did not predict baseline connectivity or change in connectivity. After adjusting for network volume, changes in within-DMN connectivity were specifically associated with changes in episodic memory and processing speed but not working memory or executive functions. The relationship with processing speed was attenuated after covarying for white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and whole-brain FC, whereas within-DMN connectivity remained associated with memory above and beyond WMH and whole-brain FC. Whole-brain and DMN FC exhibit a nonlinear trajectory, with more rapid declines in older age and possibly increases in connectivity early in the aging process. Within-DMN connectivity is a marker of episodic memory performance even among cognitively healthy older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Default mode network and whole-brain connectivity, measured using task-free fMRI, changed nonlinearly as a function of age, with some suggestion of early increases in connectivity. For the first time, longitudinal changes in DMN connectivity were shown to correlate with changes in episodic memory, whereas volume changes in relevant brain regions did not. This relationship was not accounted for by white matter hyperintensities or mean whole-brain connectivity. Functional connectivity may be an early biomarker of changes in aging but should be used with caution given its nonmonotonic nature, which could complicate interpretation. Future studies investigating longitudinal network changes should consider whole-brain changes in connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Protein Kinase C Enhances Electrical Synaptic Transmission by Acting on Junctional and Postsynaptic Ca2+ Currents</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2796?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;By synchronizing neuronal activity, electrical transmission influences the coordination, pattern, and/or frequency of firing. In the hemaphroditic marine-snail, &lt;i&gt;Aplysia calfornica&lt;/i&gt;, the neuroendocrine bag cell neurons use electrical synapses to synchronize a 30 min afterdischarge of action potentials for the release of reproductive hormone. During the afterdischarge, protein kinase C (PKC) is activated, although its impact on bag cell neuron electrical transmission is unknown. This was investigated here by monitoring electrical synapses between paired cultured bag cell neurons using dual whole-cell recording. Voltage clamp revealed a largely voltage-independent junctional current, which was enhanced by treating with a PKC activator, PMA, before recording. We also examined the transfer of presynaptic action potential-like waveforms (generated in voltage clamp) to the postsynaptic cell (measured in current clamp). For control pairs, the presynaptic spike-like waveforms mainly evoked electrotonic potentials; however, when PKC was triggered, these stimuli consistently produced postsynaptic action potentials. To assess whether this involved changes to postsynaptic responsiveness, single bag cell neurons were injected with junctional-like current mimicking that evoked by a presynaptic action potential. Unlike control neurons, which were less likely to spike, cells in PMA always fired action potentials to the junctional-like current. Furthermore, PKC activation increased a postsynaptic voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; current, which was recruited even by modest depolarization associated with an electrotonic potential. Whereas PKC inhibits gap junctions in most systems, bag cell neurons are rather unique, as the kinase potentiates the electrical synapse; in turn, this synergizes with augmented postsynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; current to promote synchronous firing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Electrical coupling is a fundamental form of communication. For the bag cell neurons of &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt;, electrical synapses coordinate a prolonged burst of action potentials known as the afterdischarge. We looked at how protein kinase C, which is upregulated with the afterdischarge, influences information transfer across the synapse. The kinase activation increased junctional current, a remarkable finding given that this enzyme is largely considered inhibitory for gap junctions. There was also an augmentation in the ability of a presynaptic neuron to provoke postsynaptic action potentials. This increased excitability was, in part, due to enhanced postsynaptic voltage-dependent Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; current. Thus, protein kinase C improves the fidelity of electrotonic transmission and promotes synchronous firing by modulating both junctional and membrane conductances.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Rescue of Learning and Memory Deficits in the Human Nonsyndromic Intellectual Disability Cereblon Knock-Out Mouse Model by Targeting the AMP-Activated Protein Kinase-mTORC1 Translational Pathway</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2780?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A homozygous nonsense mutation in the cereblon (&lt;i&gt;CRBN&lt;/i&gt;) gene results in autosomal recessive, nonsyndromic intellectual disability that is devoid of other phenotypic features, suggesting a critical role of CRBN in mediating learning and memory. In this study, we demonstrate that adult male &lt;i&gt;Crbn&lt;/i&gt; knock-out (&lt;i&gt;Crbn&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;KO&lt;/sup&gt;) mice exhibit deficits in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tasks that are recapitulated by focal knock-out of Crbn in the adult dorsal hippocampus, with no changes in social or repetitive behavior. Cellular studies identify deficits in long-term potentiation at Schaffer collateral CA1 synapses. We further show that &lt;i&gt;Crbn&lt;/i&gt; is robustly expressed in the mouse hippocampus and &lt;i&gt;Crbn&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;KO&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibit hyperphosphorylated levels of AMPKα (Thr172). Examination of processes downstream of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) finds that &lt;i&gt;Crbn&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;KO&lt;/sup&gt; mice have a selective impairment in mediators of the mTORC1 translation initiation pathway in parallel with lower protein levels of postsynaptic density glutamatergic proteins and higher levels of excitatory presynaptic markers in the hippocampus with no change in markers of the unfolded protein response or autophagy pathways. Acute pharmacological inhibition of AMPK activity in adult &lt;i&gt;Crbn&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;KO&lt;/sup&gt; mice rescues learning and memory deficits and normalizes hippocampal mTORC1 activity and postsynaptic glutamatergic proteins without altering excitatory presynaptic markers. Thus, this study identifies that loss of &lt;i&gt;Crbn&lt;/i&gt; results in learning, memory, and synaptic defects as a consequence of exaggerated AMPK activity, inhibition of mTORC1 signaling, and decreased glutamatergic synaptic proteins. Thus, &lt;i&gt;Crbn&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;KO&lt;/sup&gt; mice serve as an ideal model of intellectual disability to further explore molecular mechanisms of learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Intellectual disability (ID) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders. The cereblon (&lt;i&gt;CRBN&lt;/i&gt;) gene has been linked to autosomal recessive, nonsyndromic ID, characterized by an intelligence quotient between 50 and 70 but devoid of other phenotypic features, making cereblon an ideal protein for the study of the fundamental aspects of learning and memory. Here, using the cereblon knock-out mouse model, we show that cereblon deficiency disrupts learning, memory, and synaptic function via AMP-activated protein kinase hyperactivity, downregulation of mTORC1, and dysregulation of excitatory synapses, with no changes in social or repetitive behaviors, consistent with findings in the human population. This establishes the cereblon knock-out mouse as a model of pure ID without the confounding behavioral phenotypes associated with other current models of ID.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Visual Aversive Learning Compromises Sensory Discrimination</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2766?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aversive learning is thought to modulate perceptual thresholds, which can lead to overgeneralization. However, it remains undetermined whether this modulation is domain specific or a general effect. Moreover, despite the unique role of the visual modality in human perception, it is unclear whether this aspect of aversive learning exists in this modality. The current study was designed to examine the effect of visual aversive outcomes on the perception of basic visual and auditory features. We tested the ability of healthy participants, both males and females, to discriminate between neutral stimuli, before and after visual learning. In each experiment, neutral stimuli were associated with aversive images in an experimental group and with neutral images in a control group. Participants demonstrated a deterioration in discrimination (higher discrimination thresholds) only after aversive learning. This deterioration was measured for both auditory (tone frequency) and visual (orientation and contrast) features. The effect was replicated in five different experiments and lasted for at least 24 h. fMRI neural responses and pupil size were also measured during learning. We showed an increase in neural activations in the anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and amygdala during aversive compared with neutral learning. Interestingly, the early visual cortex showed increased brain activity during aversive compared with neutral context trials, with identical visual information. Our findings imply the existence of a central multimodal mechanism, which modulates early perceptual properties, following exposure to negative situations. Such a mechanism could contribute to abnormal responses that underlie anxiety states, even in new and safe environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Using a visual aversive-learning paradigm, we found deteriorated discrimination abilities for visual and auditory stimuli that were associated with visual aversive stimuli. We showed increased neural activations in the anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and amygdala during aversive learning, compared with neutral learning. Importantly, similar findings were also evident in the early visual cortex during trials with aversive/neutral context, but with identical visual information. The demonstration of this phenomenon in the visual modality is important, as it provides support to the notion that aversive learning can influence perception via a central mechanism, independent of input modality. Given the dominance of the visual system in human perception, our findings hold relevance to daily life, as well as imply a potential etiology for anxiety disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Primacy of Spatial Context in the Neural Representation of Events</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2755?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Some theories of episodic memory hypothesize that spatial context plays a fundamental role in episodic memory, acting as a scaffold on which episodes are constructed. A prediction based on this hypothesis is that spatial context should play a primary role in the neural representation of an event. To test this hypothesis in humans, male and female participants imagined events, composed of familiar locations, people, and objects, during an fMRI scan. We used multivoxel pattern analysis to determine the neural areas in which events could be discriminated based on each feature. We found that events could be discriminated according to their location in areas throughout the autobiographical memory network, including the parahippocampal cortex and posterior hippocampus, retrosplenial cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and medial prefrontal cortex. Events were also discriminable based on person and object features, but in fewer regions. Comparing classifier performance in regions involved in memory for scenes and events demonstrated that the location of an event was more accurately classified than the person or object involved. These results support theories that suggest that spatial context is a prominent defining feature of episodic memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Remembered and imagined events are complex, consisting of many elements, including people, objects, and locations. In this study, we sought to determine how these types of elements differentially contribute to how the brain represents an event. Participants imagined events consisting of familiar locations, people, and objects (e.g., kitchen, mom, umbrella) while their brain activity was recorded with fMRI. We found that the neural patterns of activity in brain regions associated with spatial and episodic memory could distinguish events based on their location, and to some extent, based on the people and objects involved. These results suggest that the spatial context of an event plays an important role in how an event is represented in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Mind-Wandering in People with Hippocampal Damage</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2745?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Subjective inner experiences, such as mind-wandering, represent the fundaments of human cognition. Although the precise function of mind-wandering is still debated, it is increasingly acknowledged to have influence across cognition on processes such as future planning, creative thinking, and problem-solving and even on depressive rumination and other mental health disorders. Recently, there has been important progress in characterizing mind-wandering and identifying the associated neural networks. Two prominent features of mind-wandering are mental time travel and visuospatial imagery, which are often linked with the hippocampus. People with selective bilateral hippocampal damage cannot vividly recall events from their past, envision their future, or imagine fictitious scenes. This raises the question of whether the hippocampus plays a causal role in mind-wandering and, if so, in what way. Leveraging a unique opportunity to shadow people (all males) with bilateral hippocampal damage for several days, we examined, for the first time, what they thought about spontaneously, without direct task demands. We found that they engaged in as much mind-wandering as control participants. However, whereas controls thought about the past, present, and future, imagining vivid visual scenes, hippocampal damage resulted in thoughts primarily about the present comprising verbally mediated semantic knowledge. These findings expose the hippocampus as a key pillar in the neural architecture of mind-wandering and also reveal its impact beyond episodic memory, placing it at the heart of our mental life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Humans tend to mind-wander ~30–50% of their waking time. Two prominent features of this pervasive form of thought are mental time travel and visuospatial imagery, which are often associated with the hippocampus. To examine whether the hippocampus plays a causal role in mind-wandering, we examined the frequency and phenomenology of mind-wandering in patients with selective bilateral hippocampal damage. We found that they engaged in as much mind-wandering as controls. However, hippocampal damage changed the form and content of mind-wandering from flexible, episodic, and scene based to abstract, semanticized, and verbal. These findings expose the hippocampus as a key pillar in the neural architecture of mind-wandering and reveal its impact beyond episodic memory, placing it at the heart of our mental life.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Large Visual Stimuli Induce Two Distinct Gamma Oscillations in Primate Visual Cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2730?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent studies have shown the existence of two gamma rhythms in the hippocampus subserving different functions but, to date, primate studies in primary visual cortex have reported a single gamma rhythm. Here, we show that large visual stimuli induce a slow gamma (25–45 Hz) in area V1 of two awake adult female bonnet monkeys and in the EEG of 15 human subjects (7 males and 8 females), in addition to the traditionally known fast gamma (45–70 Hz). The two rhythms had different tuning characteristics for stimulus orientation, contrast, drift speed, and size. Further, fast gamma had short latency, strongly entrained spikes and was coherent over short distances, reflecting short-range processing, whereas slow gamma appeared to reflect long-range processing. Together, two gamma rhythms can potentially provide better coding or communication mechanisms and a more comprehensive biomarker for diagnosis of mental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Gamma rhythm has been associated with high-level cognitive functions such as attention and feature binding and has been reported to be abnormal in brain disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. Unlike previous studies that have shown a single gamma rhythm in the primate visual cortex, we found that large visual gratings induce two distinct gamma oscillations in both monkey LFP and human EEG. These rhythms, termed slow (25–45 Hz) and fast (45–70 Hz), exhibited distinct tuning preferences, latencies, and coherence profiles, potentially reflecting processing at two different ranges. Multiple gamma oscillations in visual cortex may provide a richer representation of external visual stimuli and could be used for developing brain–machine interfacing applications and screening tests for neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Combinatorial Effects of Alpha- and Gamma-Protocadherins on Neuronal Survival and Dendritic Self-Avoidance</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2713?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The clustered protocadherins (Pcdhs) comprise 58 cadherin-related proteins encoded by three tandemly arrayed gene clusters, &lt;i&gt;Pcdh&lt;/i&gt;-α, &lt;i&gt;Pcdh&lt;/i&gt;-β, and &lt;i&gt;Pcdh&lt;/i&gt;- (&lt;i&gt;Pcdha&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pcdhb&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Pcdhg&lt;/i&gt;, respectively). Pcdh isoforms from different clusters are combinatorially expressed in neurons. They form multimers that interact homophilically and mediate a variety of developmental processes, including neuronal survival, synaptic maintenance, axonal tiling, and dendritic self-avoidance. Most studies have analyzed clusters individually. Here, we assessed functional interactions between &lt;i&gt;Pcdha&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pcdhg&lt;/i&gt; clusters. To circumvent neonatal lethality associated with deletion of &lt;i&gt;Pcdhgs&lt;/i&gt;, we used Crispr-Cas9 genome editing in mice to combine a constitutive &lt;i&gt;Pcdha&lt;/i&gt; mutant allele with a conditional &lt;i&gt;Pcdhg&lt;/i&gt; allele. We analyzed roles of Pcdhas and Pcdhgs in the retina and cerebellum from mice (both sexes) lacking one or both clusters. In retina, Pcdhgs are essential for survival of inner retinal neurons and dendritic self-avoidance of starburst amacrine cells, whereas Pcdhas are dispensable for both processes. Deletion of both &lt;i&gt;Pcdha&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pcdhg&lt;/i&gt; clusters led to far more dramatic defects in survival and self-avoidance than &lt;i&gt;Pcdhg&lt;/i&gt; deletion alone. Comparisons of an allelic series of mutants support the conclusion that Pcdhas and Pcdhgs function together in a dose-dependent and cell-type-specific manner to provide a critical threshold of Pcdh activity. In the cerebellum, Pcdhas and Pcdhgs also cooperate to mediate self-avoidance of Purkinje cell dendrites, with modest but significant defects in either single mutant and dramatic defects in the double mutant. Together, our results demonstrate complex patterns of redundancy between Pcdh clusters and the importance of Pcdh cluster diversity in postnatal CNS development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The formation of neural circuits requires diversification and combinatorial actions of cell surface proteins. Prominent among them are the clustered protocadherins (Pcdhs), a family of ~60 neuronal recognition molecules. Pcdhs are encoded by three closely linked gene clusters called &lt;i&gt;Pcdh&lt;/i&gt;-α, &lt;i&gt;Pcdh&lt;/i&gt;-β, and &lt;i&gt;Pcdh&lt;/i&gt;-. The Pcdhs mediate a variety of developmental processes, including neuronal survival, synaptic maintenance, and spatial patterning of axons and dendrites. Most studies to date have been limited to single clusters. Here, we used genome editing to assess interactions between &lt;i&gt;Pcdh&lt;/i&gt;-α and &lt;i&gt;Pcdh&lt;/i&gt;- gene clusters. We examined two regions of the CNS, the retina and cerebellum and show that the 14 α-Pcdhs and 22 -Pcdhs act synergistically to mediate neuronal survival and dendrite patterning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Basolateral Amygdala Inputs to the Medial Entorhinal Cortex Selectively Modulate the Consolidation of Spatial and Contextual Learning</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2698?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Although evidence suggests that the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and dorsal hippocampus (DH) work together to influence the consolidation of spatial/contextual learning, the circuit mechanism by which the BLA selectively modulates spatial/contextual memory consolidation is not clear. The medial entorhinal cortex (mEC) is a critical region in the hippocampus-based system for processing spatial information. As an efferent target of the BLA, the mEC is a candidate by which the BLA influences the consolidation of such learning. To address several questions regarding this issue, male Sprague Dawley rats received optogenetic manipulations of different BLA afferents immediately after training in different learning tasks. Optogenetic stimulation of the BLA–mEC pathway using ChR2(E123A) after spatial and cued-response Barnes maze training enhanced and impaired retention, respectively, whereas optical inhibition of the pathway using eNpHR3.0 produced trends in the opposite direction. Similar stimulation of the BLA-posterior dorsal striatum pathway had no effect. BLA–mEC stimulation also selectively enhanced retention for the contextual, but not foot shock, component of a modified contextual fear-conditioning procedure. In both sets of experiments, only stimulation using bursts of 8 Hz light pulses significantly enhanced retention, suggesting the importance of driving activity in this frequency range. An 8 Hz stimulation of the BLA–mEC pathway increased local field potential power in the same frequency range in the mEC and in the DH. Together, the present findings suggest that the BLA modulates the consolidation of spatial/contextual memory via projections to the mEC and that activity within the 8 Hz range is critical for this modulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The mechanism by which the basolateral amygdala (BLA) influences the consolidation of spatial/contextual memory is unknown. Using an optogenetic approach with multiple behavioral procedures, we found that immediate posttraining 8 Hz stimulation of BLA projections to the medial entorhinal cortex (mEC) enhanced retention for spatial/contextual memory, impaired retention for cued-response memory, and had no effect on foot shock learning for contextual fear conditioning. Electrophysiological recordings confirmed that 8 Hz stimulation of this pathway increased activity in the 8 Hz range in the mEC and in the dorsal hippocampus, a region critical for spatial memory consolidation. This suggests that coordinated BLA activity with downstream regions in the 8 Hz activity range immediately after training is important for consolidation of multiple memory forms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Protein Translation in the Nucleus Accumbens Is Dysregulated during Cocaine Withdrawal and Required for Expression of Incubation of Cocaine Craving</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2683?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Exposure to drug-associated cues can induce drug craving and relapse in abstinent addicts. Cue-induced craving that progressively intensifies (&quot;incubates&quot;) during withdrawal from cocaine has been observed in both rats and humans. Building on recent evidence that aberrant protein translation underlies incubation-related adaptations in the NAc, we used male rats to test the hypothesis that translation is dysregulated during cocaine withdrawal and/or when rats express incubated cocaine craving. We found that intra-NAc infusion of anisomycin, a general protein translation inhibitor, or rapamycin, an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin, reduced the expression of incubated cocaine craving, consistent with previous results showing that inhibition of translation in slices normalized the adaptations that maintain incubation. We then examined signaling pathways involved in protein translation using NAc synaptoneurosomes prepared after &amp;gt;47 d of withdrawal from cocaine or saline self-administration, or after withdrawal plus a cue-induced seeking test. The most robust changes were observed following seeking tests. Most notably, we found that eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) and eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) are dephosphorylated when cocaine rats undergo a cue-induced seeking test; both effects are consistent with increased translation during the test. Blocking eIF2α dephosphorylation and thereby restoring its inhibitory influence on translation, via intra-NAc injection of Sal003 just before the test, substantially reduced cocaine seeking. These results are consistent with dysregulation of protein translation in the NAc during cocaine withdrawal, enabling cocaine cues to elicit an aberrant increase in translation that is required for the expression of incubated cocaine craving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cue-induced cocaine craving progressively intensifies (incubates) during withdrawal in both humans and rats. This may contribute to persistent vulnerability to relapse. We previously demonstrated a role for protein translation in synaptic adaptations in the NAc closely linked to incubation. Here, we tested the hypothesis that translation is dysregulated during cocaine withdrawal, and this contributes to incubated craving. Analysis of signaling pathways regulating translation suggested that translation is enhanced when &quot;incubated&quot; rats undergo a cue-induced seeking test. Furthermore, intra-NAc infusions of drugs that inhibit protein translation through different mechanisms reduced expression of incubated cue-induced cocaine seeking. These results demonstrate that the expression of incubation depends on an acute increase in translation that may result from dysregulation of several pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Enhanced Operant Extinction and Prefrontal Excitability in a Mouse Model of Angelman Syndrome</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2671?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Angelman syndrome (AS), a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with intellectual disability, is caused by loss of maternal allele expression of &lt;i&gt;UBE3A&lt;/i&gt; in neurons. Mouse models of AS faithfully recapitulate disease phenotypes across multiple domains, including behavior. Yet in AS, there has been only limited study of behaviors encoded by the prefrontal cortex, a region broadly involved in executive function and cognition. Because cognitive impairment is a core feature of AS, it is critical to develop behavioral readouts of prefrontal circuit function in AS mouse models. One such readout is behavioral extinction, which has been well described mechanistically and relies upon prefrontal circuits in rodents. Here we report exaggerated operant extinction in male AS model mice, concomitant with enhanced excitability in medial prefrontal neurons from male and female AS model mice. Abnormal behavior was specific to operant extinction, as two other prefrontally dependent tasks (cued fear extinction and visuospatial discrimination) were largely normal in AS model mice. Inducible deletion of &lt;i&gt;Ube3a&lt;/i&gt; during adulthood was not sufficient to drive abnormal extinction, supporting the hypothesis that there is an early critical period for development of cognitive phenotypes in AS. This work represents the first formal experimental analysis of prefrontal circuit function in AS, and identifies operant extinction as a useful experimental paradigm for modeling cognitive aspects of AS in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Prefrontal cortex encodes &quot;high-level&quot; cognitive processes. Thus, understanding prefrontal function is critical in neurodevelopmental disorders where cognitive impairment is highly penetrant. Angelman syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with speech and motor impairments, an outwardly happy demeanor, and intellectual disability. We describe a behavioral phenotype in a mouse model of Angelman syndrome and related abnormalities in prefrontal cortex function. We hypothesize that robust and reliable prefrontally encoded behavior may be used to model cognitive impairments in Angelman syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Inferring directional connectivity from point process data of multiple
elements is desired in various scientific fields such as neuroscience,
geography, economics, etc. Here, we propose an inference procedure for this
goal based on the kinetic Ising model. The procedure is composed of two steps:
(1) determination of the time-bin size for transforming the point-process data
to discrete time binary data and (2) screening of relevant couplings from the
estimated networks. For these, we develop simple methods based on information
theory and computational statistics. Applications to data from artificial and
\textit{in vitro} neuronal networks show that the proposed procedure performs
fairly well when identifying relevant couplings, including the discrimination
of their signs, with low computational cost. These results highlight the
potential utility of the kinetic Ising model to analyze real interacting
systems with event occurrences.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04566</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs) are neural oscillations from
the parietal and occipital regions of the brain that are evoked from flickering
visual stimuli. SSVEPs are robust signals measurable in the
electroencephalogram (EEG) and are commonly used in brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs). However, methods for high-accuracy decoding of SSVEPs usually require
hand-crafted approaches that leverage domain-specific knowledge of the stimulus
signals, such as specific temporal frequencies in the visual stimuli and their
relative spatial arrangement. When this knowledge is unavailable, such as when
SSVEP signals are acquired asynchronously, such approaches tend to fail. In
this paper, we show how a compact convolutional neural network (Compact-CNN),
which only requires raw EEG signals for automatic feature extraction, can be
used to decode signals from a 12-class SSVEP dataset without the need for any
domain-specific knowledge or calibration data. We report across subject mean
accuracy of approximately 80% (chance being 8.3%) and show this is
substantially better than current state-of-the-art hand-crafted approaches
using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and Combined-CCA. Furthermore, we
analyze our Compact-CNN to examine the underlying feature representation,
discovering that the deep learner extracts additional phase and amplitude
related features associated with the structure of the dataset. We discuss how
our Compact-CNN shows promise for BCI applications that allow users to freely
gaze/attend to any stimulus at any time (e.g., asynchronous BCI) as well as
provides a method for analyzing SSVEP signals in a way that might augment our
understanding about the basic processing in the visual cortex.

	<content:encoded>Measurements of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), recorded using electroencephalography during different phases of movement, have been fundamental in understanding the neurophysiological changes related to motor control. SEP recordings have also been used to investigate adaptive plasticity changes in somatosensory processing related to active and observational motor learning tasks. Combining noninvasive brain stimulation with SEP recordings and intracranial SEP depth recordings, including recordings from deep brain stimulation electrodes, has been critical in identifying neural areas involved in specific temporal stages of somatosensory processing.</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Maturation Trajectories of Cortical Resting-State Networks Depend on the Mediating Frequency Band. (arXiv:1803.04364v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04364</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The functional significance of resting state networks and their abnormal
manifestations in psychiatric disorders are firmly established, as is the
importance of the cortical rhythms in mediating these networks. Resting state
networks are known to undergo substantial reorganization from childhood to
adulthood, but whether distinct cortical rhythms, which are generated by
separable neural mechanisms and are often manifested abnormally in psychiatric
conditions, mediate maturation differentially, remains unknown. Using
magnetoencephalography (MEG) to map frequency band specific maturation of
resting state networks from age 7 to 29 in 162 participants (31 independent),
we found significant changes with age in networks mediated by the beta
(13-30Hz) and gamma (31-80Hz) bands. More specifically, gamma band mediated
networks followed an expected asymptotic trajectory, but beta band mediated
networks followed a linear trajectory. Network integration increased with age
in gamma band mediated networks, while local segregation increased with age in
beta band mediated networks. Spatially, the hubs that changed in importance
with age in the beta band mediated networks had relatively little overlap with
those that showed the greatest changes in the gamma band mediated networks.
These findings are relevant for our understanding of the neural mechanisms of
cortical maturation, in both typical and atypical development.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04363</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The epileptic mechanism is postulated as that an animal's neurons gradually
diminish their inhibition function coupled with enhanced excitation when an
epileptic event is approaching. Calcium imaging technique is designed to
directly record brain-wide neurons activity in order to discover the underlying
epileptic mechanism. In this paper, using one brain-wide calcium imaging video
of Zebrafish, we compute dynamic pattern information of the epileptic
mechanism, and devise three graphical displays to show the visible functional
aspect of epileptic mechanism over five inter-ictal periods. The foundation of
our data-driven computations for such dynamic patterns relies on one universal
phenomenon discovered across 696 informative pixels. This universality is that
each pixel's progressive 5-percentile process oscillates in an irregular
fashion at first, but, after the middle point of inter-ictal period, the
oscillation is replaced by a steady increasing trend. Such dynamic patterns are
collectively transformed into a visible systemic change-point as an early
warning signal (EWS) of an incoming epileptic event. We conclude through the
graphic displays that pattern information extracted from the calcium imaging
video realistically reveals the Zebrafish's authentic epileptic mechanism.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04236</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, the parameter estimation problem for a multi-timescale
adaptive threshold (MAT) neuronal model is investigated. By manipulating the
system dynamics, which comprise of a non-resetting leaky integrator coupled
with an adaptive threshold, the threshold voltage can be obtained as a
realizable model that is linear in the unknown parameters. This linearly
parametrized realizable model is then utilized inside a prediction error based
framework to identify the threshold parameters with the purpose of predicting
single neuron precise firing times. The iterative linear least squares
estimation scheme is evaluated using both synthetic data obtained from an exact
model as well as experimental data obtained from in vitro rat somatosensory
cortical neurons. Results show the ability of this approach to fit the MAT
model to different types of fluctuating reference data. The performance of the
proposed approach is seen to be superior when comparing with existing
identification approaches used by the neuronal community.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04085</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A quantitative understanding of how sensory signals are transformed into
motor outputs places useful constraints on brain function and helps reveal the
brain's underlying computations. We investigate how the nematode C. elegans
responds to time-varying mechanosensory signals using a high-throughput
optogenetic assay and automated behavior quantification. In the prevailing
picture of the touch circuit, the animal's behavior is determined by which
neurons are stimulated and by the stimulus amplitude. In contrast, we find that
the nervous system is tuned to temporal properties of mechanosensory signals,
like its integral and derivative, that extend over many seconds. Mechanosensory
signals, even in the same neurons, can be tailored to elicit different
behavioral responses. Moreover, we find that the animal's response also depends
on its behavioral context. Most dramatically, the animal ignores all tested
mechanosensory stimuli during turns. Finally, we present a linear-nonlinear
model that predicts the animal's behavioral response to stimulus.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03940</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The current-voltage (I-V) conversion characterizes the physiology of cellular
microdomains and reflects cellular communication, excitability, and electrical
transduction. Yet deriving such I-V laws remains a major challenge in most
cellular microdomains due to their small sizes and the difficulty of accessing
voltage with a high nanometer precision. We present here novel analytical
relations derived for different numbers of ionic species inside a neuronal
micro/nano-domains, such as dendritic spines. When a steady-state current is
injected, we find a large deviation from the classical Ohm's law, showing that
the spine neck resistance is insuficent to characterize electrical properties.
For a constricted spine neck, modeled by a hyperboloid, we obtain a new I-V law
that illustrates the consequences of narrow passages on electrical conduction.
Finally, during a fast current transient, the local voltage is modulated by the
distance between activated voltage-gated channels. To conclude,
electro-diffusion laws can now be used to interpret voltage distribution in
neuronal microdomains.

	<content:encoded>Current antiaging strategies focusing on druggable targets have met with relatively limited success to date. Replacement of cells, tissues, and organs could provide an alternative means for targeting age-induced damage and potentially eliminating some of it. However, before this is a viable option, numerous challenges need to be addressed. Most notably, whether the brain, which defines our self-identity, is amenable to replacement therapies is unclear. Here, we consider whether progressive cell replacement is a potential approach to reverse brain aging without grossly altering function.</content:encoded>

Chemokine receptors, a subclass of G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), play essential roles in the human immune system, they are involved in cancer metastasis as well as in HIV-infection. A plethora of studies show that homo- and heterodimers or even higher order oligomers of the chemokine receptors CXCR4, CCR5, and CCR2 modulate receptor function. In addition, membrane cholesterol affects chemokine receptor activity. However, structural information about homo- and heterodimers formed by chemokine receptors and their interplay with cholesterol is limited. Here, we report homo- and heterodimer configurations of the chemokine receptors CXCR4, CCR5, and CCR2 at atomistic detail, as obtained from thousands of molecular dynamics simulations. The observed homodimerization patterns were similar for the closely related CC chemokine receptors, yet they differed significantly between the CC receptors and CXCR4. Despite their high sequence identity, cholesterol modulated the CC homodimer interfaces in a subtype-specific manner. Chemokine receptor heterodimers display distinct dimerization patterns for CXCR4/CCR5 and CXCR4/CCR2. Furthermore, associations between CXCR4 and CCR5 reveal an increased cholesterol-sensitivity as compared to CXCR4/CCR2 heterodimerization patterns. This work provides a first comprehensive structural overview over the complex interaction network between chemokine receptors and indicates how heterodimerization and the interaction with the membrane environment diversifies the function of closely related GPCRs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Hs4EV4VzCNk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

In order to access and filter content of life-science databases, full text search is a widely applied query interface. But its high flexibility and intuitiveness is paid for with potentially imprecise and incomplete query results. To reduce this drawback, query assistance systems suggest those combinations of keywords with the highest potential to match most of the relevant data records. Widespread approaches are syntactic query corrections that avoid misspelling and support expansion of words by suffixes and prefixes. Synonym expansion approaches apply thesauri, ontologies, and query logs. All need laborious curation and maintenance. Furthermore, access to query logs is in general restricted. Approaches that infer related queries by their query profile like research field, geographic location, co-authorship, affiliation etc. require user’s registration and its public accessibility that contradict privacy concerns. To overcome these drawbacks, we implemented LAILAPS-QSM, a machine learning approach that reconstruct possible linguistic contexts of a given keyword query. The context is referred from the text records that are stored in the databases that are going to be queried or extracted for a general purpose query suggestion from PubMed abstracts and UniProt data. The supplied tool suite enables the pre-processing of these text records and the further computation of customized distributed word vectors. The latter are used to suggest alternative keyword queries. An evaluated of the query suggestion quality was done for plant science use cases. Locally present experts enable a cost-efficient quality assessment in the categories trait, biological entity, taxonomy, affiliation, and metabolic function which has been performed using ontology term similarities. LAILAPS-QSM mean information content similarity for 15 representative queries is 0.70, whereas 34% have a score above 0.80. In comparison, the information content similarity for human expert made query suggestions is 0.90. The software is either available as tool set to build and train dedicated query suggestion services or as already trained general purpose RESTful web service. The service uses open interfaces to be seamless embeddable into database frontends. The JAVA implementation uses highly optimized data structures and streamlined code to provide fast and scalable response for web service calls. The source code of LAILAPS-QSM is available under GNU General Public License version 2 in Bitbucket GIT repository: https://bitbucket.org/ipk_bit_team/bioescorte-suggestion&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RJgEJ9jepIw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Relatively slow stochastic gene-state switching in the presence of positive feedback significantly broadens the region of bimodality through stabilizing the uninduced phenotypic state</title>

Within an isogenic population, even in the same extracellular environment, individual cells can exhibit various phenotypic states. The exact role of stochastic gene-state switching regulating the transition among these phenotypic states in a single cell is not fully understood, especially in the presence of positive feedback. Recent high-precision single-cell measurements showed that, at least in bacteria, switching in gene states is slow relative to the typical rates of active transcription and translation. Hence using the &lt;i&gt;lac&lt;/i&gt; operon as an archetype, in such a region of operon-state switching, we present a fluctuating-rate model for this classical gene regulation module, incorporating the more realistic operon-state switching mechanism that was recently elucidated. We found that the positive feedback mechanism induces bistability (referred to as deterministic bistability), and that the parameter range for its occurrence is significantly broadened by stochastic operon-state switching. We further show that in the absence of positive feedback, operon-state switching must be extremely slow to trigger bistability by itself. However, in the presence of positive feedback, which stabilizes the induced state, the relatively slow operon-state switching kinetics within the physiological region are sufficient to stabilize the uninduced state, together generating a broadened parameter region of bistability (referred to as stochastic bistability). We illustrate the opposite phenotype-transition rate dependence upon the operon-state switching rates in the two types of bistability, with the aid of a recently proposed rate formula for fluctuating-rate models. The rate formula also predicts a maximal transition rate in the intermediate region of operon-state switching, which is validated by numerical simulations in our model. Overall, our findings suggest a biological function of transcriptional “variations” among genetically identical cells, for the emergence of bistability and transition between phenotypic states.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jYGTBzywAD4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Cortical oscillations are thought to be involved in many cognitive functions and processes. Several mechanisms have been proposed to regulate oscillations. One prominent but understudied mechanism is gap junction coupling. Gap junctions are ubiquitous in cortex between GABAergic interneurons. Moreover, recent experiments indicate their strength can be modified in an activity-dependent manner, similar to chemical synapses. We hypothesized that activity-dependent gap junction plasticity acts as a mechanism to regulate oscillations in the cortex. We developed a computational model of gap junction plasticity in a recurrent cortical network based on recent experimental findings. We showed that gap junction plasticity can serve as a homeostatic mechanism for oscillations by maintaining a tight balance between two network states: asynchronous irregular activity and synchronized oscillations. This homeostatic mechanism allows for robust communication between neuronal assemblies through two different mechanisms: transient oscillations and frequency modulation. This implies a direct functional role for gap junction plasticity in information transmission in cortex.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fShLgpxE30I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Particle-based simulations of polarity establishment reveal stochastic promotion of turing pattern formation</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/_ccfBadz21A/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Michael Pablo, Samuel A. Ramirez, Timothy C. Elston&lt;/p&gt;

Polarity establishment, the spontaneous generation of asymmetric molecular distributions, is a crucial component of many cellular functions. &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; (yeast) undergoes directed growth during budding and mating, and is an ideal model organism for studying polarization. In yeast and many other cell types, the Rho GTPase Cdc42 is the key molecular player in polarity establishment. During yeast polarization, multiple patches of Cdc42 initially form, then resolve into a single front. Because polarization relies on strong positive feedback, it is likely that the amplification of molecular-level fluctuations underlies the generation of multiple nascent patches. In the absence of spatial cues, these fluctuations may be key to driving polarization. Here we used particle-based simulations to investigate the role of stochastic effects in a Turing-type model of yeast polarity establishment. In the model, reactions take place either between two molecules on the membrane, or between a cytosolic and a membrane-bound molecule. Thus, we developed a computational platform that explicitly simulates molecules at and near the cell membrane, and implicitly handles molecules away from the membrane. To evaluate stochastic effects, we compared particle simulations to deterministic reaction-diffusion equation simulations. Defining macroscopic rate constants that are consistent with the microscopic parameters for this system is challenging, because diffusion occurs in two dimensions and particles exchange between the membrane and cytoplasm. We address this problem by empirically estimating macroscopic rate constants from appropriately designed particle-based simulations. Ultimately, we find that stochastic fluctuations speed polarity establishment and permit polarization in parameter regions predicted to be Turing stable. These effects can operate at Cdc42 abundances expected of yeast cells, and promote polarization on timescales consistent with experimental results. To our knowledge, our work represents the first particle-based simulations of a model for yeast polarization that is based on a Turing mechanism.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_ccfBadz21A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The biological pacemaker approach is an alternative to cardiac electronic pacemakers. Its main objective is to create pacemaking activity from added or modified distribution of spontaneous cells in the myocardium. This paper aims to assess how automaticity strength of pacemaker cells (i.e. their ability to maintain robust spontaneous activity with fast rate and to drive neighboring quiescent cells) and structural linear anisotropy, combined with density and spatial distribution of pacemaker cells, may affect the macroscopic behavior of the biological pacemaker. A stochastic algorithm was used to randomly distribute pacemaker cells, with various densities and spatial distributions, in a semi-continuous mathematical model. Simulations of the model showed that stronger automaticity allows onset of spontaneous activity for lower densities and more homogeneous spatial distributions, displayed more central foci, less variability in cycle lengths and synchronization of electrical activation for similar spatial patterns, but more variability in those same variables for dissimilar spatial patterns. Compared their isotropic counterparts, &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; anisotropic monolayers had less central foci and displayed more variability in cycle lengths and synchronization of electrical activation for both similar and dissimilar spatial patterns. The present study established a link between microscopic structure and macroscopic behavior of the biological pacemaker, and may provide crucial information for optimized biological pacemaker therapies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LN7ks_yuF74&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Single-trial analyses have the potential to uncover meaningful brain dynamics that are obscured when averaging across trials. However, low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can impede the use of single-trial analyses and decoding methods. In this study, we investigate the applicability of a single-trial approach to decode stimulus modality from magnetoencephalographic (MEG) high frequency activity. In order to classify the auditory versus visual presentation of words, we combine beamformer source reconstruction with the random forest classification method. To enable group level inference, the classification is embedded in an across-subjects framework. We show that single-trial gamma SNR allows for good classification performance (accuracy across subjects: 66.44%). This implies that the characteristics of high frequency activity have a high consistency across trials and subjects. The random forest classifier assigned informational value to activity in both auditory and visual cortex with high spatial specificity. Across time, gamma power was most informative during stimulus presentation. Among all frequency bands, the 75 Hz 95 Hz band was the most informative frequency band in visual as well as in auditory areas. Especially in visual areas, a broad range of gamma frequencies (55 Hz 125 Hz) contributed to the successful classification. Thus, we demonstrate the feasibility of single-trial approaches for decoding the stimulus modality across subjects from high frequency activity and describe the discriminative gamma activity in time, frequency, and space.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oy2L5cnKlBc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0433-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The ability to sense time and anticipate events is critical for survival. Learned responses that allow anticipation of the availability of food or water have been intensively studied. While anticipatory behaviors also occur prior to availability of regularly available rewards, there has been relatively little work on anticipation of drugs of abuse, specifically methamphetamine (MA). In the present study, we used a protocol that avoided possible CNS effects of stresses of handling or surgery by testing anticipation of MA availability in animals living in their home cages, with daily voluntary access to the drug at a fixed time of day. Anticipation was operationalized as the amount of wheel running prior to MA availability. Mice were divided into four groups given access to either nebulized MA or water, in early or late day. Animals with access to MA, but not water controls, showed anticipatory activity, with more anticipation in early compared to late day and significant interaction effects. Next, we explored the neural basis of the MA anticipation, using c-FOS expression, in animals euthanized at the usual time of nebulization access. In the dorsomedial hypothalamus and orbitofrontal cortex, the pattern of c-FOS expression paralleled that of anticipatory behavior, with significant main and interaction effects of treatment and time of day. The results for the lateral septum were significant for main effects and marginally significant for interaction effects. These studies suggest that anticipation of MA is associated with activation of brain regions important in circadian timing, emotional regulation and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; A primary function of the brain is to predict future events. Brain regions regulating anticipation of drugs have received little analysis. We studied methamphetamine anticipation in mice living in their home cage and having access to nebulized methamphetamine for 1hr daily via a tunnel to a nebulizing chamber. Mice spontaneously awakened from sleep ~2hr before methamphetamine availability and voluntarily entered the chamber when accessible. This protocol avoided the potential CNS effects associated with handling, injections and surgery. c-FOS expression before methamphetamine availability was observed in the dorsomedial hypothalamus, lateral septum, and orbitofrontal cortex, suggesting that anticipation of regularly scheduled methamphetamine is associated with activation of brain regions important in circadian timing, emotional regulation and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0329-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Hierarchically organized brains communicate through feedforward (FF) and feedback (FB) pathways. In mammals, FF and FB are mediated by higher and lower frequencies during wakefulness. FB is preferentially impaired by general anesthetics in multiple mammalian species. This suggests FB serves critical functions in waking brains. The brain of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; (fruit fly) is also hierarchically organized, but the presence of FB in these brains is not established. Here, we studied FB in the fly brain, by simultaneously recording local field potentials (LFPs) from low-order peripheral structures and higher-order central structures. We analyzed the data using Granger causality (GC), the first application of this analysis technique to recordings from the insect brain. Our analysis revealed that low frequencies (0.1–5 Hz) mediated FB from the center to the periphery, while higher frequencies (10–45 Hz) mediated FF in the opposite direction. Further, isoflurane anesthesia preferentially reduced FB. Our results imply that the spectral characteristics of FF and FB may be a signature of hierarchically organized brains that is conserved from insects to mammals. We speculate that general anesthetics may induce unresponsiveness across species by targeting the mechanisms that support FB.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) secreted by neurons is a significant component of synaptic plasticity. In humans, it is also present in blood platelets where it accumulates following its biosynthesis in megakaryocytes. BDNF levels are thus readily detectable in human serum and it has been abundantly speculated that they may somehow serve as an indicator of brain function. However, there is a great deal of uncertainty with regard to the range of BDNF levels that can be considered normal, how stable these values are over time and even whether BDNF levels can be reliably measured in serum. Using monoclonal antibodies and a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), this study reports on BDNF levels in the serum of 259 volunteers with a mean value of 32.69 ± 8.33 ng/ml (SD). The mean value for the same cohort after 12 months was not significantly different (N = 226, 32.97 ± 8.36 ng/ml SD, p = 0.19). Power analysis of these values indicates that relatively large cohorts are necessary to identify significant differences, requiring a group size of 60 to detect a 20% change. The levels determined by ELISA could be validated by Western blot analyses using a BDNF monoclonal antibody. Whilst no association was observed with gender, a weak, &lt;i&gt;positive&lt;/i&gt; correlation was found with age. The overall conclusions are that BDNF levels can be reliably measured in human serum, that these levels are quite stable over one year, and that comparisons between two populations may only be meaningful if cohorts of sufficient sizes are assembled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The presence of BDNF in human blood has generated considerable interest as illustrated by the very large number of publications associating BDNF levels with various conditions affecting brain function, including depression and neurodegeneration. Yet a range of technical issues, together with a lack of plausible mechanisms explaining this association, raise questions as to the meaning and value of such measurements. This contribution deals with the feasibility of reliably measuring BDNF levels in human serum and gives indications of the size of cohorts to be recruited for meaningful differences to be observed between populations of interest.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The importance of geometry in the corneal micropocket angiogenesis assay</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/wlGrLwmrFRo/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by James A. Grogan, Anthony J. Connor, Joe M. Pitt-Francis, Philip K. Maini, Helen M. Byrne&lt;/p&gt;

The corneal micropocket angiogenesis assay is an experimental protocol for studying vessel network formation, or neovascularization, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. The assay is attractive due to the ease with which the developing vessel network can be observed in the same animal over time. Measurements from the assay have been used in combination with mathematical modeling to gain insights into the mechanisms of angiogenesis. While previous modeling studies have adopted planar domains to represent the assay, the hemispherical shape of the cornea and asymmetric positioning of the angiogenic source can be seen to affect vascular patterning in experimental images. As such, we aim to better understand: i) how the geometry of the assay influences vessel network formation and ii) how to relate observations from planar domains to those in the hemispherical cornea. To do so, we develop a three-dimensional, off-lattice mathematical model of neovascularization in the cornea, using a spatially resolved representation of the assay for the first time. Relative to the detailed model, we predict that the adoption of planar geometries has a noticeable impact on vascular patterning, leading to increased vessel ‘merging’, or anastomosis, in particular when circular geometries are adopted. Significant differences in the dynamics of diffusible aniogenesis simulators are also predicted between different domains. In terms of comparing predictions across domains, the ‘distance of the vascular front to the limbus’ metric is found to have low sensitivity to domain choice, while metrics such as densities of tip cells and vessels and ‘vascularized fraction’ are sensitive to domain choice. Given the widespread adoption and attractive simplicity of planar tissue domains, both &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, the differences identified in the present study should prove useful in relating the results of previous and future theoretical studies of neovascularization to &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; observations in the cornea.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wlGrLwmrFRo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Use of temperature to improve West Nile virus forecasts</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/9oxjUwJGPVY/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Nicholas B. DeFelice, Zachary D. Schneider, Eliza Little, Christopher Barker, Kevin A. Caillouet, Scott R. Campbell, Dan Damian, Patrick Irwin, Herff M. P. Jones, John Townsend, Jeffrey Shaman&lt;/p&gt;

Ecological and laboratory studies have demonstrated that temperature modulates West Nile virus (WNV) transmission dynamics and spillover infection to humans. Here we explore whether inclusion of temperature forcing in a model depicting WNV transmission improves WNV forecast accuracy relative to a baseline model depicting WNV transmission without temperature forcing. Both models are optimized using a data assimilation method and two observed data streams: mosquito infection rates and reported human WNV cases. Each coupled model-inference framework is then used to generate retrospective ensemble forecasts of WNV for 110 outbreak years from among 12 geographically diverse United States counties. The temperature-forced model improves forecast accuracy for much of the outbreak season. From the end of July until the beginning of October, a timespan during which 70% of human cases are reported, the temperature-forced model generated forecasts of the total number of human cases over the next 3 weeks, total number of human cases over the season, the week with the highest percentage of infectious mosquitoes, and the peak percentage of infectious mosquitoes that on average increased absolute forecast accuracy 5%, 10%, 12%, and 6%, respectively, over the non-temperature forced baseline model. These results indicate that use of temperature forcing improves WNV forecast accuracy and provide further evidence that temperature influences rates of WNV transmission. The findings provide a foundation for implementation of a statistically rigorous system for real-time forecast of seasonal WNV outbreaks and their use as a quantitative decision support tool for public health officials and mosquito control programs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9oxjUwJGPVY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The use of 3C-based methods has revealed the importance of the 3D organization of the chromatin for key aspects of genome biology. However, the different caveats of the variants of 3C techniques have limited their scope and the range of scientific fields that could benefit from these approaches. To address these limitations, we present 4Cin, a method to generate 3D models and derive virtual Hi-C (vHi-C) heat maps of genomic loci based on 4C-seq or any kind of 4C-seq-like data, such as those derived from NG Capture-C. 3D genome organization is determined by integrative consideration of the spatial distances derived from as few as four 4C-seq experiments. The 3D models obtained from 4C-seq data, together with their associated vHi-C maps, allow the inference of all chromosomal contacts within a given genomic region, facilitating the identification of Topological Associating Domains (TAD) boundaries. Thus, 4Cin offers a much cheaper, accessible and versatile alternative to other available techniques while providing a comprehensive 3D topological profiling. By studying TAD modifications in genomic structural variants associated to disease phenotypes and performing cross-species evolutionary comparisons of 3D chromatin structures in a quantitative manner, we demonstrate the broad potential and novel range of applications of our method.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0r_nU8GIe4g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Neuronal gain modulability is determined by dendritic morphology: A computational optogenetic study</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/1YQd4XrcVE4/article</link>

The mechanisms by which the gain of the neuronal input-output function may be modulated have been the subject of much investigation. However, little is known of the role of dendrites in neuronal gain control. New optogenetic experimental paradigms based on spatial profiles or patterns of light stimulation offer the prospect of elucidating many aspects of single cell function, including the role of dendrites in gain control. We thus developed a model to investigate how competing excitatory and inhibitory input within the dendritic arbor alters neuronal gain, incorporating kinetic models of opsins into our modeling to ensure it is experimentally testable. To investigate how different topologies of the neuronal dendritic tree affect the neuron’s input-output characteristics we generate branching geometries which replicate morphological features of most common neurons, but keep the number of branches and overall area of dendrites approximately constant. We found a relationship between a neuron’s gain modulability and its dendritic morphology, with neurons with bipolar dendrites with a moderate degree of branching being most receptive to control of the gain of their input-output relationship. The theory was then tested and confirmed on two examples of realistic neurons: 1) layer V pyramidal cells—confirming their role in neural circuits as a regulator of the gain in the circuit in addition to acting as the primary excitatory neurons, and 2) stellate cells. In addition to providing testable predictions and a novel application of dual-opsins, our model suggests that innervation of all dendritic subdomains is required for full gain modulation, revealing the importance of dendritic targeting in the generation of neuronal gain control and the functions that it subserves. Finally, our study also demonstrates that neurophysiological investigations which use direct current injection into the soma and bypass the dendrites may miss some important neuronal functions, such as gain modulation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1YQd4XrcVE4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: ChromoTrace: Computational reconstruction of 3D chromosome configurations for super-resolution microscopy</title>

The 3D structure of chromatin plays a key role in genome function, including gene expression, DNA replication, chromosome segregation, and DNA repair. Furthermore the location of genomic loci within the nucleus, especially relative to each other and nuclear structures such as the nuclear envelope and nuclear bodies strongly correlates with aspects of function such as gene expression. Therefore, determining the 3D position of the 6 billion DNA base pairs in each of the 23 chromosomes inside the nucleus of a human cell is a central challenge of biology. Recent advances of super-resolution microscopy in principle enable the mapping of specific molecular features with nanometer precision inside cells. Combined with highly specific, sensitive and multiplexed fluorescence labeling of DNA sequences this opens up the possibility of mapping the 3D path of the genome sequence in situ. Here we develop computational methodologies to reconstruct the sequence configuration of all human chromosomes in the nucleus from a super-resolution image of a set of fluorescent in situ probes hybridized to the genome in a cell. To test our approach, we develop a method for the simulation of DNA in an idealized human nucleus. Our reconstruction method, ChromoTrace, uses suffix trees to assign a known linear ordering of in situ probes on the genome to an unknown set of 3D in-situ probe positions in the nucleus from super-resolved images using the known genomic probe spacing as a set of physical distance constraints between probes. We find that ChromoTrace can assign the 3D positions of the majority of loci with high accuracy and reasonable sensitivity to specific genome sequences. By simulating appropriate spatial resolution, label multiplexing and noise scenarios we assess our algorithms performance. Our study shows that it is feasible to achieve genome-wide reconstruction of the 3D DNA path based on super-resolution microscopy images.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VJh9lTsZKRE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Susceptibility to Oxidative Stress Is Determined by Genetic Background in Neuronal Cell Cultures</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0335-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) leads to a deleterious and multifactorial secondary inflammatory response in the brain. Oxidative stress from the inflammation likely contributes to the brain damage although it is unclear to which extent. A largely unexplored approach is to consider phenotypic regulation of oxidative stress levels. Genetic polymorphism influences inflammation in the central nervous system and it is possible that the antioxidative response differs between phenotypes and affects the severity of the secondary injury. We therefore compared the antioxidative response in inbred rat strains Dark Agouti (DA) to Piebald Viral Glaxo (PVG). DA has high susceptibility to inflammatory challenges and PVG is protected. Primary neuronal cell cultures were exposed to peroxynitrite (ONOO&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;), nitric oxide (NO), superoxide (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). Our findings demonstrated a phenotypic control of the neuronal antioxidative response, specific to manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). DA neurons had increased levels of MnSOD, equal levels of peroxiredoxin 5, decreased oxidative stress markers 3-Nitrotyrosine and 4-HNE and decreased neuronal death detected by lactate dehydrogenase release after 24h, and higher oxidative stress levels by CellROX than PVG after 2h. It is possible that DA neurons had a phenotypic adaptation to a fiercer inflammatory environment. Peroxynitrite was confirmed as the most powerful oxidative damage mediator, while 4-HNE caused few oxidative effects. iNOS was not induced, suggesting that inflammatory, while not oxidative stimulation was required. These findings indicate that phenotypic antioxidative regulation affects the secondary inflammation, which should be considered in future individualized treatments and when evaluating antioxidative pharmacological interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Neurotrauma leads to inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain. The outcome differs between individuals and it is largely unknown what causes this diversity. It is possible that the brain phenotype is linked to oxidative stress levels, and that some individuals acquire less oxidative stress than others. We therefore tested the oxidative stress reaction patterns in rat neurons from two strains with different susceptibility to inflammation. We found that the phenotypes have different regulation of antioxidative enzymes and oxidative stress. While further studies are needed to corroborate the findings &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, it is a proof of concept of genetic regulation of direct oxidative stress, which may impact outcome after TBI and interact with future antioxidative treatment trials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Neurons are dynamic cells that respond and adapt to stimuli throughout their long postmitotic lives. The structural and functional plasticity of neurons requires the regulated transcription of new gene products, and dysregulation of transcription in either the developing or adult brain impairs cognition. We discuss how mechanisms of chromatin regulation help to orchestrate the transcriptional programs that underlie the maturation of developing neurons and the plasticity of adult neurons. We review how chromatin regulation acts locally to modulate the expression of specific genes and more broadly to coordinate gene expression programs during transitions between cellular states.</content:encoded>

While predominantly a nuclear protein modification, there is a growing appreciation that SUMOylation of proteins outside the nucleus plays direct roles in controlling synaptic transmission, neuronal excitability, and adaptive responses to cell stress. Furthermore, alterations in protein SUMOylation are observed in a wide range of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, and several extranuclear disease-associated proteins have been shown to be directly SUMOylated.</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Collateral Projections Innervate the Mammillary Bodies and Retrosplenial Cortex: A New Category of Hippocampal Cells</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0383-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To understand the hippocampus, it is necessary to understand the subiculum. Unlike other hippocampal subfields, the subiculum projects to almost all distal hippocampal targets, highlighting its critical importance for external networks. The present studies, in male rats and mice, reveal a new category of dorsal subiculum neurons that innervate both the mammillary bodies (MBs) and the retrosplenial cortex (RSP). These bifurcating neurons comprise almost half of the hippocampal cells that project to RSP. The termination of these numerous collateral projections was visualized within the medial mammillary nucleus and the granular RSP (area 29). These collateral projections included subiculum efferents that cross to the contralateral MBs. Within the granular RSP, the collateral projections form a particularly dense plexus in deep Layer II and Layer III. This retrosplenial termination site colocalized with markers for VGluT2 and neurotensin. While efferents from the hippocampal CA fields standardly collateralize, subiculum projections often have only one target site. Consequently, the many collateral projections involving the RSP and the MBs present a relatively unusual pattern for the subiculum, which presumably relates to how both targets have complementary roles in spatial processing. Furthermore, along with the anterior thalamic nuclei, the MBs and RSP are key members of a memory circuit, which is usually described as both starting and finishing in the hippocampus. The present findings reveal how the hippocampus simultaneously engages different parts of this circuit, so forcing an important revision of this network.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Losing Control in Social Situations: How the Presence of Others Affects Neural Processes Related to Sense of Agency</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0336-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Social contexts substantially influence individual behavior, but little is known about how they affect cognitive processes related to voluntary action. Previously, it has been shown that social context reduces participants’ sense of agency over the outcomes of their actions and outcome monitoring. In this fMRI study on human volunteers, we investigated the neural mechanisms by which social context alters sense of agency. Participants made costly actions to stop inflating a balloon before it burst. On &quot;social&quot; trials, another player could act in their stead, but we analyzed only trials in which the other player remained passive. We hypothesized that mentalizing processes during social trials would affect decision-making fluency and lead to a decreased sense of agency. In line with this hypothesis, we found increased activity in the bilateral temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), precuneus, and middle frontal gyrus during social trials compared with nonsocial trials. Activity in the precuneus was, in turn, negatively related to sense of agency at a single-trial level. We further found a double dissociation between TPJ and angular gyrus (AG): activity in the left AG was not sensitive to social context but was negatively related to sense of agency. In contrast, activity in the TPJ was modulated by social context but was not sensitive to sense of agency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Reliability-Weighted Integration of Audiovisual Signals Can Be Modulated by Top-down Attention</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0315-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Behaviorally, it is well established that human observers integrate signals near-optimally weighted in proportion to their reliabilities as predicted by maximum likelihood estimation. Yet, despite abundant behavioral evidence, it is unclear how the human brain accomplishes this feat. In a spatial ventriloquist paradigm, participants were presented with auditory, visual, and audiovisual signals and reported the location of the auditory or the visual signal. Combining psychophysics, multivariate functional MRI (fMRI) decoding, and models of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), we characterized the computational operations underlying audiovisual integration at distinct cortical levels. We estimated observers’ behavioral weights by fitting psychometric functions to participants’ localization responses. Likewise, we estimated the neural weights by fitting neurometric functions to spatial locations decoded from regional fMRI activation patterns. Our results demonstrate that low-level auditory and visual areas encode predominantly the spatial location of the signal component of a region’s preferred auditory (or visual) modality. By contrast, intraparietal sulcus forms spatial representations by integrating auditory and visual signals weighted by their reliabilities. Critically, the neural and behavioral weights and the variance of the spatial representations depended not only on the sensory reliabilities as predicted by the MLE model but also on participants’ modality-specific attention and report (i.e., visual vs. auditory). These results suggest that audiovisual integration is not exclusively determined by bottom-up sensory reliabilities. Instead, modality-specific attention and report can flexibly modulate how intraparietal sulcus integrates sensory signals into spatial representations to guide behavioral responses (e.g., localization and orienting).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging studies in animal models and human subjects have each revealed that relatively low striatal dopamine D2-like receptor binding potential is associated with poor impulse control and with vulnerability for addiction-related behaviors. These studies cannot, however, disambiguate the roles for various pools of D2 receptors found in the striatum (e.g., those expressed on medium spiny striato-pallidal neurons vs on dopamine-releasing nerve terminals) in these behavioral outcomes. To clarify the role of the latter pool, namely, D2 autoreceptors, we studied mice carrying a conditional DRD2 gene, with or without Cre-recombinase expressed under the transcriptional control of the dopamine transporter gene locus (autoDrd2-KO, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 19 and controls, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 21). These mice were tested for locomotor response to cocaine, and spatial reversal learning was assessed in operant conditioning chambers. As predicted, compared to control mice, autoDrd2-KO animals demonstrated heightened sensitivity to the locomotor stimulating effect of cocaine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), confirming previous research using a similar genetic model. In the spatial reversal learning task, autoDrd2-KO mice were slower to reach a learning criterion and had difficulty sustaining a prolonged nose poke response, measurements conceptually related to impaired response inhibition. Rate of learning of the initial discrimination and latencies to collect rewards, to initiate trials and to produce a response were unaffected by genetic deletion of D2 autoreceptors, discarding possible motor and motivational factors. Together, these findings confirm the role of D2 autoreceptors in reversal learning and suggest a broader involvement in behavioral inhibition mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Sulcal Polymorphisms of the IFC and ACC Contribute to Inhibitory Control Variability in Children and Adults</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0197-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Inhibitory control (IC) is a core executive function that enables humans to resist habits, temptations, or distractions. IC efficiency in childhood is a strong predictor of academic and professional success later in life. Based on analysis of the sulcal pattern, a qualitative feature of cortex anatomy determined during fetal life and stable during development, we searched for evidence that interindividual differences in IC partly trace back to prenatal processes. Using anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we analyzed the sulcal pattern of two key regions of the IC neural network, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the inferior frontal cortex (IFC), which limits the inferior frontal gyrus. We found that the sulcal pattern asymmetry of both the ACC and IFC contributes to IC (Stroop score) in children and adults: participants with asymmetrical ACC or IFC sulcal patterns had better IC efficiency than participants with symmetrical ACC or IFC sulcal patterns. Such additive effects of IFC and ACC sulcal patterns on IC efficiency suggest that distinct early neurodevelopmental mechanisms targeting different brain regions likely contribute to IC efficiency. This view shares some analogies with the &quot;common variant–small effect&quot; model in genetics, which states that frequent genetic polymorphisms have small effects but collectively account for a large portion of the variance. Similarly, each sulcal polymorphism has a small but additive effect: IFC and ACC sulcal patterns, respectively, explained 3% and 14% of the variance of the Stroop interference scores.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Inhibition of a Descending Prefrontal Circuit Prevents Ketamine-Induced Stress Resilience in Females</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0025-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Stress is a potent etiological factor in the onset of major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Therefore, significant efforts have been made to identify factors that produce resilience to the outcomes of a later stressor, in hopes of preventing untoward clinical outcomes. The NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine has recently emerged as a prophylactic capable of preventing neurochemical and behavioral outcomes of a future stressor. Despite promising results of preclinical studies performed in male rats, the effects of proactive ketamine in female rats remains unknown. This is alarming given that stress-related disorders affect females at nearly twice the rate of males. Here we explore the prophylactic effects of ketamine on stress-induced anxiety-like behavior and the neural circuit-level processes that mediate these effects in female rats. Ketamine given one week prior to an uncontrollable stressor (inescapable tailshock; IS) reduced typical stress-induced activation of the serotonergic (5-HT) dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and eliminated DRN-dependent juvenile social exploration (JSE) deficits 24 h after the stressor. Proactive ketamine altered prelimbic cortex (PL) neural ensembles so that a later experience with IS now activated these cells, which it ordinarily would not. Ketamine acutely activated a PL to DRN (PL-DRN) circuit and inhibition of this circuit with Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) at the time of IS one week later prevented stress prophylaxis, suggesting that persistent changes in PL-DRN circuit activity are responsible, at least in part, for mediating long-term effects associated with ketamine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: miR-214-3p Targets β-Catenin to Regulate Depressive-like Behaviors Induced by Chronic Social Defeat Stress in Mice</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy047/4924354?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;β-Catenin has been implicated in major depressive disorder (MDD), which is associated with synaptic plasticity and dendritic arborization. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small noncoding RNAs containing about 22 nucleotides and involved in a variety of physiological and pathophysiological process, but their roles in MDD remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the expression and function of miRNAs in the mouse model of chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). The regulation of β-catenin by selected miRNA was validated by silico prediction, target gene luciferase reporter assay, and transfection experiment in neurons. We demonstrated that the levels of miR-214-3p, which targets β-catenin transcripts were significantly increased in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of CSDS mice. Antagomir-214-3p, a neutralizing inhibitor of miR-214-3p, increased the levels of β-catenin and reversed the depressive-like behavior in CSDS mice. Meanwhile, antagomir-214-3p increased the amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) and the number of dendritic spines in mPFC of CSDS mice, which may be related to the elevated expression of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;cldn1&lt;/span&gt;. Furthermore, intranasal administered antagomir-214-3p also significantly increased the level of β-catenin and reversed the depressive-like behaviors in CSDS mice. These results may represent a new therapeutic target for MDD.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Neuronal Origin of the Temporal Dynamics of Spontaneous BOLD Activity Correlation</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy045/4924353?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Resting-state functional connectivity (FC) has become a major functional magnetic resonance imaging method to study network organization of human brains. There has been recent interest in the temporal fluctuations of FC calculated using short time windows (“dynamic FC”) because this method could provide information inaccessible with conventional “static” FC, which is typically calculated using the entire scan lasting several tens of minutes. Although multiple studies have revealed considerable temporal fluctuations in FC, it is still unclear whether the fluctuations of FC measured in hemodynamics reflect the dynamics of underlying neural activity. We addressed this question using simultaneous imaging of neuronal calcium and hemodynamic signals in mice and found coordinated temporal dynamics of calcium FC and hemodynamic FC measured in the same short time windows. Moreover, we found that variation in transient neuronal coactivation patterns was significantly related to temporal fluctuations of sliding window FC in hemodynamics. Finally, we show that the observed dynamics of FC cannot be fully accounted for by simulated data assuming stationary FC. These results provide evidence for the neuronal origin of dynamic FC and further suggest that information relevant to FC is condensed in temporally sparse events that can be extracted using a small number of time points.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule 2 (NCAM2)-Induced c-Src-Dependent Propagation of Submembrane Ca2+ Spikes Along Dendrites Inhibits Synapse Maturation</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy041/4924352?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The neural cell adhesion molecule 2 (NCAM2) is encoded by a gene on chromosome 21 in humans. NCAM2 accumulates in synapses, but its role in regulation of synapse formation remains poorly understood. We demonstrate that an increase in NCAM2 levels results in increased instability of dendritic protrusions and reduced conversion of protrusions to dendritic spines in mouse cortical neurons. NCAM2 overexpression induces an increase in the frequency of submembrane Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; spikes localized in individual dendritic protrusions and promotes propagation of submembrane Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; spikes over segments of dendrites or the whole dendritic tree. NCAM2-dependent submembrane Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; spikes are L-type voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel-dependent, and their propagation but not initiation depends on the c-Src protein tyrosine kinase. Inhibition of initiation or propagation of NCAM2-dependent submembrane Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; spikes reduces the NCAM2-dependent instability of dendritic protrusions. Synaptic boutons formed on dendrites of neurons with elevated NCAM2 expression are enriched in the protein marker of immature synapses GAP43, and the number of boutons with mature activity-dependent synaptic vesicle recycling is reduced. Our results indicate that synapse maturation is inhibited in NCAM2-overexpressing neurons and suggest that changes in NCAM2 levels and altered submembrane Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics can cause defects in synapse maturation in Down syndrome and other brain disorders associated with abnormal NCAM2 expression.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Non-perceptual Regions in the Left Inferior Parietal Lobe Support Phonological Short-term Memory: Evidence for a Buffer Account?</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy037/4924349?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Buffer versus embedded processes accounts of short-term memory (STM) for phonological information were addressed by testing subjects’ perception and memory for speech and non-speech auditory stimuli. Univariate and multivariate (MVPA) approaches were used to assess whether brain regions recruited in recognizing speech were involved in maintaining speech representations over a delay. As expected, a left superior temporal region was found to support speech perception. However, contrary to the embedded processes approach, this region failed to show a load effect, or any sustained activation, during a maintenance delay. Moreover, MVPA decoding during the maintenance stage was unsuccessful in this region by a perception classifier or an encoding classifier. In contrast, the left supramarginal gyrus showed both sustained activation and a load effect. Using MVPA, stimulus decoding was successful during the delay period. In addition, a functional connectivity analysis showed that, as memory load increased, the left temporal lobe involved in perception became more strongly connected with the parietal region involved in maintenance. Taken together, the findings provide greater support for a buffer than embedded processes account of phonological STM.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Toward Leveraging Human Connectomic Data in Large Consortia: Generalizability of fMRI-Based Brain Graphs Across Sites, Sessions, and Paradigms</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy032/4924348?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;While graph theoretical modeling has dramatically advanced our understanding of complex brain systems, the feasibility of aggregating connectomic data in large imaging consortia remains unclear. Here, using a battery of cognitive, emotional and resting fMRI paradigms, we investigated the generalizability of functional connectomic measures across sites and sessions. Our results revealed overall fair to excellent reliability for a majority of measures during both rest and tasks, in particular for those quantifying connectivity strength, network segregation and network integration. Processing schemes such as node definition and global signal regression (GSR) significantly affected resulting reliability, with higher reliability detected for the Power atlas (vs. AAL atlas) and data without GSR. While network diagnostics for default-mode and sensori-motor systems were consistently reliable independently of paradigm, those for higher-order cognitive systems were reliable predominantly when challenged by task. In addition, based on our present sample and after accounting for observed reliability, satisfactory statistical power can be achieved in multisite research with sample size of approximately 250 when the effect size is moderate or larger. Our findings provide empirical evidence for the generalizability of brain functional graphs in large consortia, and encourage the aggregation of connectomic measures using multisite and multisession data.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 2/3 (mGluR2/3) Activation Suppresses TRPV1 Sensitization in Mouse, but Not Human Sensory Neurons</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0412-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The use of human tissue to validate putative analgesic targets identified in rodents is a promising strategy for improving the historically poor translational record of preclinical pain research. We recently demonstrated that in mouse and human sensory neurons, agonists for metabotropic glutamate receptors 2 and 3 (mGluR2/3) reduce membrane hyperexcitability produced by the inflammatory mediator prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Previous rodent studies indicate that mGluR2/3 can also reduce peripheral sensitization by suppressing inflammation-induced sensitization of TRPV1. Whether this observation similarly translates to human sensory neurons has not yet been tested. We found that activation of mGluR2/3 with the agonist APDC suppressed PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced sensitization of TRPV1 in mouse, but not human sensory neurons. We also evaluated sensory neuron expression of the gene transcripts for mGluR2 (&lt;i&gt;Grm2&lt;/i&gt;), mGluR3 (&lt;i&gt;Grm3&lt;/i&gt;), and TRPV1 (&lt;i&gt;Trpv1&lt;/i&gt;). The majority of &lt;i&gt;Trpv1&lt;/i&gt;+ mouse and human sensory neurons expressed &lt;i&gt;Grm2&lt;/i&gt; and/or &lt;i&gt;Grm3&lt;/i&gt;, and in both mouse and human, &lt;i&gt;Grm2&lt;/i&gt; was expressed in a greater percentage of sensory neurons than &lt;i&gt;Grm3&lt;/i&gt;. Although we demonstrated a functional difference in the modulation of TRPV1 sensitization by mGluR2/3 activation between mouse and human, there were no species differences in the gene transcript colocalization of mGluR2 or mGluR3 with TRPV1 that might explain this functional difference. Taken together with our previous work, these results suggest that mGluR2/3 activation suppresses only some aspects of human sensory neuron sensitization caused by PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. These differences have implications for potential healthy human voluntary studies or clinical trials evaluating the analgesic efficacy of mGluR2/3 agonists or positive allosteric modulators.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Amygdala Adaptation and Temporal Dynamics of the Salience Network in Conditioned Fear: A Single-Trial fMRI Study</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0445-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Research in rodents has established the role of the amygdaloid complex in defensive responses to conditioned threat. In human imaging studies, however, activation of the amygdala by conditioned threat cues is often not observed. One hypothesis states that this finding reflects adaptation of amygdaloid responses over time. We tested this hypothesis by estimating single-trial neural responses over a large number of conditioning trials. Functional MRI (fMRI) was recorded from 18 participants during classical differential fear conditioning: Participants viewed oriented grayscale grating stimuli (45° or 135°) presented centrally in random order. In the acquisition block, one grating (the CS+) was paired with a noxious noise, the unconditioned stimulus (US), on 25% of trials. The other grating, denoted CS–, was never paired with the US. Consistent with previous reports, BOLD in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and insula, but not the amygdala, was heightened when viewing CS+ stimuli that were not paired with US compared to CS– stimuli. Trial-by-trial analysis showed that over the course of acquisition, activity in the amygdala attenuated. Interestingly, activity in the dACC and insula also declined. Representational similarity analysis (RSA) corroborated these results, indicating that the voxel patterns evoked by CS+ and CS– in these brain regions became less distinguishable over time. Together, the present findings support the hypothesis that the lack of BOLD differences in the amygdaloid complex in many studies of classical conditioning is due to adaptation, and the adaptation effects may reflect changes in large-scale networks mediating aversive conditioning, particularly the salience network.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0400-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Economic decisions arise from evaluation of alternative actions in contexts of motivation and memory. In the predatory sea-slug &lt;i&gt;Pleurobranchaea&lt;/i&gt; the economic decisions of foraging are found to occur by the workings of a simple, affectively controlled homeostat with learning abilities. Here, the neuronal circuit relations for approach-avoidance choice of &lt;i&gt;Pleurobranchaea&lt;/i&gt; are expressed and tested in the foraging simulation Cyberslug. Choice is organized around appetitive state as a moment-to-moment integration of sensation, motivation (satiation/hunger), and memory. Appetitive state controls a switch for approach vs. avoidance turn responses to sensation. Sensory stimuli are separately integrated for incentive value into appetitive state, and for prey location (stimulus place) into mapping motor response. Learning interacts with satiation to regulate prey choice affectively. The virtual predator realistically reproduces the decisions of the real one in varying circumstances and satisfies optimal foraging criteria. The basic relations are open to experimental embellishment toward enhanced neural and behavioral complexity in simulation, as was the ancestral bilaterian nervous system in evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Atypical Localization and Dissociation between Glucose Uptake and Amyloid Deposition in Cognitively Normal APOE*E4 Homozygotic Elders Compared with Patients with Late-Onset Alzheimers Disease</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0396-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progresses insidiously over decades. Therefore, study of preclinical AD is critical to identify early pathophysiological changes as potential targets for prevention or treatment. The brain processes at the preclinical stage remain minimally understood. Aside from age, the E4 allele of APOE flags a group at particularly high risk of late-onset AD (LOAD). Studies of these individuals could provide insights about the ontogenesis of AD offering clues for novel treatment strategies. To this end, cognitively normal, &lt;i&gt;APOE*E4&lt;/i&gt; homozygotes from the Alzheimer’s Diseases Neuroimaging Research Initiative database (ADNI-LONI) provided fluorodeoxyglucose and amyloid (florbetapir) PET scans (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 8 and 7, respectively; mean age 76 years). Their scans were compared to those of matched cognitively normal elders who were not E4 carriers. There was dissociation in the distribution between glucose uptake and amyloid deposition in the homozygotes. Peak hypometabolism localized bilaterally along the medial temporal cortex. In contrast, peak amyloid deposition localized principally to the putamen, a finding also seen in preclinical carriers of autosomal dominant AD mutations and preclinical AD associated with Down syndrome. Additional regions of amyloid deposition in homozygotes were medial prefrontal cortices including the anterior cingulate, middle and inferior frontal cortices, and middle and inferior occipital cortices. These findings contrast with those reported for LOAD. These data begin to characterize elders with normal cognition despite high AD risk in comparison to the known phenotypes of patients with LOAD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Neural Determinants of Task Performance during Feature-Based Attention in Human Cortex</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0375-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Studies of feature-based attention have associated activity in a dorsal frontoparietal network with putative attentional priority signals. Yet, how this neural activity mediates attentional selection and whether it guides behavior are fundamental questions that require investigation. We reasoned that endogenous fluctuations in the quality of attentional priority should influence task performance. Human subjects detected a speed increment while viewing clockwise (CW) or counterclockwise (CCW) motion (baseline task) or while attending to either direction amid distracters (attention task). In an fMRI experiment, direction-specific neural pattern similarity between the baseline task and the attention task revealed a higher level of similarity for correct than incorrect trials in frontoparietal regions. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), we disrupted posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and found a selective deficit in the attention task, but not in the baseline task, demonstrating the necessity of this cortical area during feature-based attention. These results reveal that frontoparietal areas maintain attentional priority that facilitates successful behavioral selection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: {alpha}-Tubulin Acetyltransferase Is a Novel Target Mediating Neurite Growth Inhibitory Effects of Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycans and Myelin-Associated Glycoprotein</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0240-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Damage to the CNS results in neuronal and axonal degeneration, and subsequent neurological dysfunction. Endogenous repair in the CNS is impeded by inhibitory chemical and physical barriers, such as chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), which prevent axon regeneration. Previously, it has been demonstrated that the inhibition of axonal histone deacetylase-6 (HDAC6) can promote microtubule α-tubulin acetylation and restore the growth of CSPGs- and MAG-inhibited axons. Since the acetylation of α-tubulin is regulated by two opposing enzymes, HDAC6 (deacetylation) and α-tubulin acetyltransferase-1 (αTAT1; acetylation), we have investigated the regulation of these enzymes downstream of a growth inhibitory signal. Our findings show that exposure of primary mouse cortical neurons to soluble CSPGs and MAG substrates cause an acute and RhoA-kinase-dependent reduction in α-tubulin acetylation and αTAT1 protein levels, without changes to either HDAC6 levels or HDAC6 activity. The CSPGs- and MAG-induced reduction in αTAT1 occurs primarily in the distal and middle regions of neurites and reconstitution of αTAT1, either by Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibition or lentiviral-mediated αTAT1 overexpression, can restore neurite growth. Lastly, we demonstrate that CSPGs and MAG signaling decreases αTAT1 levels posttranscriptionally via a ROCK-dependent increase in αTAT1 protein turnover. Together, these findings define αTAT1 as a novel potential therapeutic target for ameliorating CNS injury characterized by growth inhibitory substrates that are prohibitive to axonal regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Theta Oscillations Organize Spiking Activity in Higher-Order Visual Thalamus during Sustained Attention</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0384-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Higher-order visual thalamus plays a fundamental but poorly understood role in attention-demanding tasks. To investigate how neuronal dynamics in higher-order visual thalamus are modulated by sustained attention, we performed multichannel electrophysiological recordings in the lateral posterior-pulvinar complex (LP/pulvinar) in the ferret (&lt;i&gt;Mustela putorius furo&lt;/i&gt;). We recorded single unit activity and local field potential during the performance of the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) that is used in both humans and animals as an assay of sustained attention. We found that half of the units exhibited an increasing firing rate during the delay period before stimulus onset (attention-modulated units). In contrast, the non-attention-modulated units responded to the stimulus, but not during the delay period. Spike-field coherence of only the attention-modulated neurons significantly increased from the start of the delay period until screen touch, predominantly in the theta frequency band. In addition, theta power and theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling were elevated throughout the delay period. Our findings suggest that the theta oscillation plays a role in orchestrating thalamic signaling during sustained attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Impaired sustained attention can be deadly, as illustrated by the number of motor vehicle accidents that are caused by drivers not reacting quickly enough to unexpected events on the road. Understanding how electrical signaling in higher-order visual nuclei, such as the LP/pulvinar, is modulated during tasks that require sustained attention is an important step in achieving a mechanistic understanding of sustained attention, which will eventually lead to new strategies to prevent and treat impairment in sustained attention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>cAMP and cGMP are well established second messengers required for long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory formation/consolidation. By contrast, amyloid β (Aβ), mostly known as one of the main culprits for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), has received relatively little attention in the context of plasticity and memory. Of note, however, low physiological concentrations of Aβ seem necessary for LTP induction and for memory formation. This should come as no surprise, since hormesis emerged as a central dogma in biology.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons form dendritic gap junctions with one another, but the connectivity among gap junction-coupled dendrites remains uninvestigated in most neocortical areas. We visualized gap junctions in layer 4 of the mouse barrel cortex and examined their structural details. PV neurons were divided into 4 types based on the location of soma and dendrites within or outside barrels. Type 1 neurons that had soma and all dendrites inside a barrel, considered most specific to single vibrissa-derived signals, unexpectedly formed gap junctions only with other types but never with each other. Type 2 neurons inside a barrel elongated dendrites outward, forming gap junctions within a column that contained the home barrel. Type 3 neurons located outside barrels established connections with all types including Type 4 neurons that were confined inside the inter-barrel septa. The majority (33/38, 86.8%) of dendritic gap junctions were within 75 μm from at least 1 of 2 paired somata. All types received vesicular glutamate transporter 2-positive axon terminals preferentially on somata and proximal dendrites, indicating the involvement of all types in thalamocortical feedforward regulation in which proximal gap junctions may also participate. These structural organizations provide a new morphological basis for regulatory mechanisms in barrel cortex.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The mammalian dorsal telencephalic neuroepithelium develops—from medial to lateral—into the choroid plaque, cortical hem, hippocampal primordium and isocortex under the influence of Bmp, Wnt and Notch signaling. Correct telencephalic development requires a tight coordination of the extent/duration of these signals, but the identification of possible molecular coordinators is still limited. Here, we postulated that Secreted Frizzled Related Protein 1 (Sfrp1), a multifunctional regulator of Bmp, Wnt and Notch signaling strongly expressed during early telencephalic development, may represent 1 of such molecules. We report that in E10.5–E12.5 &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Sfrp1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; embryos, the hem and hippocampal domains are reduced in size whereas the prospective neocortex is medially extended. These changes are associated with a significant reduction of the medio-lateral telencephalic expression of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Axin2&lt;/span&gt;, a read-out of Wnt/βcatenin signaling activation. Furthermore, in the absence of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Sfrp1&lt;/span&gt;, Notch signaling is increased, cortical progenitor cell cycle is shorter, with expanded progenitor pools and enhanced generation of early-born neurons. Hence, in postnatal &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Sfrp1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; animals the anterior hippocampus is reduced and the neocortex is shorter in the antero-posterior and medio-lateral axis but is thicker. We propose that, by controlling Wnt and Notch signaling in opposite directions, Sfrp1 promotes hippocampal patterning and balances medio-lateral and antero-posterior cortex expansion.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Cognitive training has been suggested as a possible remediation of decline in brain structure with older age. However, it is unknown whether training effects are transient or enduring, as no studies have examined training-induced plasticity relative to decline in older adults across extended periods with multiple intervention phases. We investigated the temporal dynamics of brain plasticity across periods on and off memory training, hypothesizing that (1) a decline in white matter (WM) microstructure would be observed across the duration of the study and (2) that periods of memory training would moderate the WM microstructural decline. In total, 107 older adults followed a 40-week program, including 2 training periods separated by periods with no intervention. The general decline in WM microstructure observed across the duration of the study was moderated following the training periods, demonstrating that cognitive training may mitigate age-related brain deterioration. The training-related improvements were estimated to subside over time, indicating that continuous training may be a premise for the enduring attenuation of neural decline. Memory improvements were largely maintained after the initial training period, and may thus not rely on continuous training to the same degree as WM microstructure.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Diversity of Cortico-descending Projections: Histological and Diffusion MRI Characterization in the Monkey</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The axonal composition of cortical projections originating in premotor, supplementary motor (SMA), primary motor (a4), somatosensory and parietal areas and descending towards the brain stem and spinal cord was characterized in the monkey with histological tract tracing, electron microscopy (EM) and diffusion MRI (dMRI). These 3 approaches provided complementary information. Histology provided accurate assessment of axonal diameters and size of synaptic boutons. dMRI revealed the topography of the projections (tractography), notably in the internal capsule. From measurements of axon diameters axonal conduction velocities were computed. Each area communicates with different diameter axons and this generates a hierarchy of conduction delays in this order: a4 (the shortest), SMA, premotor (F7), parietal, somatosensory, premotor F4 (the longest). We provide new interpretations for i) the well-known different anatomical and electrophysiological estimates of conduction velocity; ii) why conduction delays are probably an essential component of the cortical motor command; and iii) how histological and dMRI tractography can be integrated.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>
