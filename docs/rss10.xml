	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: ClC-2-like Chloride Current Alterations in a Cell Model of Spinal and Bulbar Muscular Atrophy, a Polyglutamine Disease</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01687-5</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a neuromuscular disease caused by expansions of a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the androgen receptor (AR) gene. SBMA is associated with the progressive loss of lower motor neurons, together with muscle weakness and atrophy. PolyQ-AR is converted to a toxic species upon binding to its natural ligands, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Our previous patch-clamp studies on a motor neuron-derived cell model of SBMA showed alterations in voltage-gated ion currents. Here, we identified and characterized chloride currents most likely belonging to the chloride channel-2 (ClC-2) subfamily, which showed significantly increased amplitudes in the SBMA cells. The treatment with the pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), a neuropeptide with a proven protective effect in a mouse model of SBMA, recovered chloride channel current alterations in SBMA cells. These observations suggest that the CIC-2 currents are affected in SBMA, an alteration that may contribute and potentially determine the pathophysiology of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Identification of Key Genes and Pathways in Mouse Spinal Cord Involved in ddC-Induced Neuropathic Pain by Transcriptome Sequencing</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01686-6</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) works effectively in inhibiting HIV replication in patients. However, the use of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) often causes side effects of neuropathic pain, and its mechanism remains to be elucidated. Therefore, we aim to explore the mechanism of NRTIs-induced neuropathic pain at the transcriptome level. C57BL/6 J mice were given intraperitoneal injection of zalcitabine (ddC) or saline (control) for 2 weeks, during which the mechanical pain threshold of the mice was detected by von Frey test. Then the L3~L5 spinal segments of the mice were isolated and subsequently used for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on the last day of treatment. The mechanical pain threshold of mice given ddC decreased significantly. Compared with the control group, ddC caused significant changes in the expression of 135 genes, of which 66 upregulated and 69 downregulated. Enrichment analysis showed that the functions of these genes are mainly enriched in regulation of transcription, multicellular organism development, and cell differentiation, and the pathway is mainly enriched in the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway and AMPK signaling pathway. Furthermore, key genes such as Gabrd, Kcnd3, Npcd, Insr, Lypd6, Scd2, and Mef2d were also identified. These may serve as drug targets for the prevention or treatment of NRTI-induced neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: The Effect of Optogenetic Inhibition of the Anterior Cingulate Cortex in Neuropathic Pain Following Sciatic Nerve Injury</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01685-7</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cortical disinhibition is the underlying pathological alteration contributing to neuropathic pain associated with peripheral nerve injury. Nerve injury resulting in disinhibition of the anterior cingulate cortex has been reported. However, the effect of optogenetic inhibition of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) on the sensory component of nerve injury–induced neuropathic pain has not been well studied. To investigate the feasibility of optogenetic ACC modulation, we injected an optogenetic virus or a null virus into the ACC of a nerve injury–induced neuropathic pain model. The unilateral ACC was modulated, and the optogenetic effect was measured by mechanical and thermal sensitivity tests. The assessment was performed in “pre—light off,” “stimulation—yellow light on,” and “post—light off” states. Optogenetic inhibition of the ACC in injury models revealed improved mechanical and thermal latencies with profound pain-relieving effects against nerve injury–induced neuropathic pain. The sensory thalamic discharge in electrophysiological in vivo recordings was also altered during laser stimulation. This finding indicates that hyperactivity of the ACC in nerve injury increases output to the spinothalamic tract through direct or indirect pathways. The direct photoinhibition of ACC neurons could play a vital role in restoring equilibrium and provide novel insight into techniques that can assuage peripheral nerve injury–induced neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Cadaverine and Spermine Elicit Ca 2+ Uptake in Human CP Cells via a Trace Amine-Associated Receptor 1 Dependent Pathway</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01684-8</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The choroid plexus (CP) constitutes a barrier between the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which regulates the exchange of substances between these two fluids through mechanisms that are not completely understood. Polyamines as spermine, spermidine and putrescine are produced by all cells and are present in the CSF. Interestingly, their levels are altered in some neuronal disorders as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, thus increasing the interest in their signalling in the central nervous system (CNS). Cadaverine, on the other hand, is synthetized by the intestinal microbiome, suggesting that the presence of this bacterial metabolite in the CSF requires that it is up taken to the CNS across brain barriers. We knew that polyamines are detected by the olfactory signalling cascade operating at the CP, but the receptor involved had not been identified. The zebrafish TAAR13c was the only receptor known to bind a polyamine-cadaverine. Thus, we searched for a human receptor with homology to TAAR13c and found that some human TAARs including TAAR1 showed great homology. Then, we confirmed the expression of TAAR1 mRNA and protein in a human cell line of the CP, and in human CP samples. Calcium imaging assays after TAAR1 knockdown in these cells with a specific siRNA against TAAR1 showed a consistent reduction in the responses of these cells to cadaverine and spermidine, but not to spermine, suggesting that TAAR1 is activated by cadaverine and spermidine, but not spermine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) plays a crucial role in controlling the resolution of inflammation. In this study, we aimed to assess gene expression and the level of IL-10 in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of rats, after a single injection of neurotoxicant trimethyltin chloride (TMT). It was shown that 4 weeks after the treatment with TMT, the level of IL-10 in the prefrontal cortex, but not in the hippocampus of TMT-treated rats, was increased. However, expression level of IL-10 mRNA was upregulated both in the hippocampus and in the prefrontal cortex 3 weeks after the injection. Concomitantly, within the same post-treatment period, the expression level of the cyclooxygenase-2 was upregulated in both brain structures, indicating the induction of neuroinflammation. Considering that TMT leads to the death of neurons mainly in the hippocampus, we assume that in contrast to the prefrontal cortex, the level of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in the hippocampus is not sufficiently increased to prevent the damaging effect of the neurotoxicant. Therefore, an exogenous increase in the level of IL-10 may be useful for the survival of neurons in conditions of neurotoxic damage to the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The previously reported cluster of variants in the last part of exon 30 and the beginning of exon 31 of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CREBBP&lt;/em&gt;, overlapping with the ZNF2 (zinc finger, ZZ-type; residues 1701 to 1744) and ZNF3 (zinc finger, TAZ-type; residues 1764 to 1853) domains, is associated with atypical RSTS. The main features include developmental delay, short stature, microcephaly, distinctive facial features, autistic behavior, feeding difficulties, recurrent upper airway infections, and hearing impairment. Here, we report a 2-year-7-month-old Chinese girl presenting mild cognitive impairments, developmental delay, short stature, recurrent upper airway infections, and facial dysmorphism that resembled the phenotypes of previously reported atypical RSTS patients. The characteristic facial and limb dysmorphism for RSTS was absent in our patient. In addition, our patient exhibited novel phenotypes including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), sleep problem, and abnormal walking posture. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) identified a novel de novo in-frame deletion variant in the beginning of exon 30 of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CREBBP&lt;/em&gt; (NM_004380:c.4897_4899delTTC, p.Phe1633del) in the HAT domain where no pathogenic variants have been previously reported to be responsible for atypical RSTS. Our case allows us to more accurately define the borders of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CREBBP&lt;/em&gt; coding sequence resulting in atypical RSTS, which are extended to the beginning of exon 30 (residue 1633) at the 5′ end of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CREBBP&lt;/em&gt; in the HAT domain, and reveals novel phenotypes observed in our atypical Chinese RSTS patient.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;KLF4 is a zinc-finger transcription factor that plays an essential role in many biological processes, including neuroinflammation, neuron regeneration, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Through effects on these processes, KLF4 has likely roles in Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and traumatic brain injury. However, little is known about the role of KLF4 in more immediate behavioral processes that similarly depend upon broad changes in brain excitability, such as the sleep process. Here, behavioral approaches, western blot, and immunohistochemical experiments were used to explore the role of KLF4 on sedation and the potential mechanisms of those effects. The results showed that overexpression of KLF4 prolonged loss of righting reflex (LORR) duration in pentobarbital-treated mice and increased c-Fos expression in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO), while it decreased c-Fos expression in the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN). Moreover, overexpression of KLF4 reduced the expression of p53 in the hypothalamus and increased the expression of STAT3 in the hypothalamus. Therefore, these results suggest that KLF4 exerts sedative effects through the regulation of p53 and STAT3 expression, and it indicates a role of KLF4 ligands in the treatment of sleep disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Spinal cord microcirculation plays an important role in maintaining the function of spinal cord neurons and other cells. Previous studies have largely focused on the ability of microtubule stabilization to inhibit the fibroblast migration and promote axon regeneration after spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the effect of microtubule stabilization treatment on microcirculation reconstruction after SCI remains unclear. By using immunofluorescence, we found that microtubule stabilization treatment improved microcirculation reconstruction via increasing the number of microvessels, pericytes, and the perfused microvessels after SCI. To clarify the underlying mechanisms, rat brain microvascular endothelial cells and pericytes were subjected to glucose oxygen deprivation. By using flow cytometry and western blotting, we found that microtubule stabilization treatment inhibited apoptosis and migration of endothelial cells and pericytes but promoted proliferation and survival of endothelial cells and pericytes through upregulated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), VEGF receptor 2, platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGFB), PDGF receptor β, and angiopoietin-1 after SCI. Taken together, this study provides evidence for the mechanisms underlying the promotion of microcirculation reconstruction after SCI by microtubule stabilization treatment. Importantly, this study suggests the potential of microtubule stabilization as a therapeutic target to reduce microcirculation dysfunction after SCI in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative condition characterized by motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, resting tremor, and rigidity. PD diagnosis is based on medical history, review of signs, symptoms, neurological and physical examinations. Unfortunately, by the time the disease is diagnosed, dopamine (DA) neuronal loss is often extended, thereby resulting in ineffective therapies. Recent evidence suggests that neuroinflammation may be pivotal during PD onset and progression. However, suitable cellular models and biomarkers to detect early signs of neuroinflammation are still missing. In this study, we developed a well-differentiated DAergic neuronal cell line where we triggered a neuroinflammatory response to assess the temporal expression of the tissue- and urokinase plasminogen activators (tPA and uPA) and their endogenous inhibitor (PAI-1) along with that of pro-inflammatory mediators and the neuronal marker nNOS. Human neuroblastoma cells SH-SY5Y were differentiated into DAergic neuronal-like cells using a combination of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and serum depletion. Terminally-differentiated neurons were then exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for short (up to 24 h) or long term (up to 10 days) to mimic acute or chronic inflammation. Results demonstrated that uPA protein expression was stably upregulated during chronic inflammation, whereas the expression of nNOS protein better reflected the cellular response to acute inflammation. Additional studies revealed that the temporal induction of uPA was associated with increased AKT phosphorylation, but did not seem to involve cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) activation, nor the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. In conclusion, our in vitro data suggests that nNOS and uPA may serve as viable candidate biomarkers of acute and chronic neuroinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;GSK-126 is recognized as an inhibitor of enhancer of zeste homolog-2 (EZH2) activity. Because of its inhibition of EZH2 activation, GSK-126 is considered a potential anti-tumor drug. EZH2 is a histone methyltransferase that catalyzes histone 3 tri-methylation at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), resulting in gene silencing. A previous report showed that decreased H3K27me3 levels in the hippocampus may promote seizure susceptibility, possibly restricting the clinical application of GSK-126. The role of GSK-126 in seizure susceptibility was investigated in this study. We first determined a critical concentration of pentamethazol (PTZ) under which mice exhibit no seizures. We then found that mice pretreated with GSK-126 and injected with the same concentration of PTZ experienced marked convulsions. Peripheral injections of GSK-126 decreased H3K27me3 levels in the hippocampus of mice, while some seizure-related genes (Oasl1, Sox7, armcx5, Ncx3, etc.) were found to be differentially expressed in the hippocampus of those mice . These differences in the expression levels might reflect the crucial role of these genes and related pathways in the promotion of seizure susceptibility. Our results suggest that GSK-126 promotes seizure susceptibility due to its role as an EZH2 inhibitor. These findings may provide evidence to support the development of GSK-126 as a clinical drug.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The mutation of the homeostatic iron regulatory genes (HFE) impaired the hepatic hepcidin transcription leading to the chronic excess of the iron pool, with the adverse consequences of free radical oxidative damages. We herein reported the findings of Thai family members who had the compound of uncommon HFE rs2794719, together with transferrin (TF) rs1867504, transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2) rs7385804, and hemojuvelin (HJV) rs16827043 genetic variants involved in the hepcidin transcriptional pathway. These compounded genetic variants could produce the spectrum of clinical phenotypes that spanned from mild to moderate symptoms of chronic anemia to an established motor neuron disorder. The feasible pathophysiologies were the impairment of the transferrin receptor functions, which affected the endocytic uptake of halo-transferrin into the erythroblast precursors. Such a defect left the erythropoiesis depleted of their iron supply. These alterations also promoted the TfR-independent uptake of iron into other target tissues and left the TrF2/BMP-dependent-hepcidin activation pathway unattended. We used the predicted molecular interactive proteomes to support our speculated dysregulated iron metabolism. During the early stage of an elevated ferritin level, there was no inhibition of ferroportin activities from hepcidin. These pathophysiological processes went on to the point of an iron overload threshold. After that, the hepcidin transcription started to kick in with the resulting decreased serum iron levels and deterioration of clinical symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Mechanisms and progression of ischemic injuries in the retina are still incompletely clarified. Therefore, the time course of microglia activation as well as resulting cytokine expression and downstream signaling were investigated. Ischemia was induced in one eye by transiently elevated intraocular pressure (60 min) followed by reperfusion; the other eye served as a control. Eyes were processed for RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry analyses at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h as well as at 3 and 7 days. Already 2 h after ischemia, more microglia/macrophages were in an active state in the ischemia group. This was accompanied by an upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, and TGFβ. Activation of TLR3, TLR2, and the adaptor molecule Myd88 was also observed after 2 h. NFκB revealed a wave-like activation pattern. In addition, an extrinsic caspase pathway activation was noted at early time points, while enhanced numbers of cleaved caspase 3&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells could be observed in ischemic retinae throughout the study. Retinal ischemia induced an early and strong microglia/macrophage response as well as cytokine and apoptotic activation processes. Moreover, in early and late ischemic damaging processes, TLR expression and downstream signaling were involved, suggesting an involvement in neuronal death in ischemic retinae.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The effective prevention of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) needs to be explored, and the effect of preoperative pain on POCD remains unclear. We established a chronic pain model induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) and models of acute pain and anxiety without pain in mice that were subsequently subjected to partial hepatectomy surgery. Morris water maze (MWM) tests were performed to evaluate the learning and memory abilities of the mice. ELISA was used to measure IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in serum, and HPLC-MS was used to detect neurotransmitters in the prefrontal cortices and hippocampi of the mice. The results indicated that chronic pain induced by CCI might have significantly impaired the learning and memory abilities of mice, while acute pain and anxiety without pain only affected the memory abilities of mice. Perioperative acute pain increased the level of IL-1β in serum, and CCI might have increased the level of IL-6. CCI and acute pain increased dopamine (DA) levels in the cortex, similar to anxiety. Like anxiety, CCI increased 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Acute pain led to a decrease in the acetylcholine (ACH) level in the hippocampus. Our results suggest that acute pain and CCI-induced chronic pain might aggravate postoperative cognitive dysfunction via neurotransmitters and by changing the levels of inflammatory factors such as IL-1β and IL-6.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Even with increased understanding of immunology, the specific etiological trigger of MS remains unknown. Evidence suggests that oxidative/nitroxidative stress is an important contributor to MS etiology, progression, and clinical symptoms. A multifaceted treatment approach aimed at counteracting oxidative/nitroxidative stress including MS disease–modifying medications, Mediterranean style diet, stress-relieving activities, smoking and alcohol cessation, exercise, and peer support programs is the best way to treat the disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Due to molecular mimicry, maternal antibacterial antibodies are suspected to promote neurodevelopmental changes in the offspring that finally can cause disorders like autism and schizophrenia. Using a human first trimester prenatal brain multiprotein array (MPA), we demonstrate here that antibodies to the digestive tract bacteria &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Helicobacter pylori&lt;/em&gt; (α-&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;HPy&lt;/em&gt;) and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Campylobacter jejuni&lt;/em&gt; (α-&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CJe&lt;/em&gt;) interact with different synaptic proteins, including the calcium sensor synaptotagmin 5 (Syt5). Interactions of both antisera with Syt5 were confirmed by Western blot with a HEK293-cells overexpression lysate of this protein. Immunofluorescence and Western blotting revealed SiMa cells to express Syt5, which also co-migrated with a band/spot labeled by either α-&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;HPy&lt;/em&gt; or α-&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CJe&lt;/em&gt;. Functionally, a 12-h pretreatment of SiMa cells with 10 μg/ml of either α-&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;HPy&lt;/em&gt; or α-&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CJe&lt;/em&gt; resulted in a significant reduction of acetylcholine(ACh)-dependent calcium signals as compared to controls. Also ACh-dependent vesicle recycling was significantly reduced in cells pretreated with either α-&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;HPy&lt;/em&gt; or α-&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CJe&lt;/em&gt;. Similar effects were observed upon pretreatment of SiMa cells with Syt5-specific antibodies. In conclusion, the present study supports the view that prenatal maternal antibacterial immune responses towards &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;HPy&lt;/em&gt; and by this to Syt5 are able to cause functional changes, which in the end might contribute also to neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting the ventral midbrain dopaminergic neurons, resulting in motor defects mainly tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia along with a wide array of non-motor symptoms. The current study is focused on determining the potential druggable targets of PD by consolidating gene expression profiling and network methodology. Initially, the differentially expressed genes were established from which the central network was constructed by assimilating the interacting partners. Investigating the topological parameters of the network, the genes &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SYT1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CXCR4&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CDC42&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;KIT&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;RET&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;DRD2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;NTN1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PRKACB&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;KDR&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;NR4A2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SLC18A2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CCK&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TH&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;KCNJ6&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TAC1&lt;/em&gt; were identified as the hub genes and can be explored as potential candidate genes for PD therapeutics. Gene ontology and cluster analysis of the hub genes has provided further insights about the pathophysiology of the disease. Among the hub genes, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PRKACB&lt;/em&gt; is observed in relatively all the enriched pathways which are modulated by G protein-coupled receptors through protein kinases. Further, we noticed &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SYT1&lt;/em&gt; as a novel biomarker for PD. Moreover, the regulatory network was constructed with the hub genes as seed nodes with associated transcription factors (TFs) and microRNA (miRNAs). In this analysis, we identified MYC as the major TF and the miRNAs &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;miR-21&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;miR-155&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;miR-7&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;miR26A1&lt;/em&gt; have a significant role in modulating the hub genes. Briefly, these significant hub genes and their enriched pathways, TFs, and miRNAs have aided in the better understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying PD and its potential core target genes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Recent studies have shed light on the involvement of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the initiation and development of stroke. However, the regulatory function of many lncRNAs in large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) has not been fully elucidated. Based on the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis recently proposed by Pandolfi, the present study was conducted using experimental techniques and bioinformatics to investigate the expression and regulatory function of a lncRNA involved in the development of LAA. The lncRNAs differentially expressed in stroke were obtained using meta-analysis, and one lncRNA was selected for experimental studies on patients with LAA (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 100) and healthy controls (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 100) using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The patients were also evaluated through meta-analysis to identify the function of the selected lncRNA, miRNAs, and mRNAs with altered expression in stroke. Finally, the experimental results and meta-analysis findings were integrated, and different functional groups were assigned. The results indicated that the level of lncRNA-RUNX1-IT1 was significantly lower in the patients with LAA compared to the healthy control subjects (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; 0.05). Logistic regression analyses revealed that the expression of lncRNA-RUNX1-IT1 was inversely correlated with LAA (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 009, OR = 0.871, 95% CI: 0.786–0.965). In addition, a network of differentially expressed genes (DE genes) was created for miRNAs and mRNAs based on their association with lncRNA-RUNX1-IT1. Functional analysis showed that the DE genes in the network are involved in the apoptosis and alternative splicing of RNAs. The findings of the present study suggest that the downregulation of lncRNA-RUNX1-IT1 is associated with LAA development by interrupting the regulatory network of cells. The results of network analysis demonstrated that the lncRNA-RUNX1-IT1 could influence the expression of mRNAs and miRNAs involved in the apoptosis and alternative splicing of RNAs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Despite the putative advantages of MgSO&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as a neuroprotective agent in the preterm brain, the short- and long-term molecular function of MgSO&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as a neuroprotective agent has not been fully elucidated. Neuregulin (NRG1)-ErbB4 signaling plays a critical role in embryonic brain development, in the biology of dopaminergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic systems. We hypothesize that this pathway may be associated with the neuroprotective role of MgSO&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The current study aims to investigate the ability of MgSO&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to modulate the normal developing expression pattern of selected genes related to the NRG1-ErbB, dopaminergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic systems. We demonstrate that overall short-term treatment of dam rats with MgSO&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; affects the expression of fetal brain NRG1, NRG3, ErbB4, GAD67, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine D&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, GluN1, and GluN2B. More specifically, the administration of MgSO&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; alters the expression of NRG-ErbB, GAD67, TH, and D2R at early gestation day 16 (GD16) regardless of the activation of the maternal immune system by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Our data suggest that MgSO&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; treatment may affect the expression of major neuronal systems and pathways mostly at an early gestation day. These changes might be an initial clue (foundation stone) in the molecular mechanism that underlies the beneficial effect of MgSO&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as a neuroprotective agent for the developmental brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Naringin Confers Protection against Psychosocial Defeat Stress-Induced Neurobehavioral Deficits in Mice: Involvement of Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase Isoform-67, Oxido-Nitrergic Stress, and Neuroinflammatory Mechanisms</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Psychosocial stress has been widely reported to contribute to psychiatric disturbances. Perturbations in the enzymes of GABAergic and cholinergic systems have been implicated as precursors in different stress-related neuropsychiatric diseases. Targeting glutamic acid decarboxylase-67 kDa (GAD67) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) via oxidative, nitrergic, and neuroinflammatory mechanisms have been recognized as prospective strategies for the prevention of psychosocial stress-induced behavioral impairments. Naringin, a neuro-active flavonoid compound isolated from citrus fruits, has been shown to produce memory-enhancing, antiepileptic, antidepressant, and anti-inflammatory activities similarly to ginseng, a very potent adaptogen. In this communication, we assessed the effect of naringin on social-defeat stress (SDS)-induced behavioral, GABAergic, cholinergic, oxidative, nitrergic, and neuroinflammatory changes in mice using the resident–intruder paradigm. The intruder male mice were culled into six groups. Groups 1 and 2 (normal- and SDS-controls) received sterile saline, groups 3–5 were given naringin (25-100 mg/kg, i.p.) whereas group 6 had ginseng (50 mg/kg, i.p.) daily for 14 days, but followed by 10 min SDS (physical and psychological) exposure to groups 2–6 with aggressor–resident mice. Behavioral effects using Y-maze, elevated-plus maze, sociability, and tail-suspension tests were assessed on day 14. GAD67, AChE enzymes, and biomarkers of oxidative, nitrergic, and neuroinflammatory changes were assayed in the striatum, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus. Naringin and ginseng reversed all SDS-induced behavioral impairments. Naringin increased the levels of GAD67 and decreased AChE activities in the striatum, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus. Furthermore, naringin reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6), malondialdehyde, nitrite concentrations, and increased glutathione levels in a region-dependent manner. Our study suggests that naringin attenuated SDS-induced behavioral endophenotypes of neuropsychiatric disease through increased GAD67 synthesis, inhibition of AChE activity, oxidative, nitrergic stress, and neuroinflammatory processes in stress-sensitive brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Computational models of animal biosonar seek to identify critical aspects of echo processing responsible for the superior, real-time performance of echolocating bats and dolphins in target tracking and clutter rejection. The Spectrogram Correlation and Transformation (SCAT) model replicates aspects of biosonar imaging in both species by processing wideband biosonar sounds and echoes with auditory mechanisms identified from experiments with bats. The model acquires broadband biosonar broadcasts and echoes, represents them as time-frequency spectrograms using parallel bandpass filters, translates the filtered signals into ten parallel amplitude threshold levels, and then operates on the resulting time-of-occurrence values at each frequency to estimate overall echo range delay. It uses the structure of the echo spectrum by depicting it as a series of local frequency nulls arranged regularly along the frequency axis of the spectrograms after dechirping them relative to the broadcast. Computations take place entirely on the timing of threshold-crossing events for each echo relative to threshold-events for the broadcast. Threshold-crossing times take into account amplitude-latency trading, a physiological feature absent from conventional digital signal processing. Amplitude-latency trading transposes the profile of amplitudes across frequencies into a profile of time-registrations across frequencies. Target shape is extracted from the spacing of the object’s individual acoustic reflecting points, or glints, using the mutual interference pattern of peaks and nulls in the echo spectrum. These are merged with the overall range-delay estimate to produce a delay-based reconstruction of the object’s distance as well as its glints. Clutter echoes indiscriminately activate multiple parts in the null-detecting system, which then produces the equivalent glint-delay spacings in images, thus blurring the overall echo-delay estimates by adding spurious glint delays to the image. Blurring acts as an anticorrelation process that rejects clutter intrusion into perceptions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-Fv413WZkhU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The oncogenic human herpesviruses Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) are the causative agents of multiple malignancies. A hallmark of herpesviruses is their biphasic life cycle consisting of latent and lytic infection. In this study, we identified that cellular nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), an evolutionarily conserved RNA degradation pathway, critically regulates the latent-to-lytic switch of EBV and KSHV infection. The NMD machinery suppresses EBV and KSHV Rta transactivator expression and promotes maintenance of viral latency by targeting the viral polycistronic transactivator transcripts for degradation through the recognition of features in their 3′ UTRs. Treatment with a small-molecule NMD inhibitor potently induced reactivation in a variety of EBV- and KSHV-infected cell types. In conclusion, our results identify NMD as an important host process that controls oncogenic herpesvirus reactivation, which may be targeted for the therapeutic induction of lytic reactivation and the eradication of tumor cells.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/qY9ePyHwHuI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Parkinson's disease (PD) impairs various cognitive functions, including time perception. Dysfunctional time perception in PD is poorly understood, and no study has investigated the rehabilitation of time perception in patients with PD. We aimed to induce the recovery of time perception in PD patients and investigated the potential relationship between recovery and cognitive functions/domains other than time perception. Sixty patients with PD (27 females) and 20 healthy controls (10 females) were recruited. The participants underwent a feedback training protocol for 4 weeks to improve the accuracy of subjective spatial distance or time duration using a ruler or stopwatch, respectively. They participated in three tests at weekly intervals, each comprising 10 types of cognitive tasks and assessments. After duration feedback training for 1 month, performance on the Go/No‐go task, Stroop task, and impulsivity assessment improved in patients with PD, while no effect was observed after distance feedback training. Additionally, the effect of training on duration production correlated with extended reaction time and improved accuracy in the Go/No‐go and Stroop tasks. These findings suggest that time perception is functionally linked to inhibitory systems. If the feedback training protocol can modulate and maintain time perception, it may improve various cognitive/psychiatric functions in patients with PD. It may also be useful in the treatment of diseases other than PD that cause dysfunctions in temporal processing.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08361</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Clustering is a commonly used method for exploring and analysing data where
the primary objective is to categorise observations into similar clusters. In
recent decades, several algorithms and methods have been developed for
analysing clustered data. We notice that most of these techniques
deterministically define a cluster based on the value of the attributes,
distance, and density of homogenous and single-featured datasets. However,
these definitions are not successful in adding clear semantic meaning to the
clusters produced. Evolutionary operators and statistical and
multi-disciplinary techniques may help in generating meaningful clusters. Based
on this premise, we propose a new evolutionary clustering algorithm (ECAStar)
based on social class ranking and meta-heuristic algorithms for stochastically
analysing heterogeneous and multiple-featured datasets. The ECAStar is
integrated with recombinational evolutionary operators, Levy flight
optimisation, and some statistical techniques, such as quartiles and
percentiles, as well as the Euclidean distance of the K-means algorithm.
Experiments are conducted to evaluate the ECAStar against five conventional
approaches: K-means (KM), K-meansPlusPlus (KMPlusPlus), expectation
maximisation (EM), learning vector quantisation (LVQ), and the genetic
algorithm for clusteringPlusPlus (GENCLUSTPlusPlus).

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Data-driven evolutionary optimization has witnessed great success in solving
complex real-world optimization problems. However, existing data-driven
optimization algorithms require that all data are centrally stored, which is
not always practical and may be vulnerable to privacy leakage and security
threats if the data must be collected from different devices. To address the
above issue, this paper proposes a federated data-driven evolutionary
optimization framework that is able to perform data driven optimization when
the data is distributed on multiple devices. On the basis of federated
learning, a sorted model aggregation method is developed for aggregating local
surrogates based on radial-basis-function networks. In addition, a federated
surrogate management strategy is suggested by designing an acquisition function
that takes into account the information of both the global and local surrogate
models. Empirical studies on a set of widely used benchmark functions in the
presence of various data distributions demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08209</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This paper looks into the modeling of hallucination in the human's brain.
Hallucinations are known to be causally associated with some malfunctions
within the interaction of different areas of the brain involved in perception.
Focusing on visual hallucination and its underlying causes, we identify an
adversarial mechanism between different parts of the brain which are
responsible in the process of visual perception. We then show how the
characterized adversarial interactions in the brain can be modeled by a
generative adversarial network.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Stereotype and Skew: Quantifying Gender Bias in Pre-trained and Fine-tuned Language Models. (arXiv:2101.09688v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09688</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This paper proposes two intuitive metrics, skew and stereotype, that quantify
and analyse the gender bias present in contextual language models when tackling
the WinoBias pronoun resolution task. We find evidence that gender stereotype
correlates approximately negatively with gender skew in out-of-the-box models,
suggesting that there is a trade-off between these two forms of bias. We
investigate two methods to mitigate bias. The first approach is an online
method which is effective at removing skew at the expense of stereotype. The
second, inspired by previous work on ELMo, involves the fine-tuning of BERT
using an augmented gender-balanced dataset. We show that this reduces both skew
and stereotype relative to its unaugmented fine-tuned counterpart. However, we
find that existing gender bias benchmarks do not fully probe professional bias
as pronoun resolution may be obfuscated by cross-correlations from other
manifestations of gender prejudice. Our code is available online, at
https://github.com/12kleingordon34/NLP_masters_project.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Approximation Bounds for Random Neural Networks and Reservoir Systems. (arXiv:2002.05933v2 [math.PR] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05933</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This work studies approximation based on single-hidden-layer feedforward and
recurrent neural networks with randomly generated internal weights. These
methods, in which only the last layer of weights and a few hyperparameters are
optimized, have been successfully applied in a wide range of static and dynamic
learning problems. Despite the popularity of this approach in empirical tasks,
important theoretical questions regarding the relation between the unknown
function, the weight distribution, and the approximation rate have remained
open. In this work it is proved that, as long as the unknown function,
functional, or dynamical system is sufficiently regular, it is possible to draw
the internal weights of the random (recurrent) neural network from a generic
distribution (not depending on the unknown object) and quantify the error in
terms of the number of neurons and the hyperparameters. In particular, this
proves that echo state networks with randomly generated weights are capable of
approximating a wide class of dynamical systems arbitrarily well and thus
provides the first mathematical explanation for their empirically observed
success at learning dynamical systems.

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Pain is a complex, multidimensional experience that involves dynamic interactions between sensory-discriminative and affective-emotional processes. Pain experiences have a high degree of variability depending on their context and prior anticipation. Viewing pain perception as a perceptual inference problem, we propose a predictive coding paradigm to characterize evoked and non-evoked pain. We record the local field potentials (LFPs) from the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of freely behaving rats—two regions known to encode the sensory-discriminative and affective-emotional aspects of pain, respectively. We further use predictive coding to investigate the temporal coordination of oscillatory activity between the S1 and ACC. Specifically, we develop a phenomenological predictive coding model to describe the macroscopic dynamics of bottom-up and top-down activity. Supported by recent experimental data, we also develop a biophysical neural mass model to describe the mesoscopic neural dynamics in the S1 and ACC populations, in both naive and chronic pain-treated animals. Our proposed predictive coding models not only replicate important experimental findings, but also provide new prediction about the impact of the model parameters on the physiological or behavioral read-out—thereby yielding mechanistic insight into the uncertainty of expectation, placebo or nocebo effect, and chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Feed-forward deep neural networks have better performance in object categorization tasks than other models of computer vision. To understand the relationship between feed-forward deep networks and the primate brain, we investigated representations of upright and inverted faces in a convolutional deep neural network model and compared them with representations by neurons in the monkey anterior inferior-temporal cortex, area TE. We applied principal component analysis to feature vectors in each model layer to visualize the relationship between the vectors of the upright and inverted faces. The vectors of the upright and inverted monkey faces were more separated through the convolution layers. In the fully-connected layers, the separation among human individuals for upright faces was larger than for inverted faces. The Spearman correlation between each model layer and TE neurons reached a maximum at the fully-connected layers. These results indicate that the processing of faces in the fully-connected layers might resemble the asymmetric representation of upright and inverted faces by the TE neurons. The separation of upright and inverted faces might take place by feed-forward processing in the visual cortex, and separations among human individuals for upright faces, which were larger than those for inverted faces, might occur in area TE.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the risk of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) between direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and other antithrombotic drugs in detail across all diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Heterogeneity was examined using the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; statistic. Risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using random-effects meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Fifty-five RCTs were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), dabigatran reduced the risk of ICH by 60% (RR 0.40; 95% CI 0.28–0.57), apixaban by 57% (RR 0.43; 95% CI 0.31–0.58), edoxaban by 56% (RR 0.44; 95% CI 0.29–0.67) and rivaroxaban by 41% (RR 0.59; 95%CI 0.44–0.80). Compared with low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs), apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban had a similar risk of ICH. Compared with aspirin, dabigatran and apixaban had a similar risk of ICH, while rivaroxaban posed an increased risk of ICH (RR 2.12; 95% CI 1.31–3.44). For secondary prevention stroke, DOACs reduced the risk of ICH by 46% compared with warfarin (RR 0.54; 95% CI [0.42–0.70]) and had a similar risk of ICH compared with aspirin.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;All DOACs had a lower risk of ICH than VKAs. In terms of the risk of ICH, DOACs were overall as safe as LMWHs, and apixaban and dabigatran were as safe as aspirin, but rivaroxaban was not. For secondary prevention stroke, the risk of ICH with DOACs was overall lower than warfarin and similar to aspirin, but it should be noted that compared with aspirin, rivaroxaban may increase the risk of ICH. This is the first pair-wise meta-analysis that compares the risk of ICH between DOACs and other antithrombotic drugs in detail across all diseases, which may have certain significance for patients with high risk of ICH to choose antithrombotic drugs in clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To investigate if visuomotor coordination of hand movements is impaired in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) identified by dedicated testing procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Forty-seven patients admitted for diagnostic workup for suspected NPH were studied prospectively with MRI, testing of cognitive and motor functions, lumbar puncture, and visuomotor coordination of hand movements using the PABLO&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;-device before and after a spinal tap of 40–50 ml CSF. Statistical analyses were carried out with repeated measures ANOVA and non-parametric correlation analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Fourteen patients were found to suffer from ideopathic NPH. They were severely impaired in visuomotor control of intermittent arm movements in comparison to patients who were found not to be affected by NPH (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 18). In the patients with NPH the deficient arm control was improved after the spinal tap in proportion to the improvement of gait. There was no improvement of cognitive and motor functions in the patients not affected by NPH, while the patients with possible NPH (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 15) showed intermediate deficit and improvement patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Interpretation: Our data underline the importance of a multiparametric assessment of NPH and provide evidence for a motor control deficit in idiopathic NPH involving leg and arm movements. It is suggested that this motor control deficit resulted from an affection of the output tracts from the supplementary motor area in the periventricular vicinity.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: The Effects of Selective Inhibition of Histone Deacetylase 1 and 3 in Huntington’s Disease Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.616886</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Huntington’s disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease characterized by a late clinical onset of psychiatric, cognitive, and motor symptoms. Transcriptional dysregulation is an early and central disease mechanism which is accompanied by epigenetic alterations in HD. Previous studies demonstrated that targeting transcriptional changes by inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs), especially the class I HDACs, provides therapeutic effects. Yet, their exact mechanisms of action and the features of HD pathology, on which these inhibitors act remain to be elucidated. Here, using transcriptional profiling, we found that selective inhibition of HDAC1 and HDAC3 by RGFP109 alleviated transcriptional dysregulation of a number of genes, including the transcription factor genes Neurod2 and Nr4a2, and gene sets and programs, especially those that are associated to insulin-like growth factor pathway, in the striatum of R6/1 mice. RGFP109 treatment led to a modest improvement of the motor skill learning and coordination deficit on the RotaRod test, while it did not alter the locomotor and anxiety-like phenotypes in R6/1 animals. We also found, by volumetric MRI, a widespread brain atrophy in the R6/1 mice at the symptomatic disease stage, on which RGFP109 showed no significant effects. Collectively, our combined work suggests that specific HDAC1 and HDAC3 inhibition may offer benefits for alleviating the motor phenotypic deficits and transcriptional dysregulation in HD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.630502</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by extracellular amyloid β (Aβ) and intraneuronal tau protein aggregations. One risk factor for developing AD is the APOE gene coding for the apolipoprotein E protein (apoE). Humans have three versions of APOE gene: ε2, ε3, and ε4 allele. Carrying the ε4 allele is an AD risk factor while carrying the ε2 allele is protective. ApoE is a component of lipoprotein particles in the plasma at the periphery, as well as in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in the interstitial fluid (ISF) of brain parenchyma in the central nervous system (CNS). ApoE is a major lipid transporter that plays a pivotal role in the development, maintenance, and repair of the CNS, and that regulates multiple important signaling pathways. This review will focus on the critical role of apoE in AD pathogenesis and some of the currently apoE-based therapeutics developed in the treatment of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: No Impact of Stochastic Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation on Arterial Pressure and Heart Rate Variability in the Elderly Population</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.646127</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;Noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation (nGVS) is often used to improve postural stability in disorders, such as neurorehabilitation montage. For the safe use of nGVS, we investigated whether arterial pressure (AP) and heart rate vary during static supine and slow whole-body tilt with random nGVS (0.4 mA, 0.1–640 Hz, gaussian distribution) in a healthy elderly population.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;This study was conducted with a double-blind, sham-controlled, cross-over design. Seventeen healthy older adults were recruited. They were asked to maintain a static supine position on a bed for 10 min, and the bed was tilted up (TU) to 70 degrees within 30 s. After maintaining this position for 3 min, the bed was passively tilted down (TD) within 30 s. Real-nGVS or sham-nGVS was applied from 4 to 15 min. The time course of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and RR interval variability (RRIV) were analyzed to estimate the autonomic nervous activity.&lt;/p&gt;Result&lt;p&gt;nGVS and/or time, including pre-/post-event (nGVS-start, TU, and TD), had no impact on MAP and RRIV-related parameters. Further, there was no evidence supporting the argument that nGVS induces pain, vertigo/dizziness, and uncomfortable feeling.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;nGVS may not affect the AP and RRIV during static position and whole-body tilting or cause pain, vertigo/dizziness, and discomfort in the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Trajectories of Mother-Infant Communication: An Experiential Measure of the Impacts of Early Life Adversity</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.632702</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Caretaking stability in the early life environment supports neurobehavioral development, while instability and neglect constitute adverse environments that can alter maturational processes. Research in humans suggests that different types of early life adversity (ELA) can have differential effects on caretaker relationships and later cognitive and social development; however, identifying mechanistic underpinnings will require animal models with translational validity. Two common rodent models, maternal separation (MS) and limited bedding (LB), influence the mother-infant relationship during a critical window of development. We hypothesized that these paradigms may affect the development of communication strategies on the part of the pup. Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are a care-eliciting mechanism and ethologically relevant response to stressors in the rat pup. USV emission rates and acoustic parameters change throughout early development, presenting the opportunity to define developmental milestones in USVs that would reflect neurobehavioral aberrations if disrupted. This study investigated the effects of MS or LB on the dam-pup relationship by quantifying pup USVs, maternal behavior, and the relationship between the two. First, we used a generalized additive model approach to establish typical developmental trajectories of USV acoustic properties and determine windows of change in MS or LB rearing. Additionally, we quantified maternal behaviors and the predictability of maternal care sequences using an entropy rate calculation. MS and LB each shifted the developmental trajectories of USV acoustic parameters and call types in a sex-specific manner. MS more often impacted male USVs, while LB impacted female USVs. MS dams spent more time passive nursing, and LB dams spent more time on the nest. The predictability of maternal care was associated with the rate of USV emissions exclusively in females. Taken together, findings demonstrate sex- and model-specific effects of rearing environments on a novel developmental trajectory involving the mother-infant relationship, facilitating the translation of animal ELA paradigms to assess later-life consequences.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Excitability of the Ipsilateral Primary Motor Cortex During Unilateral Goal-Directed Movement</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.617146</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Previous transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies have revealed that the activity of the primary motor cortex ipsilateral to an active hand (ipsi-M1) plays an important role in motor control. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the ipsi-M1 excitability would be influenced by goal-directed movement and laterality during unilateral finger movements.&lt;/p&gt;Method&lt;p&gt;Ten healthy right-handed subjects performed four finger tapping tasks with the index finger: (1) simple tapping (Tap) task, (2) Real-word task, (3) Pseudoword task, and (4) Visually guided tapping (VT) task. In the Tap task, the subject performed self-paced simple tapping on a touch screen. In the real-word task, the subject tapped letters displayed on the screen one by one to create a Real-word (e.g., apple). Because the action had a specific purpose (i.e., creating a word), this task was considered to be goal-directed as compared to the Tap task. In the Pseudoword task, the subject tapped the letters to create a pseudoword (e.g., gdiok) in the same manner as in the Real-word task; however, the word was less meaningful. In the VT task, the subject was required to touch a series of illuminated buttons. This task was considered to be less goal-directed than the Pseudoword task. The tasks were performed with the right and left hand, and a rest condition was added as control. Single- and paired-pulse TMS were applied to the ipsi-M1 to measure corticospinal excitability and short- and long-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI and LICI) in the resting first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We found the smaller SICI in the ipsi-M1 during the VT task compared with the resting condition. Further, both SICI and LICI were smaller in the right than in the left M1, regardless of the task conditions.&lt;/p&gt;Discussion&lt;p&gt;We found that SICI in the ipsi-M1 is smaller during visual illumination-guided finger movement than during the resting condition. Our finding provides basic data for designing a rehabilitation program that modulates the M1 ipsilateral to the moving limb, for example, for post-stroke patients with severe hemiparesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Phonological Underspecification: An Explanation for How a Rake Can Become Awake</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.585817</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural markers, such as the mismatch negativity (MMN), have been used to examine the phonological underspecification of English feature contrasts using the Featurally Underspecified Lexicon (FUL) model. However, neural indices have not been examined within the approximant phoneme class, even though there is evidence suggesting processing asymmetries between liquid (e.g., /ɹ/) and glide (e.g., /w/) phonemes. The goal of this study was to determine whether glide phonemes elicit electrophysiological asymmetries related to [consonantal] underspecification when contrasted with liquid phonemes in adult English speakers. Specifically, /ɹɑ/ is categorized as [+consonantal] while /wɑ/ is not specified [i.e., (–consonantal)]. Following the FUL framework, if /w/ is less specified than /ɹ/, the former phoneme should elicit a larger MMN response than the latter phoneme. Fifteen English-speaking adults were presented with two syllables, /ɹɑ/ and /wɑ/, in an event-related potential (ERP) oddball paradigm in which both syllables served as the standard and deviant stimulus in opposite stimulus sets. Three types of analyses were used: (1) traditional mean amplitude measurements; (2) cluster-based permutation analyses; and (3) event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) analyses. The less specified /wɑ/ elicited a large MMN, while a much smaller MMN was elicited by the more specified /ɹɑ/. In the standard and deviant ERP waveforms, /wɑ/ elicited a significantly larger negative response than did /ɹɑ/. Theta activity elicited by /ɹɑ/ was significantly greater than that elicited by /wɑ/ in the 100–300 ms time window. Also, low gamma activation was significantly lower for /ɹɑ/ vs. /wɑ/ deviants over the left hemisphere, as compared to the right, in the 100–150 ms window. These outcomes suggest that the [consonantal] feature follows the underspecification predictions of FUL previously tested with the place of articulation and voicing features. Thus, this study provides new evidence for phonological underspecification. Moreover, as neural oscillation patterns have not previously been discussed in the underspecification literature, the ERSP analyses identified potential new indices of phonological underspecification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Fast Simulations of Highly-Connected Spiking Cortical Models Using GPUs</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.627620</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade there has been a growing interest in the development of parallel hardware systems for simulating large-scale networks of spiking neurons. Compared to other highly-parallel systems, GPU-accelerated solutions have the advantage of a relatively low cost and a great versatility, thanks also to the possibility of using the CUDA-C/C++ programming languages. NeuronGPU is a GPU library for large-scale simulations of spiking neural network models, written in the C++ and CUDA-C++ programming languages, based on a novel spike-delivery algorithm. This library includes simple LIF (leaky-integrate-and-fire) neuron models as well as several multisynapse AdEx (adaptive-exponential-integrate-and-fire) neuron models with current or conductance based synapses, different types of spike generators, tools for recording spikes, state variables and parameters, and it supports user-definable models. The numerical solution of the differential equations of the dynamics of the AdEx models is performed through a parallel implementation, written in CUDA-C++, of the fifth-order Runge-Kutta method with adaptive step-size control. In this work we evaluate the performance of this library on the simulation of a cortical microcircuit model, based on LIF neurons and current-based synapses, and on balanced networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, using AdEx or Izhikevich neuron models and conductance-based or current-based synapses. On these models, we will show that the proposed library achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of simulation time per second of biological activity. In particular, using a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU board, the full-scale cortical-microcircuit model, which includes about 77,000 neurons and 3 · 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; connections, can be simulated at a speed very close to real time, while the simulation time of a balanced network of 1,000,000 AdEx neurons with 1,000 connections per neuron was about 70 s per second of biological activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Sensory Detection by the Vomeronasal Organ Modulates Experience-Dependent Social Behaviors in Female Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.638800</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In mice, social behaviors are largely controlled by the olfactory system. Pheromone detection induces naïve virgin females to retrieve isolated pups to the nest and to be sexually receptive to males, but social experience increases the performance of both types of innate behaviors. Whether animals are intrinsically sensitive to the smell of conspecifics, or the detection of olfactory cues modulates experience for the display of social responses is currently unclear. Here, we employed mice with an olfactory-specific deletion of the G protein Gαi2, which partially eliminates sensory function in the vomeronasal organ (VNO), to show that social behavior in female mice results from interactions between intrinsic mechanisms in the vomeronasal system and experience-dependent plasticity. In pup- and sexually-naïve females, Gαi2 deletion elicited a reduction in pup retrieval behavior, but not in sexual receptivity. By contrast, experienced animals showed normal maternal behavior, but the experience-dependent increase in sexual receptivity was incomplete. Further, lower receptivity was accompanied by reduced neuronal activity in the anterior accessory olfactory bulb and the rostral periventricular area of the third ventricle. Therefore, neural mechanisms utilize intrinsic sensitivity in the mouse vomeronasal system and enable plasticity to display consistent social behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Cortical Thinning in the Medial Temporal Lobe and Precuneus Is Related to Cognitive Deficits in Patients With Subcortical Ischemic Vascular Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.614833</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD) is a major cause of vascular cognitive impairment (CI) and features extensive atrophy in the cerebral cortex. We aimed to test the hypothesis that cognitive deficits in SIVD are linked to decreased cortical thickness in specific brain regions, which may constitute neuroimaging biomarkers of CI. Sixty-seven SIVD patients without (SIVD-NC, n = 35) and with (SIVD-CI, n = 32) CI and a group of healthy controls (HCs, n = 36) underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cognitive functional assessments. FreeSurfer was used to preprocess structural MRI data and to calculate and compare cortical thickness. The correlation between cortical thickness and cognitive scores was examined in SIVD patients. Significantly altered cortical thickness in the bilateral insula, middle and inferior temporal lobes, precuneus, and medial temporal lobe (MTL) was identified among the three groups (p &amp;lt; 0.05, Monte Carlo simulation corrected). Post hoc results showed significantly decreased thickness in the bilateral insula and temporal lobe in SIVD-NC and SIVD-CI patients compared with HCs. However, the areas with reduced cortical thickness were larger in SIVD-CI than SIVD-NC patients. SIVD-CI patients had significantly reduced thickness in the bilateral precuneus and left MTL (Bonferroni corrected) compared with SIVD-NC patients when we extracted the mean thickness for each region of interest. In SIVD patients, the thicknesses of the left MTL and bilateral precuneus were positively correlated with immediate recall in the memory test. SIVD might lead to extensive cerebral cortical atrophy, while atrophy in the MTL and precuneus might be associated with memory deficits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64145</link>
	<content:encoded>Life in a three-dimensional biofilm is typical for many bacteria, yet little is known about how strains interact in this context. Here, we created essential-gene CRISPRi knockdown libraries in biofilm-forming &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis &lt;/i&gt;and measured competitive fitness during colony co-culture with wild type. Partial knockdown of some translation-related genes reduced growth rates and led to out-competition. Media composition led some knockdowns to compete differentially as biofilm versus non-biofilm colonies. Cells depleted for the alanine racemase AlrA died in monoculture but survived in a biofilm-colony co-culture via nutrient sharing. Rescue was enhanced in biofilm-colony co-culture with a matrix-deficient parent, due to a mutualism involving nutrient and matrix sharing. We identified several examples of mutualism involving matrix sharing that occurred in three-dimensional biofilm colonies but not when cultured in two dimensions. Thus, growth in a three-dimensional colony can promote genetic diversity through sharing of secreted factors and may drive evolution of mutualistic behavior.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>In the context of a generative model, such as predictive coding, pain and heat perception can be construed as the integration of expectation and input with their difference denoted as a prediction error. In a previous neuroimaging study (Geuter et al., 2017) we observed an important role of the insula in such a model, but could not establish its temporal aspects. Here we employed electroencephalography to investigate neural representations of predictions and prediction errors in heat and pain processing. Our data show that alpha-to-beta activity was associated with stimulus intensity expectation, followed by a negative modulation of gamma band activity by absolute prediction errors. This is in contrast to prediction errors in visual and auditory perception, which are associated with increased gamma band activity, but is in agreement with observations in working memory and word matching, which show gamma band activity for correct, rather than violated predictions.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62574</link>
	<content:encoded>Living cells often need to measure chemical concentrations that vary in time, yet how accurately they can do so is poorly understood. Here, we present a theory that fully specifies, without any adjustable parameters, the optimal design of a canonical sensing system, in terms of two elementary design principles: (1) there exists an optimal integration time, which is determined by the input statistics and the number of receptors; (2) in the optimally designed system, the number of independent concentration measurements as set by the number of receptors and the optimal integration time, equals the number of readout molecules that store these measurements, and equals the work to store these measurements reliably; no resource is then in excess and hence wasted. Applying our theory to the E.coli chemotaxis system indicates that its integration time is not only optimal for sensing shallow gradients, but also necessary to enable navigation in these gradients.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62548</link>
	<content:encoded>While comparative functional genomic studies have shown that inter-species differences in gene expression can be explained by corresponding inter-species differences in genetic and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, co-transcriptional mechanisms, such as alternative polyadenylation (APA), have received little attention. We characterized APA in lymphoblastoid cell lines from six humans and six chimpanzees by identifying and estimating usage for 44,432 polyadenylation sites (PAS) in 9,518 genes. Although APA is largely conserved, 1,705 genes showed significantly different PAS usage (FDR 0.05) between species. Genes with divergent APA also tend to be differentially expressed, are enriched among genes showing differences in protein translation, and can explain a subset of observed inter-species protein expression differences that do not differ at the transcript level. Finally, we found that genes with a dominant PAS, which is used more often than other PAS, are particularly enriched for differentially expressed genes.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62329</link>
	<content:encoded>Speech processing is built upon encoding by the auditory nerve and brainstem, yet we know very little about how these processes unfold in specific subcortical structures. These structures are deep and respond quickly, making them difficult to study during ongoing speech. Recent techniques begin to address this problem, but yield temporally broad responses with consequently ambiguous neural origins. Here we describe a method that pairs re-synthesized 'peaky' speech with deconvolution analysis of EEG recordings. We show that in adults with normal hearing, the method quickly yields robust responses whose component waves reflect activity from distinct subcortical structures spanning auditory nerve to rostral brainstem. We further demonstrate the versatility of peaky speech by simultaneously measuring bilateral and ear-specific responses across different frequency bands, and discuss important practical considerations such as talker choice. The peaky speech method holds promise as a tool for investigating speech encoding and processing, and for clinical applications.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Cohesin helps mediate sister chromatid cohesion, chromosome condensation, DNA repair and transcription regulation. We exploited proximity-dependent labeling to define the &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt;interactions of cohesin domains with DNA or with other cohesin domains that lie within the same or in different cohesin complexes. Our results suggest both cohesin's head and hinge domains bind to DNA, and cohesin structure is dynamic with differential folding of its coiled coil regions to generate butterfly confirmations. This method also reveals that cohesins form ordered clusters on and off DNA. The levels of cohesin clusters and their distribution on chromosomes are cell cycle-regulated. Cohesin clustering is likely necessary for cohesion maintenance because clustering and maintenance uniquely require the same subset of cohesin domains and the auxiliary cohesin factor Pds5p. These conclusions provide important new mechanistic and biological insights into the architecture of the cohesin complex, cohesin-cohesin interactions, and cohesin's tethering and loop extruding activities.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61531</link>
	<content:encoded>Brain homeostasis is regulated by the viability and functionality of neurons. HAT (histone acetyltransferase) and HDAC (histone deacetylase) inhibitors have been applied to treat neurological deficits in humans; yet, the epigenetic regulation in neurodegeneration remains elusive. Mutations of HAT cofactor TRRAP (Transformation/translation domain-associated protein) cause human neuropathies, including psychosis, intellectual disability, autism and epilepsy, with unknown mechanism. Here we show that Trrap deletion in Purkinje neurons results in neurodegeneration of old mice. Integrated transcriptomics, epigenomics and proteomics reveal that TRRAP via SP1 conducts a conserved transcriptomic program. TRRAP is required for SP1 binding at the promoter proximity of target genes, especially microtubule dynamics. The ectopic expression of Stathmin3/4 ameliorates defects of TRRAP-deficient neurons, indicating that the microtubule dynamics is particularly vulnerable to the action of SP1 activity. This study unravels a network linking three well-known, but up-to-date unconnected, signaling pathways, namely TRRAP, HAT and SP1 with microtubule dynamics, in neuroprotection.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61409</link>
	<content:encoded>Blood cells arise from diverse pools of stem and progenitor cells. Understanding progenitor heterogeneity is a major challenge. The &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; larval lymph gland is a well-studied model to understand blood progenitor maintenance and recapitulates several aspects of vertebrate hematopoiesis. However in-depth analysis has focused on the anterior lobe progenitors (AP), ignoring the posterior progenitors (PP) from the posterior lobes. Using &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; expression mapping, developmental and transcriptome analysis we reveal PP heterogeneity and identify molecular-genetic tools to study this abundant progenitor population. Functional analysis shows that PP resist differentiation upon immune challenge, in a JAK-STAT-dependent manner. Upon wasp parasitism, AP downregulate JAK-STAT signaling and form lamellocytes. In contrast, we show that PP activate STAT92E and remain undifferentiated, promoting survival. &lt;i&gt;Stat92E &lt;/i&gt;knockdown or genetically reducing JAK-STAT signaling permits PP lamellocyte differentiation. We discuss how heterogeneity and compartmentalization allow functional segregation in response to systemic cues and could be widely applicable.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61406</link>
	<content:encoded>The kinase PDK1 is a crucial regulator for immune cell development by connecting PI3K to downstream AKT signaling. However, the roles of PDK1 in CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell differentiation, especially in T follicular helper (Tfh) cell, remain obscure. Here we reported PDK1 intrinsically promotes the Tfh cell differentiation and germinal center responses upon acute infection by using conditional knockout mice. PDK1 deficiency in T cells caused severe defects in both early differentiation and late maintenance of Tfh cells. The expression of key Tfh regulators was remarkably downregulated in PDK1-deficient Tfh cells, including &lt;i&gt;Tcf7&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Bcl6&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Icos&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Cxcr5&lt;/i&gt;. Mechanistically, ablation of PDK1 led to impaired phosphorylation of AKT and defective activation of mTORC1, resulting in substantially reduced expression of Hif1α and p-STAT3. Meanwhile, decreased p-AKT also suppresses mTORC2-associated GSK3β activity in PDK1-deficient Tfh cells. These integrated effects contributed to the dramatical reduced expression of TCF1 and ultimately impaired the Tfh cell differentiation.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>A vast portion of the mammalian genome is transcribed as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) acting in the cytoplasm with largely unknown functions. Surprisingly, lncRNAs have been shown to interact with ribosomes, encode peptides, or act as ribosome sponges. These functions still remain mostly undetected and understudied owing to the lack of efficient tools for genome-wide simultaneous identification of ribosome-associated and peptide-producing lncRNAs. Here we present AHARIBO, a method for the detection of lncRNAs either untranslated, but associated with ribosomes, or encoding small peptides. Using AHARIBO in mouse embryonic stem cells during neuronal differentiation, we isolated ribosome-protected RNA fragments, translated RNAs and corresponding &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; synthesized peptides. Besides identifying mRNAs under active translation and associated ribosomes, we found and distinguished lncRNAs acting as ribosome sponges or encoding micropeptides, laying the ground for a better functional understanding of hundreds lncRNAs.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The pivotal role of the periaqueductal grey (PAG) in fear learning is reinforced by the identification of neurons in rat ventral (vPAG) that encode fear memory through signalling the onset and offset of an auditory conditioned stimulus during retrieval. Within this framework, understanding of cerebellar contributions to survival circuits is advanced by the discovery that: (i) reversible inactivation of the medial cerebellar nucleus (MCN) during fear consolidation (a) reduces the temporal precision of vPAG offset, but not onset responses and (b) increases rearing behaviour during retrieval, and (ii) chemogenetic inhibition of the MCN-vPAG projection during fear acquisition (a) reduces the emission of fear-related ultrasonic vocalisations and (b) slows the extinction rate of fear-related freezing. These findings show that the cerebellum regulates fear memory processes at multiple timescales and in multiple ways. The current findings indicate that dysfunctional interactions in the cerebellar-survival network may underlie fear-related disorders and comorbidities.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Reduced somatostatin (SST) and SST-positive (SST+) neurons are hallmarks of neurological disorders and associated with mood disturbances, but their origin are unknown. Chronic psychosocial stress induces behavioral emotionality deficits and deregulates unfolded protein response (UPR) of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) preferentially in SST+ neurons. Here we confirm that chronic stress increases ER stress levels in SST+ neurons of mouse prefrontal cortex, and show that genetically suppressing ER stress in SST+ neurons, but not in pyramidal neurons, normalized psychosocial stress-induced behavioral emotionality. Forced expression of SST precursor protein (preproSST), mimicking psychosocial stress-induced early proteomic changes, induces ER stress, whereas mature SST or processing-incompetent preproSST does not. Biochemical analyses further show that psychosocial stress induces SST protein aggregation under elevated ER stress conditions. These results demonstrate that SST processing is a SST+ neuron-intrinsic vulnerability factor under conditions of sustained or over-activated UPR in the ER, hence negatively impacting SST+ neuron functions.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Autism is noted for both its genotypic and phenotypic diversity. Repetitive action, resistance to environmental change, and motor disruptions vary from individual to individual. In animal models, conventional behavioral phenotyping captures such fine-scale variations incompletely. Here we use advances in computer vision and deep learning to develop a framework for characterizing mouse behavior on multiple time scales using a single popular behavioral assay, the open field test. We observed male and female C57BL/6J mice to develop a dynamic baseline of adaptive behavior over multiple days. We then examined two rodent models of autism, a cerebellum-specific model, L7-Tsc1, and a whole-brain knockout model, Cntnap2. Both Cntnap2 knockout and L7-Tsc1 mutants showed forelimb lag during gait. L7-Tsc1 mutants showed complex defects in multi-day adaptation, lacking the tendency of wild-type mice to spend progressively more time in corners of the arena. In L7-Tsc1 mutant mice, failure-to-adapt took the form of maintained ambling, turning, and locomotion, and an overall decrease in grooming. Adaptation in Cntnap2 knockout mice more broadly resembled that of wild-type. L7-Tsc1 mutant and Cntnap2 knockout mouse models showed different patterns of behavioral state occupancy. Our automated pipeline for deep phenotyping successfully captures model-specific deviations in adaptation and movement as well as differences in the detailed structure of behavioral dynamics.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Spinocerebellar Ataxias (SCAs) are a group of genetic diseases characterized by progressive ataxia and neurodegeneration, often incerebellar Purkinje neurons. Mouse models of SCA Type 1 (SCA1) have been used to study molecular mechanisms underlying Purkinje neuron degeneration and death. One SCA1 mouse model, Pcp2-ATXN1[30Q]D776, has severe ataxia in absence of progressive Purkinje neuron degeneration and death. Previous RNA-seq analyses identified cerebellar up-regulation of the peptide hormone Cholecystokinin (Cck) in Pcp2-ATXN1[30Q]D776 mice. Importantly, absence of Cck1 receptor (Cck1R) in Pcp2-ATXN1[30Q]D776 mice confers a progressive disease with Purkinje neuron death. A Cck1R agonist, A71623 administered to Pcp2-ATXN1[30Q]D776;Cck-/- and Pcp2-AXTN1[82Q] mice dampened Purkinje neuron pathology and associated deficits in motor performance. In addition, A71623 administration improved motor performance of Pcp2-ATXN2[127Q] SCA2 mice.

	<content:encoded>Modulation of motor cortical activity in the beta frequency range is one of the strongest and most studied movement-related neural signals. At the single trial level, beta band activity is often characterized by transient bursting events rather than slowly modulating oscillations, suggesting a more rapid, information-encoding functional role than previously believed. Insight into how beta bursts are generated in sensorimotor circuits can provide important constraints to theories about their functional role for movement control. To this end, we leverage and extend recent developments in high precision MEG for temporally resolved laminar analysis of burst activity, combined with a neocortical circuit model that simulates the biophysical generators of the electrical currents which drive beta bursts. This approach pinpoints the generation of beta bursts in human motor cortex to distinct excitatory synaptic inputs to deep and superficial cortical layers, which drive current flow in opposite directions. These laminar dynamics of beta bursts in motor cortex align with prior invasive animal recordings within the somatosensory cortex, and suggest a conserved mechanism for somatosensory and motor cortical beta bursts. More generally, we demonstrate the ability for uncovering the laminar dynamics of event-related neural signals in human non-invasive recordings.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is best known for its involvement in peripheral glucocorticoid release across vertebrate species. However, CRF is also produced and released throughout various brain regions to regulate central aspects of the stress response. While these various CRF populations have been described extensively in mammals, less is known about their distributions in other amniotes, and only a handful of studies have ever examined CRF distributions in reptiles. Out study is the first to map CRF cell and fiber distributions in the brain of a lizard, the brown anole (Anolis sagrei). Our results indicate that brown anole CRF distributions are highly similar to those in snakes and turtles. However, unlike in these other reptile species, we find immunofluorescent CRF neurons in a few additional brown anole locations, most notably the supraoptic nucleus. The CRF distribution in the present study is also similar to published CRF descriptions in mammals and birds, although our findings, as well as the other published reports in reptiles, collectively suggest that reptiles possess a slightly more restricted distribution of CRF cell populations than do mammals and birds.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.431257v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Syntaxin-1 (STX1) and Munc18-1 are two requisite components of synaptic vesicular release machinery, so much so synaptic transmission cannot proceed in their absence. They form a tight binary complex through two major binding modes: one through STX1's N-peptide, the other through STX1's closed conformation driven by its Habc- domain. However, physiological roles of these two reportedly different binding modes in synapses are still controversial. Here we characterized the roles of STX1's N-peptide, Habc-domain, and open conformation with and without N-peptide deletion using our STX1-null mouse model system and exogenous reintroduction of STX1A mutants. We show, on the contrary to the general view, that the Habc-domain is absolutely required and N-peptide is dispensable for synaptic transmission. However, STX1's N-peptide plays a regulatory role, particularly in the Ca2+-sensitivity and the short-term plasticity of vesicular release, whereas STX1's open conformation governs the vesicle fusogenicity. Strikingly, we also show that neurotransmitter release still proceeds when both the interaction modes between STX1 and Munc18-1 are presumably intervened together, necessitating a refinement of the conceptualization of STX1-Munc18-1 interaction.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: NECAB2 orchestrates an endosomal pathway of mitochondrial quality control at striatal synapses</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.431234v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Synaptic signaling depends on ATP generated by mitochondria. Due to extensive connectivity, the striatum is especially vulnerable to mitochondrial dysfunction and thus requires efficient mitochondrial quality control. We found that the neuronal calcium-binding protein NECAB2 ensures synaptic function in the striatum by increasing mitochondrial efficiency. NECAB2 associates with early endosomes and mitochondria at striatal synapses. Loss of NECAB2 dysregulates proteins of the endosomal ESCRT machinery and oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondria from NECAB2-deficient mice are more abundant but less efficient. These mitochondria exhibit increased respiration and superoxide production but produce less ATP. This accumulation of faulty mitochondria is caused by a defective assembly of mitochondria with early endosomes in response to oxidative stress. Impairment of this mechanism causes loss of striatal synapses and behavioral dysfunctions such as reduced motivation and altered sensory gating. NECAB2 therefore orchestrates an endosomal pathway of mitochondrial quality control important for striatal function.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: On the importance of evolving phenotype distributions on evolutionary diversification</title>

Evolutionary branching occurs when a population with a unimodal phenotype distribution diversifies into a multimodally distributed population consisting of two or more strains. Branching results from frequency-dependent selection, which is caused by interactions between individuals. For example, a population performing a social task may diversify into a cooperator strain and a defector strain. Branching can also occur in multi-dimensional phenotype spaces, such as when two tasks are performed simultaneously. In such cases, the strains may diverge in different directions: possible outcomes include division of labor (with each population performing one of the tasks) or the diversification into a strain that performs both tasks and another that performs neither. Here we show that the shape of the population’s phenotypic distribution plays a role in determining the direction of branching. Furthermore, we show that the shape of the distribution is, in turn, contingent on the direction of approach to the evolutionary branching point. This results in a distribution–selection feedback that is not captured in analytical models of evolutionary branching, which assume monomorphic populations. Finally, we show that this feedback can influence long-term evolutionary dynamics and promote the evolution of division of labor.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vePGOwAaJPk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Spectral similarity is used as a proxy for structural similarity in many tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) based metabolomics analyses such as library matching and molecular networking. Although weaknesses in the relationship between spectral similarity scores and the true structural similarities have been described, little development of alternative scores has been undertaken. Here, we introduce Spec2Vec, a novel spectral similarity score inspired by a natural language processing algorithm—Word2Vec. Spec2Vec learns fragmental relationships within a large set of spectral data to derive abstract spectral embeddings that can be used to assess spectral similarities. Using data derived from GNPS MS/MS libraries including spectra for nearly 13,000 unique molecules, we show how Spec2Vec scores correlate better with structural similarity than cosine-based scores. We demonstrate the advantages of Spec2Vec in library matching and molecular networking. Spec2Vec is computationally more scalable allowing structural analogue searches in large databases within seconds.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_ocscd6oNk0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Contemporary accounts of the initiation of cardiac arrhythmias typically rely on after-depolarizations as the trigger for reentrant activity. The after-depolarizations are usually triggered by calcium entry or spontaneous release within the cells of the myocardium or the conduction system. Here we propose an alternative mechanism whereby arrhythmias are triggered autonomously by cardiac cells that fail to repolarize after a normal heartbeat. We investigated the proposal by representing the heart as an excitable medium of FitzHugh-Nagumo cells where a proportion of cells were capable of remaining depolarized indefinitely. As such, those cells exhibit bistable membrane dynamics. We found that heterogeneous media can tolerate a surprisingly large number of bistable cells and still support normal rhythmic activity. Yet there is a critical limit beyond which the medium is persistently arrhythmogenic. Numerical analysis revealed that the critical threshold for arrhythmogenesis depends on both the strength of the coupling between cells and the extent to which the abnormal cells resist repolarization. Moreover, arrhythmogenesis was found to emerge preferentially at tissue boundaries where cells naturally have fewer neighbors to influence their behavior. These findings may explain why atrial fibrillation typically originates from tissue boundaries such as the cuff of the pulmonary vein.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GZThKKbT5Ss&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Estimating the extrinsic incubation period of malaria using a mechanistic model of sporogony</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/P_9bHRHfPkU/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Isaac J. Stopard, Thomas S. Churcher, Ben Lambert&lt;/p&gt;

During sporogony, malaria-causing parasites infect a mosquito, reproduce and migrate to the mosquito salivary glands where they can be transmitted the next time blood feeding occurs. The time required for sporogony, known as the extrinsic incubation period (EIP), is an important determinant of malaria transmission intensity. The EIP is typically estimated as the time for a given percentile, &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;, of infected mosquitoes to develop salivary gland sporozoites (the infectious parasite life stage), which is denoted by EIP&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;. Many mechanisms, however, affect the observed sporozoite prevalence including the human-to-mosquito transmission probability and possibly differences in mosquito mortality according to infection status. To account for these various mechanisms, we present a mechanistic mathematical model, which explicitly models key processes at the parasite, mosquito and observational scales. Fitting this model to experimental data, we find greater variation in the EIP than previously thought: we estimated the range between EIP&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; and EIP&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt; (at 27°C) as 4.5 days compared to 0.9 days using existing statistical methods. This pattern holds over the range of study temperatures included in the dataset. Increasing temperature from 21°C to 34°C decreased the EIP&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; from 16.1 to 8.8 days. Our work highlights the importance of mechanistic modelling of sporogony to (1) improve estimates of malaria transmission under different environmental conditions or disease control programs and (2) evaluate novel interventions that target the mosquito life stages of the parasite.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/P_9bHRHfPkU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: A model of developmental canalization, applied to human cranial form</title>

Developmental mechanisms that canalize or compensate perturbations of organismal development (targeted or compensatory growth) are widely considered a prerequisite of individual health and the evolution of complex life, but little is known about the nature of these mechanisms. It is even unclear if and how a “target trajectory” of individual development is encoded in the organism’s genetic-developmental system or, instead, emerges as an epiphenomenon. Here we develop a statistical model of developmental canalization based on an extended autoregressive model. We show that under certain assumptions the strength of canalization and the amount of canalized variance in a population can be estimated, or at least approximated, from longitudinal phenotypic measurements, even if the target trajectories are unobserved. We extend this model to multivariate measures and discuss reifications of the ensuing parameter matrix. We apply these approaches to longitudinal geometric morphometric data on human postnatal craniofacial size and shape as well as to the size of the frontal sinuses. Craniofacial size showed strong developmental canalization during the first 5 years of life, leading to a 50% reduction of cross-sectional size variance, followed by a continual increase in variance during puberty. Frontal sinus size, by contrast, did not show any signs of canalization. Total variance of craniofacial shape decreased slightly until about 5 years of age and increased thereafter. However, different features of craniofacial shape showed very different developmental dynamics. Whereas the relative dimensions of the nasopharynx showed strong canalization and a reduction of variance throughout postnatal development, facial orientation continually increased in variance. Some of the signals of canalization may owe to independent variation in developmental timing of cranial components, but our results indicate evolved, partly mechanically induced mechanisms of canalization that ensure properly sized upper airways and facial dimensions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4y09YcAbHEY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Short QT (SQT) syndrome is a genetic cardiac disorder characterized by an abbreviated QT interval of the patient’s electrocardiogram. The syndrome is associated with increased risk of arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death and can arise from a number of ion channel mutations. Cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells generated from SQT patients (SQT hiPSC-CMs) provide promising platforms for testing pharmacological treatments directly in human cardiac cells exhibiting mutations specific for the syndrome. However, a difficulty is posed by the relative immaturity of hiPSC-CMs, with the possibility that drug effects observed in SQT hiPSC-CMs could be very different from the corresponding drug effect &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. In this paper, we apply a multistep computational procedure for translating measured drug effects from these cells to human QT response. This process first detects drug effects on individual ion channels based on measurements of SQT hiPSC-CMs and then uses these results to estimate the drug effects on ventricular action potentials and QT intervals of adult SQT patients. We find that the procedure is able to identify IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values in line with measured values for the four drugs quinidine, ivabradine, ajmaline and mexiletine. In addition, the predicted effect of quinidine on the adult QT interval is in good agreement with measured effects of quinidine for adult patients. Consequently, the computational procedure appears to be a useful tool for helping predicting adult drug responses from pure &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; measurements of patient derived cell lines.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sl_Dbunfe48&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Sweating is a basic skin function in body temperature control. In sweat glands, salt excretion and reabsorption are regulated to avoid electrolyte imbalance. To date, the mechanism underlying such regulation is not fully understood. Corin is a transmembrane protease that activates atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), a cardiac hormone essential for normal blood volume and pressure. Here, we report an unexpected role of corin in sweat glands to promote sweat and salt excretion in regulating electrolyte homeostasis. In human and mouse eccrine sweat glands, corin and ANP are expressed in the luminal epithelial cells. In corin-deficient mice on normal- and high-salt diets, sweat and salt excretion is reduced. This phenotype is associated with enhanced epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) activity that mediates Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and water reabsorption. Treatment of amiloride, an ENaC inhibitor, normalizes sweat and salt excretion in corin-deficient mice. Moreover, treatment of aldosterone decreases sweat and salt excretion in wild-type (WT), but not corin-deficient, mice. These results reveal an important regulatory function of corin in eccrine sweat glands to promote sweat and salt excretion.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/sT336htC_cM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Convergence of peptidergic and non‐peptidergic protein markers in the human dorsal root ganglion and spinal dorsal horn</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25122?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Calcitonin gene‐related peptide (CGRP) and the purinergic receptor P2X3 (P2X3R) label relatively distinct populations of nociceptors in the rodent dorsal root ganglion (DRG). These two unique populations, known as the peptidergic and non‐peptidergic nociceptors, innervate different lamina of the rodent spinal dorsal horn. However, contrary to previous reports in rodent, we find that CGRP and P2X3R are highly co‐expressed in the human DRG and terminate in the same laminae (laminae 1–2) of the spinal dorsal horn. Additionally, we find that other markers such as TrpV1 and Nav1.7 are more widely expressed in human and innervate laminae 1–2 of the spinal dorsal horn. Our findings are consistent with the known polymodal nature of most primate nociceptors and indicate that sensory neurons and their central projections are different between mice and humans.







Abstract
Peripheral sensory neurons are characterized by their size, molecular profiles, and physiological responses to specific stimuli. In mouse, the peptidergic and non‐peptidergic subsets of nociceptors are distinct and innervate different lamina of the spinal dorsal horn. The unique molecular signature and neuroanatomical organization of these neurons supports a labeled line theory for certain types of nociceptive stimuli. However, long‐standing evidence supports the polymodal nature of nociceptors in many species. We have recently shown that the peptidergic marker, CGRP, and the non‐peptidergic marker, P2X3R, show largely overlapping expression at the mRNA level in human dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Herein, our aim was to assess the protein distribution of nociceptor markers, including their central projections, in the human DRG and spinal cord. Using DRGs obtained from organ donors, we observed that CGRP and P2X3R were co‐expressed by approximately 33% of human DRG neurons and TrpV1 was expressed in ~60% of human DRG neurons. In the dorsal spinal cord, CGRP, P2X3R, TrpV1, and Nav1.7 proteins stained the entirety of lamina 1–2, with only P2XR3 showing a gradient of expression. This was confirmed by measuring the size of the substantia gelatinosa using Hematoxylin and Eosin staining of adjacent sections. Our findings are consistent with the known polymodal nature of most primate nociceptors and indicate that the central projection patterns of nociceptors are different between mice and humans. Elucidating how human nociceptors connect to subsets of dorsal horn neurons will be important for understanding the physiological consequences of these species differences.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07277</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Insider threats are the cyber attacks from within the trusted entities of an
organization. Lack of real-world data and issue of data imbalance leave insider
threat analysis an understudied research area. To mitigate the effect of skewed
class distribution and prove the potential of multinomial classification
algorithms for insider threat detection, we propose an approach that combines
generative model with supervised learning to perform multi-class classification
using deep learning. The generative adversarial network (GAN) based insider
detection model introduces Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) to
enrich minority class samples to provide data for multi-class anomaly
detection. The comprehensive experiments performed on the benchmark dataset
demonstrates the effectiveness of introducing GAN derived synthetic data and
the capability of multi-class anomaly detection in insider activity analysis.
Moreover, the method is compared with other existing methods against different
parameters and performance metrics.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07227</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Descent methods for deep networks are notoriously capricious: they require
careful tuning of step size, momentum and weight decay, and which method will
work best on a new benchmark is a priori unclear. To address this problem, this
paper conducts a combined study of neural architecture and optimisation,
leading to a new optimiser called Nero: the neuronal rotator. Nero trains
reliably without momentum or weight decay, works in situations where Adam and
SGD fail, and requires little to no learning rate tuning. Also, Nero's memory
footprint is ~ square root that of Adam or LAMB. Nero combines two ideas: (1)
projected gradient descent over the space of balanced networks; (2)
neuron-specific updates, where the step size sets the angle through which each
neuron's hyperplane turns. The paper concludes by discussing how this geometric
connection between architecture and optimisation may impact theories of
generalisation in deep learning.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07036</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We here study a network of synaptic relations mingling excitatory and
inhibitory neuron nodes that displays oscillations quite similar to
electroencephalogram (EEG) brain waves, and identify abrupt variations brought
about by swift synaptic mediations. We thus conclude that corresponding changes
in EEG series surely come from the slowdown of the activity in neuron
populations due to synaptic restrictions. The latter happens to generate an
imbalance between excitation and inhibition causing a quick explosive increase
of excitatory activity, which turns out to be a (first-order) transition among
dynamic mental phases. Besides, near this phase transition, our model system
exhibits waves with a strong component in the so-called \textit{delta-theta
domain} that coexist with fast oscillations. These findings provide a simple
explanation for the observed \textit{delta-gamma} and \textit{theta-gamma
modulation} in actual brains, and open a serious and versatile path to
understand deeply large amounts of apparently erratic, easily accessible brain
data.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06942</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Convolutional networks are successful, but they have recently been
outperformed by new neural networks that are equivariant under rotations and
translations. These new networks work better because they do not struggle with
learning each possible orientation of each image feature separately. So far,
they have been proposed for 2D and 3D data. Here we generalize them to 6D
diffusion MRI data, ensuring joint equivariance under 3D roto-translations in
image space and the matching 3D rotations in $q$-space, as dictated by the
image formation. Such equivariant deep learning is appropriate for diffusion
MRI, because microstructural and macrostructural features such as neural fibers
can appear at many different orientations, and because even
non-rotation-equivariant deep learning has so far been the best method for many
diffusion MRI tasks. We validate our equivariant method on multiple-sclerosis
lesion segmentation. Our proposed neural networks yield better results and
require fewer scans for training compared to non-rotation-equivariant deep
learning. They also inherit all the advantages of deep learning over classical
diffusion MRI methods. Our implementation is available at
https://github.com/philip-mueller/equivariant-deep-dmri and can be used off the
shelf without understanding the mathematical background.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06940</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Comprehensive benchmarking of clustering algorithms is rendered difficult by
two key factors: (i)~the elusiveness of a unique mathematical definition of
this unsupervised learning approach and (ii)~dependencies between the
generating models or clustering criteria adopted by some clustering algorithms
and indices for internal cluster validation. Consequently, there is no
consensus regarding the best practice for rigorous benchmarking, and whether
this is possible at all outside the context of a given application. Here, we
argue that synthetic datasets must continue to play an important role in the
evaluation of clustering algorithms, but that this necessitates constructing
benchmarks that appropriately cover the diverse set of properties that impact
clustering algorithm performance. Through our framework, HAWKS, we demonstrate
the important role evolutionary algorithms play to support flexible generation
of such benchmarks, allowing simple modification and extension. We illustrate
two possible uses of our framework: (i)~the evolution of benchmark data
consistent with a set of hand-derived properties and (ii)~the generation of
datasets that tease out performance differences between a given pair of
algorithms. Our work has implications for the design of clustering benchmarks
that sufficiently challenge a broad range of algorithms, and for furthering
insight into the strengths and weaknesses of specific approaches.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06929</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In large infrastructures such as dams, which have a relatively high economic
value, ensuring the proper operation of the associated hydraulic facilities in
different operating conditions is of utmost importance. To ensure the correct
and successful operation of the dam's hydraulic equipment and prevent possible
damages, including gates and downstream tunnel, to build laboratory models and
perform some tests are essential (the advancement of the smart sensors based on
artificial intelligence is essential). One of the causes of damage to dam
bottom outlets is cavitation in downstream and between the gates, which can
impact on dam facilities, and air aeration can be a solution to improve it. In
the present study, six dams in different provinces in Iran has been chosen to
evaluate the air entrainment in the downstream tunnel experimentally. Three
artificial neural networks (ANN) based machine learning (ML) algorithms are
used to model and predict the air aeration in the bottom outlet. The proposed
models are trained with genetic algorithms (GA), particle swarm optimization
(PSO), i.e., ANN-GA, ANN-PSO, and ANFIS-PSO. Two hydrodynamic variables, namely
volume rate and opening percentage of the gate, are used as inputs into all
bottom outlet models. The results showed that the most optimal model is
ANFIS-PSO to predict the dependent value compared with ANN-GA and ANN-PSO. The
importance of the volume rate and opening percentage of the dams' gate
parameters is more effective for suitable air aeration.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we propose self-reorganizing and rejuvenating convolutional
neural networks; a biologically inspired method for improving the computational
resource utilization of neural networks. The proposed method utilizes the
channel activations of a convolution layer in order to reorganize that layers
parameters. The reorganized parameters are clustered to avoid parameter
redundancies. As such, redundant neurons with similar activations are merged
leaving room for the remaining parameters to rejuvenate. The rejuvenated
parameters learn different features to supplement those learned by the
reorganized surviving parameters. As a result, the network capacity utilization
increases improving the baseline network performance without any changes to the
network structure. The proposed method can be applied to various network
architectures during the training stage, or applied to a pre-trained model
improving its performance. Experimental results showed that the proposed method
is model-agnostic and can be applied to any backbone architecture increasing
its performance due to the elevated utilization of the network capacity.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06847</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For decades, a variety of predictive approaches have been proposed and
evaluated in terms of their predicting capability for Alzheimer's Disease (AD)
and its precursor - mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Most of them focused on
prediction or identification of statistical differences among different
clinical groups or phases (e.g., longitudinal studies). The continuous nature
of AD development and transition states between successive AD related stages
have been overlooked, especially in binary or multi-class classification.
Though a few progression models of AD have been studied recently, they mainly
designed to determine and compare the order of specific biomarkers. How to
effectively predict the individual patient's status within a wide spectrum of
AD progression has been understudied. In this work, we developed a novel
structure learning method to computationally model the continuum of AD
progression as a tree structure. By conducting a novel prototype learning with
a deep manner, we are able to capture intrinsic relations among different
clinical groups as prototypes and represent them in a continuous process for AD
development. We named this method as Deep Prototype Learning and the learned
tree structure as Deep Prototype Tree - DPTree. DPTree represents different
clinical stages as a trajectory reflecting AD progression and predict clinical
status by projecting individuals onto this continuous trajectory. Through this
way, DPTree can not only perform efficient prediction for patients at any
stages of AD development (77.8% accuracy for five groups), but also provide
more information by examining the projecting locations within the entire AD
progression process.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12750</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we introduce a Model-based Algorithm Turning Engine, namely
MATE, where the parameters of an algorithm are represented as expressions of
the features of a target optimisation problem. In contrast to most static
(feature-independent) algorithm tuning engines such as irace and SPOT, our
approach aims to derive the best parameter configuration of a given algorithm
for a specific problem, exploiting the relationships between the algorithm
parameters and the features of the problem. We formulate the problem of finding
the relationships between the parameters and the problem features as a symbolic
regression problem and we use genetic programming to extract these expressions.
For the evaluation, we apply our approach to configuration of the (1+1) EA and
RLS algorithms for the OneMax, LeadingOnes, BinValue and Jump optimisation
problems, where the theoretically optimal algorithm parameters to the problems
are available as functions of the features of the problems. Our study shows
that the found relationships typically comply with known theoretical results,
thus demonstrating a new opportunity to consider model-based parameter tuning
as an effective alternative to the static algorithm tuning engines.

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Patients with intracranial hemorrhages (ICH) after mechanical thrombectomy (MT) may have a higher risk of early recurrent embolism (ERE) because of delayed initiation of anticoagulants. We assessed the rate of ischemic events in the early period after MT and the association with post-MT ICH.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Patients who underwent MT in our institute were retrospectively reviewed. ERE was defined as recurrent ischemic stroke and systemic embolism within 14 days after MT. The association between ERE and parenchymal hematoma (PH) was assessed. Multivariable regression analysis and inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics between patients with and without PH.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A total of 307 patients (median age, 78 years; female, 47%; median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, 19) were included. ERE was observed in 12 of 307 patients (8 strokes, 4 systemic embolisms; 3.9%). Median time from MT to ERE was 6.5 days (IQR, 3–8 days). PH occurred in 21 patients (6.8%). Median time from MT to initiating oral anticoagulants was longer in patients with PH (8 days) than in those without (3 days) (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). In both unweighted and weighted multivariable analysis, PH was significantly associated with an increased risk of ERE (unweighted odds ratio, 10.60; 95% CI, 2.66–42.23; weighted odds ratio, 12.34; 95% CI, 2.49–61.07).&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ERE occurred in about 4% of patients after MT. PH after MT was associated with delayed initiation of oral anticoagulants and an increased risk of recurrent ischemic events.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Hands play a fundamental role in everyday behaviour. Nevertheless, healthy adults show striking misrepresentations of their hands which have been documented by a wide range of studies addressing various aspects of body representation. For example, when asked to indicate the location within the hand of the knuckles, people place them substantially farther forward than they actually are. Previous research, however, has focused exclusively on the knuckles at the base of each finger, not considering the other knuckles in the fingers. This study, therefore, aimed to investigate conceptual knowledge of the structure of the whole hand, by investigating judgements of the location of all 14 knuckle joints in the hand. Participants localised each of the 14 knuckles of their own hand (Experiment 1) or of the experimenter’s hand (Experiment 2) on a hand silhouette. We measured whether there are systematic localisation biases. The results showed highly similar pattern of mislocalisation for the knuckles of one’s own hand and those of another person’s hand, suggesting that people share an abstract conceptual knowledge about the hand structure. In line with previous reports, we showed that the metacarpophalangeal joints at the base of the fingers are judged as substantially father forward in the hand than they actually are. Moreover, for the first time we showed a gradient of this bias, with progressive reduction of distal bias from more proximal to more distal joints. In sum, people think their finger segments are roughly the same, and that their fingers are shorter than they are.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Widespread Decoding of Tactile Input Patterns Among Thalamic Neurons</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.640085</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Whereas, there is data to support that cuneothalamic projections predominantly reach a topographically confined volume of the rat thalamus, the ventroposterior lateral (VPL) nucleus, recent findings show that cortical neurons that process tactile inputs are widely distributed across the neocortex. Since cortical neurons project back to the thalamus, the latter observation would suggest that thalamic neurons could contain information about tactile inputs, in principle regardless of where in the thalamus they are located. Here we use a previously introduced electrotactile interface for producing sets of highly reproducible tactile afferent spatiotemporal activation patterns from the tip of digit 2 and record neurons throughout widespread parts of the thalamus of the anesthetized rat. We find that a majority of thalamic neurons, regardless of location, respond to single pulse tactile inputs and generate spike responses to such tactile stimulation patterns that can be used to identify which of the inputs that was provided, at above-chance decoding performance levels. Thalamic neurons with short response latency times, compatible with a direct tactile afferent input via the cuneate nucleus, were typically among the best decoders. Thalamic neurons with longer response latency times as a rule were also found to be able to decode the digit 2 inputs, though typically at a lower decoding performance than the thalamic neurons with presumed direct cuneate inputs. These findings provide support for that tactile information arising from any specific skin area is widely available in the thalamocortical circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Beta2 Oscillations in Hippocampal-Cortical Circuits During Novelty Detection</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.617388</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Novelty detection is a core feature of behavioral adaptation and involves cascades of neuronal responses—from initial evaluation of the stimulus to the encoding of new representations—resulting in the behavioral ability to respond to unexpected inputs. In the past decade, a new important novelty detection feature, beta2 (~20–30 Hz) oscillations, has been described in the hippocampus (HC). However, the interactions between beta2 and the hippocampal network are unknown, as well as the role—or even the presence—of beta2 in other areas involved with novelty detection. In this work, we combined multisite local field potential (LFP) recordings with novelty-related behavioral tasks in mice to describe the oscillatory dynamics associated with novelty detection in the CA1 region of the HC, parietal cortex, and mid-prefrontal cortex. We found that transient beta2 power increases were observed only during interaction with novel contexts and objects, but not with familiar contexts and objects. Also, robust theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling was observed during the exploration of novel environments. Surprisingly, bursts of beta2 power had strong coupling with the phase of delta-range oscillations. Finally, the parietal and mid-frontal cortices had strong coherence with the HC in both theta and beta2. These results highlight the importance of beta2 oscillations in a larger hippocampal-cortical circuit, suggesting that beta2 plays a role in the mechanism for detecting and modulating behavioral adaptation to novelty.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Alterations and Associations Between Magnetic Susceptibility of the Basal Ganglia and Diffusion Properties in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.616163</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This study adopted diffusion tensor imaging to detect alterations in the diffusion parameters of the white matter fiber in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and used quantitative susceptibility mapping to detect changes in magnetic susceptibility. However, whether the changes of susceptibility values due to excessive iron in the basal ganglia have correlations with the alterations of the diffusion properties of the white matter in patients with AD are still unknown. We aim to investigate the correlations among magnetic susceptibility values of the basal ganglia, diffusion indexes of the white matter, and cognitive function in patients with AD. Thirty patients with AD and nineteen healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. Diffusion indexes of the whole brain were detected using tract-based spatial statistics. The caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus were selected as regions of interest, and their magnetic susceptibility values were measured. Compared with HCs, patients with AD showed that there were significantly increased axial diffusivity (AxD) in the internal capsule, superior corona radiata (SCR), and right anterior corona radiata (ACR); increased radial diffusivity (RD) in the right anterior limb of the internal capsule, ACR, and genu of the corpus callosum (GCC); and decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the right ACR and GCC. The alterations of RD values, FA values, and susceptibility values of the right caudate nucleus in patients with AD were correlated with cognitive scores. Besides, AxD values in the right internal capsule, ACR, and SCR were positively correlated with the magnetic susceptibility values of the right caudate nucleus in patients with AD. Our findings revealed that the magnetic susceptibility of the caudate nucleus may be an MRI-based biomarker of the cognitive dysfunction of AD and abnormal excessive iron distribution in the basal ganglia had adverse effects on the diffusion properties of the white matter.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Early- and late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients often exhibit distinct features. We sought to compare overall white matter connectivity and evaluate the pathological factors (amyloid, tau, and vascular pathologies) that affect the disruption of connectivity in these two groups. A total of 50 early- and 38 late-onset AD patients, as well as age-matched cognitively normal participants, were enrolled and underwent diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging to construct fractional anisotropy-weighted white matter connectivity maps. [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]-THK5351 PET, [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]-Flutemetamol PET, and magnetic resonance imaging were used for the evaluation of tau and related astrogliosis, amyloid, and small vessel disease markers (lacunes and white matter hyperintensities). Cluster-based statistics was performed for connectivity comparisons and correlation analysis between connectivity disruption and the pathological markers. Both patient groups exhibited significantly disrupted connectivity compared to their control counterparts with distinct patterns. Only THK retention was related to connectivity disruption in early-onset AD patients, and this disruption showed correlations with most cognitive scores, while late-onset AD patients had disrupted connectivity correlated with amyloid deposition, white matter hyperintensities, and lacunes in which only a few cognitive scores showed associations. These findings suggest that the pathogenesis of connectivity disruption and its effects on cognition are distinct between EOAD and LOAD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Effects of Ocular Direct Current Stimulation on Full Field Electroretinogram</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.606557</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Studies on weak current stimulation (1–2 mA) examine effects on neuronal cells for the treatment of neurological diseases, like depression. Ocular current stimulation showed positive effects on retinal nerve cells which indicate that neurodegenerative ocular diseases, e.g., glaucoma, can be treated with current stimulation of the eye. However, up to now it remains unclear which exact retinal cells can be influenced. During an ocular direct current stimulation, a significant reduction of the characteristic P50 amplitude of a pattern-reversal electroretinogram (PERG) was found for an anodal and a cathodal stimulation. This current stimulation effect could originate from the modulation of pre-ganglion cell activity or by changes in local ON and OFF responses of ganglion cells. For clarification, we investigate acute direct current stimulation effects on a full field electroretinogram (ERG), which represents the activity of pre-ganglion cells (specifically cones and bipolar cells). The ERG from 15 subjects was evaluated before (ERG 1) and during (ERG 2) an ocular direct current stimulation with 800 μA over 5 min. The current was applied through a ring rubber electrode placed around the eye and a 25 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; rubber electrode placed at the ipsilateral temple. For ERG measurements, sintered Ag/AgCl skin-electrodes were positioned on the lower eyelid (active), the earlobe (reference), and the forehead (ground). The volunteers were stimulated in three independent sessions, each with a different current application (randomized order): cathodal polarity, anodal polarity (referred to the electrode around the eye), or sham stimulation. The changes between the two ERG measurements of the characteristic full field ERG amplitudes, a-wave, b-wave, and b′-wave (b-wave measured from zero line) were tested with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (α = 0.05). Comparing before to during the current stimulation for all applications, the ERG waves showed no effects on amplitudes or latencies. Furthermore, no significant difference between the cathodal, anodal, and sham stimulation could be found by a Friedman test. These results indicate an unlikely contribution of pre-ganglion cells to the previously reported stimulation effect on PERG signals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.560050</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We present a framework for the topological and semantic assembly of multiscale physiology route maps. The framework, called ApiNATOMY, consists of a knowledge representation (KR) model and a set of knowledge management (KM) tools. Using examples of ApiNATOMY route maps, we present a KR format that is suitable for the analysis and visualization by KM tools. The conceptual KR model provides a simple method for physiology experts to capture process interactions among anatomical entities. In this paper, we outline the KR model, modeling format, and the KM procedures to translate concise abstraction-based specifications into fully instantiated models of physiology processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Altered Frequency-Dependent Brain Activation and White Matter Integrity Associated With Cognition in Characterizing Preclinical Alzheimer’s Disease Stages</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.625232</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment (naMCI), and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) are regarded to be at high risk of converting to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) can reflect functional deterioration while diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is capable of detecting white matter integrity. Our study aimed to investigate the structural and functional alterations to further reveal convergence and divergence among SCD, naMCI, and aMCI and how these contribute to cognitive deterioration.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We analyzed ALFF under slow-4 (0.027–0.073 Hz) and slow-5 (0.01–0.027 Hz) bands and white matter fiber integrity among normal controls (CN), SCD, naMCI, and aMCI groups. Correlation analyses were further utilized among paired DTI alteration, ALFF deterioration, and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;For ALFF calculation, ascended ALFF values were detected in the lingual gyrus (LING) and superior frontal gyrus (SFG) within SCD and naMCI patients, respectively. Descended ALFF values were presented mainly in the LING, SFG, middle frontal gyrus, and precuneus in aMCI patients compared to CN, SCD, and naMCI groups. For DTI analyses, white matter alterations were detected within the uncinate fasciculus (UF) in aMCI patients and within the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) in naMCI patients. SCD patients presented alterations in both fasciculi. Correlation analyses revealed that the majority of these structural and functional alterations were associated with complicated cognitive decline. Besides, UF alterations were correlated with ALFF deterioration in the SFG within aMCI patients.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusions&lt;p&gt;SCD shares structurally and functionally deteriorative characteristics with aMCI and naMCI, and tends to convert to either of them. Furthermore, abnormalities in white matter fibers may be the structural basis of abnormal brain activation in preclinical AD stages. Combined together, it suggests that structural and functional integration may characterize the preclinical AD progression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Preserving Right Pre-motor and Posterior Prefrontal Cortices Contribute to Maintaining Overall Basic Emotion</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.612890</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Basic emotions such as happiness, sadness, and anger are universal, regardless of the human species, and are governed by specific brain regions. A recent report revealed that mentalizing, which is the ability to estimate other individuals’ emotional states via facial expressions, can be preserved with the help of awake surgery. However, it is still questionable whether we can maintain the ability to understand others’ emotions by preserving the positive mapping sites of intraoperative assessment. Here, we demonstrated the cortical regions related to basic emotions via awake surgery for patients with frontal glioma and investigated the usefulness of functional mapping in preserving basic emotion. Of the 56 consecutive patients with right cerebral hemispheric glioma who underwent awake surgery at our hospital, intraoperative assessment of basic emotion could be successfully performed in 22 patients with frontal glioma and were included in our study. During surgery, positive responses were found in 18 points in 12 patients (54.5%). Of these, 15 points from 11 patients were found at the cortical level, mainly the premotor and posterior part of the prefrontal cortices. Then, we focused on cortical 15 positive mappings with 40 stimulations and investigated the types of emotions that showed errors by every stimulation. There was no specific rule for the region-emotional type, which was beyond our expectations. In the postoperative acute phase, the test score of basic emotion declined in nine patients, and of these, it decreased under the cut-off value (Z-score ≤ −1.65) in three patients. Although the total score declined significantly just after surgery (p = 0.022), it recovered within 3 months postoperatively. Our study revealed that through direct electrical stimulation (DES), the premotor and posterior parts of the prefrontal cortices are related to various kinds of basic emotion, but not a single one. When the region with a positive mapping site is preserved during operation, basic emotion function might be maintained although it declines transiently after surgery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Brain Inspired Sequences Production by Spiking Neural Networks With Reward-Modulated STDP</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.612041</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding and producing embedded sequences according to supra-regular grammars in language has always been considered a high-level cognitive function of human beings, named “syntax barrier” between humans and animals. However, some neurologists recently showed that macaques could be trained to produce embedded sequences involving supra-regular grammars through a well-designed experiment paradigm. Via comparing macaques and preschool children's experimental results, they claimed that human uniqueness might only lie in the speed and learning strategy resulting from the chunking mechanism. Inspired by their research, we proposed a Brain-inspired Sequence Production Spiking Neural Network (SP-SNN) to model the same production process, followed by memory and learning mechanisms of the multi-brain region cooperation. After experimental verification, we demonstrated that SP-SNN could also handle embedded sequence production tasks, striding over the “syntax barrier.” SP-SNN used Population-Coding and STDP mechanism to realize working memory, Reward-Modulated STDP mechanism for acquiring supra-regular grammars. Therefore, SP-SNN needs to simultaneously coordinate short-term plasticity (STP) and long-term plasticity (LTP) mechanisms. Besides, we found that the chunking mechanism indeed makes a difference in improving our model's robustness. As far as we know, our work is the first one toward the “syntax barrier” in the SNN field, providing the computational foundation for further study of related underlying animals' neural mechanisms in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Given the rapid development of light weight EEG devices which we have witnessed the past decade, it is reasonable to ask to which extent neuroscience could now be taken outside the lab. In this study, we have designed an EEG paradigm well suited for deployment “in the wild.” The paradigm is tested in repeated recordings on 20 subjects, on eight different occasions (4 in the laboratory, 4 in the subject's own home). By calculating the inter subject, intra subject and inter location variance, we find that the inter location variation for this paradigm is considerably less than the inter subject variation. We believe the paradigm is representative of a large group of other relevant paradigms. This means that given the positive results in this study, we find that if a research paradigm would benefit from being performed in less controlled environments, we expect limited problems in doing so.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Relatively little attention has been paid to contributions from the dorsal striatum (DS) to aversive learning, despite its well-established role in stimulus-response learning. Here, we review studies exploring the role of DS in aversive learning, including different roles for the dorsomedial and dorsolateral striatum in Pavlovian fear conditioning as well as innate and inhibitory avoidance (IA) behaviors. We outline how future investigation might determine specific contributions from DS subregions, cell types, and connections that contribute to aversive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Neuroprotective Effects of Exercise Postconditioning After Stroke via SIRT1-Mediated Suppression of Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) Stress</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.598230</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While it is well-known that pre-stroke exercise conditioning reduces the incidence of stroke and the development of comorbidities, it is unclear whether post-stroke exercise conditioning is also neuroprotective. The present study investigated whether exercise postconditioning (PostE) induced neuroprotection and elucidated the involvement of SIRT1 regulation on the ROS/ER stress pathway. Adult rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by either: (1) resting; (2) mild exercise postconditioning (MPostE); or (3) intense exercise postconditioning (IPostE). PostE was initiated 24 h after reperfusion and performed on a treadmill. At 1 and 3 days thereafter, we determined infarct volumes, neurological defects, brain edema, apoptotic cell death through measuring pro- (BAX and Caspase-3) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) proteins, and ER stress through the measurement of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), inositol-requiring 1α (IRE1α), protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), Caspase-12, and SIRT1. Proteins were measured by Western blot. ROS production was detected by flow cytometry.Compared to resting rats, both MPostE and IPostE significantly decreased brain infarct volumes and edema, neurological deficits, ROS production, and apoptotic cell death. MPostE further increased Bcl-2 expression and Bcl-2/BAX ratio as well as BAX and Caspase-3 expressions and ROS production (*p &amp;lt; 0.05). Both PostE groups saw decreases in ER stress proteins, while MPostE demonstrated a further reduction in GRP78 (***p &amp;lt; 0.001) and Caspase-12 (*p &amp;lt; 0.05) expressions at 1 day and IRE1α (**p &amp;lt; 0.01) and CHOP (*p &amp;lt; 0.05) expressions at 3 days. Additionally, both PostE groups saw significant increases in SIRT1 expression.In this study, both mild and intense PostE levels induced neuroprotection after stroke through SIRT1 and ROS/ER stress pathway. Additionally, the results may provide a base for our future study regarding the regulation of SIRT1 on the ROS/ER stress pathway in the biochemical processes underlying post-stroke neuroprotection. The results suggest that mild exercise postconditioning might play a similar neuroprotective role as intensive exercise and could be an effective exercise strategy as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Multiple Regionalized Genes and Their Putative Networks in the Interpeduncular Nucleus Suggest Complex Mechanisms of Neuron Development and Axon Guidance</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.643320</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) is a highly conserved limbic structure in the vertebrate brain, located in the isthmus and rhombomere 1. It is formed by various populations that migrate from different sites to the distinct domains within the IPN: the prodromal, rostral interpeduncular, and caudal interpeduncular nuclei. The aim here was to identify genes that are differentially expressed across these domains, characterizing their putative functional roles and interactions. To this end, we screened the 2,038 genes in the Allen Developing Mouse Brain Atlas database expressed at E18.5 and we identified 135 genes expressed within the IPN. The functional analysis of these genes highlighted an overrepresentation of gene families related to neuron development, cell morphogenesis and axon guidance. The interactome analysis within each IPN domain yielded specific networks that mainly involve members of the ephrin/Eph and Cadherin families, transcription factors and molecules related to synaptic neurotransmission. These results bring to light specific mechanisms that might participate in the formation, molecular regionalization, axon guidance and connectivity of the different IPN domains. This genoarchitectonic model of the IPN enables data on gene expression and interactions to be integrated and interpreted, providing a basis for the further study of the connectivity and function of this poorly understood nuclear complex under both normal and pathological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Accruing positron emission tomography (PET) studies have suggested that dopaminergic functioning and metabolic changes are correlated with cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Yet, the relationship between dopaminergic or cerebral metabolism and different cognitive domains in PD is poorly understood. To address this scarcity, we aimed to investigate the interactions among dopaminergic bindings, metabolic network changes, and the cognitive domains in PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We recruited 41 PD patients, including PD patients with no cognitive impairment (PD-NC; n = 21) and those with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI; n = 20). All patients underwent clinical evaluations and a schedule of neuropsychological tests and underwent both 11C-N-2-carbomethoxy-3-(4-fluorophenyl)-tropane (11C-CFT) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET imaging.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;11C-CFT imaging revealed a significant positive correlation between executive function and striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) binding at both the voxel and regional levels. Metabolic imaging revealed that executive function correlated with 18F-FDG uptake, mainly in inferior frontal gyrus, putamen, and insula. Further analysis indicated that striatal DAT binding correlated strictly with metabolic activity in the temporal gyrus, medial frontal gyrus, and cingulate gyrus.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our findings might promote the understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.589299</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;It has been suggested that physical inactivity and lack of stimulating cognitive activity are the two most significant modifiable risk factors to impair cognitive function. Although many studies that investigated the cognitive effects of physical exercise and cognitive stimuli in dual-task conditions showed improved cognitive performance, others have not confirmed these findings. The main aim of the present work is to analyze the effects of a dual-task multimodal physical exercise training, at moderate intensity, and cognitive stimulation on cognitive and physical function in healthy older adults.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;This clinical trial was registered on the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (RBR-9zrx3d). Here we tested the effects of a dual-task multimodal physical exercise training, at moderate intensity, on cognitive and physical function and quality of life in community dwelling older adults. The training protocol included 24 group sessions, 2/week, per 75 min. Cognition was assessed using CANTAB automated neuropsychological tests and Functional Capacity to Exercise tests. Performance was compared from baseline to post intervention and to a non-exercise control group using Mixed Linear Model for repeated measures.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Control (CG) and dual-task (DTEx) groups progressed differentially over time on performance of episodic memory, sustained visual attention, functional mobility, cardiorespiratory fitness, lower limbs strength resistance, agility, quality of life and dual-task performance with significant improved DTEx performance. Control group did not show any significant changes on these tests except for showing a reduction in dual-task performance.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;We suggest that the dual-task combination of multisensory cognitive stimulation and multimodal moderate physical exercise training, twice a week, may be adopted as an effective program to reduce progression of age-related cognitive decline and improve physical fitness and quality of life on healthy older adults.&lt;/p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration&lt;p&gt;Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials: https://ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/rg/RBR-9zrx3d -UTN code: U1111-1233-6349.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65389</link>
	<content:encoded>Chromosome segregation during cell division requires engagement of kinetochores of sister chromatids with microtubules emanating from opposite poles. As the corresponding microtubules shorten, these 'bioriented' sister kinetochores experience tension-dependent stabilization of microtubule attachments. The yeast XMAP215 family member and microtubule polymerase, Stu2, associates with kinetochores and contributes to tension-dependent stabilization in vitro. We show here that a C-terminal segment of Stu2 binds the four-way junction of the Ndc80 complex (Ndc80c) and that residues conserved both in yeast Stu2 orthologs and in their metazoan counterparts make specific contacts with Ndc80 and Spc24. Mutations that perturb this interaction prevent association of Stu2 with kinetochores, impair cell viability, produce biorientation defects, and delay cell cycle progression. Ectopic tethering of the mutant Stu2 species to the Ndc80c junction restores wild-type function in vivo. These findings show that the role of Stu2 in tension-sensing depends on its association with kinetochores by binding with Ndc80c.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64693</link>
	<content:encoded>While beige adipocytes have been found to associate with dense sympathetic neurites in mouse inguinal subcutaneous white fat (iWAT), little is known about when and how this patterning is established. Here, we applied whole-tissue imaging to examine the development of sympathetic innervation in iWAT. We found that parenchymal neurites actively grow between postnatal day 6 (P6) and P28, overlapping with early postnatal beige adipogenesis. Constitutive deletion of &lt;i&gt;Prdm16&lt;/i&gt; in adipocytes led to a significant reduction in early postnatal beige adipocytes and sympathetic density within this window. Using an inducible, adipocyte-specific &lt;i&gt;Prdm16&lt;/i&gt; knockout model, we found that &lt;i&gt;Prdm16&lt;/i&gt; is required for guiding sympathetic growth during early development. Deleting &lt;i&gt;Prdm16&lt;/i&gt; in adult animals, however, did not affect sympathetic structure in iWAT. Together, these findings highlight that beige adipocyte-sympathetic neurite communication is crucial to establish sympathetic structure during the early postnatal period but may be dispensable for its maintenance in mature animals.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The mitochondrial carrier family protein SLC25A3 transports both copper and phosphate in mammals yet in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; the transport of these substrates is partitioned across two paralogs: PIC2 and MIR1. To understand the ancestral state of copper and phosphate transport in mitochondria, we explored the evolutionary relationships of PIC2 and MIR1 orthologs across the eukaryotic tree of life. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that PIC2-like and MIR1-like orthologs are present in all major eukaryotic supergroups, indicating an ancient gene duplication created these paralogs. To link this phylogenetic signal to protein function, we used structural modelling and site-directed mutagenesis to identify residues involved in copper and phosphate transport. Based on these analyses, we generated a L175A variant of mouse SLC25A3 that retains the ability to transport copper but not phosphate. This work highlights the utility of using an evolutionary framework to uncover amino acids involved in substrate recognition by mitochondrial carrier family proteins.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64684</link>
	<content:encoded>The mature cerebellum controls motor skill precision and participates in other sophisticated brain functions that include learning, cognition, and speech. Different types of GABAergic and glutamatergic cerebellar neurons originate in temporal order from two progenitor niches, the ventricular zone and rhombic lip, which express the transcription factors Ptf1a and Atoh1, respectively. However, the molecular machinery required to specify the distinct neuronal types emanating from these progenitor zones is still unclear. Here, we uncover the transcription factor Olig3 as a major determinant in generating the earliest neuronal derivatives emanating from both progenitor zones in mice. In the rhombic lip, Olig3 regulates progenitor cell proliferation. In the ventricular zone, Olig3 safeguards Purkinje cell specification by curtailing the expression of Pax2, a transcription factor that suppresses the Purkinje cell differentiation program. Our work thus defines Olig3 as a key factor in early cerebellar development.</content:encoded>

We demonstrate the applicability of this approach, termed BLITZ (Biotin Labelling In Tagged Zebrafish), in diverse cell types such as neurons and vascular endothelial cells. We applied this methodology to identify interactors of caveolar coat protein, cavins, in skeletal muscle.

To probe energetics of this coupling without complication from bound agonist we use a gain of function mutant (a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;L9'Tb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;g&lt;sub&gt;2L&lt;/sub&gt;) directly activated by BZDs. We identify a specific residue whose mutation (a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;V279A) more than doubles the energetic contribution of the BZD positive modulator diazepam (DZ) to pore opening and also enhances DZ-potentiation of GABA-evoked currents in a wild-type background. In contrast, other linker mutations have little effect on DZ efficiency, but generally impair unliganded pore opening. Our observations reveal an important residue regulating BZD-pore linkage, thereby shedding new light on the molecular mechanism of these drugs.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64139</link>
	<content:encoded>Before the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic began, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) was among the top priorities for global public health. Already a complex challenge, AMR now needs to be addressed in a changing healthcare landscape. Here, we analyse how changes due to COVID-19 in terms of antimicrobial usage, infection prevention, and health systems affect the emergence, transmission, and burden of AMR. Increased hand hygiene, decreased international travel, and decreased elective hospital procedures may reduce AMR pathogen selection and spread in the short term. However, the opposite effects may be seen if antibiotics are more widely used as standard healthcare pathways break down. Over 6 months into the COVID-19 pandemic, the dynamics of AMR remain uncertain. We call for the AMR community to keep a global perspective while designing finely tuned surveillance and research to continue to improve our preparedness and response to these intersecting public health challenges.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Individual variation in Achilles tendon morphology and geometry changes susceptibility to injury</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63204</link>
	<content:encoded>The unique structure of the Achilles tendon, combining three smaller sub-tendons, enhances movement efficiency by allowing individual control from connected muscles. This requires compliant interfaces between sub-tendons, but compliance decreases with age and may account for increased injury frequency. Current understanding of sub-tendon sliding and its role in the whole Achilles tendon function is limited. Here we show changing the degree of sliding greatly affects the tendon mechanical behaviour. Our in vitro testing discovered distinct sub-tendon mechanical properties in keeping with their mechanical demands. In silico study based on measured properties, subject-specific tendon geometry, and modified sliding capacity demonstrated age-related displacement reduction similar to our in vivo ultrasonography measurements. Peak stress magnitude and distribution within the whole Achilles tendon are affected by individual tendon geometries, the sliding capacity between sub-tendons, and different muscle loading conditions. These results suggest clinical possibilities to identify patients at risk and design personalised rehabilitation protocols.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61803</link>
	<content:encoded>Influenza virus has a high mutation rate, such that within one host different viral variants can emerge. Evidence suggests that influenza virus variants are more prevalent in pregnant and/or obese individuals due to their impaired interferon response. We have recently shown that the non-allergic, paucigranulocytic subtype of asthma is associated with impaired type I interferon production. Here, we seek to address if this is associated with an increased emergence of influenza virus variants. Compared to controls, mice with paucigranulocytic asthma had increased disease severity and an increased emergence of influenza virus variants. Specifically, PB1 mutations exclusively detected in asthmatic mice were associated with increased polymerase activity. Furthermore, asthmatic host-derived virus led to increased disease severity in wild-type mice. Taken together, these data suggest that at least a subset of patients with asthma may be more susceptible to severe influenza and may be a possible source of new influenza virus variants.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61135</link>
	<content:encoded>Painful stimuli evoke a mixture of sensations, negative emotions and behaviors. These myriad effects are thought to be produced by parallel ascending circuits working in combination. Here we describe a pathway from spinal cord to brain for ongoing pain. Activation of a subset of spinal neurons expressing Tacr1 evokes a full repertoire of somatotopically-directed pain-related behaviors in the absence of noxious input. Tacr1 projection neurons (expressing NKR1) target a tiny cluster of neurons in the superior lateral parabrachial nucleus (PBN-SL). We showed that these neurons, which also express Tacr1 (PBN-SL&lt;sup&gt;Tacr1&lt;/sup&gt;), are responsive to sustained but not acute noxious stimuli. Activation of PBN-SL&lt;sup&gt;Tacr1&lt;/sup&gt; neurons alone did not trigger pain responses but instead served to dramatically heighten nocifensive behaviors and suppress itch. Remarkably, mice with silenced PBN-SL&lt;sup&gt;Tacr1&lt;/sup&gt; neurons ignored long-lasting noxious stimuli. Together, these data reveal new details about this spinoparabrachial pathway and its key role in the sensation of ongoing pain.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Adaptation to shifting temperatures is crucial for the survival of the bacterial pathogen &lt;i&gt;Vibrio cholerae&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we show that colony rugosity, a biofilm-associated phenotype, is regulated by temperature in &lt;i&gt;V. cholerae&lt;/i&gt; strains that naturally lack the master biofilm transcriptional regulator HapR. Using transposon-insertion mutagenesis, we found the &lt;i&gt;V. cholerae&lt;/i&gt; ortholog of BipA, a conserved ribosome-associated GTPase, is critical for this temperature-dependent phenomenon. Proteomic analyses revealed that loss of BipA alters the synthesis of &amp;gt;300 proteins in &lt;i&gt;V. cholerae&lt;/i&gt; at 22°C, increasing the production of biofilm-related proteins including the key transcriptional activators VpsR and VpsT, as well as proteins important for diverse cellular processes. At low temperatures, BipA protein levels increase and are required for optimal ribosome assembly in &lt;i&gt;V. cholerae&lt;/i&gt;, suggesting that control of BipA abundance is a mechanism by which bacteria can remodel their proteomes. Our study reveals a remarkable new facet of &lt;i&gt;V. cholerae&lt;/i&gt;’s complex biofilm regulatory network.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Neural crest cells (NCCs) are vertebrate stem cells that give rise to various cell types throughout the developing body in early life. Here, we utilized single-cell transcriptomic analyses to delineate NCC-derivatives along the posterior developing vertebrate, zebrafish, during the late embryonic to early larval stage, a period when NCCs are actively differentiating into distinct cellular lineages. We identified several major NCC/NCC-derived cell-types including mesenchyme, neural crest, neural, neuronal, glial, and pigment, from which we resolved over three dozen cellular subtypes. We dissected gene expression signatures of pigment progenitors delineating into chromatophore lineages, mesenchyme cells, and enteric NCCs transforming into enteric neurons. Global analysis of NCC derivatives revealed they were demarcated by combinatorial &lt;i&gt;hox&lt;/i&gt; gene codes, with distinct profiles within neuronal cells. From these analyses, we present a comprehensive cell-type atlas that can be utilized as a valuable resource for further mechanistic and evolutionary investigations of NCC differentiation.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Iron is a biochemically critical metal cofactor in enzymes involved in photosynthesis, cellular respiration, nitrate assimilation, nitrogen fixation, and reactive oxygen species defense. Marine microeukaryotes have evolved a phytotransferrin-based iron uptake system to cope with iron scarcity, a major factor limiting primary productivity in the global ocean. Diatom phytotransferrin is endocytosed, however proteins downstream of this environmentally ubiquitous iron receptor are unknown. We applied engineered ascorbate peroxidase APEX2-based subcellular proteomics to catalog proximal proteins of phytotransferrin in the model marine diatom &lt;i&gt;Phaeodactylum tricornutum&lt;/i&gt;. Proteins encoded by poorly characterized iron-sensitive genes were identified including three that are expressed from a chromosomal gene cluster. Two of them showed unambiguous colocalization with phytotransferrin adjacent to the chloroplast. Further phylogenetic, domain, and biochemical analyses suggest their involvement in intracellular iron processing. Proximity proteomics holds enormous potential to glean new insights into iron acquisition pathways and beyond in these evolutionarily, ecologically, and biotechnologically important microalgae.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.431528v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Current theories propose that the short-term retention of information in working memory (WM) and the recall of information from long-term memory (LTM) are supported by overlapping neural mechanisms in occipital and parietal cortex. Both are thought to rely on reinstating patterns of sensory activity evoked by the perception of the remembered item. However, the extent of the shared representations between WM and LTM are unclear, and it is unknown how WM and LTM representations may differ across cortical regions. We designed a spatial memory task that allowed us to directly compare the representations of remembered spatial information in WM and LTM. Critically, we carefully matched the precision of behavioral responses in these tasks. We used fMRI and multivariate pattern analyses to examine representations in (1) retinotopic cortex and (2) lateral parietal cortex (LPC) regions previously implicated in LTM. We show that visual memories were represented in a sensory-like code in both tasks across retinotopic regions in occipital and parietal cortex. LPC regions also encoded remembered locations in both WM and LTM, but in a format that differed from the sensory-evoked activity. These results suggest a striking correspondence in the format of WM and LTM representations across occipital and parietal cortex. On the other hand, we show that activity patterns in nearly all parietal regions, but not occipital regions, contained information that could discriminate between WM trials and LTM trials. Our data provide new evidence for theories of memory systems and the representation of mnemonic content.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.431506v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Humans extract statistical regularities over time by forming internal representations of the transition probabilities between states. Studies on sequence prediction learning typically focus on how experiencing a particular sequence allows the underlying generative model to be learned. Here we ask what role generative models play when participants experience and learn to predict different sequences from a common generative family. Our novel multi-task prediction paradigm requires participants to complete four sequence learning tasks, each task being a different instantiation of a common generative family. This multi-task environment allows participants to demonstrate two types of learning: (i) within-task learning (i.e., finding the solution to each of the tasks), and (ii) across-task learning (i.e., learning from one task that changes how they approach future tasks). Specifically, to examine across-task learning, we focus on the first four trials of each sequence learning task, as choices during these trials must be driven by participants' background knowledge and not by their in-task learning experience. We show not only that participants arrive with a structured prior, but also that as participants proceed from one task to the next, their prior increasingly resembles the true generative family. Then, to analyse the within-task learning, we model behaviour within each task as arising from a mixture-of-generative-models learning strategy, whereby participants have a pool of candidate explanatory models (mostly within the true generative family) that they continuously update and arbitrate against each other to best explain the stimulus sequence. This framework predicts specific structured errors from participants, as well as a gating mechanism for learning, both of which are observed in the data.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Go is the alpha subunit of the major heterotrimeric G protein in neurons and mediates signaling by every known neurotransmitter, yet the signaling mechanisms activated by Go remain to be fully elucidated. Genetic analysis in Caenorhabditis elegans has shown that Go signaling inhibits neuronal activity and neurotransmitter release, but studies of the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects have been limited by lack of tools to complement genetic studies with other experimental approaches. Here we demonstrate that inserting the green fluorescent protein (GFP) into an internal loop of the Go protein results in a tagged protein that is functional in vivo and that facilitates cell biological and biochemical studies of Go. Transgenic expression of Go-GFP rescues the defects caused by loss of endogenous Go in assays of egg laying and locomotion behaviors. Defects in body morphology caused by loss of Go are also rescued by Go-GFP. The Go-GFP protein is localized to the plasma membrane of neurons, mimicking localization of endogenous Go. Using GFP as an epitope tag, Go-GFP can be immunoprecipitated from C. elegans lysates to purify Go protein complexes. The Go-GFP transgene reported in this study enables studies involving in vivo localization and biochemical purification of Go to complement the already well-developed genetic analysis of Go signaling.</content:encoded>

We found that IT neurons, but not PT neurons, convey significant working memory-related signals. We also found that the inactivation of IT neurons, but not PT neurons, impairs behavioral performance. In contrast, PT neurons convey far more temporal information than IT neurons during the delay period. Our results indicate a division of labor between IT and PT projection neurons in the prefrontal cortex for the maintenance of working memory and for tracking the passage of time, respectively.</content:encoded>

Here, we describe the neural activity of human cerebral organoids reciprocally connected by a bundle of axons. Compared to conventional organoids, connected organoids produced significantly more intense and complex oscillatory activity. Optogenetic manipulations revealed that the connected organoids could re-play and recapitulate over time temporal patterns found in external stimuli, indicating that the connected organoids were able to form and retain temporal memories. Our findings suggest that connected organoids may serve as powerful tools for investigating the roles of macroscopic circuits in the human brain - allowing researchers to dissect cellular functions in three-dimensional in vitro nervous system models in unprecedented ways.</content:encoded>

We found that both subcortical and cortical neural sources contributed to the responses. Results indicated that advancing age was related to smaller responses with less cortical response contributions, consistent with an age-related decrease in neural phase-locking ability. Conversely, hearing impaired subjects displayed larger responses compared to age-matched normal hearing controls. This was due to additional cortical response contributions which were stronger for participants with more severe hearing loss. This is consistent with the recruitment of additional cortical sources for auditory processing in persons with hearing impairment.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.430904v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Predictive coding represents a promising framework for understanding brain function. It postulates that the brain continuously inhibits predictable sensory input, ensuring a preferential processing of surprising elements. A central aspect of this view is its hierarchical connectivity, involving recurrent message passing between excitatory bottom-up signals and inhibitory top-down feedback. Here we use computational modelling to demonstrate that such architectural hard-wiring is not necessary. Rather, predictive coding is shown to emerge as a consequence of energy efficiency. When training recurrent neural networks to minimise their energy consumption while operating in predictive environments, the networks self-organise into prediction and error units with appropriate inhibitory and excitatory interconnections, and learn to inhibit predictable sensory input. Moving beyond the view of purely top-down driven predictions, we demonstrate via virtual lesioning experiments that networks perform predictions on two timescales: fast lateral predictions among sensory units, and slower prediction cycles that integrate evidence over time.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.431339v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Cerebellar granule cells (GrCs) are usually regarded as a uniform cell type that collectively expands the coding space of the cerebellum by integrating diverse combinations of mossy fiber inputs. Accordingly, stable molecularly or physiologically defined GrC subtypes within a single cerebellar region have not been reported. The only known cellular properties that distinguishes otherwise homogeneous GrCs is the correspondence between GrC birthtime and the depth of the molecular layer to which their axons (parallel fibers) project. To determine the role birth timing plays in GrC wiring and function, we developed genetic strategies to access early- and late-born GrCs. We initiated retrograde monosynaptic rabies virus tracing from control, early-born, and late-born GrCs, revealing the different patterns of mossy fiber input to GrCs in vermis lobule 6 and simplex, as well as to early- and late-born GrCs of vermis lobule 6: sensory and motor nuclei provide more input to early-born GrCs, while basal pontine and cerebellar nuclei provide more input to late-born GrCs. In vivo multi-depth 2-photon Ca2+ imaging of parallel fibers of early- and late-born GrCs revealed representations of diverse task variables and stimuli by both populations, with differences in the proportions of parallel fibers encoding movement, reward anticipation, and reward consumption. Our results suggest neither organized parallel processing nor completely random organization of mossy fiber--&amp;gt;GrC circuitry, but instead a moderate influence of birth timing on GrC wiring and encoding. Our imaging data also suggest that GrCs can represent general aversiveness, in addition to recently described reward representations.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.431332v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Dynamin mediates fission of vesicles from the plasma membrane during endocytosis. Typically, dynamin is recruited from the cytosol to endocytic sites, requiring seconds to tens of seconds. However, ultrafast endocytosis in neurons internalizes vesicles as quickly as 50 ms during synaptic vesicle recycling. Here we demonstrate that Dynamin 1 is pre-recruited to endocytic sites for ultrafast endocytosis. Specifically, Dynamin 1xA, a splice variant of Dynamin 1, interacts with Syndapin 1 to form molecular condensates on the plasma membrane when the proline-rich domain of this variant is dephosphorylated. When this domain is mutated to include phosphomimetic residues or Syndapin 1s dynamin-interacting domain is mutated, Dynamin 1xA becomes diffuse, and consequently, ultrafast endocytosis slows down by ~100-fold. Mechanistically, Syndapin 1 acts as an adaptor by binding the plasma membrane and stores Dynamin 1xA at endocytic sites. This cache bypasses the recruitment step and accelerates endocytosis at synapses.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The molecular mechanisms underlying the diversity of cortical glutamatergic synapses is still only partially understood. Here, we tested the hypothesis that presynaptic active zones (AZs) are constructed from molecularly uniform, independent release sites (RSs), the number of which scales linearly with the AZ size. Paired recordings between hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells and fast-spiking interneurons followed by quantal analysis demonstrate large variability in the number of RSs (N) at these connections. High resolution molecular analysis of functionally characterized synapses reveals highly variable Munc13-1 content of AZs that possess the same N. Replica immunolabeling also shows a 3-fold variability in the Munc13-1 content of AZs of identical size. Munc13-1 is clustered within the AZs; cluster size and density are also variable. Our results provide evidence for quantitative molecular heterogeneity of RSs and support a model in which the AZ is built up from variable numbers of molecularly heterogeneous, but independent RSs.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: A compressed representation of spatial distance in the rodent hippocampus</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.431306v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Principal cells in the rodent hippocampus often fire in response to traversal through a specific spatial location (place cells), as well as elapsed time during an imposed temporal delay or after stimulus offset (time cells). Sequences of time cells unfold rapidly at first, with many time cells with narrow time fields. As the triggering event recedes into the past, time cells are fewer and have broader fields. This means that the representation of time in the hippocampus is compressed with greater resolution for time points near the present. Using tetrode recordings we measured individual CA1 units while rats traveled along a track that could be changed in length. Consistent with previous results, most place cells coded for distance from the starting point of the trajectory. Critically, place cells became less numerous and showed gradually widening fields with distance from the starting location. These results suggest that as the animal leaves a landmark, the hippocampal place code forms a compressed representation of distance from the starting location. The representation of time and space in the hippocampus have similar properties suggesting that they arise from similar computational mechanisms.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Nicotine-mediated recruitment of GABAergic neurons to a dopaminergic phenotype attenuates motor deficits in alpha-synuclein Parkinson's model.</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.431290v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>BACKGROUND: Previous work revealed an inverse correlation between smoking and Parkinson's disease (PD) that is associated with nicotine-induced neuroprotection of dopaminergic (DA) neurons against nigrostriatal damage in PD primates and rodent models. Nicotine, a neuroactive component of tobacco, can directly alter the activity of midbrain DA neurons and induce non-DA neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) to acquire a DA phenotype. We investigated the recruitment mechanism of nigrostriatal GABAergic neurons to express DA phenotypes, such as transcription factor Nurr1 and DA-synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and the concomitant effects on motor function. METHODS: Wild-type and -syn-overexpressing (PD) mice treated with chronic nicotine were assessed by behavioral pattern monitor (BPM) and immunohistochemistry/in-situ hybridization to measure behavior and the translational/transcriptional regulation of neurotransmitter phenotype following selective Nurr1 overexpression or DREADD-mediated chemogenetic activation. RESULTS: Nicotine treatment led to a transcriptional TH and translational Nurr1 upregulation within a pool of SN GABAergic neurons in wild-type animals. In PD mice, nicotine increased Nurr1 expression, reduced the number of -syn-expressing neurons, and simultaneously rescued motor deficits. Hyperactivation of GABA neurons alone was sufficient to elicit de novo translational upregulation of Nurr1 in non-DA neurons. Retrograde labeling revealed that a fraction of these GABAergic neurons project to the dorsal striatum. CONCLUSIONS: Nicotine exposure initiates neuroprotective mechanisms counteracting the neurodegenerative effects of -syn accumulation in DA neurons and contributing to Nurr1-mediated therapeutic effects. Revealing the mechanism of nicotine-induced DA plasticity protecting SN neurons against nigrostriatal damage could contribute to developing new strategies for neurotransmitter replacement in PD.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: A practical modification to a resting state fMRI protocol for improved characterization of cerebrovascular function</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.431289v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), defined here as the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) response to a CO2 pressure change, is a useful metric of cerebrovascular function. Both the amplitude and the timing (hemodynamic lag) of the CVR response can bring insight into the nature of a cerebrovascular pathology and aid in understanding noise confounds when using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to study neural activity. This research assessed a practical modification to a typical resting state fMRI protocol, to improve the characterization of cerebrovascular function. In 9 healthy subjects, we modelled CVR and lag in three resting state data segments, and in data segments which added a 2 to 3 minute breathing task to the start of a resting state segment. Two different breathing tasks were used to induce fluctuations in arterial CO2 pressure: a breath hold task to induce hypercapnia (CO2 increase) and a cued deep breathing task to induce hypocapnia (CO2 decrease). Our analysis produced voxelwise estimates of the amplitude (CVR) and timing (lag) of the BOLD fMRI response to CO2 by systematically shifting the CO2 regressor in time to optimize the model fit. This optimization inherently increases grey matter CVR values and fit statistics. The inclusion of a simple breathing task, compared to a resting state scan only, increases the number of voxels in the brain that have a significant relationship between CO2 and BOLD fMRI signals, and improves our confidence in the plausibility of voxelwise CVR and hemodynamic lag estimates. We demonstrate the clinical utility and feasibility of this protocol in an incidental finding of Moyamoya disease, and explore the possibilities and challenges of using this protocol in younger populations. This hybrid protocol has direct applications for CVR mapping in both research and clinical settings and wider applications for fMRI denoising and interpretation.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Optimal Reinforcement Learning with Asymmetric Updating in Volatile Environments: a Simulation Study</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.431283v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The ability to predict the future is essential for decision-making and interaction with the environment to avoid punishment and gain reward. Reinforcement learning algorithms provide a normative way for interactive learning, especially in volatile environments. The optimal strategy for the classic reinforcement learning model is to increase the learning rate as volatility increases. Inspired by optimistic bias in humans, an alternative reinforcement learning model has been developed by adding a punishment learning rate to the classic reinforcement learning model. In this study, we aim to 1) compare the performance of these two models in interaction with different environments, and 2) find optimal parameters for the models. Our simulations indicate that having two different learning rates for rewards and punishments increases performance in a volatile environment. Investigation of the optimal parameters shows that in almost all environments, having a higher reward learning rate compared to the punishment learning rate is beneficial for achieving higher performance which in this case is the accumulation of more rewards. Our results suggest that to achieve high performance, we need a shorter memory window for recent rewards and a longer memory window for punishments. This is consistent with optimistic bias in human behavior.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Deletion of Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier-1 Attenuates Behavioral and Anatomical Deficits by Enhancing Functional Autophagic Activities in Huntington Disease</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.431277v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Mutant HTT (mHTT) associated with Huntington disease (HD) affects the central nervous system by prominent atrophy in the striatum and promotes psychiatric, cognitive, and choreiform movements, although the exact mechanism remains obscure. Previous studies have shown that SUMO1 (Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier-1) modification of mHTT promotes cellular toxicity, but the in vivo role and functions of SUMO1 in HD pathogenesis are unclear. Here, we report that SUMO1 deletion in Q175DN HD-het knock-in mice (HD mice) prevented age-dependent HD-like motor and neurological impairments and suppressed the striatal atrophy and inflammatory response. SUMO1 deletion caused a drastic reduction in soluble mHtt levels and nuclear and extracellular mHtt inclusions, while increasing cytoplasmic inclusions in the striatum of HD mice. SUMO1 deletion also enhanced autophagic activity, characterized by augmented interactions between mHTT inclusions and a lysosomal marker (LAMP1), increased LC3B/LAMP1 interaction, and decreased sequestosome-1 (p62) and mHTT and diminished p62/LAMP1 interactions in DARPP-32 positive medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in HD mice. Depletion of SUMO1 in an HD cell model also diminished the mHtt levels and enhanced autophagy flux. In addition, the SUMOylation inhibitor ginkgolic acid strongly enhanced autophagy and diminished mHTT levels in human HD fibroblasts. These results indicate that SUMO is a critical therapeutic target in HD and that blocking SUMO may ameliorate HD pathogenesis by improving autophagy activities.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Poly (I:C)-induced maternal immune activation affects mouse visual discrimination performance and reversal learning in a sex-dependent manner.</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.431275v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>While there is a strong focus on the negative consequences of maternal immune activation (MIA) on the developing brain, very little attention is directed towards potential advantages of early life challenges. In this study we utilized a polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) MIA model to test visual discrimination (VD) and reversal learning (RL) in mice using touchscreen technology. Significant sex differences emerged in that MIA improved the latency for males to make a correct choice in the VD task while females reached criterion sooner, made fewer errors and utilized fewer correction trials in RL compared to saline-treated controls. These surprising improvements were accompanied by the sex-specific upregulation of several neural markers critical to cognitive functioning (e.g., Gabrg2, Grin1, Grin2b, Htr2a, Chrm1, Prkca, and Camk2a mRNA in prefrontal cortex (PFC)), indicative of compensatory plasticity in response to the MIA challenge. In contrast, when exposed to a &quot;two-hit&quot; stress model (MIA combined with loss of the social component of environmental enrichment (EE)), mice showed no evidence of anhedonia but required an increased number of PD and RL correction trials. These animals also had significant reductions of CamK2a mRNA in the PFC. Appropriate functioning of synaptic plasticity, via mediators such as this protein kinase and others, are critical for behavioral flexibility. Although EE has been implicated in delaying the appearance of symptoms associated with certain brain disorders, these findings are in line with evidence that it also makes individuals more vulnerable to its loss. Overall, with the right &quot;dose&quot;, early life stress exposure can confer at least some functional advantages, which are lost when the number or magnitude of these exposures become too great.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Cerebral cortical communication overshadows computational energy-use, but these combine to predict synapse number</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.431272v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Darwinian evolution tends to produce energy-efficient outcomes. On the other hand, energy limits computation, be it neural and probabilistic or digital and logical. Taking a particular energy-efficient viewpoint, we define neural computation and make use of an energy-constrained, computational function. This function can be optimized over a variable that is proportional to the number of synapses per neuron. This function also implies a specific distinction between ATP-consuming processes, especially computation per se vs the communication processes including action potentials and transmitter release. Thus to apply this mathematical function requires an energy audit with a partitioning of energy consumption that differs from earlier work. The audit points out that, rather than the oft-quoted 20 watts of glucose available to the brain [1], the fraction partitioned to cortical computation is only 0.1 watts of ATP. On the other hand at 3.5 watts, long-distance communication costs are 35-fold greater. Other novel quantifications include (i) a finding that the biological vs ideal values of neural computational efficiency differ by a factor of 10^8 and (ii) two predictions of N, the number of synaptic transmissions needed to fire a neuron (2500 vs 2000).</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.431255v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The brain is an extraordinarily complex system that facilitates the efficient integration of information from different regions to execute its functions. With the recent advances in technology, researchers can now collect enormous amounts of data from the brain using neuroimaging at different scales and from numerous modalities. With that comes the need for sophisticated tools for analysis. The field of network neuroscience has been trying to tackle these challenges, and graph theory has been one of its essential branches through the investigation of brain networks. Recently, topological data analysis has gained more attention as an alternative framework by providing a set of metrics that go beyond pair-wise connections and offer improved robustness against noise. In this hands-on tutorial, our goal is to provide the computational tools to explore neuroimaging data using these frameworks and to facilitate their accessibility, data visualisation, and comprehension for newcomers to the field. We will start by giving a concise (and by no means complete) overview of the field to introduce the two frameworks, and then explain how to compute both well-established and newer metrics on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. We use an open-source language (Python) and provide an accompanying publicly available Jupyter Notebook that uses data from the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project. Moreover, we would like to highlight one part of our notebook that is solely dedicated to realistic visualisation of high order interactions in brain networks. This pipeline provides three-dimensional (3-D) plots of pair-wise and higher-order interactions projected in a brain atlas, a new feature tailor-made for network neuroscience.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Exploring MEG brain fingerprints: evaluation, pitfalls and interpretations</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.431253v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Individual characterization of subjects based on their functional connectome (FC), termed 'FC fingerprinting', has become a highly sought-after goal in contemporary neuroscience research. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have demonstrated unique characterization and accurate identification of individuals as an accomplished task. However, FC fingerprinting in magnetoencephalography (MEG) data is still widely unexplored. Here, we study resting-state MEG data from the Human Connectome Project to assess the MEG FC fingerprinting and its relationship with several factors including amplitude- and phase-coupling functional connectivity measures, spatial leakage correction and frequency bands. To this end, we first employ two identification scoring methods, differential identifiability and success rate, to provide quantitative fingerprint scores for each FC measurement. Secondly, we explore the edgewise and nodal MEG fingerprinting patterns across the different frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma). Finally, we investigate the cross-modality fingerprinting patterns obtained from MEG and fMRI recordings from the same subjects. Our results suggest that fingerprinting performance is heavily dependent on the functional connectivity measure, frequency band, identification scoring method, and spatial leakage correction. We report higher MEG fingerprints in phase-coupling methods, central frequency bands (alpha and beta), and in the visual, frontoparietal, dorsal-attention and default-mode networks. Furthermore, cross-modality comparisons reveal a certain degree of spatial concordance in fingerprinting patterns between the MEG and fMRI data, especially in the visual system. This comprehensive, albeit preliminary investigation of MEG connectome test-retest identification offers a first characterization of MEG fingerprinting in relation to different methodological and electrophysiological factors and contributes to the understanding of fingerprinting cross-modal relationships. We hope that this first investigation will contribute to setting the grounds for MEG connectome identification.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.431235v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The visual word form area (VWFA) is a region of human inferotemporal cortex that emerges at a fixed location in occipitotemporal cortex during reading acquisition, and systematically responds to written words in literate individuals. According to the neuronal recycling hypothesis, this region arises through the repurposing, for letter recognition, of a subpart of the ventral visual pathway initially involved in face and object recognition. Furthermore, according to the biased connectivity hypothesis, its universal localization is due to pre-existing connections from this subregion to areas involved in spoken language processing. Here, we evaluate those hypotheses in an explicit computational model. We trained a deep convolutional neural network of the ventral visual pathway, first to categorize pictures, and then to recognize written words invariantly for case, font and size. We show that the model can account for many properties of the VWFA, particularly when a subset of units possesses a biased connectivity to word output units. The network develops a sparse, invariant representation of written words, based on a restricted set of reading-selective units. Their activation mimics several properties of the VWFA, and their lesioning causes a reading-specific deficit. Our simulation fleshes out the neuronal recycling hypothesis, and make several testable predictions concerning the neural code for written words.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Towards deciphering the Nt17 code: How the sequence and conformation of the first 17 amino acids in Huntingtin regulate the aggregation, cellular properties, and neurotoxicity of mutant Httex1</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.431207v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The first 17 N-terminal amino acids (the Nt17 domain) flanking the polyQ tract of the Huntingtin protein (Htt) play an important role in modulating its aggregation, life cycle, membrane binding, and toxicity. Therefore, a better understanding of the molecular and structural determinants of the Nt17 code would likely provide important insights and help guide the development of future anti-aggregation and Htt lowering therapeutic strategies. Towards this goal, we sought to elucidate the role of the Nt17 sequence and helical conformation in regulating mutant Httex1 aggregation, morphology, uptake, and neuronal toxicity. To modulate the helical conformation of Nt17, we used a helix and membrane-binding disrupting mutation (M8P) strategy and site-specific introduction of post-translational modifications that are known to enhance (pT3) or disrupt (pS13, pS16, or pS13/pS16) the overall helicity of Nt17. Our in vitro studies show that the Nt17 and polyQ domains synergistically promote Httex1 aggregation, consistent with previous findings. However, we show that the Nt17 sequence, but not its helical conformation, is a key determinant of the morphology and growth of Httex1 fibrils. In cells, we show that the aggregation propensity and the toxic properties of de novo Httex1 were dependent on both the Nt17 sequence and its helical conformation and the synergistic effect of the Nt17 and polyQ domains. Finally, we demonstrate that the uptake of Httex1 into primary striatal neurons is strongly influenced by the helical propensity of Nt17. Phosphorylation (at T3 or S13/S16) or removal of the Nt17 domain increases the uptake and accumulation of Httex1 fibrils into the nucleus and induces neuronal cell death. Altogether our results demonstrate that the Nt17 domain serves as one of the key master regulators of Htt aggregation and toxicity and represents an attractive target for inhibiting Htt aggregate formation, inclusion formation, cell-to-cell propagation, and neuronal toxicity. These findings have significant implications for targeting the Nt17 domain to develop new disease-modifying therapies for the treatment of Huntington's disease.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Influence of regional white matter hyperintensity volume and apolipoprotein E ε4 status on hippocampal volume in healthy older adults</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23308?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
While total white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been associated with hippocampal atrophy, less is known about how the regional distribution of WMH volume may differentially affect the hippocampus in healthy aging. Additionally, apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carriers may be at an increased risk for greater WMH volumes and hippocampal atrophy in aging. The present study sought to investigate whether regional WMH volume mediates the relationship between age and hippocampal volume and if this association is moderated by APOE ε4 status in a group of 190 cognitively healthy adults (APOE ε4 status [carrier/non‐carrier] = 59/131), ages 50–89. Analyses revealed that temporal lobe WMH volume significantly mediated the relationship between age and average bilateral hippocampal volume, and this effect was moderated by APOE ε4 status (−0.020 (SE = 0.009), 95% CI, [−0.039, −0.003]). APOE ε4 carriers, but not non‐carriers, showed negative indirect effects of age on hippocampal volume through temporal lobe WMH volume (APOE ε4 carriers: −0.016 (SE = 0.007), 95% CI, [−0.030, −0.003]; APOE ε4 non‐carriers: .005 (SE = 0.006), 95% CI, [−0.006, 0.017]). These findings remained significant after additionally adjusting for sex, years of education, hypertension status and duration, cholesterol status, diabetes status, Body Mass Index, history of smoking, and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale‐IV Full Scale IQ. There were no significant moderated mediation effects for frontal, parietal, and occipital lobe WMH volumes, with or without covariates. Our findings indicate that in cognitively healthy older adults, elevated WMH volume regionally localized to the temporal lobes in APOE ε4 carriers is associated with reduced hippocampal volume, suggesting greater vulnerability to brain aging and the risk for Alzheimer's disease.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Fractional anisotropy from diffusion tensor imaging correlates with acute astrocyte and myelin swelling in neonatal swine models of excitotoxic and hypoxic‐ischemic brain injury</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25121?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>In neonatal piglets with encephalopathy from excitotoxic brain injury, fractional anisotropy from diffusion tensor imaging correlates with swollen astrocytes immunophenotyped by glutamate transporter‐1 (GLT‐1) and normal neurons with perineuronal GLT‐1+ astrocyte decorations in the striatum.







Abstract
The specific cytopathology that causes abnormal fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) after neonatal hypoxia‐ischemia (HI) is not completely understood. The panoply of cell types in the brain might contribute differentially to changes in DTI metrics. Because glia are the predominant cell type in brain, we hypothesized that changes in FA and MD would signify perturbations in glial microstructure. Using a 3‐Tesla clinical scanner, we conducted in vivo DTI MRI in nine neonatal piglets at 20–96 h after excitotoxic brain injury from striatal quinolinic acid injection or global HI. FA and MD from putamen, caudate, and internal capsule in toto were correlated with astrocyte swelling, neuronal excitotoxicity, and white matter injury. Low FA correlated with more swollen astrocytes immunophenotyped by aquaporin‐4 (AQP4), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and glutamate transporter‐1 (GLT‐1). Low FA was also related to the loss of neurons with perineuronal GLT‐1+ astrocyte decorations, large myelin swellings, lower myelin density, and oligodendrocyte cell death identified by 2′,3′‐cyclic nucleotide 3′‐phosphodiesterase, bridging integrator‐1, and nuclear morphology. MD correlated with degenerating oligodendrocytes and depletion of normal GFAP+ astrocytes but not with astrocyte or myelin swelling. We conclude that FA is associated with cytotoxic edema in astrocytes and oligodendrocyte processes as well as myelin injury at the cellular level. MD can detect glial cell death and loss, but it may not discern subtle pathology in swollen astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, or myelin. This study provides a cytopathologic basis for interpreting DTI in the neonatal brain after HI.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Long‐term Safety and Efficacy of Eculizumab in Aquaporin‐4 IgG‐Positive NMOSD</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26049?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
During PREVENT (NCT01892345), eculizumab significantly reduced relapse risk versus placebo in patients with aquaporin‐4 immunoglobulin G‐positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (AQP4‐IgG+ NMOSD). We report an interim analysis of PREVENT's ongoing open‐label extension (OLE; NCT02003144) evaluating eculizumab's long‐term safety and efficacy.


Methods
Patients who completed PREVENT could enroll in the OLE to receive eculizumab (maintenance dose, 1200 mg/2 weeks, after a blinded induction phase). Safety and efficacy data from PREVENT and its OLE (interim data cut, July 31, 2019) were combined for this analysis.


Results
Across PREVENT and the OLE, 137 patients received eculizumab and were monitored for a median (range) of 133.3 (5.1–276.9) weeks, for a combined total of 362.3 patient‐years (PY). Treatment‐related adverse event (AE) and serious adverse event (SAE) rates were 183.5/100 PY and 8.6/100 PY, respectively. Serious infection rates were 10.2/100 PY in eculizumab‐treated patients versus 15.1/100 PY in the PREVENT placebo group. No patient developed a meningococcal infection. At 192 weeks (3.7 years), 94.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 88.6–97.3) of patients remained adjudicated relapse‐free. The adjudicated annualized relapse rate was 0.025 (95% CI, 0.013–0.048) in all eculizumab‐treated patients versus 0.350 (95% CI, 0.199–0.616) in the PREVENT placebo group. During the OLE, 37% of patients (44/119) stopped or decreased background immunosuppressive therapy use.


Interpretation
This analysis demonstrates that eculizumab's long‐term safety profile in NMOSD is consistent with its established profile across other indications. This analysis also demonstrated the sustained ability of long‐term eculizumab treatment to reduce relapse risk in patients with AQP4‐IgG+ NMOSD.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06635</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the great empirical success of artificial neural networks (NNs)
from a theoretical point of view is currently one of the hottest research
topics in computer science. In this paper we study the expressive power of NNs
with rectified linear units from a combinatorial optimization perspective. In
particular, we show that, given a directed graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ arcs,
there exists an NN of polynomial size that computes a maximum flow from any
possible real-valued arc capacities as input. To prove this, we develop the
pseudo-code language Max-Affine Arithmetic Programs (MAAPs) and show
equivalence between MAAPs and NNs concerning natural complexity measures. We
then design a MAAP to exactly solve the Maximum Flow Problem, which translates
to an NN of size $\mathcal{O}(m^2 n^2)$.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: A Philosophical Understanding of Representation for Neuroscience. (arXiv:2102.06592v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06592</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Typical systems neuroscience experiments correlate the activity of recorded
neurons with controlled variations in stimuli or behavior. Such experiments are
commonly taken to reveal that the neural activity is a representation of the
stimulus or behavior. But what does this statement mean? Representation is a
philosophical concept with a rich history going back at least to Aristotle. A
careful reading of contemporary philosophy suggests four criteria of
representation as they relate to neuroscience. First, a representation needs to
correlate with the object in reality that it represents. Second, a
representation needs to have some causal impact on behavior. Third, a
representation should have its causal role exclusively -- the absence of the
representation should block the behavior it enables. Fourth, a representation
should have teleological justification that specifies the cases in which it is
a misrepresentation. We argue that not taking all four criteria seriously leads
to statements that are neither neuroscientifically nor philosophically
satisfying. We discuss how neuroscience can move towards a deeper notion of
representation.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Leveraging Benchmarking Data for Informed One-Shot Dynamic Algorithm Selection. (arXiv:2102.06481v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06481</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A key challenge in the application of evolutionary algorithms in practice is
the selection of an algorithm instance that best suits the problem at hand.
What complicates this decision further is that different algorithms may be best
suited for different stages of the optimization process. Dynamic algorithm
selection and configuration are therefore well-researched topics in
evolutionary computation. However, while hyper-heuristics and parameter control
studies typically assume a setting in which the algorithm needs to be chosen
while running the algorithms, without prior information, AutoML approaches such
as hyper-parameter tuning and automated algorithm configuration assume the
possibility of evaluating different configurations before making a final
recommendation. In practice, however, we are often in a middle-ground between
these two settings, where we need to decide on the algorithm instance before
the run (&quot;oneshot&quot; setting), but where we have (possibly lots of) data
available on which we can base an informed decision.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We analyze in this work how such prior performance data can be used to infer
informed dynamic algorithm selection schemes for the solution of pseudo-Boolean
optimization problems. Our specific use-case considers a family of genetic
algorithms.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06435</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We present a first proof-of-concept use-case that demonstrates the efficiency
of interfacing the algorithm framework ParadisEO with the automated algorithm
configuration tool irace and the experimental platform IOHprofiler. By combing
these three tools, we obtain a powerful benchmarking environment that allows us
to systematically analyze large classes of algorithm spaces on complex
benchmark problems. Key advantages of our pipeline are fast evaluation times,
the possibility to generate rich data sets to support the analysis of the
algorithms, and a standardized interface that can be used to benchmark very
broad classes of sampling-based optimization heuristics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to enabling systematic algorithm configuration studies, our
approach paves a way for assessing the contribution of new ideas in interplay
with already existing operators -- a promising avenue for our research domain,
which at present may have a too strong focus on comparing entire algorithm
instances.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06358</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We present a new model of neural networks called Min-Max-Plus Neural Networks
(MMP-NNs) based on operations in tropical arithmetic. In general, an MMP-NN is
composed of three types of alternately stacked layers, namely linear layers,
min-plus layers and max-plus layers. Specifically, the latter two types of
layers constitute the nonlinear part of the network which is trainable and more
sophisticated compared to the nonlinear part of conventional neural networks.
In addition, we show that with higher capability of nonlinearity expression,
MMP-NNs are universal approximators of continuous functions, even when the
number of multiplication operations is tremendously reduced (possibly to none
in certain extreme cases). Furthermore, we formulate the backpropagation
algorithm in the training process of MMP-NNs and introduce an algorithm of
normalization to improve the rate of convergence in training.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Cerebral cortical communication overshadows computational energy-use, but these combine to predict synapse number. (arXiv:2102.06273v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06273</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Darwinian evolution tends to produce energy-efficient outcomes. On the other
hand, energy limits computation, be it neural and probabilistic or digital and
logical. Taking a particular energy-efficient viewpoint, we define neural
computation and make use of an energy-constrained, computational function. This
function can be optimized over a variable that is proportional to the number of
synapses per neuron. This function also implies a specific distinction between
ATP-consuming processes, especially computation \textit{per se} vs the
communication processes including action potentials and transmitter release.
Thus to apply this mathematical function requires an energy audit with a
partitioning of energy consumption that differs from earlier work. The audit
points out that, rather than the oft-quoted 20 watts of glucose available to
the brain \cite{sokoloff1960metabolism,sawada2013synapse}, the fraction
partitioned to cortical computation is only 0.1 watts of ATP. On the other hand
at 3.5 watts, long-distance communication costs are 35-fold greater. Other
novel quantifications include (i) a finding that the biological vs ideal values
of neural computational efficiency differ by a factor of $10^8$ and (ii) two
predictions of $N$, the number of synaptic transmissions needed to fire a
neuron (2500 vs 2000).

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Decentralizing Feature Extraction with Quantum Convolutional Neural Network for Automatic Speech Recognition. (arXiv:2010.13309v2 [cs.SD] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13309</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We propose a novel decentralized feature extraction approach in federated
learning to address privacy-preservation issues for speech recognition. It is
built upon a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) composed of a quantum
circuit encoder for feature extraction, and a recurrent neural network (RNN)
based end-to-end acoustic model (AM). To enhance model parameter protection in
a decentralized architecture, an input speech is first up-streamed to a quantum
computing server to extract Mel-spectrogram, and the corresponding
convolutional features are encoded using a quantum circuit algorithm with
random parameters. The encoded features are then down-streamed to the local RNN
model for the final recognition. The proposed decentralized framework takes
advantage of the quantum learning progress to secure models and to avoid
privacy leakage attacks. Testing on the Google Speech Commands Dataset, the
proposed QCNN encoder attains a competitive accuracy of 95.12% in a
decentralized model, which is better than the previous architectures using
centralized RNN models with convolutional features. We also conduct an in-depth
study of different quantum circuit encoder architectures to provide insights
into designing QCNN-based feature extractors. Neural saliency analyses
demonstrate a correlation between the proposed QCNN features, class activation
maps, and input spectrograms. We provide an implementation for future studies.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: New Insights Into the Intricacies of Proneural Gene Regulation in the Embryonic and Adult Cerebral Cortex</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.642016</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Historically, the mammalian brain was thought to lack stem cells as no new neurons were found to be made in adulthood. That dogma changed ∼25 years ago with the identification of neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult rodent forebrain. However, unlike rapidly self-renewing mature tissues (e.g., blood, intestinal crypts, skin), the majority of adult NSCs are quiescent, and those that become ‘activated’ are restricted to a few neurogenic zones that repopulate specific brain regions. Conversely, embryonic NSCs are actively proliferating and neurogenic. Investigations into the molecular control of the quiescence-to-proliferation-to-differentiation continuum in the embryonic and adult brain have identified proneural genes encoding basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors (TFs) as critical regulators. These bHLH TFs initiate genetic programs that remove NSCs from quiescence and drive daughter neural progenitor cells (NPCs) to differentiate into specific neural cell subtypes, thereby contributing to the enormous cellular diversity of the adult brain. However, new insights have revealed that proneural gene activities are context-dependent and tightly regulated. Here we review how proneural bHLH TFs are regulated, with a focus on the murine cerebral cortex, drawing parallels where appropriate to other organisms and neural tissues. We discuss upstream regulatory events, post-translational modifications (phosphorylation, ubiquitinylation), protein–protein interactions, epigenetic and metabolic mechanisms that govern bHLH TF expression, stability, localization, and consequent transactivation of downstream target genes.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Insights Into the Mechanism of Tyrosine Nitration in Preventing β-Amyloid Aggregation in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.619836</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nitration of tyrosine at the tenth residue (Tyr10) in amyloid-β (Aβ) has been reported to reduce its aggregation and neurotoxicity in our previous studies. However, the exact mechanism remains unclear. Here, we used Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; peptide with differently modified forms at Tyr10 to investigate the molecular mechanism to fill this gap. By using immunofluorescent assay, we confirmed that nitrated Aβ was found in the cortex of 10-month-old female triple transgenic mice of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). And then, we used the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) method and circular dichroism (CD) to demonstrate that the modification and mutation of Tyr10 in Aβ have little impact on conformational changes. Then, with the aids of fluorescence assays of thioflavin T and 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and dynamic light scattering (DLS), we found that adding a large group to the phenolic ring of Tyr10 of Aβ could not inhibit Aβ fibrilization and aggregation. Nitration of Aβ reduces its aggregation mainly because it could induce the deprotonation of the phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyr10 of Aβ at physiological pH. We proposed that the negatively charged Tyr10 caused by nitration at physiological pH could interact with the salt bridge between Glu11 and His6 or His13 and block the kink around Tyr10, thereby preventing Aβ fibrilization and aggregation. These findings provide us new insights into the relationship between Tyr10 nitration and Aβ aggregation, which would help to further understand that keeping the balance of nitric oxide in vivo is important for preventing AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Common and Specific Alterations of Amygdala Subregions in Major Depressive Disorder With and Without Anxiety: A Combined Structural and Resting-State Functional MRI Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.634113</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Anxious major depressive disorder is a common subtype of major depressive disorder; however, its unique neural mechanism is not well-understood currently. Using multimodal MRI data, this study examined common and specific alterations of amygdala subregions between patients with and without anxiety. No alterations were observed in the gray matter volume or intra-region functional integration in either patient group. Compared with the controls, both patient groups showed decreased functional connectivity between the left superficial amygdala and the left putamen, and between the right superficial amygdala and the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex and medial orbitofrontal cortex, while only patients with anxiety exhibited decreased activity in the bilateral laterobasal and superficial amygdala. Moreover, the decreased activity correlated negatively with the Hamilton depression scale scores in the patients with anxiety. These findings provided insights into the pathophysiologic processes of anxious major depressive disorder and may help to develop new and effective treatment programs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: “Mickey Mousing” in the Brain: Motion-Sound Synesthesia and the Subcortical Substrate of Audio-Visual Integration</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.605166</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Motion-sound synesthesia is characterized by illusory auditory sensations linked to the pattern and rhythms of motion (dubbed “Mickey Mousing” as in cinema) of visually experienced but soundless object, like an optical flow array, a ball bouncing or a horse galloping. In an MRI study with a group of three synesthetes and a group of eighteen control participants, we found structural changes in the brains of synesthetes in the subcortical multisensory areas of the superior and inferior colliculi. In addition, functional magnetic resonance imaging data showed activity in motion-sensitive regions, as well as temporal and occipital areas, and the cerebellum. However, the synesthetes had a higher activation within the left and right cuneus, with stronger activations when viewing optical flow stimuli. There was also a general difference in connectivity of the colliculi with the above mentioned regions between the two groups. These findings implicate low-level mechanisms within the human neuroaxis as a substrate for local connectivity and cross activity between perceptual processes that are “distant” in terms of cortical topography. The present findings underline the importance of considering the role of subcortical systems and their connectivity to multimodal regions of the cortex and they strengthen a parsimonious account of synesthesia, at the least of the visual-auditory type.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Non-peptide Angiotensin-(1–7) Mimic AVE 0991 Attenuates Delayed Neurocognitive Recovery After Laparotomy by Reducing Neuroinflammation and Restoring Blood-Brain Barrier Integrity in Aged Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.624387</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Delayed neurocognitive recovery (dNCR) after surgery is a common postoperative complication in older adult patients. Our previous studies have demonstrated that cognitive impairment after surgery involves an increase in the brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activity, including overactivation of the angiotensin 2/angiotensin receptor-1 (Ang II/AT1) axis, which provokes the disruption of the hippocampal blood-brain barrier (BBB). Nevertheless, the potential role of the counter-regulatory RAS axis, the Ang-(1–7)/Mas pathway, in dNCR remains unknown. Using an aged rat model of dNCR, we dynamically investigated the activity of both axes of the RAS following laparotomy. AVE 0991, a nonpeptide analog of Ang-(1–7), was administered intranasally immediately after laparotomy. We found that the elevation of Ang II, induced by surgery was accompanied by a decrease of Ang-(1–7) in the hippocampus, but not in the circulation. Surgery also significantly downregulated hippocampal Mas receptor expression at 24 h postsurgery. Mas activation with intranasal AVE 0991 treatment significantly improved hippocampus-dependent learning and memory deficits induced by surgery. Furthermore, it attenuated hippocampal neuroinflammation, as shown by the decreased level of the microglial activation marker cluster of differentiation 11b (CD11b) and the decreased production of several inflammatory molecules. Along with these beneficial effects, the AVE 0991 treatment also alleviated the imbalance between matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP-3), modulated the expression of occludin, and alleviated the IgG extravasation, thereby restoring the integrity of the BBB. In conclusion, these data indicate that activation of Mas by AVE 0991 attenuates dNCR after surgery by reducing neuroinflammation and restoring BBB integrity. Our findings suggest that the Ang-(1–7)/Mas pathway may be a novel therapeutic target for treating dNCR after surgery in older adult patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.624253</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Working memory training (WMT) effects may be modulated by mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subtypes, and variations in APOE-epsilon (APOE-ε) and LMX1A genotypes. Sixty-one individuals (41 men/20 women, mean age 66 years) diagnosed with MCI (31 amnestic/30 non-amnestic) and genotyped for APOE-ε and LMX1A completed 4 weeks/20–25 sessions of WMT. Cognitive functions were assessed before, 4 weeks and 16 weeks after WMT. Except for Processing Speed, the non-amnestic MCI group (naMCI) outperformed the amnestic MCI (aMCI) group in all cognitive domains across all time-points. At 4 weeks, working memory function improved in both groups (p &amp;lt; 0.0001), but at 16 weeks the effects only remained in the naMCI group. Better performance was found after training for the naMCI patients with LMX1A-AA genotype and for the APOE-ε4 carriers. Only the naMCI-APOE-ε4 group showed improved Executive Function at 16 weeks. WMT improved working memory and some non-trained cognitive functions in individuals with MCI. The naMCI group had greater training gain than aMCI group, especially in those with LMX1A-AA genotype and among APOE-ε4-carriers. Further research with larger sample sizes for the subgroups and longer follow-up evaluations is warranted.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Basal Forebrain Atrophy Is Associated With Allocentric Navigation Deficits in Subjective Cognitive Decline</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.596025</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) are at higher risk of incipient Alzheimer's disease (AD). Spatial navigation (SN) impairments in AD dementia and mild cognitive impairment patients have been well-documented; however, studies investigating SN deficits in SCD subjects are still lacking. This study aimed to explore whether basal forebrain (BF) and entorhinal cortex (EC) atrophy contribute to spatial disorientation in the SCD stage. In total, 31 SCD subjects and 24 normal controls were enrolled and administered cognitive scales, a 2-dimensional computerized SN test, and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning. We computed the differences in navigation distance errors and volumes of BF subfields, EC, and hippocampus between the SCD and control groups. The correlations between MRI volumetry and navigation distance errors were also calculated. Compared with the controls, the SCD subjects performed worse in both egocentric and allocentric navigation. The SCD group showed volume reductions in the whole BF (p &amp;lt; 0.05, uncorrected) and the Ch4p subfield (p &amp;lt; 0.05, Bonferroni corrected), but comparable EC and hippocampal volumes with the controls. In the SCD cohort, the allocentric errors were negatively correlated with total BF (r = −0.625, p &amp;lt; 0.001), Ch4p (r = −0.625, p &amp;lt; 0.001), total EC (r = −0.423, p = 0.031), and left EC volumes (r = −0.442, p = 0.024), adjusting for age, gender, years of education, total intracranial volume, and hippocampal volume. This study demonstrates that SN deficits and BF atrophy may be promising indicators for the early detection of incipient AD patients. The reduced BF volume, especially in the Ch4p subfield, may serve as a structural basis for allocentric disorientation in SCD subjects independent of hippocampal atrophy. Our findings may have further implications for the preclinical diagnosis and intervention for potential AD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.602191</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tai Chi Chuan (TCC) exercise has been shown to improve cognitive task-switching performance in older adults, but the extent of this positive effect varies among individuals. Past research also shows that brain white matter integrity could predict behavioral gains of cognitive and motor learning. Therefore, in this randomized controlled trial (NCT02270320), we examined whether baseline integrity of three target white matter tract groups was predictive of task-switching improvement after 12-week TCC training in middle-aged and older adults. Thirty-eight eligible participants were randomly assigned to a TCC group (n = 19) and a control group (n = 19). Cognitive task-switching and physical performances were collected before and after training. Brain diffusion spectrum MR images were acquired before training and the general fractional anisotropy (GFA) of each target white matter tract group was calculated to indicate baseline white matter integrity of that group. Correlation and regression analyses between these GFAs and post-training task-switching improvement were analyzed using adjusted p-values. After 12 weeks, significant task-switching and physical performance improvements were found only in the TCC group. Moreover, higher baseline GFA of the prefronto-striato-thalamo-prefrontal loop fibers (r = −0.63, p = 0.009), but not of the prefronto-parietal/occipital (r = −0.55, p = 0.026) and callosal (r = −0.35, p = 0.189) fiber groups, was associated with greater reductions of task-switching errors after the TCC training. Multiple regression analysis revealed that baseline GFA of the prefronto-striato-thalamo-prefrontal loop fibers was the only independent white matter integrity predictor of task-switching error reductions after TCC training (β = −0.620, adjusted R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; change = 0.265, p = 0.009). These findings not only highlight the important role of baseline integrity of the prefronto-striatal circuits in influencing the extent of positive cognitive task-switching effects from short-term TCC training, but also implicate that preserving good white matter integrity in the aging process may be crucial in order to gain the best cognitive effects of exercise interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64444</link>
	<content:encoded>The canonical Wnt pathway transcriptional co-activator β-catenin regulates self-renewal and differentiation of mammalian nephron progenitor cells (NPCs). We modulated β-catenin levels in NPC cultures using the GSK3 inhibitor CHIR9902 (CHIR) to examine opposing developmental actions of β-catenin. Low CHIR-mediated maintenance and expansion of NPCs is independent of direct engagement of TCF/LEF/β-catenin transcriptional complexes at low CHIR-dependent cell-cycle targets. In contrast, in high CHIR, TCF7/LEF1/β-catenin complexes replaced TCF7L1/TCF7L2 binding on enhancers of differentiation-promoting target genes. Chromosome confirmation studies showed pre-established promoter-enhancer connections to these target genes in NPCs. High CHIR-associated &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; looping was observed in positive transcriptional feedback regulation to the canonical Wnt pathway. Thus, β-catenin's direct transcriptional role is restricted to the induction of NPCs where rising β-catenin levels switch inhibitory TCF7L1/TCF7L2 complexes to activating LEF1/TCF7 complexes at primed gene targets poised for rapid initiation of a nephrogenic program.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64395</link>
	<content:encoded>Communications between actin filaments and integrin-mediated focal adhesion (FA) are crucial for cell adhesion and migration. As a core platform to organize FA proteins, the tripartite ILK/PINCH/Parvin (IPP) complex interacts with actin filaments to regulate the cytoskeleton-FA crosstalk. Rsu1, a Ras suppressor, is enriched in FA through PINCH1 and plays important roles in regulating F-actin structures. Here, we solved crystal structures of the Rsu1/PINCH1 complex, in which the Leucine-Rich-Repeats of Rsu1 form a solenoid structure to tightly associate with the C-terminal region of PINCH1. Further structural analysis uncovered that the interaction between Rsu1 and PINCH1 blocks the IPP-mediated F-actin bundling by disrupting the binding of PINCH1 to actin. Consistently, overexpressing Rsu1 in HeLa cells impairs stress fiber formation and cell spreading. Together, our findings demonstrated that Rsu1 is critical for tuning the communication between F-actin and FA by interacting with the IPP complex and negatively modulating the F-actin bundling.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>In a traditional view, in social cognition, attention is equated with gaze and people track other people’s attention by tracking their gaze. Here, we used fMRI to test whether the brain represents attention in a richer manner. People read stories describing an agent (either oneself or someone else) directing attention to an object in one of two ways: either internally directed (endogenous) or externally induced (exogenous). We used multivoxel pattern analysis to examine how brain areas within the theory-of-mind network encoded attention type and agent type. Brain activity patterns in the left temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) showed significant decoding of information about endogenous versus exogenous attention. The left TPJ, left superior temporal sulcus (STS), precuneus, and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) significantly decoded agent type (self versus other). These findings show that the brain constructs a rich model of one’s own and others’ attentional state, possibly aiding theory of mind.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The Parkinson's disease protein α-synuclein (aSyn) promotes membrane fusion and fission by interacting with various negatively charged phospholipids. Despite postulated roles in endocytosis and exocytosis, plasma membrane (PM) interactions of αSyn are poorly understood. Here, we show that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), two highly acidic components of inner PM leaflets, mediate plasma membrane localization of endogenous pools of αSyn in A2780, HeLa, SK-MEL-2 and differentiated and undifferentiated neuronal SH-SY5Y cells. We demonstrate that αSyn binds to reconstituted PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-membranes in a helical conformation &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and that PIP&lt;sub&gt;2 &lt;/sub&gt;synthesizing&lt;sub&gt; &lt;/sub&gt;kinases and hydrolyzing phosphatases reversibly redistribute αSyn in cells.

	<content:encoded>Cholinergic fast time-scale modulation of cortical physiology is critical for cognition, but direct local measurement of neuromodulators &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt;is challenging. Choline oxidase (ChOx)-based electrochemical biosensors have been used to capture fast cholinergic signals in behaving animals. However, these transients might be biased by local field potential and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-evoked enzymatic responses. Using a novel Tetrode-based Amperometric ChOx (TACO) sensor we performed highly sensitive and selective simultaneous measurement of ChOx activity (COA) and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

This mechanism accounts for most of COA transients in the hippocampus, including those following locomotion bouts and sharp-wave/ripples Our results suggest that it is unfeasible to probe phasic cholinergic signals under most behavioral paradigms with current ChOx biosensors&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; This confound is generalizable to any oxidase-based biosensor, entailing rigorous controls and new biosensor designs.</content:encoded>

Without rewiring its anatomical connectivity, how can a motor neuron dynamically switch roles to play appropriate roles in various behaviors? We previously used voltage-sensitive dye imaging to record from DE-3 and most other neurons in the leech segmental ganglion during (fictive) swimming, crawling, and local-bend escape (Tomina and Wagenaar, 2017). Here, we repeated that experiment, then re-imaged the same ganglion using serial blockface electron microscopy and traced DE-3's processes. Further, we traced back the processes of DE-3's presynaptic partners to their respective somata. This allowed us to analyze the relationship between circuit anatomy and the activity patterns it sustains. We found that input synapses important for all of the behaviors were widely distributed over DE-3's branches, yet that functional clusters were different during (fictive) swimming vs. crawling.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Common X‐chromosome variants are associated with Parkinson's disease risk</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26051?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Identify genetic variants on the X‐chromosome associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) risk.


Methods
We performed an X‐chromosome‐wide association study (XWAS) of PD risk by meta‐analyzing results from sex‐stratified analyses. To avoid spurious associations, we designed a specific harmonization pipeline for the X‐chromosome and focused on a European ancestry sample. We included 11,142 cases, 280,164 controls, and 5,379 proxy cases, based on parental history of PD. Additionally, we tested the association of significant variants with: (i) PD risk in an independent replication with 1,561 cases and 2,465 controls, and (ii) putamen volume in 33,360 individuals from the UK Biobank.


Results
In the discovery meta‐analysis, we identified: rs7066890 (OR=1.10 [1.06‐1.14]; P=2.2x10‐9) intron of GPM6B, and rs28602900 (OR=1.10 [1.07‐1.14]; P=1.6x10‐8) in a high gene density region including RPL10, ATP6A1, FAM50A, PLXNA3. The rs28602900 association with PD was replicated (OR=1.16 [1.03‐1.30]; P=0.016) and shown to colocalize with a significant expression quantitative locus (eQTL) regulating RPL10 expression in the putamen and other brain tissues in GTEx. Additionally, the rs28602900 locus was found to be associated with reduced brain putamen volume. No results reached genome‐wide significance in the sex‐stratified analyses.


Interpretation
We report the first XWAS of PD and identify two genome‐wide significant loci. The rs28602900 association replicated in an independent PD dataset and showed concordant effects in its association with putamen volume. Critically, rs26802900 is a significant eQTL of RPL10.These results support a role for ribosomal proteins in PD pathogenesis and show that the X‐chromosome contributes to PD genetic risk.

Its identity was confirmed by recombinant‐protein western blot, ELISA and cell based assay. Autoantibody specificity was confirmed by analyzing assorted control sera/CSF.


Results
Leucine zipper 4 (LUZP4)‐IgG was detected in 28 patients’ sera, 26 of whom (93%) were men. The median age at neurological symptom onset was 45 years (range 28‐84). Median titer (ELISA) was 1:300 (1:50 to &amp;gt;1:6400; normal value &amp;lt;1:50). Co‐existent Kelch‐like protein 11‐IgG was identified in 18 cases (64%). The most common presenting phenotype was rhombencephalitis (17/28; 61%). Other presentations included limbic encephalitis (n=5, 18%), seizures and/or encephalitis (n=2, 7%) and motor neuronopathy/polyradiculopathy (n=4, 14%). The most common malignancy among cancer‐evaluated PNS patients was seminoma (21/27; 78%). Nine of the 21 seminomas detected by whole‐body FDG‐PET scan (43%) were extra‐testicular. Both female patients had ovarian teratoma. Regressed testicular germ‐cell tumors were found in four patients. Exposure of T‐cell‐dendritic‐cell co‐cultures from chronic immunosuppression naïve LUZP4‐IgG‐seropositive patients to recombinant LUZP4 protein evoked a marked increase in CD69‐expression on both CD4+ and CD8+ T‐cells when compared to vehicle‐exposed and healthy control cultures.


Interpretation
LUZP4‐IgG represents a novel serological biomarker of PNS and has high predictive value for germ‐cell tumors. The demonstrated antigen‐specific T‐cell responses support a CD8+T‐cell‐mediated cytotoxic paraneoplastic and anti‐tumor potential.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: The onset of preclinical Alzheimer's disease in monozygotic twins</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26048?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
To study the genetic contribution to the start of Alzheimer's disease with amyloid and tau biomarkers in cognitively intact older identical twins.


Methods
We studied in 96 monozygotic twin‐pairs relationships between Aβ aggregation as measured by the ratio Aβ1‐42/1‐40 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, n=126) and positron emission tomography (PET, n=194), and CSF markers for Aβ production (BACE1, Aβ1‐40 and 1‐38) and CSF tau. Associations amongst markers were tested with Generalized Estimating Equations including a random effect for twin status, adjusted for age, gender, and APOE ε4 genotype. We used twin analyses to determine relative contributions of genetic and/or environmental factors to AD pathophysiological processes.


Results
Twenty‐seven individuals (14%) had an abnormal amyloid‐PET, and 14 twin‐pairs (15%) showed discordant amyloid‐PET scans. Within twin‐pairs, Aβ production markers and total‐tau (t‐tau) levels strongly correlated (r range 0.73, 0.86; all p&amp;lt;0.0001), and Aβ aggregation markers and 181‐phosphorylated‐tau (p‐tau) levels correlated moderately strong (r range 0.50, 0.64; all p&amp;lt;0.0001). Cross‐twin cross‐trait analysis showed that Aβ1‐38 in one twin correlated with Aβ1‐42/1‐40 ratios, t‐tau and p‐tau levels in their co‐twins (r range ‐0.28, 0.58; all p&amp;lt;.007). Within‐pair differences in Aβ production markers related to differences in tau levels (r range 0.49, 0.61; all p&amp;lt;0.0001). Twin discordance analyses suggest that Aβ production and tau levels show coordinated increases in very early AD.


Interpretation
Our results suggest a substantial genetic/shared environmental background contributes to both Aβ and tau increases, suggesting that modulation of environmental risk factors may aid in delaying the onset of AD pathophysiological processes.

	<content:encoded>Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a severe neuropsychiatric complication of live cirrhosis. We identified the typical patterns of increased regional activity in the fronto‐striato‐cerebellar network and decreased activity in the visuo‐sensorimotor network and cingulate gyrus in HE patient.

Abstract
Neuropsychiatric deficits are common in patients with liver cirrhosis (LC), especially in those with hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Previous studies reveal abnormalities in brain activity underlying the neuropsychiatric deficits in LC patients; however, the results are inconsistent. We conducted a meta‐analysis of resting‐state functional magnetic resonance imaging studies using anisotropic effect‐size signed differential mapping software on LC patients to characterize the most consistent regional activity alterations, and to evaluate the potential effect of liver transplantation (LT) on brain function. Meta‐regression analyses were performed to explore the relationship between brain alterations and clinical variables. Compared with healthy controls, the typical patterns of increased regional activity in the fronto‐striato‐cerebellar network and decreased activity in the visuo‐sensorimotor network and cingulate gyrus were identified in LC patients, which remained significant in the subgroup meta‐analyses of minimal HE (MHE) and overt HE (OHE) patients. Functional deficits in the default mode network (DMN) were found in OHE patients compared with MHE patients. Ammonia level positively correlated with brain activity in the right middle temporal gyrus, and the completion time of number connection test A negatively correlated with brain activity in the left anterior cingulate gyrus. In addition, patients showed increased activity in the visuo‐sensorimotor network and precuneus after LT. Our study suggests that alterations in the fronto‐striato‐cerebellar and visuo‐sensorimotor networks may be the potential pathophysiological mechanisms underlying HE, and deficits in the DMN may indicate the progression of HE. LT may improve brain function in the visuo‐sensorimotor network. This study has registered in the PROSPERO (CRD42020212758).</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: The beneficial role of the synthetic microneurotrophin BNN20 in a focal demyelination model</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24809?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>This study provides data showing the beneficial role of BNN20 during demyelination. Our results showed that BNN20 increases the number of mature OLs in the lesion site of the LPC‐induced demyelination mouse model, while it reduces astrocytic accumulation, leading to a faster remyelination process. It does not significantly alter OPC recruitment or microglia/macrophages accumulation. Furthermore, our in vitro studies showed that BNN20 acts directly on OLs by enhancing their maturation. In addition, BNN20 treatment increased the number of LPC‐treated mature OLs and this beneficial effect was TrkA‐dependent. Moreover, BNN20 reduces microglial activation and their transition to the pro‐inflammatory state upon LPS stimulation in vitro. In conclusion, our results indicate that BNN20 is a multifaceted agent against demyelinating conditions by being able to affect all glial populations.

Abstract
BNN20, a C17‐spiroepoxy derivative of the neurosteroid dehydroepiandrosterone, has been shown to exhibit strong neuroprotective properties but its role in glial populations has not been assessed. Our aim was to investigate the effect of BNN20 on glial populations by using in vitro and in vivo approaches, taking advantage of the well‐established lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)‐induced focal demyelination mouse model. Our in vivo studies, performed in male mice, showed that BNN20 treatment leads to an increased number of mature oligodendrocytes (OLs) in this model. It diminishes astrocytic accumulation during the demyelination phase leading to a faster remyelination process, while it does not affect oligodendrocyte precursor cell recruitment or microglia/macrophage accumulation. Additionally, our in vitro studies showed that BNN20 acts directly to OLs and enhances their maturation even after they were treated with LPC. This beneficial effect of BNN20 is mediated, primarily, through the neurotrophin receptor TrkA. In addition, BNN20 reduces microglial activation and their transition to their pro‐inflammatory state upon lipopolysaccharides stimulation in vitro. Taken together our results suggest that BNN20 could serve as an important molecule to develop blood–brain barrier‐permeable synthetic agonists of neurotrophin receptors that could reduce inflammation, protect and increase the number of functional OLs by promoting their differentiation/maturation.</content:encoded>

This review summarizes how these systems are now being used to study disease processes from synaptic transmission to BBB breakdown, opening up new possibilities to model neurological diseases using human cells.

Abstract
Neurological disorders are the leading cause of disability and the second largest cause of death worldwide. Despite significant research efforts, neurology remains one of the most failure‐prone areas of drug development. The complexity of the human brain, boundaries to examining the brain directly in vivo, and the significant evolutionary gap between animal models and humans, all serve to hamper translational success. Recent advances in microfluidic in vitro models have provided new opportunities to study human cells with enhanced physiological relevance. The ability to precisely micro‐engineer cell‐scale architecture, tailoring form and function, has allowed for detailed dissection of cell biology using microphysiological systems (MPS) of varying complexities from single cell systems to “Organ‐on‐chip” models. Simplified neuronal networks have allowed for unique insights into neuronal transport and neurogenesis, while more complex 3D heterotypic cellular models such as neurovascular unit mimetics and “Organ‐on‐chip” systems have enabled new understanding of metabolic coupling and blood–brain barrier transport. These systems are now being developed beyond MPS toward disease specific micro‐pathophysiological systems, moving from “Organ‐on‐chip” to “Disease‐on‐chip.” This review gives an outline of current state of the art in microfluidic technologies for neurological disease research, discussing the challenges and limitations while highlighting the benefits and potential of integrating technologies. We provide examples of where such toolsets have enabled novel insights and how these technologies may empower future investigation into neurological diseases.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Sodium salicylate enhances neural excitation via reducing GABAergic transmission in the dentate gyrus area of rat hippocampus in vivo</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23312?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Sodium salicylate, one of the non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, is widely prescribed in the clinic, but a high dose of usage can cause hyperactivity in the central nervous system, including the hippocampus. At present, the neural mechanism underlying the induced hyperactivity is not fully understood, in particular, in the hippocampus under an in vivo condition. In this study, we found that systemic administration of sodium salicylate increased the field excitatory postsynaptic potential slope and the population spike amplitude in a dose‐dependent manner in the hippocampal dentate gyrus area of rats with in vivo field potential extracellular recordings, which indicates that sodium salicylate enhances basal synaptic transmission and neural excitation. In the presence of picrotoxin, a GABA‐A receptor antagonist, sodium salicylate failed to increase the initial slope of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential and the amplitude of the population spike in vivo. To further explore how sodium salicylate enhances the neural excitation, we made whole‐cell patch‐clamp recordings from hippocampal slices. We found that perfusion of the slice with sodium salicylate decreased electrically evoked GABA receptor‐mediated currents, increased paired‐pulse ratio, and lowered frequency and amplitude of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents. Together, these results demonstrate that sodium salicylate enhances the neural excitation through suppressing GABAergic synaptic transmission in presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms in the hippocampal dentate gyrus area. Our findings may help understand the side effects caused by sodium salicylate in the central nervous system.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Organization of Radial Glia Reveals Growth Pattern in the Telencephalon of a Percomorph Fish Astatotilapia burtoni</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25126?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>The orientation of radial glia in the dorsal telencephalon of teleost fish follows a morphogenetic process called eversion. We studied the radial glia in the cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni and found that glial processes get increasingly displaced by central pallial areas during growth. New cells are added to the growing brain subventricularly consistent with a stacking growth pattern (Cell Addition I). In addition, our data suggest that radial glial cells give rise to migrating astroglial cells providing new neurons and glia to deeper pallial regions (Cell Addition II).







Abstract
In the brain of teleost fish, radial glial cells are the main astroglial cell type. To understand how radial glia structures are adapting to continuous growth of the brain, we studied the astroglial cells in the telencephalon of the cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni in small fry to large specimens. These animals grow to a standard length of 10–12 cm in this fish species, corresponding to a more than 100‐fold increase in brain volume. Focusing on the telencephalon where glial cells are arranged radially in the everted (dorsal) pallium, immunocytochemistry for glial markers revealed an aberrant pattern of radial glial fibers in the central division of the dorsal pallium (DC, i.e. DC4 and DC5). The main glial processes curved around these nuclei, especially in the posterior part of the telencephalon. This was verified in tissue‐cleared brains stained for glial markers. We further analyzed the growth of radial glia by immunocytochemically applied stem cell (PCNA, Sox2) and differentiation marker (doublecortin), and found that these markers were expressed at the ventricular surface consistent with a stacking growth pattern. In addition, we detected doublecortin and Sox2 positive cells in deeper nuclei of DC areas. Our data suggest that radial glial cells give rise to migrating cells providing new neurons and glia to deeper pallial regions. This results in expansion of the central pallial areas and displacement of existing radial glial. In summary we show that radial glial cells can adapt to morphological growth processes in the adult fish brain, and contribute to this growth.

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: The intrinsically disordered N-terminus of the voltage-dependent anion channel</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/Vq74hJpoero/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Jordane Preto, Isabelle Krimm&lt;/p&gt;

The voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) is a critical β-barrel membrane protein of the mitochondrial outer membrane, which regulates the transport of ions and ATP between mitochondria and the cytoplasm. In addition, VDAC plays a central role in the control of apoptosis and is therefore of great interest in both cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Although not fully understood, it is presumed that the gating mechanism of VDAC is governed by its N-terminal region which, in the open state of the channel, exhibits an α-helical structure positioned midway inside the pore and strongly interacting with the β-barrel wall. In the present work, we performed molecular simulations with a recently developed force field for disordered systems to shed new light on known experimental results, showing that the N-terminus of VDAC is an intrinsically disordered region (IDR). First, simulation of the N-terminal segment as a free peptide highlighted its disordered nature and the importance of using an IDR-specific force field to properly sample its conformational landscape. Secondly, accelerated dynamics simulation of a double cysteine VDAC mutant under applied voltage revealed metastable low conducting states of the channel representative of closed states observed experimentally. Related structures were characterized by partial unfolding and rearrangement of the N-terminal tail, that led to steric hindrance of the pore. Our results indicate that the disordered properties of the N-terminus are crucial to properly account for the gating mechanism of VDAC.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Vq74hJpoero&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

In this work, we introduce an entirely data-driven and automated approach to reveal disease-associated biomarker and risk factor networks from heterogeneous and high-dimensional healthcare data. Our workflow is based on Bayesian networks, which are a popular tool for analyzing the interplay of biomarkers. Usually, data require extensive manual preprocessing and dimension reduction to allow for effective learning of Bayesian networks. For heterogeneous data, this preprocessing is hard to automatize and typically requires domain-specific prior knowledge. We here combine Bayesian network learning with hierarchical variable clustering in order to detect groups of similar features and learn interactions between them entirely automated. We present an optimization algorithm for the adaptive refinement of such group Bayesian networks to account for a specific target variable, like a disease. The combination of Bayesian networks, clustering, and refinement yields low-dimensional but disease-specific interaction networks. These networks provide easily interpretable, yet accurate models of biomarker interdependencies. We test our method extensively on simulated data, as well as on data from the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP-TREND), and demonstrate its effectiveness using non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and hypertension as examples. We show that the group network models outperform available biomarker scores, while at the same time, they provide an easily interpretable interaction network.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jkNdrJc6Bg4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Intratumour heterogeneity is increasingly recognized as a frequent problem for cancer treatment as it allows for the evolution of resistance against treatment. While cancer genotyping becomes more and more established and allows to determine the genetic heterogeneity, less is known about the phenotypic heterogeneity among cancer cells. We investigate how phenotypic differences can impact the efficiency of therapy options that select on this diversity, compared to therapy options that are independent of the phenotype. We employ the ecological concept of trait distributions and characterize the cancer cell population as a collection of subpopulations that differ in their growth rate. We show in a deterministic model that growth rate-dependent treatment types alter the trait distribution of the cell population, resulting in a delayed relapse compared to a growth rate-independent treatment. Whether the cancer cell population goes extinct or relapse occurs is determined by stochastic dynamics, which we investigate using a stochastic model. Again, we find that relapse is delayed for the growth rate-dependent treatment type, albeit an increased relapse probability, suggesting that slowly growing subpopulations are shielded from extinction. Sequential application of growth rate-dependent and growth rate-independent treatment types can largely increase treatment efficiency and delay relapse. Interestingly, even longer intervals between decisions to change the treatment type may achieve close-to-optimal efficiencies and relapse times. Monitoring patients at regular check-ups may thus provide the temporally resolved guidance to tailor treatments to the changing cancer cell trait distribution and allow clinicians to cope with this dynamic heterogeneity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aYkw248ZmSs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Drug combinations have demonstrated great potential in cancer treatments. They alleviate drug resistance and improve therapeutic efficacy. The fast-growing number of anti-cancer drugs has caused the experimental investigation of all drug combinations to become costly and time-consuming. Computational techniques can improve the efficiency of drug combination screening. Despite recent advances in applying machine learning to synergistic drug combination prediction, several challenges remain. First, the performance of existing methods is suboptimal. There is still much space for improvement. Second, biological knowledge has not been fully incorporated into the model. Finally, many models are lack interpretability, limiting their clinical applications. To address these challenges, we have developed a knowledge-enabled and self-attention transformer boosted deep learning model, TranSynergy, which improves the performance and interpretability of synergistic drug combination prediction. TranSynergy is designed so that the cellular effect of drug actions can be explicitly modeled through cell-line gene dependency, gene-gene interaction, and genome-wide drug-target interaction. A novel Shapley Additive Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (SA-GSEA) method has been developed to deconvolute genes that contribute to the synergistic drug combination and improve model interpretability. Extensive benchmark studies demonstrate that TranSynergy outperforms the state-of-the-art method, suggesting the potential of mechanism-driven machine learning. Novel pathways that are associated with the synergistic combinations are revealed and supported by experimental evidence. They may provide new insights into identifying biomarkers for precision medicine and discovering new anti-cancer therapies. Several new synergistic drug combinations have been predicted with high confidence for ovarian cancer which has few treatment options.

For practical reasons, many forecasts of case, hospitalization, and death counts in the context of the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are issued in the form of central predictive intervals at various levels. This is also the case for the forecasts collected in the &lt;i&gt;COVID-19 Forecast Hub&lt;/i&gt; (https://covid19forecasthub.org/). Forecast evaluation metrics like the logarithmic score, which has been applied in several infectious disease forecasting challenges, are then not available as they require full predictive distributions. This article provides an overview of how established methods for the evaluation of quantile and interval forecasts can be applied to epidemic forecasts in this format. Specifically, we discuss the computation and interpretation of the weighted interval score, which is a proper score that approximates the continuous ranked probability score. It can be interpreted as a generalization of the absolute error to probabilistic forecasts and allows for a decomposition into a measure of sharpness and penalties for over- and underprediction.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/W7lxFydOLE0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

We present OpenAWSEM and Open3SPN2, new cross-compatible implementations of coarse-grained models for protein (AWSEM) and DNA (3SPN2) molecular dynamics simulations within the OpenMM framework. These new implementations retain the chemical accuracy and intrinsic efficiency of the original models while adding GPU acceleration and the ease of forcefield modification provided by OpenMM’s Custom Forces software framework. By utilizing GPUs, we achieve around a 30-fold speedup in protein and protein-DNA simulations over the existing LAMMPS-based implementations running on a single CPU core. We showcase the benefits of OpenMM’s Custom Forces framework by devising and implementing two new potentials that allow us to address important aspects of protein folding and structure prediction and by testing the ability of the combined OpenAWSEM and Open3SPN2 to model protein-DNA binding. The first potential is used to describe the changes in effective interactions that occur as a protein becomes partially buried in a membrane. We also introduced an interaction to describe proteins with multiple disulfide bonds. Using simple pairwise disulfide bonding terms results in unphysical clustering of cysteine residues, posing a problem when simulating the folding of proteins with many cysteines. We now can computationally reproduce Anfinsen’s early Nobel prize winning experiments by using OpenMM’s Custom Forces framework to introduce a multi-body disulfide bonding term that prevents unphysical clustering. Our protein-DNA simulations show that the binding landscape is funneled towards structures that are quite similar to those found using experiments. In summary, this paper provides a simulation tool for the molecular biophysics community that is both easy to use and sufficiently efficient to simulate large proteins and large protein-DNA systems that are central to many cellular processes. These codes should facilitate the interplay between molecular simulations and cellular studies, which have been hampered by the large mismatch between the time and length scales accessible to molecular simulations and those relevant to cell biology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LCxJndAzN8w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Investigating the representation of uncertainty in neuronal circuits</title>

Skilled behavior often displays signatures of Bayesian inference. In order for the brain to implement the required computations, neuronal activity must carry accurate information about the uncertainty of sensory inputs. Two major approaches have been proposed to study neuronal representations of uncertainty. The first one, the Bayesian decoding approach, aims primarily at decoding the posterior probability distribution of the stimulus from population activity using Bayes’ rule, and indirectly yields uncertainty estimates as a by-product. The second one, which we call the correlational approach, searches for specific features of neuronal activity (such as tuning-curve width and maximum firing-rate) which correlate with uncertainty. To compare these two approaches, we derived a new normative model of sound source localization by Interaural Time Difference (ITD), that reproduces a wealth of behavioral and neural observations. We found that several features of neuronal activity correlated with uncertainty on average, but none provided an accurate estimate of uncertainty on a trial-by-trial basis, indicating that the correlational approach may not reliably identify which aspects of neuronal responses represent uncertainty. In contrast, the Bayesian decoding approach reveals that the activity pattern of the entire population was required to reconstruct the trial-to-trial posterior distribution with Bayes’ rule. These results suggest that uncertainty is unlikely to be represented in a single feature of neuronal activity, and highlight the importance of using a Bayesian decoding approach when exploring the neural basis of uncertainty.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tRxROqEkr3o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Unsupervised manifold learning of collective behavior</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/Y2ws0d9jEAE/article</link>

Collective behavior is an emergent property of numerous complex systems, from financial markets to cancer cells to predator-prey ecological systems. Characterizing modes of collective behavior is often done through human observation, training generative models, or other supervised learning techniques. Each of these cases requires knowledge of and a method for characterizing the macro-state(s) of the system. This presents a challenge for studying novel systems where there may be little prior knowledge. Here, we present a new unsupervised method of detecting emergent behavior in complex systems, and discerning between distinct collective behaviors. We require only metrics, &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt;, defined on the set of agents, &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;, which measure agents’ nearness in variables of interest. We apply the method of diffusion maps to the systems (&lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(i)&lt;/sup&gt;) to recover efficient embeddings of their interaction networks. Comparing these geometries, we formulate a measure of similarity between two networks, called the map alignment statistic (MAS). A large MAS is evidence that the two networks are codetermined in some fashion, indicating an emergent relationship between the metrics &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt;. Additionally, the form of the macro-scale organization is encoded in the covariances among the two sets of diffusion map components. Using these covariances we discern between different modes of collective behavior in a data-driven, unsupervised manner. This method is demonstrated on a synthetic flocking model as well as empirical fish schooling data. We show that our state classification subdivides the known behaviors of the school in a meaningful manner, leading to a finer description of the system’s behavior.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Y2ws0d9jEAE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Conservation and dimorphism in androgen receptor distribution in Alston's singing mouse (Scotinomys teguina)</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25108?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>We used immunohistochemistry to qualitatively and quantitatively characterize the nuclear androgen receptor (AR) in the brain of the Alston's singing mouse (Scotinomys teguina).







Abstract
Because of their roles in courtship and intrasexual competition, sexual displays are often sexually dimorphic, but we know little about the mechanisms that produce such dimorphism. Among mammals, one example is the vocalization of Alston's singing mouse (Scotinomys teguina), which consists of a series of rapidly repeated, frequency‐modulated notes. The rate and duration of songs is sexually dimorphic and androgen responsive. To understand the neuronal mechanisms underlying this sexual dimorphism, we map the sites of androgen sensitivity throughout the brain, focusing analysis along a pathway that spans from limbic structures to vocal motor regions. We find widespread expression of AR immunoreactivity (AR‐ir) throughout limbic structures important for social behavior and vocalization, including the lateral septum, extended amygdala, preoptic area and hypothalamus. We also find extensive AR staining along previously documented vocal motor pathways, including the periaqueductal gray, parabrachial nucleus, and nucleus ambiguus, the last of which innervates intrinsic laryngeal muscles. Lastly, AR‐ir is also evident in sensory areas such as the medial geniculate, inferior, and superior colliculi. A quantitative analysis revealed that males exhibited more AR‐ir than females, a pattern that was most pronounced in the hypothalamus. Despite the elaboration of vocalization in singing mice, comparison with prior literature suggests that the broad pattern of AR‐ir may be conserved across a wide range of rodents. Together these data identify brain nuclei well positioned to shape the sexually dimorphic vocalization of S. teguina and suggest that such androgen modulation of vocalization is evolutionary conserved among rodents.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Development of Parvalbumin Neurons and Perineuronal Nets in the Visual Cortex of Normal and Dark Exposed Cats</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25127?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>At the peak of the critical period, immersion into complete darkness for 10 days significantly reduces the number of perineuronal nets (PNN) in the primary visual cortex of cats but does not alter the number of parvalbumin (PV) cells that they usually surround. Further, darkness reduces the size of PV cells even if they are surrounded by a PNN, indicating that PNNs do not inhibit all forms of neural plasticity.







Abstract
During development the visual system maintains a high capacity for modification by expressing characteristics permissive for plasticity, enabling neural circuits to be refined by visual experience to achieve their mature form. This period is followed by the emergence of characteristics that stabilize the brain to consolidate for a lifetime connections that were informed by experience. Attenuation of plasticity potential is thought to derive from an accumulation of plasticity‐inhibiting characteristics that appear at ages beyond the peak of plasticity. Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are molecular aggregations that primarily surround fast‐spiking inhibitory neurons called parvalbumin (PV) cells, which exhibit properties congruent with a plasticity inhibitor. In this study we examined the development of PNNs and PV cells in the primary visual cortex of a highly visual mammal, and assessed the impact that 10 days of darkness had on both characteristics. Here we show that labeling for PV expression emerges earlier and reaches adult levels sooner than PNNs. We also demonstrate that darkness, a condition known to enhance plasticity, significantly reduces the density of PNNs and the size of PV cell somata but does not alter the number of PV cells in visual cortex. The darkness‐induced reduction of PV cell size occurred irrespective of whether neurons were surrounded by a PNN, suggesting that PNNs have a restricted capacity to inhibit plasticity. Finally, we show that PV cells surrounded by a PNN were significantly larger than those without one, supporting the view that PNNs may mediate trophic support to the cells they surround.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Assessing Dysferlinopathy Patients Over Three Years With A New Motor Scale</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26044?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Dysferlinopathy is a muscular dystrophy with a highly variable clinical presentation and currently unpredictable progression. This variability and unpredictability presents difficulties for prognostication and clinical trial design. The Jain Clinical Outcomes Study of Dysferlinopathy aims to establish the validity of the North Star Assessment for Limb Girdle Type Muscular Dystrophies (NSAD) scale and identify factors that influence the rate of disease progression using NSAD.


Methods
We collected a longitudinal series of functional assessments from 187 dysferlinopathy patients over three years. Rasch analysis was used to develop the NSAD, a motor performance scale suitable for ambulant and non‐ambulant patients. Generalized estimating equations were used to evaluate the impact of patient factors on outcome trajectories.


Results
The NSAD detected significant change in clinical progression over 1 year. The steepest functional decline occurred during the first 10 years after symptom onset, with more rapid decline noted in patients who developed symptoms at a younger age (p = 0.04). The most rapidly deteriorating group over the study was patients 3–8 years post symptom onset at baseline.


Interpretation
The NSAD is the first validated limb girdle specific scale of motor performance, suitable for use in clinics practice and clinical trials. Longitudinal analysis showed it may be possible to identify patient factors associated with greater functional decline both across the disease course and in the short‐term for clinical trial preparation. Through further work and validation in this cohort, we anticipate that a disease model incorporating functional performance will allow for more accurate prognosis for patients with dysferlinopathy.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data makes studying the development of
cells possible at unparalleled resolution. Given that many cellular
differentiation processes are hierarchical, their scRNA-seq data is expected to
be approximately tree-shaped in gene expression space. Inference and
representation of this tree-structure in two dimensions is highly desirable for
biological interpretation and exploratory analysis. Our two contributions are
an approach for identifying a meaningful tree structure from high-dimensional
scRNA-seq data, and a visualization method respecting the tree-structure. We
extract the tree structure by means of a density based minimum spanning tree on
a vector quantization of the data and show that it captures biological
information well. We then introduce DTAE, a tree-biased autoencoder that
emphasizes the tree structure of the data in low dimensional space. We compare
to other dimension reduction methods and demonstrate the success of our method
experimentally. Our implementation relying on PyTorch and Higra is available at
github.com/hci-unihd/DTAE.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Combinatorial Optimization: Covering Salesman Problems. (arXiv:2102.05875v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05875</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This paper introduces a new deep learning approach to approximately solve the
Covering Salesman Problem (CSP). In this approach, given the city locations of
a CSP as input, a deep neural network model is designed to directly output the
solution. It is trained using the deep reinforcement learning without
supervision. Specifically, in the model, we apply the Multi-head Attention to
capture the structural patterns, and design a dynamic embedding to handle the
dynamic patterns of the problem. Once the model is trained, it can generalize
to various types of CSP tasks (different sizes and topologies) with no need of
re-training. Through controlled experiments, the proposed approach shows
desirable time complexity: it runs more than 20 times faster than the
traditional heuristic solvers with a tiny gap of optimality. Moreover, it
significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art deep learning approaches
for combinatorial optimization in the aspect of both training and inference. In
comparison with traditional solvers, this approach is highly desirable for most
of the challenging tasks in practice that are usually large-scale and require
quick decisions.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The use of evolutionary methods in design and art is increasing in diversity
and popularity. Approaches to using these methods for creative production
typically focus either on optimisation or exploration. In this paper we
introduce an evolutionary system for design that combines these two approaches,
enabling users to explore landscapes of design alternatives using
design-oriented measures of fitness, along with their own aesthetic
preferences. We test our methods using a biologically-inspired generative
system capable of producing 3D objects that can be exported directly as 3D
printing toolpath instructions. For the search stage of our system we combine
the use of the CMA-ES algorithm for optimisation and linear interpolation
between generated objects for feature exploration. We investigate the system`s
capabilities by evolving highly fit artefacts and then combining them with
aesthetically interesting ones.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Anomaly Detection through Transfer Learning in Agriculture and Manufacturing IoT Systems. (arXiv:2102.05814v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05814</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;IoT systems have been facing increasingly sophisticated technical problems
due to the growing complexity of these systems and their fast deployment
practices. Consequently, IoT managers have to judiciously detect failures
(anomalies) in order to reduce their cyber risk and operational cost. While
there is a rich literature on anomaly detection in many IoT-based systems,
there is no existing work that documents the use of ML models for anomaly
detection in digital agriculture and in smart manufacturing systems. These two
application domains pose certain salient technical challenges. In agriculture
the data is often sparse, due to the vast areas of farms and the requirement to
keep the cost of monitoring low. Second, in both domains, there are multiple
types of sensors with varying capabilities and costs. The sensor data
characteristics change with the operating point of the environment or machines,
such as, the RPM of the motor. The inferencing and the anomaly detection
processes therefore have to be calibrated for the operating point.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we analyze data from sensors deployed in an agricultural farm
with data from seven different kinds of sensors, and from an advanced
manufacturing testbed with vibration sensors. We evaluate the performance of
ARIMA and LSTM models for predicting the time series of sensor data. Then,
considering the sparse data from one kind of sensor, we perform transfer
learning from a high data rate sensor. We then perform anomaly detection using
the predicted sensor data. Taken together, we show how in these two application
domains, predictive failure classification can be achieved, thus paving the way
for predictive maintenance.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Addressing a complex real-world optimization problem is a challenging task.
The chance-constrained knapsack problem with correlated uniform weights plays
an important role in the case where dependent stochastic components are
considered. We perform runtime analysis of a randomized search algorithm (RSA)
and a basic evolutionary algorithm (EA) for the chance-constrained knapsack
problem with correlated uniform weights. We prove bounds for both algorithms
for producing a feasible solution. Furthermore, we investigate the behavior of
the algorithms and carry out analyses on two settings: uniform profit value and
the setting in which every group shares an arbitrary profit profile. We provide
insight into the structure of these problems and show how the weight
correlations and the different types of profit profiles influence the runtime
behavior of both algorithms in the chance-constrained setting.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: The Prognostic Value of Homocysteine in Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.600582</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: This comprehensive meta-analysis aimed to assess whether an increased homocysteine (Hcy) level is an independent predictor of unfavorable outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted up to August 1, 2020 to collect studies reporting Hcy levels in AIS patients. We analyzed all the data using Review Manager 5.3 software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Seventeen studies with 15,636 AIS patients were selected for evaluation. A higher Hcy level was associated with a poorer survival outcome (OR 1.43, 95% CI: 1.25–1.63). Compared with the AIS group, Hcy levels were significantly lower in the healthy control patients, with an SMD of 5.11 and 95% CI (1.87–8.35). Analysis of the different subgroups of AIS demonstrated significant associations between high Hcy levels and survival outcomes only in Caucasian and Asian patients. Moreover, whereas high Hcy levels were closely associated with gender, B12 deficiency, smoking, and patients who received tissue plasminogen activator treatment, no significant difference was found between increased Hcy levels and age, drinking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. In addition, the cut-off value (20.0 μmol/L) might be an optimum cut-off index for AIS patients in clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This meta-analysis reveals that the Hcy level may serve as an independent predictor for unfavorable survival outcomes in AIS patients, particularly in Caucasian and Asian AIS patients. Further studies can be conducted to clarify this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Protein Aggregation Inhibitors as Disease-Modifying Therapies for Polyglutamine Diseases</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.621996</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases are a group of inherited neurodegenerative diseases caused by the abnormal expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat that are translated into an expanded polyQ stretch in the disease-causative proteins. The expanded polyQ stretch itself plays a critical disease-causative role in the pathomechanisms underlying polyQ diseases. Notably, the expanded polyQ stretch undergoes a conformational transition from the native monomer into the β-sheet-rich monomer, followed by the formation of soluble oligomers and then insoluble aggregates with amyloid fibrillar structures. The intermediate soluble species including the β-sheet-rich monomer and oligomers exhibit substantial neurotoxicity. Therefore, protein conformation stabilization and aggregation inhibition that target the upstream of the insoluble aggregate formation would be a promising approach toward the development of disease-modifying therapies for polyQ diseases. PolyQ aggregation inhibitors of different chemical categories, such as intrabodies, peptides, and small chemical compounds, have been identified through intensive screening methods. Among them, recent advances in the brain delivery methods of several peptides and the screening of small chemical compounds have brought them closer to clinical utility. Notably, the recent discovery of arginine as a potent conformation stabilizer and aggregation inhibitor of polyQ proteins both in vitro and in vivo have paved way to the clinical trial for the patients with polyQ diseases. Meanwhile, expression reduction of expanded polyQ proteins per se would be another promising approach toward disease modification of polyQ diseases. Gene silencing, especially by antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), have succeeded in reducing the expression of polyQ proteins in the animal models of various polyQ diseases by targeting the aberrant mRNA with expanded CAG repeats. Of note, some of these ASOs have recently been translated into clinical trials. Here we overview and discuss these recent advances toward the development of disease modifying therapies for polyQ diseases. We envision that combination therapies using aggregation inhibitors and gene silencing would meet the needs of the patients with polyQ diseases and their caregivers in the near future to delay or prevent the onset and progression of these currently intractable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Therapeutic Hypothermia Inhibits the Classical Complement Pathway in a Rat Model of Neonatal Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.616734</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;Complement activation is instrumental in the pathogenesis of Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), a significant cause of neonatal mortality and disability worldwide. Therapeutic hypothermia (HT), the only available treatment for HIE, only modestly improves outcomes. Complement modulation as a therapeutic adjunct to HT has been considered, but is challenging due to the wide-ranging role of the complement system in neuroinflammation, homeostasis and neurogenesis in the developing brain. We sought to identify potential therapeutic targets by measuring the impact of treatment with HT on complement effector expression in neurons and glia in neonatal HIE, with particular emphasis on the interactions between microglia and C1q.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The Vannucci model was used to induce HIE in term-equivalent rat pups. At P10-12, pups were randomly assigned to three different treatment groups: Sham (control), normothermia (NT), and hypothermia (HT) treatment. Local and systemic complement expression and neuronal apoptosis were measured by ELISA, TUNEL and immunofluorescence labeling, and differences compared between groups.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Treatment with HT is associated with decreased systemic and microglial expression of C1q, decreased systemic C5a levels, and decreased microglial and neuronal deposition of C3 and C9. The effect of HT on cytokines was variable with decreased expression of pro and anti-inflammatory effectors. HT treatment was associated with decreased C1q binding on cells undergoing apoptosis.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our data demonstrate the extreme complexity of the immune response in neonatal HIE. We propose modulation of downstream effectors C3a and C5a as a therapeutic adjunct to HT to enhance neuroprotection in the developing brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: A New Apparatus for Recording Evoked Responses to Painful and Non-painful Sensory Stimulation in Freely Moving Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.613801</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Experiments on pain processing in animals face several methodological challenges including the reproducible application of painful stimuli. Ideally, behavioral and physiological correlates of pain should be assessed in freely behaving mice, avoiding stress, fear or behavioral restriction as confounding factors. Moreover, the time of pain-evoked brain activity should be precisely related to the time of stimulation, such that pain-specific neuronal activity can be unambiguously identified. This can be achieved with laser-evoked heat stimuli which are also well established for human pain research. However, laser-evoked neuronal potentials are rarely investigated in awake unrestrained rodents, partially due to the practical difficulties in precisely and reliably targeting and triggering stimulation. In order to facilitate such studies we have developed a versatile stimulation and recording system for freely moving mice. The custom-made apparatus can provide both laser- and mechanical stimuli with simultaneous recording of evoked potentials and behavioral responses. Evoked potentials can be recorded from superficial and deep brain areas showing graded pain responses which correlate with pain-specific behavioral reactions. Non-painful mechanical stimuli can be applied as a control, yielding clearly different electrophysiological and behavioral responses. The apparatus is suited for simultaneous acquisition of precisely timed electrophysiological and behavioral evoked responses in freely moving mice. Besides its application in pain research it may be also useful in other fields of sensory physiology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.566004</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;With prevalence of electrophysiological data collected outside of the laboratory from portable, non-invasive modalities growing at a rapid rate, the quality of these recorded data, if not adequate, could affect the effectiveness of medical devices that depend of them. In this work, we propose novel methods to evaluate electrophysiological signal quality to determine how much of the data represents the physiological source of interest. Data driven models are investigated through Bayesian decision and deep learning-based methods to score unimodal (signal and noise recorded on same device) and multimodal (signal and noise each recorded from different devices) data, respectively. We validate these methods and models on three electroencephalography (EEG) data sets (N = 60 subjects) to score EEG quality based on the presence of ocular artifacts with our unimodal method and motion artifacts with our multimodal method. Further, we apply our unimodal source method to compare the performance of two different artifact removal algorithms. Our results show we are able to effectively score EEG data using both methods and apply our method to evaluate the performance of other artifact removal algorithms that target ocular artifacts. Methods developed and validated here can be used to assess data quality and evaluate the effectiveness of certain noise-reduction algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Evaluation of Task fMRI Decoding With Deep Learning on a Small Sample Dataset</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.577451</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recently, several deep learning methods have been applied to decoding in task-related fMRI, and their advantages have been exploited in a variety of ways. However, this paradigm is sometimes problematic, due to the difficulty of applying deep learning to high-dimensional data and small sample size conditions. The difficulties in gathering a large amount of data to develop predictive machine learning models with multiple layers from fMRI experiments with complicated designs and tasks are well-recognized. Group-level, multi-voxel pattern analysis with small sample sizes results in low statistical power and large accuracy evaluation errors; failure in such instances is ascribed to the individual variability that risks information leakage, a particular issue when dealing with a limited number of subjects. In this study, using a small-size fMRI dataset evaluating bilingual language switch in a property generation task, we evaluated the relative fit of different deep learning models, incorporating moderate split methods to control the amount of information leakage. Our results indicated that using the session shuffle split as the data folding method, along with the multichannel 2D convolutional neural network (M2DCNN) classifier, recorded the best authentic classification accuracy, which outperformed the efficiency of 3D convolutional neural network (3DCNN). In this manuscript, we discuss the tolerability of within-subject or within-session information leakage, of which the impact is generally considered small but complex and essentially unknown; this requires clarification in future studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to investigate whether the effect of mental practice (motor imagery training) can be enhanced by providing neurofeedback based on transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-induced motor evoked potentials (MEP). Twenty-four healthy, right-handed subjects were enrolled in this study. The subjects were randomly allocated into two groups: a group that was given correct TMS feedback (Real-FB group) and a group that was given randomized false TMS feedback (Sham-FB group). The subjects imagined pushing the switch with just timing, when the target circle overlapped a cross at the center of the computer monitor. In the Real-FB group, feedback was provided to the subjects based on the MEP amplitude measured in the trial immediately preceding motor imagery. In contrast, the subjects of the Sham-FB group were provided with a feedback value that was independent of the MEP amplitude. TMS was applied when the target, moving from right to left, overlapped the cross at the center of the screen, and the MEP amplitude was measured. The MEP was recorded in the right first dorsal interosseous muscle. We evaluated the pre-mental practice and post-mental practice motor performance in both groups. As a result, a significant difference was observed in the percentage change of error values between the Real-FB group and the Sham-FB group. Furthermore, the MEP was significantly different between the groups in the 4th and 5th sets. Therefore, it was suggested that TMS-induced MEP-based neurofeedback might enhance the effect of mental practice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Maternal Distress and Offspring Neurodevelopment: Challenges and Opportunities for Pre-clinical Research Models</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.635304</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pre-natal exposure to acute maternal trauma or chronic maternal distress can confer increased risk for psychiatric disorders in later life. Acute maternal trauma is the result of unforeseen environmental or personal catastrophes, while chronic maternal distress is associated with anxiety or depression. Animal studies investigating the effects of pre-natal stress have largely used brief stress exposures during pregnancy to identify critical periods of fetal vulnerability, a paradigm which holds face validity to acute maternal trauma in humans. While understanding these effects is undoubtably important, the literature suggests maternal stress in humans is typically chronic and persistent from pre-conception through gestation. In this review, we provide evidence to this effect and suggest a realignment of current animal models to recapitulate this chronicity. We also consider candidate mediators, moderators and mechanisms of maternal distress, and suggest a wider breadth of research is needed, along with the incorporation of advanced -omics technologies, in order to understand the neurodevelopmental etiology of psychiatric risk.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Personalized Virtual Reality Human-Computer Interaction for Psychiatric and Neurological Illnesses: A Dynamically Adaptive Virtual Reality Environment That Changes According to Real-Time Feedback From Electrophysiological Signal Responses</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.596980</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Virtual reality (VR) constitutes an alternative, effective, and increasingly utilized treatment option for people suffering from psychiatric and neurological illnesses. However, the currently available VR simulations provide a predetermined simulative framework that does not take into account the unique personality traits of each individual; this could result in inaccurate, extreme, or unpredictable responses driven by patients who may be overly exposed and in an abrupt manner to the predetermined stimuli, or result in indifferent, almost non-existing, reactions when the stimuli do not affect the patients adequately and thus stronger stimuli are recommended. In this study, we present a VR system that can recognize the individual differences and readjust the VR scenarios during the simulation according to the treatment aims. To investigate and present this dynamically adaptive VR system we employ an Anxiety Disorder condition as a case study, namely arachnophobia. This system consists of distinct anxiety states, aiming to dynamically modify the VR environment in such a way that it can keep the individual within a controlled, and appropriate for the therapy needs, anxiety state, which will be called “desired states” for the study. This happens by adjusting the VR stimulus, in real-time, according to the electrophysiological responses of each individual. These electrophysiological responses are collected by an external electrodermal activity biosensor that serves as a tracker of physiological changes. Thirty-six diagnosed arachnophobic individuals participated in a one-session trial. Participants were divided into two groups, the Experimental Group which was exposed to the proposed real-time adaptive virtual simulation, and the Control Group which was exposed to a pre-recorded static virtual simulation as proposed in the literature. These results demonstrate the proposed system’s ability to continuously construct an updated and adapted virtual environment that keeps the users within the appropriately chosen state (higher or lower intensity) for approximately twice the time compared to the pre-recorded static virtual simulation. Thus, such a system can increase the efficiency of VR stimulations for the treatment of central nervous system dysfunctions, as it provides numerically more controlled sessions without unexpected variations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: The Connectivity Fingerprints of Highly-Skilled and Disordered Reading Persist Across Cognitive Domains</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.590093</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The capacity to produce and understand written language is a uniquely human skill that exists on a continuum, and foundational to other facets of human cognition. Multivariate classifiers based on support vector machines (SVM) have provided much insight into the networks underlying reading skill beyond what traditional univariate methods can tell us. Shallow models like SVM require large amounts of data, and this problem is compounded when functional connections, which increase exponentially with network size, are predictors of interest. Data reduction using independent component analyses (ICA) mitigates this problem, but conventionally assumes linear relationships. Multilayer feedforward networks, in contrast, readily find optimal low-dimensional encodings of complex patterns that include complex nonlinear or conditional relationships. Samples of poor and highly-skilled young readers were selected from two open access data sets using rhyming and mental multiplication tasks, respectively. Functional connectivity was computed for the rhyming task within a functionally-defined reading network and used to train multilayer feedforward classifier models to simultaneously associate functional connectivity patterns with lexicality (word vs. pseudoword) and reading skill (poor vs. highly-skilled). Classifiers identified validation set lexicality with significantly better than chance accuracy, and reading skill with near-ceiling accuracy. Critically, a series of replications used pre-trained rhyming-task models to classify reading skill from mental multiplication task participants' connectivity with near-ceiling accuracy. The novel deep learning approach presented here provides the clearest demonstration to date that reading-skill dependent functional connectivity within the reading network influences brain processing dynamics across cognitive domains.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Place Cells in Head-Fixed Mice Navigating a Floating Real-World Environment</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.618658</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The hippocampal place cell system in rodents has provided a major paradigm for the scientific investigation of memory function and dysfunction. Place cells have been observed in area CA1 of the hippocampus of both freely moving animals, and of head-fixed animals navigating in virtual reality environments. However, spatial coding in virtual reality preparations has been observed to be impaired. Here we show that the use of a real-world environment system for head-fixed mice, consisting of an air-floating track with proximal cues, provides some advantages over virtual reality systems for the study of spatial memory. We imaged the hippocampus of head-fixed mice injected with the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s while they navigated circularly constrained or open environments on the floating platform. We observed consistent place tuning in a substantial fraction of cells despite the absence of distal visual cues. Place fields remapped when animals entered a different environment. When animals re-entered the same environment, place fields typically remapped over a time period of multiple days, faster than in freely moving preparations, but comparable with virtual reality. Spatial information rates were within the range observed in freely moving mice. Manifold analysis indicated that spatial information could be extracted from a low-dimensional subspace of the neural population dynamics. This is the first demonstration of place cells in head-fixed mice navigating on an air-lifted real-world platform, validating its use for the study of brain circuits involved in memory and affected by neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: NGN2 mmRNA-Based Transcriptional Programming in Microfluidic Guides hiPSCs Toward Neural Fate With Multiple Identities</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.602888</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent advancements in cell engineering have succeeded in manipulating cell identity with the targeted overexpression of specific cell fate determining transcription factors in a process named transcriptional programming. Neurogenin2 (NGN2) is sufficient to instruct pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) to acquire a neuronal identity when delivered with an integrating system, which arises some safety concerns for clinical applications. A non-integrating system based on modified messenger RNA (mmRNA) delivery method, represents a valuable alternative to lentiviral-based approaches. The ability of NGN2 mmRNA to instruct PSC fate change has not been thoroughly investigated yet. Here we aimed at understanding whether the use of an NGN2 mmRNA-based approach combined with a miniaturized system, which allows a higher transfection efficiency in a cost-effective system, is able to drive human induced PSCs (hiPSCs) toward the neuronal lineage. We show that NGN2 mRNA alone is able to induce cell fate conversion. Surprisingly, the outcome cell population accounts for multiple phenotypes along the neural development trajectory. We found that this mixed population is mainly constituted by neural stem cells (45% ± 18 PAX6 positive cells) and neurons (38% ± 8 βIIITUBULIN positive cells) only when NGN2 is delivered as mmRNA. On the other hand, when the delivery system is lentiviral-based, both providing a constant expression of NGN2 or only a transient pulse, the outcome differentiated population is formed by a clear majority of neurons (88% ± 1 βIIITUBULIN positive cells). Altogether, our data confirm the ability of NGN2 to induce neuralization in hiPSCs and opens a new point of view in respect to the delivery system method when it comes to transcriptional programming applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Association Between the Gut Microbiota and Parkinson's Disease, a Meta-Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.636545</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) were often observed with gastrointestinal symptoms, which preceded the onset of motor symptoms. Neuropathology of PD has also been found in the enteric nervous system (ENS). Many studies have reported significant PD-related alterations of gut microbiota. This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the differences of gut microbiota between patients with PD and healthy controls (HCs) across different geographical regions. We conducted a systematic online search for case-control studies detecting gut microbiota in patients with PD and HCs. Mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to access alterations in the abundance of certain microbiota families in PD. Fifteen case-control studies were included in this meta-analysis study. Our results showed significant lower abundance levels of Prevotellaceae (MD = −0.37, 95% CI = −0.62 to −0.11), Faecalibacterium (MD = −0.41, 95% CI: −0.57 to −0.24), and Lachnospiraceae (MD = −0.34, 95% CI = −0.59 to −0.09) in patients with PD compared to HCs. Significant higher abundance level of Bifidobacteriaceae (MD = 0.38, 95%; CI = 0.12 to 0.63), Ruminococcaceae (MD = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.07 to 1.10), Verrucomicrobiaceae (MD = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.21 to 0.69), and Christensenellaceae (MD = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.07 to 0.34) was also found in patients with PD. Thus, shared alterations of certain gut microbiota were detected in patients with PD across different geographical regions. These PD-related gut microbiota dysbiosis might lead to the impairment of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) producing process, lipid metabolism, immunoregulatory function, and intestinal permeability, which contribute to the pathogenesis of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.631770</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A wide range of comorbid diseases is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide. Evidence from clinical and molecular studies suggest that chronic diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression, and inflammatory bowel disease, may be associated with an increased risk of AD in different populations. Disruption in several shared biological pathways has been proposed as the underlying mechanism for the association between AD and these comorbidities. Notably, inflammation is a common dysregulated pathway shared by most of the comorbidities associated with AD. Some drugs commonly prescribed to patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease have shown promising results in AD patients. Systems-based biology studies have identified common genetic factors and dysregulated pathways that may explain the relationship of comorbid disorders in AD. Nonetheless, the precise mechanisms for the occurrence of disease comorbidities in AD are not entirely understood. Here, we discuss the impact of the most common comorbidities in the clinical management of AD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Increased Plasma Heme Oxygenase-1 Levels in Patients With Early-Stage Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.621508</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is a 32 kDa stress-response protein implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Biliverdin is derived from heme through a reaction mediated by HO-1 and protects cells from oxidative stress. However, iron and carbon monoxide produced by the catabolism of HO-1 exert detrimental effects on patients with PD. The purpose of this study was to determine whether plasma HO-1 levels represent a biomarker of PD and to further explore the underlying mechanism of increased HO-1 levels by applying voxel-based morphometry (VBM).Methods: We measured plasma HO-1 levels using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 156 subjects, including 81 patients with early- and advanced-stage PD and 75 subjects without PD. The analyses were adjusted to control for confounders such as age, sex, and medication. We analyzed T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 74 patients with PD using VBM to elucidate the association between altered brain volumes and HO-1 levels. Then, we compared performance on MMSE sub-items between PD patients with low and high levels of HO-1 using Mann-Whitney U tests.Results: Plasma HO-1 levels were significantly elevated in PD patients, predominantly those with early-stage PD, compared with controls (p &amp;lt; 0.05). The optimal cutoff value for patients with early PD was 2.245 ng/ml HO-1 [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.654]. Plasma HO-1 levels were unaffected by sex, age, and medications (p &amp;gt; 0.05). The right hippocampal volume was decreased in the subset of PD patients with high HO-1 levels (p &amp;lt; 0.05). A weak correlation was observed between right hippocampal volume and plasma HO-1 levels (r = −0.273, p = 0.018). There was no difference in total MMSE scores between the low- and high-HO-1 groups (p &amp;gt; 0.05), but the high-HO-1 group had higher language scores than the low-HO-1 group (p &amp;lt; 0.05).Conclusions: Plasma HO-1 levels may be a promising biomarker of early PD. Moreover, a high plasma concentration of the HO-1 protein is associated with a reduction in right hippocampal volume.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Body Temperature Is Associated With Cognitive Performance in Older Adults With and Without Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Cross-sectional Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.585904</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Wearable devices for remote and continuous health monitoring in older populations frequently include sensors for body temperature measurements (i.e., skin and core body temperatures). Healthy aging is associated with core body temperatures that are in the lower range of age-related normal values (36.3 ± 0.6°C, oral temperature), while patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) exhibit core body temperatures above normal values (up to 0.2°C). However, the relation of body temperature measures with neurocognitive health in older adults remains unknown. This study aimed to explore the association of body temperature with cognitive performance in older adults with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Eighty community-dwelling older adults (≥65 years) participated, of which 54 participants were cognitively healthy and 26 participants met the criteria for MCI. Skin temperatures at the rib cage and the scapula were measured in the laboratory (single-point measurement) and neuropsychological tests were conducted to assess general cognitive performance, episodic memory, verbal fluency, executive function, and processing speed. In a subgroup (n = 15, nine healthy, six MCI), skin and core body temperatures were measured continuously during 12 h of habitual daily activities (long-term measurement). Spearman’s partial correlation analyses, controlled for age, revealed that lower median body temperature and higher peak-to-peak body temperature amplitude was associated with better general cognitive performance and with better performance in specific domains of cognition; [e.g., rib median skin temperature (single-point) vs. processing speed: r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.33, p = 0.002; rib median skin temperature (long-term) vs. executive function: r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.56, p = 0.023; and peak-to-peak core body temperature amplitude (long-term) vs. episodic memory: r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.51, p = 0.032]. Additionally, cognitively healthy older adults showed lower median body temperature and higher peak-to-peak body temperature amplitude compared to older adults with MCI (e.g., rib median skin temperature, single-point: p = 0.035, r = 0.20). We conclude that both skin and core body temperature measures are potential early biomarkers of cognitive decline and preclinical symptoms of MCI/AD. It may therefore be promising to integrate body temperature measures into multi-parameter systems for the remote and continuous monitoring of neurocognitive health in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

MIGNON is a workflow for the analysis of RNA-Seq experiments, which not only efficiently manages the estimation of gene expression levels from raw sequencing reads, but also calls genomic variants present in the transcripts analyzed. Moreover, this is the first workflow that provides a framework for the integration of transcriptomic and genomic data based on a mechanistic model of signaling pathway activities that allows a detailed biological interpretation of the results, including a comprehensive functional profiling of cell activity. MIGNON covers the whole process, from reads to signaling circuit activity estimations, using state-of-the-art tools, it is easy to use and it is deployable in different computational environments, allowing an optimized use of the resources available.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lbrtDEw9EwA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The correct identification of metabolic activity in tissues or cells under different conditions can be extremely elusive due to mechanisms such as post-transcriptional modification of enzymes or different rates in protein degradation, making difficult to perform predictions on the basis of gene expression alone. Context-specific metabolic network reconstruction can overcome some of these limitations by leveraging the integration of multi-omics data into genome-scale metabolic networks (GSMN). Using the experimental information, context-specific models are reconstructed by extracting from the generic GSMN the sub-network most consistent with the data, subject to biochemical constraints. One advantage is that these context-specific models have more predictive power since they are tailored to the specific tissue, cell or condition, containing only the reactions predicted to be active in such context. However, an important limitation is that there are usually many different sub-networks that optimally fit the experimental data. This set of optimal networks represent alternative explanations of the possible metabolic state. Ignoring the set of possible solutions reduces the ability to obtain relevant information about the metabolism and may bias the interpretation of the true metabolic states. In this work we formalize the problem of enumerating optimal metabolic networks and we introduce DEXOM, an unified approach for diversity-based enumeration of context-specific metabolic networks. We developed different strategies for this purpose and we performed an exhaustive analysis using simulated and real data. In order to analyze the extent to which these results are biologically meaningful, we used the alternative solutions obtained with the different methods to measure: 1) the improvement of in silico predictions of essential genes in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; using ensembles of metabolic network; and 2) the detection of alternative enriched pathways in different human cancer cell lines. We also provide DEXOM as an open-source library compatible with COBRA Toolbox 3.0, available at https://github.com/MetExplore/dexom.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v2GUBLx6oK4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Recent work of Sottoriva, Graham, and collaborators have led to the controversial claim that exponentially growing tumors have a site frequency spectrum that follows the 1/&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt; law consistent with neutral evolution. This conclusion has been criticized based on data quality issues, statistical considerations, and simulation results. Here, we use rigorous mathematical arguments to investigate the site frequency spectrum in the two-type model of clonal evolution. If the fitnesses of the two types are λ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, then the site frequency spectrum is &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; where &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; = λ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;/λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. This is due to the advantageous mutations that produce the founders of the type 1 population. Mutations within the growing type 0 and type 1 populations follow the 1/&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt; law. Our results show that, in contrast to published criticisms, neutral evolution in an exponentially growing tumor can be distinguished from the two-type model using the site frequency spectrum.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JjBq4PnRsds&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Analyzing the dynamical properties of mobile objects requires to extract trajectories from recordings, which is often done by tracking movies. We compiled a database of two-dimensional movies for very different biological and physical systems spanning a wide range of length scales and developed a general-purpose, optimized, open-source, cross-platform, easy to install and use, self-updating software called FastTrack. It can handle a changing number of deformable objects in a region of interest, and is particularly suitable for animal and cell tracking in two-dimensions. Furthermore, we introduce the probability of incursions as a new measure of a movie’s trackability that doesn’t require the knowledge of ground truth trajectories, since it is resilient to small amounts of errors and can be computed on the basis of an &lt;i&gt;ad hoc&lt;/i&gt; tracking. We also leveraged the versatility and speed of FastTrack to implement an iterative algorithm determining a set of nearly-optimized tracking parameters—yet further reducing the amount of human intervention—and demonstrate that FastTrack can be used to explore the space of tracking parameters to optimize the number of swaps for a batch of similar movies. A benchmark shows that FastTrack is orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art tracking algorithms, with a comparable tracking accuracy.

Prolonged lag time can be induced by starvation contributing to the antibiotic tolerance of bacteria. We analyze the optimal lag time to survive and grow the iterative and stochastic application of antibiotics. A simple model shows that the optimal lag time can exhibit a discontinuous transition when the severeness of the antibiotic application, such as the probability to be exposed the antibiotic, the death rate under the exposure, and the duration of the exposure, is increased. This suggests the possibility of reducing tolerant bacteria by controlled usage of antibiotics application. When the bacterial populations are able to have two phenotypes with different lag times, the fraction of the second phenotype that has different lag time shows a continuous transition. We then present a generic framework to investigate the optimal lag time distribution for total population fitness for a given distribution of the antibiotic application duration. The obtained optimal distributions have multiple peaks for a wide range of the antibiotic application duration distributions, including the case where the latter is monotonically decreasing. The analysis supports the advantage in evolving multiple, possibly discrete phenotypes in lag time for bacterial long-term fitness.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/q02rylL_KyQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Deriving fine-scale models of human mobility from aggregated origin-destination flow data</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/4RXwWBH3_cY/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Constanze Ciavarella, Neil M. Ferguson&lt;/p&gt;

The spatial dynamics of epidemics are fundamentally affected by patterns of human mobility. Mobile phone call detail records (CDRs) are a rich source of mobility data, and allow semi-mechanistic models of movement to be parameterised even for resource poor settings. While the gravity model typically reproduces human movement reasonably well at the administrative level spatial scale, past studies suggest that parameter estimates vary with the level of spatial discretisation at which models are fitted. Given that privacy concerns usually preclude public release of very fine-scale movement data, such variation would be problematic for individual-based simulations of epidemic spread parametrised at a fine spatial scale. We therefore present new methods to fit fine-scale mathematical mobility models (here we implement variants of the gravity and radiation models) to spatially aggregated movement data and investigate how model parameter estimates vary with spatial resolution. We use gridded population data at 1km resolution to derive population counts at different spatial scales (down to ∼ 5km grids) and implement mobility models at each scale. Parameters are estimated from administrative-level flow data between overnight locations in Kenya and Namibia derived from CDRs: where the model spatial resolution exceeds that of the mobility data, we compare the flow data between a particular origin and destination with the sum of all model flows between cells that lie within those particular origin and destination administrative units. Clear evidence of over-dispersion supports the use of negative binomial instead of Poisson likelihood for count data with high values. Radiation models use fewer parameters than the gravity model and better predict trips between overnight locations for both considered countries. Results show that estimates for some parameters change between countries and with spatial resolution and highlight how imperfect flow data and spatial population distribution can influence model fit.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4RXwWBH3_cY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: The role of children in the spread of COVID-19: Using household data from Bnei Brak, Israel, to estimate the relative susceptibility and infectivity of children</title>

One of the significant unanswered questions about COVID-19 epidemiology relates to the role of children in transmission. This study uses data on infections within households in order to estimate the susceptibility and infectivity of children compared to those of adults. The data were collected from households in the city of Bnei Brak, Israel, in which all household members were tested for COVID-19 using PCR (637 households, average household size of 5.3). In addition, serological tests were performed on a subset of the individuals in the study. Inspection of the PCR data shows that children are less likely to be tested positive compared to adults (25% of children positive over all households, 44% of adults positive over all households, excluding index cases), and the chance of being positive increases with age. Analysis of joint PCR/serological data shows that there is under-detection of infections in the PCR testing, which is more substantial in children. However, the differences in detection rates are not sufficient to account for the differences in PCR positive rates in the two age groups. To estimate relative transmission parameters, we employ a discrete stochastic model of the spread of infection within a household, allowing for susceptibility and infectivity parameters to differ among children and adults. The model is fitted to the household data using a simulated maximum likelihood approach. To adjust parameter estimates for under-detection of infections in the PCR results, we employ a multiple imputation procedure using estimates of under-detection in children and adults, based on the available serological data. We estimate that the susceptibility of children (under 20 years old) is 43% (95% CI: [31%, 55%]) of the susceptibility of adults. The infectivity of children was estimated to be 63% (95% CI: [37%, 88%]) relative to that of adults.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-dx0oGr514M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Marc A. Dämgen, Philip C. Biggin&lt;/p&gt;

Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) are receptor proteins that are sensitive to their membrane environment, but the mechanism for how lipids modulate function under physiological conditions in a state dependent manner is not known. The glycine receptor is a pLGIC whose structure has been resolved in different functional states. Using a realistic model of a neuronal membrane coupled with coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that some key lipid-protein interactions are dependent on the receptor state, suggesting that lipids may regulate the receptor’s conformational dynamics. Comparison with existing structural data confirms known lipid binding sites, but we also predict further protein-lipid interactions including a site at the communication interface between the extracellular and transmembrane domain. Moreover, in the active state, cholesterol can bind to the binding site of the positive allosteric modulator ivermectin. These protein-lipid interaction sites could in future be exploited for the rational design of lipid-like allosteric drugs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dtFHrIa3xVo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Adoptive Transfer of JC Virus‐Specific T Lymphocytes for the Treatment of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26020?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is still burdened by high mortality in a subset of patients, such as those affected by hematological malignancies. The aim of this study was to analyze the safety and carry out preliminary evaluation of the efficacy of polyomavirus JC (JCPyV)‐specific T cell therapy in a cohort of hematological patients with PML.


Methods
Between 2014 and 2019, 9 patients with a diagnosis of “definite PML” according to the 2013 consensus who were showing progressive clinical deterioration received JCPyV‐specific T cells. Cell lines were expanded from autologous or allogenic peripheral blood mononuclear cells by stimulation with JCPyV antigen‐derived peptides.


Results
None of the patients experienced treatment‐related adverse events. In the evaluable patients, an increase in the frequency of circulating JCPyV‐specific lymphocytes was observed, with a decrease or clearance of JCPyV viral load in cerebrospinal fluid. In responsive patients, transient appearance of punctate areas of contrast enhancement within, or close to, PML lesions was observed, which was interpreted as a sign of immune control and which regressed spontaneously without the need for steroid treatment. Six of 9 patients achieved PML control, with 5 alive and in good clinical condition at their last follow‐up.


Interpretation
Among other novel treatments, T cell therapy is emerging as a viable treatment option in patients with PML, particularly for those not amenable to restoration of specific immunity. Neurologists should be encouraged to refer PML patients to specialized centers to allow access to this treatment strategy. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.592660</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the recent sleep studies, it was shown that afferentation of many cortical areas switches during sleep to the interoceptive one. However, it was unclear whether the insular cortex, which is often considered as the main cortical visceral representation, maintains the same effective connectivity in both states of vigilance, or processes interoceptive information predominantly in one state. We investigated neuronal responses of the cat insular cortex to electrical stimulations of the intestinal wall delivered during wakefulness and natural sleep. Marked increase was observed in the number of insular neurons responding to this stimulation in sleep comparing to wakefulness, and enlarged amplitudes of evoked local field potentials were found as well. Moreover, most of the cells responding to intestinal stimulation in wakefulness never responded to identical stimuli during sleep and vice versa. It was also shown that applied low intensity intestinal stimulations had never compromised sleep quality. In addition, experiments with microstimulation of the insular cortex and recording of intestinal myoelectric activity demonstrated that effective insula-to-gut propagation also happened only during sleep. On the other hand, the same insular stimulations in wakefulness led to contractions of orofacial muscles. The evoked face movements gradually disappeared in the course of sleep development. These findings demonstrate that pattern of efficient afferent and efferent connections of the insular cortex changes with transition from wakefulness to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Isoliquiritigenin Confers Neuroprotection and Alleviates Amyloid-β42-Induced Neuroinflammation in Microglia by Regulating the Nrf2/NF-κB Signaling</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.638772</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Neuroinflammation and oxidative stress are two major pathological characteristics of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Amyloid-β oligomers (AβO), a toxic form of Aβ, promote the neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in the development of AD. Isoliquiritigenin (ISL), a natural flavonoid isolated from the root of liquorice, has been shown to exert inhibitory effects on inflammatory response and oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;Objectives&lt;p&gt;The main purpose of this study is to assess the influence of ISL on inflammatory response and oxidative stress in BV2 cells stimulated with AβO, and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2-H- tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxicity assays were used to assess the toxic or protective effects of ISL. The expression levels of interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α were assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Morphological changes in BV2 cells were assessed by immunofluorescence method. Nitric oxide (NO) assay kit was used to determinate the NO production. Western blot, qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence were used to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;ISL treatment reduced the production of inflammatory cytokines and NO, and alleviated the morphological changes in BV2 cells induced by AβO. ISL treatment further protected N2a cells from the toxic medium of AβO-stimulated BV2 cells. ISL activated nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling and suppressed nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling in BV2 cells.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;ISL suppresses AβO-induced inflammation and oxidative stress in BV2 cells via the regulation of Nrf2/NF-κB signaling. Therefore, ISL indirectly protects neurons from the damage of toxic conditioned media.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Clear and Consistent Imaging of Hippocampal Internal Architecture With High Resolution Multiple Image Co-registration and Averaging (HR-MICRA)</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.546312</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging of hippocampal internal architecture (HIA) at 3T is challenging. HIA is defined by layers of gray and white matter that are less than 1 mm thick in the coronal plane. To visualize HIA, conventional MRI approaches have relied on sequences with high in-plane resolution (≤0.5 mm) but comparatively thick slices (2–5 mm). However, thicker slices are prone to volume averaging effects that result in loss of HIA clarity and blurring of the borders of the hippocampal subfields in up to 61% of slices as has been reported. In this work we describe an approach to hippocampal imaging that provides consistently high HIA clarity using a commonly available sequence and post-processing techniques that is flexible and may be applicable to any MRI platform. We refer to this approach as High Resolution Multiple Image Co-registration and Averaging (HR-MICRA). This approach uses a variable flip angle turbo spin echo sequence to repeatedly acquire a whole brain T2w image volume with high resolution in three dimensions in a relatively short amount of time, and then co-register the volumes to correct for movement and average the repeated scans to improve SNR. We compared the averages of 4, 9, and 16 individual scans in 20 healthy controls using a published HIA clarity rating scale. In the body of the hippocampus, the proportion of slices with good or excellent HIA clarity was 90%, 83%, and 67% for the 16x, 9x, and 4x HR-MICRA images, respectively. Using the 4x HR-MICRA images as a baseline, the 9x HR-MICRA images were 2.6 times and 16x HR-MICRA images were 3.2 times more likely to have high HIA ratings (p &amp;lt; 0.001) across all hippocampal segments (head, body, and tail). The thin slices of the HR-MICRA images allow reformatting in any plane with clear visualization of hippocampal dentation in the sagittal plane. Clear and consistent visualization of HIA will allow application of this technique to future hippocampal structure research, as well as more precise manual or automated segmentation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Enlarged Area of Mesencephalic Iron Deposits in Adults Who Stutter</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.639269</link>
	<content:encoded>Purpose&lt;p&gt;Childhood onset speech fluency disorder (stuttering) is possibly related to dopaminergic dysfunction. Mesencephalic hyperechogenicity (ME) detected by transcranial ultrasound (TCS) might be seen as an indirect marker of dopaminergic dysfunction. We here determined whether adults who stutter since childhood (AWS) show ME.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We performed TCS in ten AWS and ten matched adults who never stuttered. We also assessed motor performance in finger tapping and in the 25 Foot Walking test.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared to controls, AWS showed enlarged ME on either side. Finger tapping was slower in AWS. Walking cadence, i.e., the ratio of number of steps by time, tended to be higher in AWS than in control participants.&lt;/p&gt;Discussion&lt;p&gt;The results demonstrate a motor deficit in AWS linked to dopaminergic dysfunction and extending beyond speech. Since iron deposits evolve in childhood and shrink thereafter, ME might serve as an easily quantifiable biomarker helping to predict the risk of persistency in children who stutter.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: 7T MRI and Computational Modeling Supports a Critical Role of Lead Location in Determining Outcomes for Deep Brain Stimulation: A Case Report</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.631778</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established therapy for Parkinson’s disease motor symptoms. The ideal site for implantation within STN, however, remains controversial. While many argue that placement of a DBS lead within the sensorimotor territory of the STN yields better motor outcomes, others report similar effects with leads placed in the associative or motor territory of the STN, while still others assert that placing a DBS lead “anywhere within a 6-mm-diameter cylinder centered at the presumed middle of the STN (based on stereotactic atlas coordinates) produces similar clinical efficacy.” These discrepancies likely result from methodological differences including targeting preferences, imaging acquisition and the use of brain atlases that do not account for patient-specific anatomic variability. We present a first-in-kind within-patient demonstration of severe mood side effects and minimal motor improvement in a Parkinson’s disease patient following placement of a DBS lead in the limbic/associative territory of the STN who experienced marked improvement in motor benefit and resolution of mood side effects following repositioning the lead within the STN sensorimotor territory. 7 Tesla (7 T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were used to generate a patient-specific anatomical model of the STN with parcellation into distinct functional territories and computational modeling to assess the relative degree of activation of motor, associative and limbic territories.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Neural Correlates of Cued Reward Omission</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.615313</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Compared to our understanding of positive prediction error signals occurring due to unexpected reward outcomes, less is known about the neural circuitry in humans that drives negative prediction errors during omission of expected rewards. While classical learning theories such as Rescorla–Wagner or temporal difference learning suggest that both types of prediction errors result from a simple subtraction, there has been recent evidence suggesting that different brain regions provide input to dopamine neurons which contributes to specific components of this prediction error computation. Here, we focus on the brain regions responding to negative prediction error signals, which has been well-established in animal studies to involve a distinct pathway through the lateral habenula. We examine the activity of this pathway in humans, using a conditioned inhibition paradigm with high-resolution functional MRI. First, participants learned to associate a sensory stimulus with reward delivery. Then, reward delivery was omitted whenever this stimulus was presented simultaneously with a different sensory stimulus, the conditioned inhibitor (CI). Both reward presentation and the reward-predictive cue activated midbrain dopamine regions, insula and orbitofrontal cortex. While we found significant activity at an uncorrected threshold for the CI in the habenula, consistent with our predictions, it did not survive correction for multiple comparisons and awaits further replication. Additionally, the pallidum and putamen regions of the basal ganglia showed modulations of activity for the inhibitor that did not survive the corrected threshold.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Developmental Origins of Opioid Use Disorder and Its Comorbidities</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.601905</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Opioid use disorder (OUD) rarely presents as a unitary psychiatric condition, and the comorbid symptoms likely depend upon the diverse risk factors and mechanisms by which OUD can arise. These factors are heterogeneous and include genetic predisposition, exposure to prescription opioids, and environmental risks. Crucially, one key environmental risk factor for OUD is early life adversity (ELA). OUD and other substance use disorders are widely considered to derive in part from abnormal reward circuit function, which is likely also implicated in comorbid mental illnesses such as depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. ELA may disrupt reward circuit development and function in a manner predisposing to these disorders. Here, we describe new findings addressing the effects of ELA on reward circuitry that lead to OUD and comorbid disorders, potentially via shared neural mechanisms. We discuss some of these OUD-related problems in both humans and animals. We also highlight the increasingly apparent, crucial contribution of biological sex in mediating the range of ELA-induced disruptions of reward circuitry which may confer risk for the development of OUD and comorbid neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Crossed Entorhino-Dentate Projections Form and Terminate With Correct Layer-Specificity in Organotypic Slice Cultures of the Mouse Hippocampus</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.637036</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The entorhino-dentate projection, i.e., the perforant pathway, terminates in a highly ordered and laminated fashion in the rodent dentate gyrus (DG): fibers arising from the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) terminate in the middle molecular layer, whereas fibers arising from the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) terminate in the outer molecular layer of the DG. In rats and rabbits, a crossed entorhino-dentate projection exists, which originates from the entorhinal cortex (EC) and terminates in the contralateral DG. In contrast, in mice, such a crossed projection is reportedly absent. Using single and double mouse organotypic entorhino-hippocampal slice cultures, we studied the ipsi- and crossed entorhino-dentate projections. Viral tracing revealed that entorhino-dentate projections terminate with a high degree of lamina-specificity in single as well as in double cultures. Furthermore, in double cultures, entorhinal axons arising from one slice freely intermingled with entorhinal axons originating from the other slice. In single as well as in double cultures, entorhinal axons exhibited a correct topographical projection to the DG: medial entorhinal axons terminated in the middle and lateral entorhinal axons terminated in the outer molecular layer. Finally, entorhinal neurons were virally transduced with Channelrhodopsin2-YFP and stimulated with light, revealing functional connections between the EC and dentate granule cells. We conclude from our findings that entorhino-dentate projections form bilaterally in the mouse hippocampus in vitro and that the mouse DG provides a permissive environment for crossed entorhinal fibers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Mild Motor Signs Matter in Typical Brain Aging: The Value of the UPDRS Score Within a Functionally Intact Cohort of Older Adults</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.594637</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objectives: To characterize the clinical correlates of subclinical Parkinsonian signs, including longitudinal cognitive and neural (via functional connectivity) outcomes, among functionally normal older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Participants included 737 functionally intact community-dwelling older adults who performed prospective comprehensive evaluations at ~15-months intervals for an average of 4.8 years (standard deviation 3.2 years). As part of these evaluations, participants completed the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) longitudinally and measures of processing speed, executive functioning and verbal episodic memory. T1-weighted structural scans and task-free functional MRI scans were acquired on 330 participants. We conducted linear mixed-effects models to determine the relationship between changes in UPDRS with cognitive and neural changes, using age, sex, and education as covariates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Cognitive outcomes were processing speed, executive functioning, and episodic memory. Greater within-person increases in UPDRS were associated with more cognitive slowing over time. Although higher average UPDRS scores were significantly associated with overall poorer executive functions, there was no association between UPDRS and executive functioning longitudinally. UPDRS scores did not significantly relate to longitudinal memory performances. Regarding neural correlates, greater increases in UPDRS scores were associated with reduced intra-subcortical network connectivity over time. There were no relationships with intra-frontoparietal or inter-subcortical-frontoparietal connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our findings add to the aging literature by indicating that mild motor changes are negatively associated with cognition and network connectivity in functionally intact adults.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Modulation of the dynamics of cerebellar Purkinje cells through the interaction of excitatory and inhibitory feedforward pathways</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/vctWaRe4AhQ/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Yuanhong Tang, Lingling An, Ye Yuan, Qingqi Pei, Quan Wang, Jian K. Liu&lt;/p&gt;

The dynamics of cerebellar neuronal networks is controlled by the underlying building blocks of neurons and synapses between them. For which, the computation of Purkinje cells (PCs), the only output cells of the cerebellar cortex, is implemented through various types of neural pathways interactively routing excitation and inhibition converged to PCs. Such tuning of excitation and inhibition, coming from the gating of specific pathways as well as short-term plasticity (STP) of the synapses, plays a dominant role in controlling the PC dynamics in terms of firing rate and spike timing. PCs receive cascade feedforward inputs from two major neural pathways: the first one is the feedforward excitatory pathway from granule cells (GCs) to PCs; the second one is the feedforward inhibition pathway from GCs, via molecular layer interneurons (MLIs), to PCs. The GC-PC pathway, together with short-term dynamics of excitatory synapses, has been a focus over past decades, whereas recent experimental evidence shows that MLIs also greatly contribute to controlling PC activity. Therefore, it is expected that the diversity of excitation gated by STP of GC-PC synapses, modulated by strong inhibition from MLI-PC synapses, can promote the computation performed by PCs. However, it remains unclear how these two neural pathways are interacted to modulate PC dynamics. Here using a computational model of PC network installed with these two neural pathways, we addressed this question to investigate the change of PC firing dynamics at the level of single cell and network. We show that the nonlinear characteristics of excitatory STP dynamics can significantly modulate PC spiking dynamics mediated by inhibition. The changes in PC firing rate, firing phase, and temporal spike pattern, are strongly modulated by these two factors in different ways. MLIs mainly contribute to variable delays in the postsynaptic action potentials of PCs while modulated by excitation STP. Notably, the diversity of synchronization and pause response in the PC network is governed not only by the balance of excitation and inhibition, but also by the synaptic STP, depending on input burst patterns. Especially, the pause response shown in the PC network can only emerge with the interaction of both pathways. Together with other recent findings, our results show that the interaction of feedforward pathways of excitation and inhibition, incorporated with synaptic short-term dynamics, can dramatically regulate the PC activities that consequently change the network dynamics of the cerebellar circuit.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vctWaRe4AhQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Optogenetic targeting of astrocytes provides a robust experimental model to differentially induce Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals in astrocytes &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. However, a systematic study quantifying the response of optogenetically modified astrocytes to light is yet to be performed. Here, we propose a novel stochastic model of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics in astrocytes that incorporates a light sensitive component—channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2). Utilizing this model, we investigated the effect of different light stimulation paradigms on cells expressing select variants of ChR2 (wild type, ChETA, and ChRET/TC). Results predict that depending on paradigm specification, astrocytes might undergo drastic changes in their basal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; level and spiking probability. Furthermore, we performed a global sensitivity analysis to assess the effect of variation in parameters pertinent to the shape of the ChR2 photocurrent on astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics. Results suggest that directing variants towards the first open state of the ChR2 photocycle (o&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) enhances spiking activity in astrocytes during optical stimulation. Evaluation of the effect of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; buffering and coupling coefficient in a network of ChR2-expressing astrocytes demonstrated basal level elevations in the stimulated region and propagation of calcium activity to unstimulated cells. Buffering reduced the diffusion range of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; within the network, thereby limiting propagation and influencing the activity of astrocytes. Collectively, the framework presented in this study provides valuable information for the selection of light stimulation paradigms that elicit desired astrocytic activity using existing ChR2 constructs, as well as aids in the engineering of future application-oriented optogenetic variants.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mC1SkbAKXg4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Adaptive social contact rates induce complex dynamics during epidemics</title>

Epidemics may pose a significant dilemma for governments and individuals. The personal or public health consequences of inaction may be catastrophic; but the economic consequences of drastic response may likewise be catastrophic. In the face of these trade-offs, governments and individuals must therefore strike a balance between the economic and personal health costs of reducing social contacts and the public health costs of neglecting to do so. As risk of infection increases, potentially infectious contact between people is deliberately reduced either individually or by decree. This must be balanced against the social and economic costs of having fewer people in contact, and therefore active in the labor force or enrolled in school. Although the importance of adaptive social contact on epidemic outcomes has become increasingly recognized, the most important properties of coupled human-natural epidemic systems are still not well understood. We develop a theoretical model for adaptive, optimal control of the effective social contact rate using traditional epidemic modeling tools and a utility function with delayed information. This utility function trades off the population-wide contact rate with the expected cost and risk of increasing infections. Our analytical and computational analysis of this simple discrete-time deterministic strategic model reveals the existence of an endemic equilibrium, oscillatory dynamics around this equilibrium under some parametric conditions, and complex dynamic regimes that shift under small parameter perturbations. These results support the supposition that infectious disease dynamics under adaptive behavior change may have an indifference point, may produce oscillatory dynamics without other forcing, and constitute complex adaptive systems with associated dynamics. Implications for any epidemic in which adaptive behavior influences infectious disease dynamics include an expectation of fluctuations, for a considerable time, around a quasi-equilibrium that balances public health and economic priorities, that shows multiple peaks and surges in some scenarios, and that implies a high degree of uncertainty in mathematical projections.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8TBkScHy6-w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), early diagnosis is essential for both current and potential treatments. To find a supportive approach for the diagnosis, we constructed an artificial intelligence‐based prediction model of ALS using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Images of spinal motor neurons derived from healthy control and ALS patient iPSCs were analyzed by a deep convolutional neural network, and the algorithm achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.97 for classifying healthy control and ALS. This prediction model by deep learning algorithm with iPSC technology could support the diagnosis and may provide proactive treatment of ALS by future prospective research.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Diagnostic utility of Gold Coast criteria in ALS</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26045?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
The diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains problematic, with current diagnostic criteria (revised El Escorial [rEEC] and Awaji) being complex and prone to error. Consequently, diagnostic utility of the recently proposed Gold Coast criteria was determined in ALS.


Methods
We retrospectively reviewed 506 patients (302 males, 204 females) to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the Gold Coast criteria to the Awaji and rEEC criteria (defined by the proportion of patients categorized as definite, probable or possible ALS) in accordance with standards of reporting of diagnostic accuracy criteria.


Results
The sensitivity of Gold Coast criteria (92%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 88.7‐94.6%) was comparable to Awaji (90.3%, 95%CI 86.69‐93.2% ) and rEEC (88.6, 95%CI 84.8‐91.7%) criteria. Additionally, the Gold Coast criteria sensitivity was maintained across different subgroups, defined by site of onset, disease duration, and functional disability. In atypical ALS phenotypes, the Gold Coast criteria exhibited greater sensitivity and specificity.


Interpretation
The present study established the diagnostic utility of the Gold Coast criteria in ALS, with benefits evident in bulbar and limb‐onset disease patients, as well as atypical phenotypes. The Gold Coast criteria should be considered in clinical practice and therapeutic trials.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Winfree oscillators are phase oscillator models of neurons, characterized by their phase response curve and pulsatile interaction function. We use the Ott/Antonsen ansatz to study large heterogeneous networks of Winfree oscillators, deriving low-dimensional differential equations which describe the evolution of the expected state of networks of oscillators. We consider the effects of correlations between an oscillator's in-degree and out-degree, and between the in- and out-degrees of an “upstream” and a “downstream” oscillator (degree assortativity). We also consider correlated heterogeneity, where some property of an oscillator is correlated with a structural property such as degree. We finally consider networks with parameter assortativity, coupling oscillators according to their intrinsic frequencies. The results show how different types of network structure influence its overall dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Prediction of Transmembrane Regions, Cholesterol, and Ganglioside Binding Sites in Amyloid-Forming Proteins Indicate Potential for Amyloid Pore Formation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.619496</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Besides amyloid fibrils, amyloid pores (APs) represent another mechanism of amyloid induced toxicity. Since hypothesis put forward by Arispe and collegues in 1993 that amyloid-beta makes ion-conducting channels and that Alzheimer's disease may be due to the toxic effect of these channels, many studies have confirmed that APs are formed by prefibrillar oligomers of amyloidogenic proteins and are a common source of cytotoxicity. The mechanism of pore formation is still not well-understood and the structure and imaging of APs in living cells remains an open issue. To get closer to understand AP formation we used predictive methods to assess the propensity of a set of 30 amyloid-forming proteins (AFPs) to form transmembrane channels. A range of amino-acid sequence tools were applied to predict AP domains of AFPs, and provided context on future experiments that are needed in order to contribute toward a deeper understanding of amyloid toxicity. In a set of 30 AFPs we predicted their amyloidogenic propensity, presence of transmembrane (TM) regions, and cholesterol (CBM) and ganglioside binding motifs (GBM), to which the oligomers likely bind. Noteworthy, all pathological AFPs share the presence of TM, CBM, and GBM regions, whereas the functional amyloids seem to show just one of these regions. For comparative purposes, we also analyzed a few examples of amyloid proteins that behave as biologically non-relevant AFPs. Based on the known experimental data on the β-amyloid and α-synuclein pore formation, we suggest that many AFPs have the potential for pore formation. Oligomerization and α-TM helix to β-TM strands transition on lipid rafts seem to be the common key events.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Systemic Candesartan Treatment Modulates Behavior, Synaptic Protein Levels, and Neuroinflammation in Female Mice That Express Human APOE4</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.628403</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) could be beneficial for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients independent of any effects on hypertension. However, studies in rodent models directly testing the activity of ARB treatment on behavior and AD-relevent pathology including neuroinflammation, Aβ levels, and cerebrovascular function, have produced mixed results. APOE4 is a major genetic risk factor for AD and has been linked to many of the same functions as those purported to be modulated by ARB treatment. Therefore, evaluating the effects of ARB treatment on behavior and AD-relevant pathology in mice that express human APOE4 could provide important information on whether to further develop ARBs for AD therapy. In this study, we treated female and male mice that express the human APOE4 gene in the absence (E4FAD−) or presence (E4FAD+) of high Aβ levels with the ARB prodrug candesartan cilexetil for a duration of 4 months. Compared to vehicle, candesartan treatment resulted in greater memory-relevant behavior and higher hippocampal presynaptic protein levels in female, but not male, E4FAD− and E4FAD+ mice. The beneficial effects of candesartan in female E4FAD− and E4FAD+ mice occurred in tandem with lower GFAP and Iba1 levels in the hippocampus, whereas there were no effects on markers of cerebrovascular function and Aβ levels. Collectively, these data imply that the effects of ARBs on AD-relevant pathology may be modulated in part by the interaction between APOE genotype and biological sex. Thus, the further development of ARBs could provide therapeutic options for targeting neuroinflammation in female APOE4 carriers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: The Impact of Vigorous Cycling Exercise on Visual Attention: A Study With the BR8 Wireless Dry EEG System</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.621365</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many studies have reported that exercise can influence cognitive performance. But advancing our understanding of the interrelations between psychology and physiology in sports neuroscience requires the study of real-time brain dynamics during exercise in the field. Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the most powerful brain imaging technologies. However, the limited portability and long preparation time of traditional wet-sensor systems largely limits their use to laboratory settings. Wireless dry-sensor systems are emerging with much greater potential for practical application in sports. Hence, in this paper, we use the BR8 wireless dry-sensor EEG system to measure P300 brain dynamics while cycling at various intensities. The preparation time was mostly less than 2 min as BR8 system’s dry sensors were able to attain the required skin-sensor interface impedance, enabling its operation without any skin preparation or application of conductive gel. Ten participants performed four sessions of a 3 min rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task while resting and while cycling. These four sessions were pre-CE (RSVP only), low-CE (RSVP in 40–50% of max heart rate), vigorous-CE (RSVP in 71–85% of max heart rate) and post-CE (RSVP only). The recorded brain signals demonstrate that the P300 amplitudes, observed at the Pz channel, for the target and non-target responses were significantly different in all four sessions. The results also show decreased reaction times to the visual attention task during vigorous exercise, enriching our understanding of the ways in which exercise can enhance cognitive performance. Even though only a single channel was evaluated in this study, the quality and reliability of the measurement using these dry sensor-based EEG systems is clearly demonstrated by our results. Further, the smooth implementation of the experiment with a dry system and the success of the data analysis demonstrate that wireless dry EEG devices can open avenues for real-time measurement of cognitive functions in athletes outside the laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.620176</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a destructive and burdensome neurodegenerative disease, one of the most common characteristics of which are neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that are composed of abnormal tau protein. Animal studies have suggested that dl-3-n-butylphthalide (dl-NBP) alleviates cognitive impairment in mouse models of APP/PS1 and SAMP8. However, the underlying mechanisms related to this remain unclear. In this study, we examined the effects of dl-NBP on learning and memory in P301S transgenic mice, which carry the human tau gene with the P301S mutation. We found that dl-NBP supplementation effectively improved behavioral deficits and rescued synaptic loss in P301S tau transgenic mice, compared with vehicle-treated P301S mice. Furthermore, we also found that it markedly inhibited the hyperphosphorylated tau at the Ser262 site and decreased the activity of MARK4, which was associated with tau at the Ser262 site. Finally, dl-NBP treatment exerted anti-inflammatory effects and reduced inflammatory responses in P301S mice. In conclusion, our results provide evidence that dl-NBP has a promising potential for the therapy of tauopathies, including AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.601945</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;brain4care, a new Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared non-invasive sensor that monitors intracranial pressure waveforms, was used in a 13-year-old girl who presented with untreatable headaches. The patient had a history of craniopharyngioma resection and a ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement 7 years prior to the use of the device. Secondary obstructive hydrocephalus was also a present factor in the case. The hypothesis was that due to the hydrocephalus, the child presented chronic headaches and needed constant readjustment into the ventriculoperitoneal shunt to regulate the cerebrospinal fluid inside her ventricles in order to control the patient's intracranial pressure (ICP). The device was chosen considering the risks to submit a patient into the regular invasive method to measure ICP. It was identified that the device could also indicate altered intracranial compliance due to the ratio between the P1 and P2 amplitudes (P2/P1 ratio &amp;gt; 1).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, an artificial intelligence segmented dynamic video image based on the process of intensive cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease monitoring is deeply investigated, and a sparse automatic coding deep neural network with a four layers stack structure is designed to automatically extract the deep features of the segmented dynamic video image shot, and six categories of normal, atrial premature, ventricular premature, right bundle branch block, left bundle branch block, and pacing are achieved through hierarchical training and optimization. Accurate recognition of heartbeats with an average accuracy of 99.5%. It provides technical assistance for the intelligent prediction of high-risk cardiovascular diseases like ventricular fibrillation. An intelligent prediction algorithm for sudden cardiac death based on the echolocation network was proposed. By designing an echolocation network with a multilayer serial structure, an intelligent distinction between sudden cardiac death signal and non-sudden death signal was realized, and the signal was predicted 5 min before sudden death occurred, with an average prediction accuracy of 94.32%. Using the self-learning capability of stack sparse auto-coding network, a large amount of label-free data is designed to train the stack sparse auto-coding deep neural network to automatically extract deep representations of plaque features. A small amount of labeled data then introduced to micro-train the entire network. Through the automatic analysis of the fiber cap thickness in the plaques, the automatic identification of thin fiber cap-like vulnerable plaques was achieved, and the average overlap of vulnerable regions reached 87%. The overall time for the automatic plaque and vulnerable plaque recognition algorithm was 0.54 s. It provides theoretical support for accurate diagnosis and endogenous analysis of high-risk cardiovascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.592989</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sleep–wake disruptions are among the most prevalent and burdensome non-motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Clinical studies have demonstrated that these disturbances can precede the onset of typical motor symptoms by years, indicating that they may play a primary function in the pathogenesis of PD. Animal studies suggest that sleep facilitates the removal of metabolic wastes through the glymphatic system via convective flow from the periarterial space to the perivenous space, upregulates antioxidative defenses, and promotes the maintenance of neuronal protein homeostasis. Therefore, disruptions to the sleep–wake cycle have been associated with inefficient metabolic clearance and increased oxidative stress in the central nervous system (CNS). This leads to excessive accumulation of alpha-synuclein and the induction of neuronal loss, both of which have been proposed to be contributing factors to the pathogenesis and progression of PD. Additionally, recent studies have suggested that PD-related pathophysiological alterations during the prodromal phase disrupt sleep and circadian rhythms. Taken together, these findings indicate potential mechanistic interactions between sleep–wake disorders and PD progression as proposed in this review. Further research into the hypothetical mechanisms underlying these interactions would be valuable, as positive findings may provide promising insights into novel therapeutic interventions for PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Tau Deletion Prevents Cognitive Impairment and Mitochondrial Dysfunction Age Associated by a Mechanism Dependent on Cyclophilin-D</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.586710</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aging is an irreversible process and the primary risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Mitochondrial impairment is a process that generates oxidative damage and ATP deficit; both factors are important in the memory decline showed during normal aging and AD. Tau is a microtubule-associated protein, with a strong influence on both the morphology and physiology of neurons. In AD, tau protein undergoes post-translational modifications, which could play a relevant role in the onset and progression of this disease. Also, these abnormal forms of tau could be present during the physiological aging that could be related to memory impairment present during this stage. We previously showed that tau ablation improves mitochondrial function and cognitive abilities in young wild-type mice. However, the possible contribution of tau during aging that could predispose to the development of AD is unclear. Here, we show that tau deletion prevents cognitive impairment and improves mitochondrial function during normal aging as indicated by a reduction in oxidative damage and increased ATP production. Notably, we observed a decrease in cyclophilin-D (CypD) levels in aged tau−/− mice, resulting in increased calcium buffering and reduced mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening. The mPTP is a mitochondrial structure, whose opening is dependent on CypD expression, and new evidence suggests that this could play an essential role in the neurodegenerative process showed during AD. In contrast, hippocampal CypD overexpression in aged tau−/− mice impairs mitochondrial function evidenced by an ATP deficit, increased mPTP opening, and memory loss; all effects were observed in the AD pathology. Our results indicate that the absence of tau prevents age-associated cognitive impairment by maintaining mitochondrial function and reducing mPTP opening through a CypD-dependent mechanism. These findings are novel and represent an important advance in the study of how tau contributes to the cognitive and mitochondrial failure present during aging and AD in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Migraine is a chronic and idiopathic disorder leading to cognitive and affective problems. However, the neural basis of migraine without aura is still unclear. In this study, dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (dALFF) analyses were performed in 21 patients with migraine without aura and 21 gender- and age-matched healthy controls to identify the voxel-level abnormal functional dynamics. Significantly decreased dALFF in the bilateral anterior insula, bilateral lateral orbitofrontal cortex, bilateral medial prefrontal cortex, bilateral anterior cingulate cortex, and left middle frontal cortex were found in patients with migraine without aura. The dALFF values in the anterior cingulate cortex were negatively correlated with pain intensity, i.e., visual analog scale. Finally, support vector machine was used to classify patients with migraine without aura from healthy controls and achieved an accuracy of 83.33%, sensitivity of 90.48%, and specificity of 76.19%. Our findings provide the evidence that migraine influences the brain functional activity dynamics and reveal the neural basis for migraine, which could facilitate understanding the neuropathology of migraine and future treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.606292</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Our prior research demonstrated that the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) exerted a modulatory role in ingroup bias in emotional mimicry. In this study, two experiments were conducted to further explore whether the rTPJ is a neural region for emotional mimicry or for the modulation of emotional mimicry by group membership in a sham-controlled, double-blinded, between-subject design. Both experiments employed non-invasive transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to temporarily change the cortical excitability over the rTPJ and facial electromyography (fEMG) to measure facial muscle activations as an index of emotional mimicry. After the anodal or sham stimulation, participants in Experiment 1 passively viewed a series of happy clips, while participants in Experiment 2 viewed happy clips performed by ethnic ingroup and outgroup models. fEMG analyses revealed that participants in Experiment 1 showed the same degree of happy mimicry for both tDCS conditions (anodal vs. sham) and participants in Experiment 2 showed an ingroup bias in happy mimicry in the sham condition, which disappeared in the anodal condition. Taken together, the present study demonstrated that rTPJ plays a role in the modulation of emotional mimicry by group membership.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Ninety-seven schoolchildren from 8 to 14 years old were tested: a clinical sample of 49 children with ADHD (n = 18), SLD (n = 18) or SLD in comorbidity with ADHD (n = 13), and 48 typically-developing (TD) children matched for age and intelligence. Participants were administered tasks and questionnaires to confirm their initial diagnosis, and a battery of executive function (EF) tasks testing inhibition, shifting, and verbal and visuospatial updating. Using one-way ANOVAs, our results showed that all children in the clinical samples exhibited impairments on EF measures (inhibition and shifting tasks) when compared with TD children. A more specific pattern only emerged for the updating tasks. Only children with SLD had significant impairment in verbal updating, whereas children with ADHD, and those with SLD in comorbidity with ADHD, had the worst performance in visuospatial updating. The clinical and educational implications of these findings are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Criticality, Connectivity, and Neural Disorder: A Multifaceted Approach to Neural Computation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.611183</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It has been hypothesized that the brain optimizes its capacity for computation by self-organizing to a critical point. The dynamical state of criticality is achieved by striking a balance such that activity can effectively spread through the network without overwhelming it and is commonly identified in neuronal networks by observing the behavior of cascades of network activity termed “neuronal avalanches.” The dynamic activity that occurs in neuronal networks is closely intertwined with how the elements of the network are connected and how they influence each other's functional activity. In this review, we highlight how studying criticality with a broad perspective that integrates concepts from physics, experimental and theoretical neuroscience, and computer science can provide a greater understanding of the mechanisms that drive networks to criticality and how their disruption may manifest in different disorders. First, integrating graph theory into experimental studies on criticality, as is becoming more common in theoretical and modeling studies, would provide insight into the kinds of network structures that support criticality in networks of biological neurons. Furthermore, plasticity mechanisms play a crucial role in shaping these neural structures, both in terms of homeostatic maintenance and learning. Both network structures and plasticity have been studied fairly extensively in theoretical models, but much work remains to bridge the gap between theoretical and experimental findings. Finally, information theoretical approaches can tie in more concrete evidence of a network's computational capabilities. Approaching neural dynamics with all these facets in mind has the potential to provide a greater understanding of what goes wrong in neural disorders. Criticality analysis therefore holds potential to identify disruptions to healthy dynamics, granted that robust methods and approaches are considered.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Neurofascin Is a Novel Component of Rod Photoreceptor Synapses in the Outer Retina</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.635849</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural circuit formation is an intricate and complex process where multiple neuron types must come together to form synaptic connections at a precise location and time. How this process is orchestrated during development remains poorly understood. Cell adhesion molecules are known to play a pivotal role in assembling neural circuits. They serve as recognition molecules between corresponding synaptic partners. In this study, we identified a new player in assembling neural circuits in the outer retina, the L1-family cell adhesion molecule Neurofascin (Nfasc). Our data reveals Nfasc is expressed in the synaptic layer where photoreceptors make synaptic connections to their respective partners. A closer examination of Nfasc expression shows high levels of expression in rod bipolars but not in cone bipolars. Disruption of Nfasc using a conditional knockout allele results in selective loss of pre- and post-synaptic proteins in the rod synaptic layer but not in the cone synaptic layer. Electron microscopic analysis confirms that indeed there are abnormal synaptic structures with less dendrites of rod bipolars innervating rod terminals in loss of Nfasc animals. Consistent with these findings, we also observe a decrease in rod-driven retinal responses with disruption of Nfasc function but not in cone-driven responses. Taken together, our data suggest a new role of Nfasc in rod synapses within the mouse outer retina.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Glypicans and Heparan Sulfate in Synaptic Development, Neural Plasticity, and Neurological Disorders</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.595596</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are components of the cell surface and extracellular matrix, which bear long polysaccharides called heparan sulfate (HS) attached to the core proteins. HSPGs interact with a variety of ligand proteins through the HS chains, and mutations in HSPG-related genes influence many biological processes and cause various diseases. In particular, recent findings from vertebrate and invertebrate studies have raised the importance of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored HSPGs, glypicans, as central players in the development and functions of synapses. Glypicans are important components of the synapse-organizing protein complexes and serve as ligands for leucine-rich repeat transmembrane neuronal proteins (LRRTMs), leukocyte common antigen-related (LAR) family receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs), and G-protein-coupled receptor 158 (GPR158), regulating synapse formation. Many of these interactions are mediated by the HS chains of glypicans. Neurexins (Nrxs) are also synthesized as HSPGs and bind to some ligands in common with glypicans through HS chains. Therefore, glypicans and Nrxs may act competitively at the synapses. Furthermore, glypicans regulate the postsynaptic expression levels of ionotropic glutamate receptors, controlling the electrophysiological properties and non-canonical BMP signaling of synapses. Dysfunctions of glypicans lead to failures in neuronal network formation, malfunction of synapses, and abnormal behaviors that are characteristic of neurodevelopmental disorders. Recent human genetics revealed that glypicans and HS are associated with autism spectrum disorder, neuroticism, and schizophrenia. In this review, we introduce the studies showing the roles of glypicans and HS in synapse formation, neural plasticity, and neurological disorders, especially focusing on the mouse and Drosophila as potential models for human diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: D1R- and D2R-Medium-Sized Spiny Neurons Diversity: Insights Into Striatal Vulnerability to Huntington’s Disease Mutation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.628010</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Huntington’s disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder caused by an aberrant expansion of the CAG tract within the exon 1 of the HD gene, HTT. HD progressively impairs motor and cognitive capabilities, leading to a total loss of autonomy and ultimate death. Currently, no cure or effective treatment is available to halt the disease. Although the HTT gene is ubiquitously expressed, the striatum appears to be the most susceptible district to the HD mutation with Medium-sized Spiny Neurons (MSNs) (D1R and D2R) representing 95% of the striatal neuronal population. Why are striatal MSNs so vulnerable to the HD mutation? Particularly, why do D1R- and D2R-MSNs display different susceptibility to HD? Here, we highlight significant differences between D1R- and D2R-MSNs subpopulations, such as morphology, electrophysiology, transcriptomic, functionality, and localization in the striatum. We discuss possible reasons for their selective degeneration in the context of HD. Our review suggests that a better understanding of cell type-specific gene expression dysregulation within the striatum might reveal new paths to therapeutic intervention or prevention to ameliorate HD patients’ life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.624648</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dendrites undergo extensive growth and remodeling during their lifetime. Specification of neurites into dendrites is followed by their arborization, maturation, and functional integration into synaptic networks. Each of these distinct developmental processes is spatially and temporally controlled in an exquisite fashion. Protein kinases through their highly specific substrate phosphorylation regulate dendritic growth and plasticity. Perturbation of kinase function results in aberrant dendritic growth and synaptic function. Not surprisingly, kinase dysfunction is strongly associated with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Herein, we review, (a) key kinase pathways that regulate dendrite structure, function and plasticity, (b) how aberrant kinase signaling contributes to dendritic dysfunction in neurological disorders and (c) emergent technologies that can be applied to dissect the role of protein kinases in dendritic structure and function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Engine Failure in Axo-Myelinic Signaling: A Potential Key Player in the Pathogenesis of Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.610295</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a complex and chronic disease of the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by both degenerative and inflammatory processes leading to axonal damage, demyelination, and neuronal loss. In the last decade, the traditional outside-in standpoint on MS pathogenesis, which identifies a primary autoimmune inflammatory etiology, has been challenged by a complementary inside-out theory. By focusing on the degenerative processes of MS, the axo-myelinic system may reveal new insights into the disease triggering mechanisms. Oxidative stress (OS) has been widely described as one of the means driving tissue injury in neurodegenerative disorders, including MS. Axonal mitochondria constitute the main energy source for electrically active axons and neurons and are largely vulnerable to oxidative injury. Consequently, axonal mitochondrial dysfunction might impair efficient axo-glial communication, which could, in turn, affect axonal integrity and the maintenance of axonal, neuronal, and synaptic signaling. In this review article, we argue that OS-derived mitochondrial impairment may underline the dysfunctional relationship between axons and their supportive glia cells, specifically oligodendrocytes and that this mechanism is implicated in the development of a primary cytodegeneration and a secondary pro-inflammatory response (inside-out), which in turn, together with a variably primed host’s immune system, may lead to the onset of MS and its different subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Ginkgolide B Maintains Calcium Homeostasis in Hypoxic Hippocampal Neurons by Inhibiting Calcium Influx and Intracellular Calcium Release</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.627846</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ginkgolide B (GB), a terpene lactone and active ingredient of Ginkgo biloba, shows protective effects in neuronal cells subjected to hypoxia. We investigated whether GB might protect neurons from hypoxic injury through regulation of neuronal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis. Primary hippocampal neurons subjected to chemical hypoxia (0.7 mM CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in vitro exhibited an increase in cytoplasmic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (measured from the fluorescence of fluo-4), but this effect was significantly diminished by pre-treatment with 0.4 mM GB. Electrophysiological recordings from the brain slices of rats exposed to hypoxia in vivo revealed increases in spontaneous discharge frequency, action potential frequency and calcium current magnitude, and all these effects of hypoxia were suppressed by pre-treatment with 12 mg/kg GB. Western blot analysis demonstrated that hypoxia was associated with enhanced mRNA and protein expressions of Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 (a voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel), STIM1 (a regulator of store-operated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry) and RyR2 (isoforms of Ryanodine Receptor which mediates sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release), and these actions of hypoxia were suppressed by GB. Taken together, our in vitro and in vivo data suggest that GB might protect neurons from hypoxia, in part, by regulating Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx and intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release to maintain Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Interleukin-1β Modulates Synaptic Transmission and Synaptic Plasticity During the Acute Phase of Sepsis in the Senescence-Accelerated Mouse Hippocampus</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.637703</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Aging and pre-existing cognitive impairment are considered to be independent risk factors for sepsis-associated encephalopathy. This study aimed to investigate the manner in which aging and pre-existing cognitive dysfunction modified neuroinflammation, synaptic plasticity, and basal synaptic transmission during the acute phase of sepsis using Senescence-Accelerated Mice Prone 8 (SAMP8) and Senescence-Accelerated Resistant Mice 1 (SAMR1).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We used 6-month-old SAMP8 and SAMR1. Sepsis was induced using cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). The animal’s hippocampi and blood were collected for subsequent investigations 24 h after surgery.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Long-term potentiation (LTP) was impaired in the Shaffer-collateral (SC)-CA1 pathway of the hippocampus in SAMP8 without surgery compared to the age-matched SAMR1, which was reflective of cognitive dysfunction in SAMP8. CLP impaired the SC-CA1 LTP in SAMR1 compared to the sham-operated controls, but not in SAMP8. Moreover, CLP decreased the input-output curve and increased the paired-pulse ratio in SAMP8, suggesting the reduced probability of basal synaptic transmission due to sepsis. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that CLP elevated IL-1β levels, especially in the hippocampi of SAMP8 with microglial activation. In vivo peripheral IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) administration in the septic SAMP8 revealed that the neuroinflammation was not correlated with the peripheral elevation of IL-1β. Ex vivo IL-1ra administration to the hippocampus ameliorated LTP impairment in SAMR1 and the reduction in basal transmission in SAMP8 after sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusions&lt;p&gt;The mechanism of the modulation of synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity by the acute stage of sepsis differed between SAMR1 and SAMP8. These changes were related to centrally derived IL-1 receptor-mediated signaling and were accompanied by microglial activation, especially in SAMP8.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Association Between Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase and Mild Cognitive Impairment in Chinese Women</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.630409</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Dementia, as a global public health problem, is becoming increasingly serious. As a precursor of dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) plays an important role in the diagnosis and prevention of dementia. Recent studies have found a correlation between gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels and cognitive function in men. The relationship between GGT levels and cognitive function in women remains unclear because GGT activity and expression differ between the sexes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: We recruited a total of 2,943 Chinese women from Jidong and Taian in 2019. We grouped the participants according to GGT levels, diagnosed MCI using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) scale, and modeled the study outcomes using logistic regression to explore the relationship between GGT level and MCI. We also analyzed the interaction of obesity, sleep duration, and hyperuricemia with GGT in the development of MCI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The prevalence of MCI increased with increasing GGT level, from the lowest quartile to the highest quartile of GGT: 8.4% (66/786), 14.2% (119/840), 17.6% (108/613), and 21.4% (151/704), respectively. At the same time, as GGT levels increased, so did the risk of MCI. In the fully adjusted model, compared with those for participants in the lowest GGT quartiles, the odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for MCI for participants in the second, third, and fourth GGT quartiles were 1.49 (1.04–2.12), 1.53(1.06–2.21), and 1.88 (1.33–2.65), respectively. The risk of developing MCI was further increased in people with high GGT levels who were obese (OR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.39–2.76, P &amp;lt; 0.001), slept less (OR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.35–2.71, P &amp;lt; 0.001), had high levels of uric acid (OR = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.03–2.32, P &amp;lt; 0.001), or after menopause (OR = 2.92, 95% CI: 2.07–4.12, P &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: We found that MCI is more common in women with elevated GGT levels, so GGT could be a potential diagnostic marker for MCI. Meanwhile, our findings indicated that women with high GGT levels had an increased risk of MCI when they were obese, sleep deprived, had high serum uric acid (SUA) levels or underwent menopause.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.612404</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the major mental health outcomes on dementia patient carers when using psychoeducational programs and psychotherapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A meta-analysis was performed with randomized controlled trials of carers' tele-health interventions from the literature inception to December 31, 2019, using PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases for articles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The meta-analysis identified 1,043 results, of which 11 were randomized control trials. Among all 11 randomized control trials, only one study addressed face-to-face contact with online modules of interventions, four studies addressed telephone-based interventions, two studies reported on combined face-to-face contact and phone call interventions, two studies focused on web-based interventions, one study used video and telephone interventions, and one study conducted a computer-telephone integration system of intervention. The updated evidence suggested that there was more efficacy via tele-health interventions in lowering depression for carers of people with dementia. We outlined the delivery formation of intervention to evaluate the effectiveness and processes of major mental health improvements, including depression, burden, anxiety, and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: In this study, tele-health intervention was shown to significantly lower depression and also lower the risk of mental health impairment. Although there was a significant decrease of depression, there were no significant differences in burden, anxiety, and quality of life. Future researchers are encouraged to carry out larger-scale studies; also, further analysis using a standardized assessment tool is suggested for future multi-component tele-health interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Altered Insular Subregional Connectivity Associated With Cognitions for Distinguishing the Spectrum of Pre-clinical Alzheimer's Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.597455</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) are regarded as part of the pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) spectrum. The insular subregional networks are thought to have diverse intrinsic connectivity patterns that are involved in cognitive and emotional processing. We set out to investigate convergent and divergent altered connectivity patterns of the insular subregions across the spectrum of pre-clinical AD and evaluated how well these patterns can differentiate the pre-clinical AD spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: Functional connectivity (FC) analyses in insular subnetworks were carried out among 38 patients with SCD, 56 patients with aMCI, and 55 normal controls (CNs). Logistic regression analyses were used to construct models for aMCI and CN, as well as SCD and CN classification. Finally, we conducted correlation analyses to measure the relationship between FCs of altered insular subnetworks and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Patients with SCD presented with reduced FC in the bilateral cerebellum posterior lobe and increased FC in the medial frontal gyrus and the middle temporal gyrus. On the other hand, patients with aMCI largely presented with decreased FC in the bilateral inferior parietal lobule, the cerebellum posterior lobe, and the anterior cingulate cortex, as well as increased FC in the medial and inferior frontal gyrus, and the middle and superior temporal gyrus. Logistic regression analyses indicated that a model composed of FCs among altered insular subnetworks in patients with SCD was able to appropriately classify 83.9% of patients with SCD and CN, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.876, 81.6% sensitivity, and 81.8% specificity. A model consisting of altered insular subnetwork FCs in patients with aMCI was able to appropriately classify 86.5% of the patients with aMCI and CNs, with an AUC of 0.887, 80.4% sensitivity, and 83.6% specificity. Furthermore, some of the FCs among altered insular subnetworks were significantly correlated with episodic memory and executive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Patients with SCD and aMCI are likely to share similar convergent and divergent altered intrinsic FC patterns of insular subnetworks as the pre-clinical AD spectrum, and presented with abnormalities among subnetworks. Based on these abnormalities, individuals can be correctly differentiated in the pre-clinical AD spectrum. These results suggest that alterations in insular subnetworks can be utilized as a potential biomarker to aid in conducting a clinical diagnosis of the spectrum of pre-clinical AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Disease‐Modifying Therapies and Coronavirus Disease 2019 Severity in Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26028?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
This study was undertaken to assess the impact of immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies on the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS).


Methods
We retrospectively collected data of PwMS with suspected or confirmed COVID‐19. All the patients had complete follow‐up to death or recovery. Severe COVID‐19 was defined by a 3‐level variable: mild disease not requiring hospitalization versus pneumonia or hospitalization versus intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death. We evaluated baseline characteristics and MS therapies associated with severe COVID‐19 by multivariate and propensity score (PS)‐weighted ordinal logistic models. Sensitivity analyses were run to confirm the results.


Results
Of 844 PwMS with suspected (n = 565) or confirmed (n = 279) COVID‐19, 13 (1.54%) died; 11 of them were in a progressive MS phase, and 8 were without any therapy. Thirty‐eight (4.5%) were admitted to an ICU; 99 (11.7%) had radiologically documented pneumonia; 96 (11.4%) were hospitalized.
After adjusting for region, age, sex, progressive MS course, Expanded Disability Status Scale, disease duration, body mass index, comorbidities, and recent methylprednisolone use, therapy with an anti‐CD20 agent (ocrelizumab or rituximab) was significantly associated (odds ratio [OR] = 2.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.18–4.74, p = 0.015) with increased risk of severe COVID‐19. Recent use (&amp;lt;1 month) of methylprednisolone was also associated with a worse outcome (OR = 5.24, 95% CI = 2.20–12.53, p = 0.001). Results were confirmed by the PS‐weighted analysis and by all the sensitivity analyses.


Interpretation
This study showed an acceptable level of safety of therapies with a broad array of mechanisms of action. However, some specific elements of risk emerged. These will need to be considered while the COVID‐19 pandemic persists. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Depression and Nigral Neuron Density in Lewy Body Spectrum Diseases</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26046?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Parkinson's disease and other Lewy body spectrum diseases (LBDs) are associated with a specific risk for clinical depression. In the present clinicopathological study with 73 LBD patients, we observed that the substantia nigra pars compacta dopamine neuron density was markedly lower in patients who had comorbid depression antemortem than in nondepressed patients (1.52 vs 2.32 n/mm2, p=0.004). There were no differences in cognition, motor disease severity, antiparkinsonian medications or disease duration between groups. The results implicate the substantia nigra as an important psychomotor modulatory area of mood in patients with Lewy body disorders.

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Inferences of glia‐mediated control in Caenorhabditis elegans</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24803?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>In this study we show that the invertebrate cephalic glia (CEPglia) are important regulators of complex behaviors. Caenorhabditis elegans CEPglia are similar to astrocytes and assist in temporally regulating bidirectional communication with neurons and non‐neuronal cells. Thus, CEPglia mediated signaling facilitates the fluent transition between independent behaviors in a complex motor program.

Abstract
Astrocytes modulate synaptic transmission; yet, it remains unclear how glia influence complex behaviors. Here, we explore the effects of Caenorhabditis elegans astrocyte‐like cephalic glia (CEPglia) and the glia‐specific bHLH transcription factor HLH‐17 on mating behavior and the defecation motor program (DMP). In C. elegans, male mating has been explicitly described through the male tail circuit and is characterized by coordination of multiple independent behaviors to ensure that copulation is achieved. Furthermore, the sex‐specific male mating circuitry shares similar components with the DMP, which is complex and rhythmic, and requires a fixed sequence of behaviors to be activated periodically. We found that loss of CEPglia reduced persistence in executing mating behaviors and hindered copulation, while males that lacked HLH‐17 demonstrated repetitive prodding behavior that increased the time spent in mating but did not hinder copulation. During the DMP, we found that posterior body wall contractions (pBocs) and enteric muscle contractions (EMCs) were differentially affected by loss of HLH‐17 or CEPglia in males and hermaphrodites. pBocs and EMCs required HLH‐17 activity in both sexes, whereas loss of CEPglia alone did not affect DMP in males. Our data suggest that CEPglia mediate complex behaviors by signaling to the GABAergic DVB neuron, and that HLH‐17 activity influences those discrete steps within those behaviors. Collectively, these data provide evidence of glia as a link in cooperative regulation of complex and rhythmic behavior that, in C. elegans links circuitry in the head and the tail.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Computational Model of Motion Sickness Describing the Effects of Learning Exogenous Motion Dynamics</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.634604</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The existing computational models used to estimate motion sickness are incapable of describing the fact that the predictability of motion patterns affects motion sickness. Therefore, the present study proposes a computational model to describe the effect of the predictability of dynamics or the pattern of motion stimuli on motion sickness. In the proposed model, a submodel – in which a recursive Gaussian process regression is used to represent human features of online learning and future prediction of motion dynamics – is combined with a conventional model of motion sickness based on an observer theory. A simulation experiment was conducted in which the proposed model predicted motion sickness caused by a 900 s horizontal movement. The movement was composed of a 9 m repetitive back-and-forth movement pattern with a pause. Regarding the motion condition, the direction and timing of the motion were varied as follows: (a) Predictable motion (M_P): the direction of the motion and duration of the pause were set to 8 s; (b) Motion with unpredicted direction (M_dU): the pause duration was fixed as in (M_P), but the motion direction was randomly determined; (c) Motion with unpredicted timing (M_tU): the motion direction was fixed as in (M_P), but the pause duration was randomly selected from 4 to 12 s. The results obtained using the proposed model demonstrated that the predicted motion sickness incidence for (M_P) was smaller than those for (M_dU) and (M_tU) and no considerable difference was found between M_dU and M_tU. This tendency agrees with the sickness patterns observed in a previous experimental study in which the human participants were subject to motion conditions similar to those used in our simulations. Moreover, no significant differences were found in the predicted motion sickness incidences at different conditions when the conventional model was used.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Up and Down States During Slow Oscillations in Slow-Wave Sleep and Different Levels of Anesthesia</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.609645</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Slow oscillations are a pattern of synchronized network activity generated by the cerebral cortex. They consist of Up and Down states, which are periods of activity interspersed with periods of silence, respectively. However, even when this is a unique dynamic regime of transitions between Up and Down states, this pattern is not constant: there is a range of oscillatory frequencies (0.1–4 Hz), and the duration of Up vs. Down states during the cycles is variable. This opens many questions. Is there a constant relationship between the duration of Up and Down states? How much do they vary across conditions and oscillatory frequencies? Are there different sub regimes within the slow oscillations? To answer these questions, we aimed to explore a concrete aspect of slow oscillations, Up and Down state durations, across three conditions: deep anesthesia, light anesthesia, and slow-wave sleep (SWS), in the same chronically implanted rats. We found that light anesthesia and SWS have rather similar properties, occupying a small area of the Up and Down state duration space. Deeper levels of anesthesia occupy a larger region of this space, revealing that a large variety of Up and Down state durations can emerge within the slow oscillatory regime. In a network model, we investigated the network parameters that can explain the different points within our bifurcation diagram in which slow oscillations are expressed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Glycinergic Transmission in the Presence and Absence of Functional GlyT2: Lessons From the Auditory Brainstem</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.560008</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synaptic transmission is controlled by re-uptake systems that reduce transmitter concentrations in the synaptic cleft and recycle the transmitter into presynaptic terminals. The re-uptake systems are thought to ensure cytosolic concentrations in the terminals that are sufficient for reloading empty synaptic vesicles (SVs). Genetic deletion of glycine transporter 2 (GlyT2) results in severely disrupted inhibitory neurotransmission and ultimately to death. Here we investigated the role of GlyT2 at inhibitory glycinergic synapses in the mammalian auditory brainstem. These synapses are tuned for resilience, reliability, and precision, even during sustained high-frequency stimulation when endocytosis and refilling of SVs probably contribute substantially to efficient replenishment of the readily releasable pool (RRP). Such robust synapses are formed between MNTB and LSO neurons (medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, lateral superior olive). By means of patch-clamp recordings, we assessed the synaptic performance in controls, in GlyT2 knockout mice (KOs), and upon acute pharmacological GlyT2 blockade. Via computational modeling, we calculated the reoccupation rate of empty release sites and RRP replenishment kinetics during 60-s challenge and 60-s recovery periods. Control MNTB-LSO inputs maintained high fidelity neurotransmission at 50 Hz for 60 s and recovered very efficiently from synaptic depression. During 'marathon-experiments' (30,600 stimuli in 20 min), RRP replenishment accumulated to 1,260-fold. In contrast, KO inputs featured severe impairments. For example, the input number was reduced to ~1 (vs. ~4 in controls), implying massive functional degeneration of the MNTB-LSO microcircuit and a role of GlyT2 during synapse maturation. Surprisingly, neurotransmission did not collapse completely in KOs as inputs still replenished their small RRP 80-fold upon 50 Hz | 60 s challenge. However, they totally failed to do so for extended periods. Upon acute pharmacological GlyT2 inactivation, synaptic performance remained robust, in stark contrast to KOs. RRP replenishment was 865-fold in marathon-experiments, only ~1/3 lower than in controls. Collectively, our empirical and modeling results demonstrate that GlyT2 re-uptake activity is not the dominant factor in the SV recycling pathway that imparts indefatigability to MNTB-LSO synapses. We postulate that additional glycine sources, possibly the antiporter Asc-1, contribute to RRP replenishment at these high-fidelity brainstem synapses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Astrocytic and Oligodendrocytic P2X7 Receptors Determine Neuronal Functions in the CNS</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.641570</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;P2X7 receptors are members of the ATP-gated cationic channel family with a preferential localization at the microglial cells, the resident macrophages of the brain. However, these receptors are also present at neuroglia (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes) although at a considerably lower density. They mediate necrosis/apoptosis by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as the excitotoxic (glio)transmitters glutamate and ATP. Besides mediating cell damage i.e., superimposed upon chronic neurodegenerative processes in Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson’s Disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, they may also participate in neuroglial signaling to neurons under conditions of high ATP concentrations during any other form of neuroinflammation/neurodegeneration. It is a pertinent open question whether P2X7Rs are localized on neurons, or whether only neuroglia/microglia possess this receptor-type causing indirect effects by releasing the above-mentioned signaling molecules. We suggest as based on molecular biology and functional evidence that neurons are devoid of P2X7Rs although the existence of neuronal P2X7Rs cannot be excluded with absolute certainty.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Glymphatic System as a Gateway to Connect Neurodegeneration From Periphery to CNS</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.639140</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The classic concept of the absence of lymphatic vessels in the central nervous system (CNS), suggesting the immune privilege of the brain in spite of its high metabolic rate, was predominant until recent times. On the other hand, this idea left questioned how cerebral interstitial fluid is cleared of waste products. It was generally thought that clearance depends on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Not long ago, an anatomically and functionally discrete paravascular space was revised to provide a pathway for the clearance of molecules drained within the interstitial space. According to this model, CSF enters the brain parenchyma along arterial paravascular spaces. Once mixed with interstitial fluid and solutes in a process mediated by aquaporin-4, CSF exits through the extracellular space along venous paravascular spaces, thus being removed from the brain. This process includes the participation of perivascular glial cells due to a sieving effect of their end-feet. Such draining space resembles the peripheral lymphatic system, therefore, the term “glymphatic” (glial-lymphatic) pathway has been coined. Specific studies focused on the potential role of the glymphatic pathway in healthy and pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases. This mainly concerns Alzheimer’s disease (AD), as well as hemorrhagic and ischemic neurovascular disorders; other acute degenerative processes, such as normal pressure hydrocephalus or traumatic brain injury are involved as well. Novel morphological and functional investigations also suggested alternative models to drain molecules through perivascular pathways, which enriched our insight of homeostatic processes within neural microenvironment. Under the light of these considerations, the present article aims to discuss recent findings and concepts on nervous lymphatic drainage and blood–brain barrier (BBB) in an attempt to understand how peripheral pathological conditions may be detrimental to the CNS, paving the way to neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.590354</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Low-intensity transcranial ultrasound (LITUS) may have a therapeutic effect on Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients to some extent. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and relaxation time T2&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; that indicate the integrity of fiber tracts and iron concentrations in brain tissue have been used to evaluate the therapeutic effects of LITUS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Purpose: This study aims to use FA and T2&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; values to evaluate the therapeutic effects of LITUS in a PD rat model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials and Methods: Twenty Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into a hemi-PD group (n = 10) and a LITUS group (n = 10). Single-shot spin echo echo-planar imaging and fast low-angle shot T2WI sequences at 3.0 T were used. The FA and T2&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; values on the right side of the substantia nigra (SN) pars compacta were measured to evaluate the therapeutic effect of LITUS in the rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: One week after PD-like signs were induced in the rats, the FA value in the LITUS group was significantly larger compared with the PD group (0.214 ± 0.027 vs. 0.340 ± 0.032, t = 2.864, P = 0.011). At the 5th and 6th weeks, the FA values in the LITUS group were significantly smaller compared with the PD group (5th week: 0.290 ± 0.037 vs. 0.405 ± 0.027, t = 2.385, P = 0.030; 6th week: 0.299 ± 0.021 vs. 0.525 ± 0.028, t = 6.620, P &amp;lt; 0.0001). In the 5th and 6th weeks, the T2&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; values in the injected right SN of the LITUS group were significantly higher compared with the PD group (5th week, 12.169 ± 0.826 in the LITUS group vs. 7.550 ± 0.824 in the PD group; 6th week, 11.749 ± 0.615 in the LITUS group vs. 7.550 ± 0.849 in the PD group).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: LITUS had neuroprotective effects and can reduce the damage of 6-OHDA-induced neurotoxicity in hemi-PD rats. The combination of FA and T2&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; assessments can potentially serve as a new and effective method to evaluate the therapeutic effects of LITUS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Isoquercetin Improves Inflammatory Response in Rats Following Ischemic Stroke</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.555543</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Inflammatory response contributes to brain injury after ischemia and reperfusion (I/R). Our previous literature has shown isoquercetin plays an important role in protecting against cerebral I/R injury. The present study was conducted to further investigate the effect of isoquercetin on inflammation-induced neuronal injury in I/R rats with the involvement of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) and inhibitor of NF-κB (I-κB)/nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway mediated by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and C5a receptor 1 (C5aR1). In vivo middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) rat model and in vitro oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R) neuron model were used. MCAO/R induced neurological deficits, cell apoptosis, and release of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 in ischemic brain in rats. Simultaneously, the expression of TLR4 and C5aR1 was significantly up-regulated in both MCAO/R rats and OGD/R neurons, accompanied with the inhibition of cAMP/PKA signaling and activation of I-κB/NF-κB signaling in the cortex of MCAO/R rats. Over-expression of C5aR1 in neurons induced decrease of cell viability, exerting similar effects with OGD/R injury. Isoquercetin acted as a neuroprotective agent against I/R brain injury to suppress inflammatory response and improve cell recovery by inhibiting TLR4 and C5aR1 expression, promoting cAMP/PKA activation, and inhibiting I-κB/NF-κB activation and Caspase 3 expression. TLR4 and C5aR1 contributed to inflammation and apoptosis via activating cAMP/PKA/I-κB/NF-κB signaling during cerebral I/R, suggesting that this signaling pathway may be a potent therapeutic target in ischemic stroke. Isoquercetin was identified as a neuroprotective agent, which maybe a promising therapeutic agent used for the treatment of ischemic stroke and related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Disturbance of networks was recently proposed to be associated with the occurrence of depression in Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the neurobiological mechanism of depression underlying PD remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;This study was conducted to investigate whether intra-network and inter-network brain connectivity is differently changed in PD patients with and without depression (PDD and PDND patients, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Forty-one PDD patients, 64 PDND patients, and 55 healthy controls (HCs) underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The default mode network (DMN), executive control network (ECN), salience network (SN), precuneus network (PCUN), and sensorimotor network (SMN) were extracted using independent component analysis (ICA), and then the functional connectivity (FC) values within and between these networks were measured.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;PDD patients exhibited abnormal FC values within the DMN, ECN, SN, PCUN, and SMN. In addition, PDD patients demonstrated decreased connectivity between anterior SN (aSN) and bilateral ECN, between posterior SN (pSN) and dorsal DMN (dDMN), and between PCUN and dDMN/SMN/bilateral ECN. Connectivity within the left hippocampus of dDMN and the right medial superior frontal gyrus of aSN was a significant predictor of depression level in PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusions&lt;p&gt;Aberrant intra- and inter-network FC is involved in several important hubs in the large-scale networks, which can be a biomarker for distinguishing PDD from PDND.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.638887</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The loss or absence of vision is probably one of the most incapacitating events that can befall a human being. The importance of vision for humans is also reflected in brain anatomy as approximately one third of the human brain is devoted to vision. It is therefore unsurprising that throughout history many attempts have been undertaken to develop devices aiming at substituting for a missing visual capacity. In this review, we present two concepts that have been prevalent over the last two decades. The first concept is sensory substitution, which refers to the use of another sensory modality to perform a task that is normally primarily sub-served by the lost sense. The second concept is cross-modal plasticity, which occurs when loss of input in one sensory modality leads to reorganization in brain representation of other sensory modalities. Both phenomena are training-dependent. We also briefly describe the history of blindness from ancient times to modernity, and then proceed to address the means that have been used to help blind individuals, with an emphasis on modern technologies, invasive (various type of surgical implants) and non-invasive devices. With the advent of brain imaging, it has become possible to peer into the neural substrates of sensory substitution and highlight the magnitude of the plastic processes that lead to a rewired brain. Finally, we will address the important question of the value and practicality of the available technologies and future directions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Feeling Touched: Empathy Is Associated With Performance in a Tactile Acuity Task</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.593425</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The concept of empathy describes our capacity to understand the emotions and intentions of others and to relate to our conspecifics. Numerous studies investigated empathy as a state as well as a stable personality trait. For example, recent studies in neuroscience suggest, among other brain areas such as the insula or the ACC, a role of the somatosensory cortices for empathy (e.g., when observing someone else being touched). Since the classic understanding of the primary somatosensory cortex is to represent touch on the body surface, we here aimed to test whether tactile performance is linked to the personality trait empathy. To test this, we examined the tactile acuity of 95 healthy participants (mean age 31 years) by using a two-point discrimination threshold task at the index fingers. Trait empathy was assessed by employing the interpersonal reactivity index (IRI), which measures self-reported empathy with four scales (empathic concern, perspective taking, fantasy, and personal distress). Results of regression analyses suggested the subscale empathic concern to be positively associated with performance in the tactile acuity task. We discuss this finding in the light of recent studies on empathy and consider possible implications of tactile training to enhance empathy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Short-Term Plasticity in Cortical GABAergic Synapses on Olfactory Bulb Granule Cells Is Modulated by Endocannabinoids</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.629052</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Olfactory bulb and higher processing areas are synaptically interconnected, providing rapid regulation of olfactory bulb circuit dynamics and sensory processing. Short-term plasticity changes at any of these synapses could modulate sensory processing and potentially short-term sensory memory. A key olfactory bulb circuit for mediating cortical feedback modulation is granule cells, which are targeted by multiple cortical regions including both glutamatergic excitatory inputs and GABAergic inhibitory inputs. There is robust endocannabinoid modulation of excitatory inputs to granule cells and here we explored whether there was also endocannabinoid modulation of the inhibitory cortical inputs to granule cells. We expressed light-gated cation channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in GABAergic neurons in the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca (HDB) and their projections to granule cells in olfactory bulb. Selective optical activation of ChR2 positive axons/terminals generated strong, frequency-dependent short-term depression of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated-IPSC in granule cells. As cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor is heavily expressed in olfactory bulb granule cell layer (GCL) and there is endogenous endocannabinoid release in GCL, we investigated whether activation of CB1 receptor modulated the HDB IPSC and short-term depression at the HDB→granule cell synapse. Activation of the CB1 receptor by the exogenous agonist Win 55,212-2 significantly decreased the peak amplitude of individual IPSC and decreased short-term depression, while blockade of the CB1 receptor by AM 251 slightly increased individual IPSCs and increased short-term depression. Thus, we conclude that there is tonic endocannabinoid activation of the GABAergic projections of the HDB to granule cells, similar to the modulation observed with glutamatergic projections to granule cells. Modulation of inhibitory synaptic currents and frequency-dependent short-term depression could regulate the precise balance of cortical feedback excitation and inhibition of granule cells leading to changes in granule cell mediated inhibition of olfactory bulb output to higher processing areas.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Based Therapy for Stroke: Current Understanding and Challenges</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.628940</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Stroke, the most prevalent cerebrovascular disease, causes serious loss of neurological function and is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite advances in pharmacological and surgical therapy, treatment for functional rehabilitation following stroke is limited with a consequent serious impact on quality of life. Over the past decades, mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs)-based therapy has emerged as a novel strategy for various diseases including stroke due to their unique properties that include easy isolation, multipotent differentiation potential and strong paracrine capacity. Although MSCs have shown promising results in the treatment of stroke, there remain many challenges to overcome prior to their therapeutic application. In this review, we focus on the following issues: the scientific data from preclinical studies and clinical trials of MSCs in the treatment of stroke; the potential mechanisms underlying MSC-based therapy for stroke; the challenges related to the timing and delivery of MSCs and MSC senescence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Different Modular Organization Between Early Onset and Late Onset Depression: A Study Base on Granger Causality Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.625175</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Modular organization reflects the activity patterns of our brain. Different disease states may lead to different activity patterns and clinical features. Early onset depression (EOD) and late onset depression (LOD) share the same clinical symptoms, but have different treatment strategies and prognosis. Thus, explored the modular organization of EOD and LOD might help us understand their pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: The study included 82 patients with late life depression (EOD 40, LOD 42) and 90 healthy controls. We evaluated the memory, executive function and processing speed and performed resting-stage functional MRI for all participants. We constructed a functional network based on Granger causality analysis and carried out modularity, normalized mutual information (NMI), Phi coefficient, within module degree z-score, and participation coefficient analyses for all the participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Result: The Granger function network analysis suggested that the functional modularity was different among the three groups (P&lt;sub&gt;auc&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.0300), and NMI analysis confirmed that the partition of EOD was different from that of LOD (P&lt;sub&gt;auc&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.0190). Rh.10d.ROI (polar frontal cortex) and Rh.IPS1.ROI (dorsal stream visual cortex) were shown to be the potential specific nodes in the modular assignment according to the Phi coefficient (P = 0.0002, P&lt;sub&gt;fdr&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.0744 &amp;amp; P = 0.0004, P&lt;sub&gt;fdr&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.0744).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This study reveal that the functional modularity and partition were different between EOD and LOD in Granger function network. These findings support the hypothesis that different pathological changes might exist in EOD and LOD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Immune Profiling of Parkinson’s Disease Revealed Its Association With a Subset of Infiltrating Cells and Signature Genes</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.605970</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is an age-related and second most common neurodegenerative disorder. In recent years, increasing evidence revealed that peripheral immune cells might be able to infiltrate into brain tissues, which could arouse neuroinflammation and aggravate neurodegeneration. This study aimed to illuminate the landscape of peripheral immune cells and signature genes associated with immune infiltration in PD. Several transcriptomic datasets of substantia nigra (SN) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were separately collected as training cohort, testing cohort, and external validation cohort. The immunoscore of each sample calculated by single-sample gene set enrichment analysis was used to reflect the peripheral immune cell infiltration and to identify the differential immune cell types between PD and healthy participants. According to receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, the immunoscore achieved an overall accuracy of the area under the curve (AUC) = 0.883 in the testing cohort, respectively. The immunoscore displayed good performance in the external validation cohort with an AUC of 0.745. The correlation analysis and logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the correlation between immune cells and PD, and mast cell was identified most associated with the occurrence of PD. Additionally, increased mast cells were also observed in our in vivo PD model. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to selected module genes related to a mast cell. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis and random-forest analysis were used to analyze module genes, and two hub genes RBM3 and AGTR1 were identified as associated with mast cells in the training cohort. The expression levels of RBM3 and AGTR1 in these cohorts and PD models revealed that these hub genes were significantly downregulated in PD. Moreover, the expression trend of the aforementioned two genes differed in mast cells and dopaminergic (DA) neurons. In conclusion, this study not only exhibited a landscape of immune infiltrating patterns in PD but also identified mast cells and two hub genes associated with the occurrence of PD, which provided potential therapeutic targets for PD patients (PDs).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Chronic immobilization stress (CIS) results in sex‐dependent changes in opioid peptide levels and receptor subcellular distributions within the rat dorsal hippocampus, which are paralleled with an inability for males to acquire conditioned place preference (CPP) to oxycodone. Here, RNAScope in situ hybridization was used to determine the expression of hippocampal opioid peptides and receptors in unstressed (US) and CIS estrus female and male adult (∼2.5 months old ) Sprague Dawley rats. In all groups, dentate granule cells expressed PENK and PDYN; additionally, numerous interneurons expressed PENK. OPRD1 and OPRM1 were primarily expressed in interneurons, and to a lesser extent, in pyramidal and granule cells. OPRK1‐was expressed in sparsely distributed interneurons. There were few baseline sex differences: US females compared to US males had more PENK‐expressing and fewer OPRD1‐expressing granule cells and more OPRM1‐expressing CA3b interneurons. Several expression differences emerged after CIS. Both CIS females and males compared to their US counterparts had elevated: (1) PENK‐expressing dentate granule cells and interneurons in CA1 and CA2/3a; (2) OPRD1 probe number and cell expression in CA1, CA2/3a and CA3b and the dentate gyrus; and (3) OPRK1‐expressing interneurons in the dentate hilus. Also, CIS males compared to US males had elevated: (1) PDYN expression in granule cells; (2) OPRD1 probe and interneuron expression in CA2/3a; (3) OPRM1 in granule cells; and (4) OPRK1 interneuron expression in CA2/3a. The sex‐specific changes in hippocampal opioid gene expression may impact network properties and synaptic plasticity processes that may contribute to the attenuation of oxycodone CPP in CIS males.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The Mediator multiprotein complex functions as a regulator of RNA polymerase II–catalyzed gene transcription. In this study, exome sequencing detected biallelic putative disease‐causing variants in MED27, encoding Mediator complex subunit 27, in 16 patients from 11 families with a novel neurodevelopmental syndrome. Patient phenotypes are highly homogeneous, including global developmental delay, intellectual disability, axial hypotonia with distal spasticity, dystonic movements, and cerebellar hypoplasia. Seizures and cataracts were noted in severely affected individuals. Identification of multiple patients with biallelic MED27 variants supports the critical role of MED27 in normal human neural development, particularly for the cerebellum.

	<title>Hippocampus: Hippocampal beta oscillations predict mouse object‐location associative memory performance</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23311?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Memorizing the locations of environmental cues is crucial for survival and depends on the hippocampus. We recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from the hippocampus of freely moving mice during an object location task. The power of beta‐band (23–30 Hz) oscillations increased immediately before approaching objects in a memory‐encoding phase. The exploration‐induced beta oscillations gradually decreased during the memory‐encoding session. Mice that exhibited stronger beta oscillation power exhibited better performance in the subsequent memory‐retrieval test. These results suggest that beta oscillations in the hippocampal CA1 region are involved in the memory encoding of object‐location associations.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Astrocytes in rare neurological conditions: Morphological and functional considerations</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25118?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Astrocytes are essential cells of the CNS with several functions relating to neuronal and overall homeostasis. As a result, astrocytic dysfunction can cause widespread detrimental effects. There still exist numerous rare neurological conditions in which astrocytic involvement is only beginning to be explored. Accordingly, we will detail the role of astrocytes in over 40+ rare neurological conditions through the lens of function and morphology and highlight remaining neuropathologies where astrocytic involvement has yet to be investigated.







Abstract
Astrocytes are a population of central nervous system (CNS) cells with distinctive morphological and functional characteristics that differ within specific areas of the brain and are widely distributed throughout the CNS. There are mainly two types of astrocytes, protoplasmic and fibrous, which differ in morphologic appearance and location. Astrocytes are important cells of the CNS that not only provide structural support, but also modulate synaptic activity, regulate neuroinflammatory responses, maintain the blood–brain barrier, and supply energy to neurons. As a result, astrocytic disruption can lead to widespread detrimental effects and can contribute to the pathophysiology of several neurological conditions. The characteristics of astrocytes in more common neuropathologies such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease have significantly been described and continue to be widely studied. However, there still exist numerous rare neurological conditions in which astrocytic involvement is unknown and needs to be explored. Accordingly, this review will summarize functional and morphological changes of astrocytes in various rare neurological conditions based on current knowledge thus far and highlight remaining neuropathologies where astrocytic involvement has yet to be investigated.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24802?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Evidence from everyday life suggests that differences in social behaviors between males and females exist, both in animal and in humans. These differences can be related to socio‐cultural determinants, but also to specialized portions of the brain (the social brain), from the neurotransmitter to the neural network level. The high vulnerability of this system is expressed by the wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders associated with social dysfunctions, particularly social withdrawal. The principal psychiatric disorders with prominent social withdrawal are described, including hikikomori‐like syndromes, and anxiety, depressive, autistic, schizophrenic, and personality disorders. It is hypothesized that social withdrawal can be partially independent from other symptoms and likely reflect alterations in the social brain itself, leading to a similar, transdiagnostic social dysfunction, reflecting defects in the social brain across a variety of psychopathological conditions. An overview is provided of gender effects in the biological determinants of social behavior, including: the anatomical structures of the social brain; the dimorphic brain structures, and the modulation of their development by sex steroids; gender differences in “social” neurotransmitters (vasopressin and oxytocin), and in their response to social stress. A better comprehension of gender differences in the phenotypes of social disorders and in the neural bases of social behaviors may provide new insights for timely, focused, innovative, and gender‐specific treatments.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Neural correlates of visuoperceptive changes in severe alcohol use disorder: A critical review of neuroimaging and electrophysiological findings</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24799?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Visuoperceptive deficits are frequently reported in severe alcohol use disorder (SAUD) and are considered as pervasive and persistent in time. While this topic of investigation has previously driven researchers' interest, far fewer studies have focused on visuoperception in SAUD since the ‘90s, leaving open central questions regarding the origin and implications of these deficits. To renew research in the field and provide a solid background to work upon, this paper reviews the neural correlates of visuoperception in SAUD, based on data from neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies. Results reveal structural and functional changes within the visual system but also in the connections between occipital and frontal areas. We highlight the lack of integration of these findings in the dominant models of vision which stress the dynamic nature of the visual system and consider the presence of both bottom‐up and top‐down cerebral mechanisms. Visuoperceptive changes are also discussed in the framework of long‐lasting debates regarding the influence of demographic and alcohol‐related factors, together stressing the presence of inter‐individual differences. Capitalizing on this review, we provide guidelines to inform future research, and ultimately improve clinical care.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: ApoE4 reduction with ASOs decreases neurodegeneration in a tauopathy model</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26043?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype is the strongest genetic risk factor for late‐onset Alzheimer's disease with the ε4 allele increasing risk in a dose‐dependent fashion. In addition to ApoE4 playing a crucial role in amyloid‐β deposition, recent evidence suggests that it also plays an important role in tau pathology and tau‐mediated neurodegeneration. It is not known, however, whether therapeutic reduction of ApoE4 would exert protective effects on tau‐mediated neurodegeneration.


Methods
Herein, we utilized antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) against human APOE to reduce ApoE4 levels in the P301S/ApoE4 mouse model of tauopathy. We treated P301S/ApoE4 mice with ApoE or control ASOs via intracerebroventricular injection at 6 months and 7.5 months of age and performed brain pathological assessments at 9 months of age.


Results
Our results indicate that treatment with ApoE ASOs reduced ApoE4 protein levels by ~50%, significantly protected against tau pathology and associated neurodegeneration, decreased neuroinflammation, and preserved synaptic density. These data were also corroborated by a significant reduction in levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL) protein in plasma of ASO‐treated mice.


Interpretation
We conclude that reducing ApoE4 levels should be further explored as a therapeutic approach for APOE4 carriers with tauopathy including Alzheimer's disease.

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Cortical connections of the functional domain for climbing or running in posterior parietal cortex of galagos</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25123?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>A domain for combined forelimb and hindlimb movements in posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of galagos was identified. This domain had dense intrinsic connections within PPC and reciprocal connections with frontal and parietal sensorimotor areas of the ipsilateral cortex. It also had connections with the homotopic region of the contralateral cortex.






Abstract
Previous studies in prosimian galagos (Otolemur garnetti) have demonstrated that posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is subdivided into several functionally distinct domains, each of which mediates a specific type of complex movements (e.g., reaching, grasping, hand‐to‐mouth) and has a different pattern of cortical connections. Here we identified a medially located domain in PPC where combined forelimb and hindlimb movements, as if climbing or running, were evoked by long‐train intracortical microstimulation (LT‐ICMS). We injected anatomical tracers in this climbing/running domain of PPC to reveal its cortical connections. Our results showed the PPC climbing domain had dense intrinsic connections within rostral PPC and reciprocal connections with forelimb and hindlimb region in primary motor cortex (M1) of the ipsilateral hemisphere. Fewer connections were with dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), supplementary motor (SMA) and cingulate motor (CMA) areas, as well as somatosensory cortex including areas 3a, 3b and 1‐2, secondary somatosensory (S2), parietal ventral (PV) and retroinsular (Ri) areas. The rostral portion of the climbing domain had more connections with primary somatosensory cortex than the caudal portion. Cortical projections were found in functionally matched domains in M1 and premotor cortex (PMC). Similar patterns of connections with fewer labeled neurons and terminals were seen in the contralateral hemisphere. These connection patterns are consistent with the proposed role of the climbing/running domain as part of a parietal‐frontal network for combined use of the limbs in locomotion as in climbing and running. The cortical connections identify this action‐specific domain in PPC as a more somatosensory driven domain.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Adults with cerebral palsy require ongoing neurologic care: A systematic review</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26040?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Cerebral palsy (CP) neurologic care and research efforts typically focus on children. However, most people with CP are adults. Adults with CP are at increased risk of new neurologic conditions, like stroke and myelopathy, that require ongoing neurologic surveillance to distinguish them from baseline motor impairments. Neurologic factors could also contribute to the motor function decline, chronic pain, and chronic fatigue that are commonly experienced by adults with CP. Based on a systematic literature review, we suggest: 1) guidelines for neurologic surveillance and neurologist referral; and 2) clinical research questions regarding the evolving neurologic risks for adults with CP.

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Differential development of myelin in zebra finch song nuclei</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25019?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>The forebrain song nuclei in adult songbirds exhibit distinct myelination patterns, yet little is known about myelin development. We demonstrate different developmental rates and final levels of myelination across five major song nuclei. This differential myelin development could contribute to different aspects of song acquisition and production.







Abstract
Songbirds learn vocalizations by hearing and practicing songs. As song develops, the tempo becomes faster and more precise. In the songbird brain, discrete nuclei form interconnected myelinated circuits that control song acquisition and production. The myelin sheath increases the speed of action potential propagation by insulating the axons of neurons and by reducing membrane capacitance. As the brain develops, myelin increases in density, but the time course of myelin development across discrete song nuclei has not been systematically studied in a quantitative fashion. We tested the hypothesis that myelination develops differentially across time and song nuclei. We examined myelin development in the brains of the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) from chick at posthatch day (d) 8 to adult (up to 147 d) in five major song nuclei: HVC (proper name), robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA), Area X, lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium, and medial portion of the dorsolateral thalamic nucleus (DLM). All of these nuclei showed an increase in the density of myelination during development but at different rates and to different final degrees. Exponential curve fits revealed that DLM showed earlier myelination than other nuclei, and HVC showed the slowest myelination of song nuclei. Together, these data show differential maturation of myelination in different portions of the song system. Such differential maturation would be well placed to play a role in regulating the development of learned song.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: A proteomic view on the differential phenotype of Schwann cells derived from mouse sensory and motor nerves</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25018?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Schwann cells (SCs) were found to have sensory and motor phenotypes and associated with the modality specific promotion of sensory and motor nerve regeneration. To explore the differences between them, we established a workflow to obtain highly purified SCs derived from sensory nerve (SNdSCs) and motor nerve (MNdSCs) from B6; D2‐Tg(s100B‐EGFP)1Wjt/J mice. The SNdSCs and MNdSCs were isolated from dorsal and ventral roots by FACS sorting. The proteome of SNdSCs and MNdSCs was compared by a quantitative proteomic analysis based on iTRAQ labeling and the mouse Schwann proteome was obtained. Several differentially expressed proteins between SNdSCs and MNdSCs were verified.







Abstract
Schwann cells (SCs) are myelin‐forming glial cells of the peripheral nervous system. Recent studies suggested that SCs comprise two phenotypes: sensory SCs and motor SCs, which are associated with the modality‐specific promotion of sensory and motor axon growth during peripheral neuronal regeneration. However, the molecular basis of the two phenotypic SCs is unclear. We established a workflow to obtain highly purified SCs derived from sensory nerve (SNdSCs) and motor nerve (MNdSCs) from B6; D2‐Tg(s100B‐EGFP)1Wjt/J mice. Subsequently, a quantitative proteomic analysis based on iTRAQ labeling was performed to compare the proteome of SNdSCs and MNdSCs. A total of 6,567 proteins were identified, of which 63 and 11 proteins were overexpressed in SNdSCs and MNdSCs, respectively. Three of the overexpressed proteins were further validated by western blot and immunocytochemistry: GMFB and CNPase, which were overexpressed in sensory SNdSCs, and histone H4, which was overexpressed in MNdSCs. The expression pattern of the three proteins was also validated in the dorsal roots and ventral roots. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that proteins highly expressed in SNdSCs are mainly involved in RNA processing and protein synthesis, while those overexpressed in MNdSCs are related to cell proliferation. Real‐time cell analysis confirmed that the proliferation activity of MNdSCs is higher than that of SNdSCs. This study is the first to provide a proteomic view of the differential phenotype of mouse SNdSCs and MNdSCs. The data may serve as a valuable source for the study of the biological characteristics of these two SC phenotypes and their roles in nerve‐specific regeneration.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25017?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Using the capacity of a systemic growth hormone (GH) injection to induce STAT5 phosphorylation in the mouse brain, we identified several neurochemically distinct neuronal populations in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus that are directly responsive to GH, including tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)‐, somatostatin (SST)‐, thyrotropin‐releasing hormone (TRH)‐ and corticotropin‐releasing hormone (CRH)‐producing neurons.







Abstract
Multiple neuroendocrine, autonomic and behavioral responses are regulated by the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH). Previous studies have shown that PVH neurons express the growth hormone (GH) receptor (GHR), although the role of GH signaling on PVH neurons is still unknown. Given the great heterogeneity of cell types located in the PVH, we performed a detailed analysis of the neurochemical identity of GH‐responsive cells to understand the possible physiological importance of GH action on PVH neurons. GH‐responsive cells were detected via the phosphorylated form of the signal transducer and activator of transcription‐5 (pSTAT5) in adult male mice that received an intraperitoneal GH injection. Approximately 51% of GH‐responsive cells in the PVH co‐localized with the vesicular glutamate transporter 2. Rare co‐localizations between pSTAT5 and vesicular GABA transporter or vasopressin were observed, whereas approximately 20% and 38% of oxytocin and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) cells, respectively, were responsive to GH in the PVH. Approximately 55%, 35% and 63% of somatostatin, thyrotropin‐releasing hormone (TRH) and corticotropin‐releasing hormone (CRH) neurons expressed GH‐induced pSTAT5, respectively. Additionally, 8%, 49% and 75% of neuroendocrine TH, TRH and CRH neurons, and 67%, 32% and 74% of nonneuroendocrine TH, TRH and CRH neurons were responsive to GH in the PVH of Fluoro‐Gold‐injected mice. Our findings suggest that GH action on PVH neurons is involved in the regulation of the thyroid, somatotropic and adrenal endocrine axes, possibly influencing homeostatic and stress responses.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: A natural endocast of an early Miocene odontocete and its implications in cetacean brain evolution</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25015?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>A 19‐to‐16 million year old natural endocast of an odontocete whale is described and compared. The exceptional preservation allowed the identification of major neural and vascular characters opening a window into the cetacean brain evolution. The encephalization quotient and other statistical analyses revealed that this endocast belonged to a well encephalized, early‐diverging toothed whale and helped in interpreting a number of morphological changes in odontocete brain evolution.







Abstract
The natural endocast Museo di Geologia e Paleontologia of the Università degli Studi di Torino (MGPT)‐PU 13873 is described and analyzed in order to interpret its taxonomic affinities and its potential significance on our understanding of cetacean brain evolution. The endocast is from the early Miocene of Piedmont (between ca. 19 and 16 million years ago), Northwestern Italy, and shows a number of plesiomorphic characters. These include: scarcely rounded cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum exposed in dorsal view with little superimposition by the cerebral hemispheres, short temporal lobe, and long sylvian fissure. The distance between the hypophysis and the rostral pons is particularly high, as it was determined by the calculus of the hypothalamus quotient, suggesting that the development of a deep interpeduncular fossa was not as advanced as in living odontocetes. The encephalization quotient (EQ) of MGPT‐PU 13873 is ~1.81; therefore, this specimen shows an EQ in line with other fossil whales of the same geological age (early Miocene). Comparative analysis shows that there is a critical lack of data from the late Miocene and Pliocene that prevents us to fully understand the recent evolution of the EQ diversity in whales. Moreover, the past diversity of brain size and shape in mysticetes is virtually unknown. All these observations point to the need of additional efforts to uncover evolutionary patterns and processes on cetacean brain evolution.</content:encoded>

Abstract
Studying retinal specializations offers insights into eye functionality and visual ecology. Using light microscopic techniques, including retinal whole‐mounts, we investigated photoreceptor densities in the retina of the skate Leucoraja erinacea. We show that photoreceptors are not sized or oriented in the same way, and that they are not evenly distributed across the retina. There was a dorsally located horizontal visual streak with increased photoreceptor density, with additional local maxima in which densities were highest. Photoreceptors were longest and thinnest inside this visual streak, becoming shorter and thicker toward the periphery and toward the ventral retina. Furthermore, in the peripheral retinal parts, photoreceptors (particularly the outer segments) were noticeably tilted with respect to the retinal long axis. In order to understand how photoreceptors are tilted inside the eye, we used computerized tomography (CT) and micro‐CT, to obtain geometrical dimensions of the whole skate eye. These CT/micro‐CT data provided us with the outlines of the skate eye and the location of the retina and this enabled us to reconstruct how photoreceptors tilt in an intact eye. Findings were analyzed relative to previously published ganglion cell distributions in this species, showing a posteriorly located retinal area with photoreceptor: ganglion cell convergence as low as 39:1. Some peripheral areas showed ratios as high as 391:1. We frame our findings in terms of the animal's anatomy: body and eye shape, specifically the location of the tapetum, as well as the visual demands associated with lifestyle and habitat type. A speculative function in polarization sensitivity is discussed.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>VTA MC3R neurons are a likely site of interaction between homeostatic and hedonic feeding circuits.
VTA MC3R neurons send efferent projections to, and receive afferent input from, multiple brain regions involved in feeding, reward, and aversion.
Very few POMC and AgRP neurons were labeled by monosynaptic rabies from multiple VTA neuron subtypes.









Abstract
The mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system is involved in the regulation of multiple behaviors, including feeding, and evidence demonstrates that the melanocortin system can act on the mesolimbic DA system to control feeding and other behaviors. The melanocortin‐3 receptor (MC3R) is an important component of the melanocortin system, but its overall role is poorly understood. Because MC3Rs are highly expressed in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and are likely to be the key interaction point between the melanocortin and mesolimbic DA systems, we set out to identify both the efferent projection patterns of VTA MC3R neurons and the location of the neurons providing afferent input to them. VTA MC3R neurons were broadly connected to neurons across the brain but were strongly connected to a discrete set of brain regions involved in the regulation of feeding, reward, and aversion. Surprisingly, experiments using monosynaptic rabies virus showed that proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and agouti‐related protein (AgRP) neurons in the arcuate nucleus made few direct synapses onto VTA MC3R neurons or any of the other major neuronal subtypes in the VTA, despite being extensively labeled by general retrograde tracers injected into the VTA. These results greatly contribute to our understanding of the anatomical interactions between the melanocortin and mesolimbic systems and provide a foundation for future studies of VTA MC3R neurons and the circuits containing them in the control of feeding and other behaviors.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25012?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Whole mount immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy were used on juveniles of three echinoderm species to characterize their neuroanatomy. Detailed comparisons confirmed the conservation, among the three species, of a similar general neuroanatomical organization and revealed equivalent innervation patterns at the level of the appendages (i.e., the podia and the spines).







Abstract
The echinoderms are a phylum of marine deuterostomes characterized by the pentaradial (five fold) symmetry of their adult bodies. Due to this unusual body plan, adult echinoderms have long been excluded from comparative analyses aimed at understanding the origin and evolution of deuterostome nervous systems. Here, we investigated the neural anatomy of early juveniles of representatives of three of the five echinoderm classes: the echinoid Paracentrotus lividus, the asteroid Patiria miniata, and the holothuroid Parastichopus parvimensis. Using whole mount immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy, we found that the nervous system of echinoid early juveniles is composed of three main structures: a basiepidermal nerve plexus, five radial nerve cords connected by a circumoral nerve ring, and peripheral nerves innervating the appendages. Our whole mount preparations further allowed us to obtain thorough descriptions of these structures and of several innervation patterns, in particular at the level of the appendages. Detailed comparisons of the echinoid juvenile nervous system with those of asteroid and holothuroid juveniles moreover supported a general conservation of the main neural structures in all three species, including at the level of the appendages. Our results support the previously proposed hypotheses for the existence of two neural units in echinoderms: one consisting of the basiepidermal nerve plexus to process sensory stimuli locally and one composed of the radial nerve cords and the peripheral nerves constituting a centralized control system. This study provides the basis for more in‐depth comparisons of the echinoderm adult nervous system with those of other animals, in particular hemichordates and chordates, to address the long‐standing controversies about deuterostome nervous system evolution.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Ivanova et al., use sparse labeling of mural cells in the retina to identify pericyte diversity and to selectively manipulate capillary blood flow.







Abstract
Pericytes are a unique class of mural cells essential for angiogenesis, maintenance of the vasculature and are key players in microvascular pathology. However, their diversity and specific roles are poorly understood, limiting our insight into vascular physiology and the ability to develop effective therapies. Here, in the mouse retina, a tractable model of the CNS, we evaluated distinct classes of mural cells along the vascular tree for both structural characterization and physiological manipulation of blood flow. To accomplish this, we first tested three inducible mural cell‐specific mouse lines using a sensitive Ai14 reporter and tamoxifen application either by a systemic injection, or by local administration in the form of eye drops. The specificity and pattern of cre activation varied significantly across the three lines, under either the PDGFRβ or NG2 promoter (Pdgfrβ‐CreRha, Pdgfrβ‐CreCsln, and Cspg4‐Cre). In particular, a mouse line with Cre under the NG2 promoter resulted in sparse TdTomato labeling of mural cells, allowing for an unambiguous characterization of anatomical features of individual sphincter cells and capillary pericytes. Furthermore, in one PDGFRβ line, we found that focal eye drop application of tamoxifen led to an exclusive Cre‐activation in pericytes, without affecting arterial mural cells. We then used this approach to boost capillary blood flow by selective expression of Halorhodopsin, a highly precise hyperpolarizing optogenetic actuator. The ability to exclusively target capillary pericytes may prove a precise and potentially powerful tool to treat microcirculation deficits, a common pathology in numerous diseases.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Dendritic spine abnormalities correlate with behavioral and cognitive deficits in mouse models of Lafora disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25006?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Alterations in dendritic spine morphology are known to associate with cognitive dysfunctions in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. In this study, we analyzed the dendritic spine morphologies in the mouse model for Lafora disease (LD)—a fatal form of epileptic disorder associated with cognitive defects. We found a significant increase in the density, length, and reduction in the width of the dendritic spines from the postnatal period onwards. These animals also exhibited hyperactivity, reduced anxiety‐like behavior, and deficits in the spatial and nonspatial memory. Thus, dendritic spine abnormalities appear to be a primary developmental defect in the LD mouse model and may contribute to the cognitive deficits in the disease.







Abstract
Lafora disease (LD) is a genetic and fatal form of neurodegenerative disorder characterized by myoclonic epilepsy and cognitive deficits. LD is caused by loss‐of‐function mutations in the EPM2A or the NHLRC1 gene. A major hallmark of LD is the presence of abnormal glycogen aggregates in neurons and other tissues. Functional studies on the genes have, therefore, mostly focused on glycogen metabolism. The physiological basis of cognitive deficits in LD is thus largely unexplored. Alterations in dendritic spine morphology are known in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. We, therefore, analyzed the dendritic spine morphologies in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampal and Cortical layer V of the Epm2a or Nhlrc1 knockout mice brain. We found a significant increase in the density, length, and reduction in the width of the dendritic spines in Postnatal day 21 to 12‐month‐old LD animals. Similar observations were made in the primary cultures of neurons derived from the hippocampi of the embryonic brain, suggesting that the aberrant spine phenotype could be a developmental defect in LD. We also looked at the cognitive and behavioral deficits as a possible readout of the spine abnormalities. The LD animals exhibited hyperactivity, reduced anxiety‐like behavior, and deficits in the spatial and nonspatial memory. Such abnormalities were seen in the younger (1–2 months) as well as the older (7–8 months) age groups. Taken together, our results suggest that the dendritic spine abnormalities are primary developmental defects in the LD model and these defects might underlie some of the symptoms, including cognitive deficits, in LD.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26041?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Patients with COVID‐19 can present with distinct neurological manifestations. This study shows that inflammatory neurological diseases were associated with increased levels of IL‐2, IL‐4, IL‐6, IL‐10, IL‐12, CXCL8, and CXCL10 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Conversely, encephalopathy was associated with high serum levels of IL‐6, CXCL8, and active TGF‐β1. Inflammatory syndromes of the central nervous system (CNS) in COVID‐19 can appear early, as a para‐infectious process without significant systemic involvement, or without direct evidence of SARS‐CoV‐2 neuroinvasion. At the same time, encephalopathy is mainly influenced by peripheral events, including inflammatory cytokines.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Endosome dysregulation in Down syndrome: a potential contributor to Alzheimer's disease pathology</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26042?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Intracellular protein trafficking via the endosomes plays a key role in the maintenance of normal neuronal function. Although many diseases of the central nervous system exhibit specific pathological hallmarks, abnormalities of the endosome system are common traits for several of them including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Three main routes originate from the endosomes: the recycling, the degradation and the retrograde pathway. Studies have shown that the majority of Down syndrome subjects develop AD pathology and manifest altered morphology and number of endosomes, abnormalities in lysosome acidification and exosome secretion suggesting that dysfunction of one of these pathways could play a functional role in the AD‐like phenotype of the syndrome. Two of the major endosomal routes are mediated by the retromer complex, a multimeric system responsible for transport of cargo from the endosome to the trans‐Golgi network or to the cell membrane. Recently, a new endosome system structurally related to the retromer, called “retriever’, has been reported. While we know a lot about the neuropathophysiology of the retromer complex, no precise pathogenic role for the retriever has been identified yet. Here, we will review the neurobiology of the endosome system and its role as key player in the development of AD‐like pathology in Down syndrome. Additionally, we will discuss current knowledge on these two main endosome systems, retromer and retriever, and their potential as novel therapeutic targets.

	<content:encoded>Morphology of Satb2 expressing ganglion cells in macaque, human, and marmoset retinas. The study shows that Satb2 expression in retinal ganglion cells is not conserved across Old World and New World primate species.







Abstract
In primates, the retinal ganglion cells contributing to high acuity spatial vision (midget cells and parasol cells), and blue‐yellow color vision (small bistratified cells) are well understood. Many other ganglion cell types with large dendritic fields (named wide‐field ganglion cells) have been identified, but their spatial density and distribution are largely unknown. Here we took advantage of the recently established molecular diversity of ganglion cells to study wide‐field ganglion cell populations in three primate species. We used antibodies against the transcription factor Special AT‐rich binding protein 2 (Satb2) to explore its expression in macaque (Macaca fascicularis, M. nemestrina), human and marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) retinas. In all three species, Satb2 cells make up a low proportion (1.5–4%) of the ganglion cell population, with a slight increase from central to peripheral retina. Intracellular dye injections revealed that in macaque and human retinas, the large majority (over 80%) of Satb2 cells are inner and outer stratifying large sparse cells. By contrast, in marmoset retina the majority (over 60%) of Satb2 expressing cells were broad thorny cells, with smaller proportions of recursive bistratified (putative direction‐selective), large bistratified, and outer stratifying narrow thorny cells. Our findings imply that Satb2 expression has undergone rapid species specific adaptations during primate evolution, because expression is not conserved across Old World (macaque, human) and New World (marmoset) suborders.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Cross‐regional phase amplitude coupling supports the encoding of episodic memories</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23309?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Phase amplitude coupling (PAC) between theta and gamma oscillations represents a key neurophysiological mechanism that promotes the temporal organization of oscillatory activity. For this reason, PAC has been implicated in item/context integration for episodic processes, including coordinating activity across multiple cortical regions. While data in humans has focused principally on PAC within a single brain region, data in rodents has revealed evidence that the phase of the hippocampal theta oscillation modulates gamma oscillations in the cortex (and vice versa). This pattern, termed cross‐regional PAC (xPAC), has not previously been observed in human subjects engaged in mnemonic processing. We use a unique dataset with intracranial electrodes inserted simultaneously into the hippocampus and seven cortical regions across 40 human subjects to (1) test for the presence of significant cross‐regional PAC (xPAC), (2) to establish that the magnitude of xPAC predicts memory encoding success, (3) to describe specific frequencies within the broad 2–9 Hz theta range that govern hippocampal‐cortical interactions in xPAC, and (4) compare anterior versus posterior hippocampal xPAC patterns. We find that strong functional xPAC occurs principally between the hippocampus and other mesial temporal structures, namely entorhinal and parahippocampal cortices, and that xPAC is overall stronger for posterior hippocampal connections. We also show that our results are not confounded by alternative factors such as inter‐regional phase synchrony, local PAC occurring within cortical regions, or artifactual theta oscillatory waveforms.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Multisite Study of Evoked Potentials in Rett Syndrome</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26029?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
The aim of the current study was to evaluate the utility of evoked potentials as a biomarker of cortical function in Rett syndrome (RTT). As a number of disease‐modifying therapeutics are currently under development, there is a pressing need for biomarkers to objectively and precisely assess the effectiveness of these treatments.


Method
Yearly visual evoked potentials (VEPs) and auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) were acquired from individuals with RTT, aged 2 to 37 years, and control participants across 5 sites as part of the Rett Syndrome and Related Disorders Natural History Study. Baseline and year 1 data, when available, were analyzed and the repeatability of the results was tested. Two syndrome‐specific measures from the Natural History Study were used for evaluating the clinical relevance of the VEP and AEP parameters.


Results
At the baseline study, group level comparisons revealed reduced VEP and AEP amplitude in RTT compared to control participants. Further analyses within the RTT group indicated that this reduction was associated with RTT‐related symptoms, with greater severity associated with lower VEP and AEP amplitude. In participants with RTT, VEP and AEP amplitude was also negatively associated with age. Year 1 follow‐up data analyses yielded similar findings and evidence of repeatability of EPs at the individual level.


Interpretation
The present findings indicate the promise of evoked potentials (EPs) as an objective measure of disease severity in individuals with RTT. Our multisite approach demonstrates potential research and clinical applications to provide unbiased assessment of disease staging, prognosis, and response to therapy.

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.628818</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Impairment of spatial memory, including an inability to recall previous locations and navigate the world, is often one of the first signs of functional disability on the road to cognitive impairment. While there are many screening and diagnostic tools which attempt to measure spatial memory ability, they are often not representative of real-life situations and can therefore lack applicability. One potential solution to this problem involves the use of virtual reality (VR), which immerses individuals in a virtually-simulated environment, allowing for scenarios more representative of real-life without any of the associated risks. Here, we review the evidence surrounding the use of VR for the screening and diagnosis of spatial memory impairments, including potential limitations and how it compares to standard neuropsychological tests. We will also discuss the evidence regarding the potential use of VR in the rehabilitation of spatial memory deficits, which has not been well studied, but which could be game-changing if proven successful.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: A systematic review of noninflammatory cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for clinical outcome in neonates with perinatal hypoxic brain injury that could be biologically significant</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24801?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Neonatal encephalopathy (NE) that purportedly arises from hypoxia‐ischemia is labeled hypoxic‐ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Perinatal asphyxia is a clinical syndrome involving acidosis, a low Apgar score and the need for resuscitation in the delivery room; asphyxia alerts one to the possibility of NE. In the present systematic review, we focused on the noninflammatory biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that are involved in the development of possible brain injury in asphyxia or HIE. A literature search in PubMed and EMBASE for case–control studies was conducted and 17 studies were found suitable by a priori criteria. Statistical analysis used the Mantel–Haenszel model for dichotomous data. The pooled mean difference and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined. We identified the best biomarkers, based on the estimation approach in evaluating the biological significance, out of hundreds in three categories: cell adhesion and proliferation, oxidants and antioxidants, and cell damage. The following subtotal‐population comparisons were made: perinatal asphyxia versus no asphyxia, asphyxia with HIE versus asphyxia without HIE, asphyxia with HIE versus no asphyxia, and term versus preterm HIE newborn with asphyxia. Biological significance of the biomarkers was determined by using a modification of the estimation approach, by ranking the biomarkers according to the difference in the bounds of the CIs. The most promising CSF biomarkers for prognostication especially for the severest HIE include creatine kinase, xanthine oxidase, vascular endothelial growth factor, neuron‐specific enolase, superoxide dismutase, and malondialdehyde. Future studies are recommended using such a combined test to prognosticate the most severely affected patients.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: PKN1 Is a Novel Regulator of Hippocampal GluA1 Levels</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.640495</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alterations in the processes that control α-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) expression, assembly and trafficking are closely linked to psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. We have recently shown that the serine/threonine kinase Protein kinase N1 (PKN1) is a developmentally active regulator of cerebellar synaptic maturation by inhibiting AKT and the neurogenic transcription factor neurogenic differentiation factor-2 (NeuroD2). NeuroD2 is involved in glutamatergic synaptic maturation by regulating expression levels of various synaptic proteins. Here we aimed to study the effect of Pkn1 knockout on AKT phosphorylation and NeuroD2 levels in the hippocampus and the subsequent expression levels of the NeuroD2 targets and AMPAR subunits: glutamate receptor 1 (GluA1) and GluA2/3. We show that PKN1 is expressed throughout the hippocampus. Interestingly, not only postnatal but also adult hippocampal phospho-AKT and NeuroD2 levels were significantly elevated upon Pkn1 knockout. Postnatal and adult Pkn1&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; hippocampi showed enhanced expression of the AMPAR subunit GluA1, particularly in area CA1. Surprisingly, GluA2/3 levels were not different between both genotypes. In addition to higher protein levels, we also found an enhanced GluA1 content in the membrane fraction of postnatal and adult Pkn1&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; animals, while GluA2/3 levels remained unchanged. This points toward a very specific regulation of GluA1 expression and/or trafficking by the novel PKN1-AKT-NeuroD2 axis. Considering the important role of GluA1 in hippocampal development as well as the pathophysiology of several disorders, ranging from Alzheimer’s, to depression and schizophrenia, our results validate PKN1 for future studies into neurological disorders related to altered AMPAR subunit expression in the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Cyfip1 Regulates SynGAP1 at Hippocampal Synapses</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.581714</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In humans, copy number variations in CYFIP1 appear to have sweeping physiological and structural consequences in the brain, either producing or altering the severity of intellectual disability, autism, and schizophrenia. Independently, SynGAP1 haploinsufficiency produces intellectual disability and, frequently, autism. Cyfip1 inhibits protein translation and promotes actin polymerization, and SynGAP1 is a synaptically localized Ras/Rap GAP. While these proteins are clearly distinct, studies investigating their functions in mice have shown that each regulates the maturation of synapses in the hippocampus and haploinsufficiency for either produces an exaggerated form of mGluR-dependent long-term depression, suggesting that some signaling pathways converge. In this study, we examined how Cyfip1 haploinsufficiency impacts SynGAP1 levels and localization, as well as potential sites for mechanistic interaction in mouse hippocampus. The data show that synaptic, but not total, levels of SynGAP1 in Cyfip1&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice were abnormally low during early postnatal development and in adults. This may be in response to a shift in the balance of kinases that activate SynGAP1 as levels of Cdk5 were reduced and those of activated CaMKII were maintained in Cyfip1&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice compared to wild-type mice. Alternatively, this could reflect altered actin dynamics as Rac1 activity in Cyfip1&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt; hippocampus was boosted significantly compared to wild-type mice, and levels of synaptic F-actin were generally enhanced due in part to an increase in the activity of the WAVE regulatory complex. Decreased synaptic SynGAP1 coupled with a CaMKII-mediated bias toward Rap1 inactivation at synapses is also consistent with increased levels of synaptic GluA2, increased AMPA receptor-mediated responses to stimulation, and increased levels of synaptic mGluR1/5 compared to wild-type mice. Collectively, our data suggest that Cyfip1 regulates SynGAP1 and the two proteins work coordinately at synapses to appropriately direct actin polymerization and GAP activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Loss of Choline Agonism in the Inner Ear Hair Cell Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Linked to the α10 Subunit</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.639720</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The α9α10 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) plays a fundamental role in inner ear physiology. It mediates synaptic transmission between efferent olivocochlear fibers that descend from the brainstem and hair cells of the auditory sensory epithelium. The α9 and α10 subunits have undergone a distinct evolutionary history within the family of nAChRs. Predominantly in mammalian vertebrates, the α9α10 receptor has accumulated changes at the protein level that may ultimately relate to the evolutionary history of the mammalian hearing organ. In the present work, we investigated the responses of α9α10 nAChRs to choline, the metabolite of acetylcholine degradation at the synaptic cleft. Whereas choline is a full agonist of chicken α9α10 receptors it is a partial agonist of the rat receptor. Making use of the expression of α9α10 heterologous receptors, encompassing wild-type, heteromeric, homomeric, mutant, chimeric, and hybrid receptors, and in silico molecular docking, we establish that the mammalian (rat) α10 nAChR subunit underscores the reduced efficacy of choline. Moreover, we show that whereas the complementary face of the α10 subunit does not play an important role in the activation of the receptor by ACh, it is strictly required for choline responses. Thus, we propose that the evolutionary changes acquired in the mammalian α9α10 nAChR resulted in the loss of choline acting as a full agonist at the efferent synapse, without affecting the triggering of ACh responses. This may have accompanied the fine-tuning of hair cell post-synaptic responses to the high-frequency activity of efferent medial olivocochlear fibers that modulate the cochlear amplifier.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent studies suggest the brain functional connectivity impairment is the early event occurred in case of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) as well as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We model the brain as a graph based network to study these impairment. In this paper, we present a new diagnosis approach using graph theory based features from functional magnetic resonance (fMR) images to discriminate AD, MCI, and healthy control (HC) subjects using different classification techniques. These techniques include linear support vector machine (LSVM), and regularized extreme learning machine (RELM). We used pairwise Pearson’s correlation-based functional connectivity to construct the brain network. We compare the classification performance of brain network using Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) datasets. Node2vec graph embedding approach is employed to convert graph features to feature vectors. Experimental results show that the SVM with LASSO feature selection method generates better classification accuracy compared to other classification technique.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Studying Implicit Attitudes Towards Smoking: Event-Related Potentials in the Go/NoGo Association Task</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.634994</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cigarette smoking and other addictive behaviors are among the main preventable risk factors for several severe and potentially fatal diseases. It has been argued that addictive behavior is controlled by an automatic-implicit cognitive system and by a reflective-explicit cognitive system, that operate in parallel to jointly drive human behavior. The present study addresses the formation of implicit attitudes towards smoking in both smokers and non-smokers, using a Go/NoGo association task (GNAT), and behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) measures. The GNAT assesses, via quantifying participants’ reaction times, the strength of association between a target category and either pole of an evaluative dimension (positive or negative). EEG analysis is performed to determine the temporal course of the event-related potential (ERP) components underlying Go/NoGo decisions and implicit attitude formation. Both smokers and non-smokers showed prolonged reaction times to smoking-related pictures when the pictures were coupled with positive evaluative words (“incongruent condition”). This indicates negative implicit attitudes towards smoking in both groups alike at the time point of the behavioral response (600–700 ms post-stimulus). However, only the non-smokers, not the smokers, were found to show a delay of the N200 component in the incongruent condition. This is interpreted as reflecting ambivalent or even positive implicit attitudes towards smoking in the smoker group at the time point of the N200 (300–400 ms post-stimulus). Our study thus provides evidence for the hypothesis that implicit attitudes are subject to changes within several hundred milliseconds after stimulus presentation, and can be altered in the course of their formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: No Impact of Cerebellar Anodal Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation at Three Different Timings on Motor Learning in a Sequential Finger-Tapping Task</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.631517</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Recently, attention has grown toward cerebellar neuromodulation in motor learning using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). An important point of discussion regarding this modulation is the optimal timing of tDCS, as this parameter could significantly influence the outcome. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the effects of the timing of cerebellar anodal tDCS (ca-tDCS) on motor learning using a sequential finger-tapping task (FTT).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: One hundred and twenty two healthy young, right-handed subjects (96 females) were randomized into four groups (During&lt;sub&gt;sham&lt;/sub&gt;, Before, During&lt;sub&gt;real&lt;/sub&gt;, After). They performed 2 days of FTT with their non-dominant hand on a custom keyboard. The task consisted of 40 s of typing followed by 20 s rest. Each participant received ca-tDCS (2 mA, sponge electrodes of 25 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 20 min) at the appropriate timing and performed 20 trials on the first day (T1, 20 min). On the following day, only 10 trials of FTT were performed without tDCS (T2, 10 min). Motor skill performance and retention were assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: All participants showed a time-dependent increase in learning. Motor performance was not different between groups at the end of T1 (p = 0.59). ca-tDCS did not facilitate the retention of the motor skill in the FTT at T2 (p = 0.27). Thus, our findings indicate an absence of the effect of ca-tDCS on motor performance or retention of the FTT independently from the timing of stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The present results suggest that the outcome of ca-tDCS is highly dependent on the task and stimulation parameters. Future studies need to establish a clear basis for the successful and reproducible clinical application of ca-tDCS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Predicting Student Performance Using Machine Learning in fNIRS Data</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.622224</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Increasing student involvement in classes has always been a challenge for teachers and school managers. In online learning, some interactivity mechanisms like quizzes are increasingly used to engage students during classes and tasks. However, there is a high demand for tools that evaluate the efficiency of these mechanisms. In order to distinguish between high and low levels of engagement in tasks, it is possible to monitor brain activity through functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The main advantages of this technique are portability, low cost, and a comfortable way for students to concentrate and perform their tasks. This setup provides more natural conditions for the experiments if compared to the other acquisition tools. In this study, we investigated levels of task involvement through the identification of correct and wrong answers of typical quizzes used in virtual environments. We collected data from the prefrontal cortex region (PFC) of 18 students while watching a video lecture. This data was modeled with supervised learning algorithms. We used random forests and penalized logistic regression to classify correct answers as a function of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin concentration. These models identify which regions best predict student performance. The random forest and penalized logistic regression (GLMNET with LASSO) obtained, respectively, 0.67 and 0.65 area of the ROC curve. Both models indicate that channels F4-F6 and AF3-AFz are the most relevant for the prediction. The statistical significance of these models was confirmed through cross-validation (leave-one-subject-out) and a permutation test. This methodology can be useful to better understand the teaching and learning processes in a video lecture and also provide improvements in the methodologies used in order to better adapt the presentation content.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Effect of Repetitive Passive Movement Before Motor Skill Training on Corticospinal Excitability and Motor Learning Depend on BDNF Polymorphisms</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.621358</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A decrease in cortical excitability tends to be easily followed by an increase induced by external stimuli via a mechanism aimed at restoring it; this phenomenon is called “homeostatic plasticity.” In recent years, although intervention methods aimed at promoting motor learning using this phenomenon have been studied, an optimal intervention method has not been established. In the present study, we examined whether subsequent motor learning can be promoted further by a repetitive passive movement, which reduces the excitability of the primary motor cortex (M1) before motor learning tasks. We also examined the relationship between motor learning and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Forty healthy subjects (Val/Val genotype, 17 subjects; Met carrier genotype, 23 subjects) participated. Subjects were divided into two groups of 20 individuals each. The first group was assigned to perform the motor learning task after an intervention consisting in the passive adduction–abduction movement of the right index finger at 5 Hz for 10 min (RPM condition), while the second group was assigned to perform the task without the passive movement (control condition). The motor learning task consisted in the visual tracking of the right index finger. The results showed that the corticospinal excitability was transiently reduced after the passive movement in the RPM condition, whereas it was increased to the level detected in the control condition after the motor learning task. Furthermore, the motor learning ability was decreased immediately after the passive movement; however, the motor performance finally improved to the level observed in the control condition. In individuals carrying the Val/Val genotype, higher motor learning was also found to be related to the more remarkable changes in corticospinal excitability caused by the RPM condition. This study revealed that the implementation of a passive movement before a motor learning tasks did not affect M1 excitatory changes and motor learning efficiency; in contrast, in subjects carrying the Val/Val polymorphism, the more significant excitatory changes in the M1 induced by the passive movement and motor learning task led to the improvement of motor learning efficiency. Our results also suggest that homeostatic plasticity occurring in the M1 is involved in this improvement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Examination of the Prefrontal Cortex Hemodynamic Responses to the Fist-Edge-Palm Task in Naïve Subjects Using Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.617626</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Fist-Edge-Palm (FEP) task, a manual hand task, has been used to detect frontal dysfunctions in clinical situations: its performance failures are observed in various prefrontal cortex (PFC)-related disorders, including schizophrenia. However, previous imaging studies reported that the performance of the FEP task activated motor-related areas, but not the PFC. Here, we aimed to investigate the relationships between the performance of the FEP task and PFC functions. Hemodynamic activity in the PFC, including the dorsolateral PFC (area 46) and frontal pole (area 10), was recorded. Healthy young subjects performed the FEP task as well as a palm tapping (PT) task (control task) three times. The subjects also completed a Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) and Schizotypal Personality Scale (STA) questionnaire. We found that hemodynamic activity (Oxy-Hb) in the PFC increased in the first trial of the FEP task but decreased considerably in the second and third trials compared to the PT task. The number of performance errors in the FEP task also decreased in the second and third trials. Error reduction (i.e., learning) in the FEP task between the first and second trials was negatively correlated with schizotypal trait and the number of perseveration errors in the WCST. Furthermore, changes in the PFC hemodynamic activity between the first and second trials were positively correlated with error reduction in the FEP task between the first and second trials, and negatively correlated with the number of perseveration errors in the WCST. These results suggest that learning in the FEP task requires PFC activation, which is negatively associated with perseveration errors in the WCST. The results further suggest that the FEP task, in conjunction with near-infrared spectroscopy, may be useful as a diagnostic method for various disorders with PFC dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Error-Related Cognitive Control and Behavioral Adaptation Mechanisms in the Context of Motor Functioning and Anxiety</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.615616</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Motor proficiency reflects the ability to perform precise and coordinated movements in different contexts. Previous research suggests that different profiles of motor proficiency may be associated with different cognitive functioning characteristics thus suggesting an interaction between cognitive and motor processes. The current study investigated this interaction in the general population of healthy adults with different profiles of motor proficiency by focusing on error-related cognitive control and behavioral adaptation mechanisms. In addition, the impact of these processes was assessed in terms of trait anxiety and worries. Forty healthy adults were divided into high and low motor proficiency groups based on an assessment of their motor skills. Using electroencephalography during a flanker task, error-related negativity (ERN) was measured as the neural indicator of cognitive control. Post-error slowing (PES) was measured to represent behavioral adaptation. Participants also completed an anxiety assessment questionnaire. Participants in the high motor proficiency group achieved better task accuracy and showed relatively enhanced cognitive control through increased ERN. Contrastingly, individuals in the lower motor proficiency group achieved poorer accuracy whilst showing some evidence of compensation through increased PES. Trait anxiety reflecting general worries was found to be correlated with motor functioning, but the study could not provide evidence that this was related to cognitive or behavioral control mechanisms. The interaction between cognitive and motor processes observed in this study is unique for healthy and sub-clinical populations and provides a baseline for the interpretation of similar investigations in individuals with motor disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Event-related potential components are sensitive to the processes underlying how questions are understood. We use so-called “covert” wh-questions in Mandarin to probe how such components generalize across different kinds of constructions. This study shows that covert Mandarin wh-questions do not elicit anterior negativities associated with memory maintenance, even when such a dependency is unambiguously cued. N = 37 native speakers of Mandarin Chinese read Chinese questions and declarative sentences word-by-word during EEG recording. In contrast to prior studies, no sustained anterior negativity (SAN) was observed between the cue word, such as the question-embedding verb “wonder,” and the in-situ wh-filler. SANs have been linked with working memory maintenance, suggesting that grammatical features may not impose the same maintenance demands as the content words used in prior work.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neural Mechanisms of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Chronic Pain: A Network-Based fMRI Approach</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.587018</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Over 100 million Americans suffer from chronic pain (CP), which causes more disability than any other medical condition in the United States at a cost of $560–$635 billion per year (Institute of Medicine, 2011). Opioid analgesics are frequently used to treat CP. However, long term use of opioids can cause brain changes such as opioid-induced hyperalgesia that, over time, increase pain sensation. Also, opioids fail to treat complex psychological factors that worsen pain-related disability, including beliefs about and emotional responses to pain. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can be efficacious for CP. However, CBT generally does not focus on important factors needed for long-term functional improvement, including attainment of personal goals and the psychological flexibility to choose responses to pain. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) has been recognized as an effective, non-pharmacologic treatment for a variety of CP conditions (Gutierrez et al., 2004). However, little is known about the neurologic mechanisms underlying ACT. We conducted an ACT intervention in women (n = 9) with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected pre- and post-ACT, and changes in functional connectivity (FC) were measured using Network-Based Statistics (NBS). Behavioral outcomes were measured using validated assessments such as the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ-II), the Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire (CPAQ), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and the NIH Toolbox Neuro-QoL&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; (Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders) scales. Results suggest that, following the 4-week ACT intervention, participants exhibited reductions in brain activation within and between key networks including self-reflection (default mode, DMN), emotion (salience, SN), and cognitive control (frontal parietal, FPN). These changes in connectivity strength were correlated with changes in behavioral outcomes including decreased depression and pain interference, and increased participation in social roles. This study is one of the first to demonstrate that improved function across the DMN, SN, and FPN may drive the positive outcomes associated with ACT. This study contributes to the emerging evidence supporting the use of neurophysiological indices to characterize treatment effects of alternative and complementary mind-body therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Liquid state machine (LSM) is a type of recurrent spiking network with a strong relationship to neurophysiology and has achieved great success in time series processing. However, the computational cost of simulations and complex dynamics with time dependency limit the size and functionality of LSMs. This paper presents a large-scale bioinspired LSM with modular topology. We integrate the findings on the visual cortex that specifically designed input synapses can fit the activation of the real cortex and perform the Hough transform, a feature extraction algorithm used in digital image processing, without additional cost. We experimentally verify that such a combination can significantly improve the network functionality. The network performance is evaluated using the MNIST dataset where the image data are encoded into spiking series by Poisson coding. We show that the proposed structure can not only significantly reduce the computational complexity but also achieve higher performance compared to the structure of previous reported networks of a similar size. We also show that the proposed structure has better robustness against system damage than the small-world and random structures.

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Brain Metabolite, N-Acetylaspartate Is a Potent Protein Aggregation Inhibitor</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.617308</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deposition of toxic protein inclusions is a common hallmark of many neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson disease etc. N-acetylaspartate (NAA) is an important brain metabolite whose levels got altered under various neurodegenerative conditions. Indeed, NAA has been a widely accepted biological marker for various neurological disorders. We have also reported that NAA is a protein stabilizer. In the present communication, we investigated the role of NAA in modulating the aggregation propensity on two model proteins (carbonic anhydrase and catalase). We discovered that NAA suppresses protein aggregation and could solubilize preformed aggregates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Organoid Models of Glioblastoma and Their Role in Drug Discovery</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.605255</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Glioblastoma (GBM) is a devastating adult brain cancer with high rates of recurrence and treatment resistance. Cellular heterogeneity and extensive invasion of surrounding brain tissues are characteristic features of GBM that contribute to its intractability. Current GBM model systems do not recapitulate some of the complex features of GBM and have not produced sufficiently-effective treatments. This has cast doubt on the effectiveness of current GBM models and drug discovery paradigms. In search of alternative pre-clinical GBM models, various 3D organoid-based GBM model systems have been developed using human cells. The scalability of these systems and potential to more accurately model characteristic features of GBM, provide promising new avenues for pre-clinical GBM research and drug discovery efforts. Here, we review the current suite of organoid-GBM models, their individual strengths and weaknesses, and discuss their future applications with an emphasis on compound screening.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Beyond Neuronal Heat Sensing: Diversity of TRPV1 Heat-Capsaicin Receptor-Channel Functions</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.612480</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) is a calcium-permeable ion channel best known for its ability to be gated by the pungent constituent of red chili pepper, capsaicin, and related chemicals from the group of vanilloids as well as by noxious heat. As such, it is mostly expressed in sensory neurons to act as a detector of painful stimuli produced by pungent chemicals and high temperatures. Its activation is also sensitized by the numerous endogenous inflammatory mediators and second messengers, making it an important determinant of nociceptive signaling. Except for such signaling, though, neuronal TRPV1 activation may influence various organ functions by promoting the release of bioactive neuropeptides from sensory fiber innervation organs. However, TRPV1 is also found outside the sensory nervous system in which its activation and function is not that straightforward. Thus, TRPV1 expression is detected in skeletal muscle; in some types of smooth muscle; in epithelial and immune cells; and in adipocytes, where it can be activated by the combination of dietary vanilloids, endovanilloids, and pro-inflammatory factors while the intracellular calcium signaling that this initiates can regulate processes as diverse as muscle constriction, cell differentiation, and carcinogenesis. The purpose of the present review is to provide a clear-cut distinction between neurogenic TRPV1 effects in various tissues consequent to its activation in sensory nerve endings and non-neurogenic TRPV1 effects due to its expression in cell types other than sensory neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Acoustic and Language Based Deep Learning Approaches for Alzheimer's Dementia Detection From Spontaneous Speech</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.623607</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Current methods for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Dementia include structured questionnaires, structured interviews, and various cognitive tests. Language difficulties are a major problem in dementia as linguistic skills break down. Current methods do not provide robust tools to capture the true nature of language deficits in spontaneous speech. Early detection of Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) from spontaneous speech overcomes the limitations of earlier approaches as it is less time consuming, can be done at home, and is relatively inexpensive. In this work, we re-implement the existing NLP methods, which used CNN-LSTM architectures and targeted features from conversational transcripts. Our work sheds light on why the accuracy of these models drops to 72.92% on the ADReSS dataset, whereas, they gave state of the art results on the DementiaBank dataset. Further, we build upon these language input-based recurrent neural networks by devising an end-to-end deep learning-based solution that performs a binary classification of Alzheimer's Dementia from the spontaneous speech of the patients. We utilize the ADReSS dataset for all our implementations and explore the deep learning-based methods of combining acoustic features into a common vector using recurrent units. Our approach of combining acoustic features using the Speech-GRU improves the accuracy by 2% in comparison to acoustic baselines. When further enriched by targeted features, the Speech-GRU performs better than acoustic baselines by 6.25%. We propose a bi-modal approach for AD classification and discuss the merits and opportunities of our approach.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Sexual Regional Dimorphism of Post-Adolescent and Middle Age Brain Maturation. A Multi-center 3T MRI Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.622054</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sex-related differences are tied into neurodevelopmental and lifespan processes, beginning early in the perinatal and developmental phases and continue into adulthood. The present study was designed to investigate sexual dimorphism of changes in gray matter (GM) volume in post-adolescence, with a focus on early and middle-adulthood using a structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset of healthy controls from the European Network on Psychosis, Affective disorders and Cognitive Trajectory (ENPACT). Three hundred and seventy three subjects underwent a 3.0 T MRI session across four European Centers. Age by sex effects on GM volumes were investigated using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and the Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas regions (ROI). Females and males showed overlapping and non-overlapping patterns of GM volume changes during aging. Overlapping age-related changes emerged in bilateral frontal and temporal cortices, insula and thalamus. Both VBM and ROI analyses revealed non-overlapping changes in multiple regions, including cerebellum and vermis, bilateral mid frontal, mid occipital cortices, left inferior temporal and precentral gyri. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for sex differences in cross-sectional analyses, not only in the study of normative changes, but particularly in the context of psychiatric and neurologic disorders, wherein sex effects may be confounded with disease-related changes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Expression of reelin with age in the human hippocampal formation</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23310?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Reelin plays a key role in neuronal migration and lamination in the cortex and hippocampus. Animal studies have shown that reelin expression decreases with age. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of reelin in all layers of the human hippocampal formation across three age groups. We used immunohistochemistry in formalin fixed and paraffin embedded hippocampal tissue from infants (1–10 months; n = 9), children (4–10 years; n = 4), and adults (45–60 years; n = 6) to stain for reelin. Expression was quantified (measured as the number of positive reelin cells/mm2) in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus (DG), the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (ML), the hippocampal fissure (HF), stratum lacunosum moleculare (SLM), CA4/Hilus and the stratum pyramidale layer of CA3, CA2, and CA1. Expression of reelin was highest in the HF irrespective of age, followed by the SLM and ML. Minimal to no expression was seen in the stratum pyramidale layer of CA1‐3. With age, reelin expression decreased and was statistically significant from infancy to childhood in the HF (p = .02). This study confirms that reelin expression decreases with age in the human hippocampus, and shows for the first time that the major decrease occurs between infancy and early childhood.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24789?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Nitric oxide (NO) is an important signaling molecule with many functions in the nervous system. Derived from the enzymatic conversion of arginine by several nitric oxide synthases (NOS), NO plays significant roles in neuronal developmental events such as the establishment of dendritic branching or arbors. A brief summary of the discovery, molecular biology, and chemistry of NO, and a description of important NO‐mediated signal transduction pathways with emphasis on the role for NO in the development of dendritic branching during neurodevelopment are presented. Important sex differences in neuronal nitric oxide synthase expression during neuronal development are considered. Finally, a survey of endogenous and exogenous substances that disrupt dendritic patterning is presented with particular emphasis on how these molecules may drive NO‐mediated sex differences in dendritic branching.</content:encoded>
