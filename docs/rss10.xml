	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Evolutionary optimisation of neural network models for fish collective behaviours in mixed groups of robots and zebrafish. (arXiv:1808.03166v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03166</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Animal and robot social interactions are interesting both for ethological
studies and robotics. On the one hand, the robots can be tools and models to
analyse animal collective behaviours, on the other hand, the robots and their
artificial intelligence are directly confronted and compared to the natural
animal collective intelligence. The first step is to design robots and their
behavioural controllers that are capable of socially interact with animals.
Designing such behavioural bio-mimetic controllers remains an important
challenge as they have to reproduce the animal behaviours and have to be
calibrated on experimental data. Most animal collective behavioural models are
designed by modellers based on experimental data. This process is long and
costly because it is difficult to identify the relevant behavioural features
that are then used as a priori knowledge in model building. Here, we want to
model the fish individual and collective behaviours in order to develop robot
controllers. We explore the use of optimised black-box models based on
artificial neural networks (ANN) to model fish behaviours. While the ANN may
not be biomimetic but rather bio-inspired, they can be used to link perception
to motor responses. These models are designed to be implementable as robot
controllers to form mixed-groups of fish and robots, using few a priori
knowledge of the fish behaviours. We present a methodology with multilayer
perceptron or echo state networks that are optimised through evolutionary
algorithms to model accurately the fish individual and collective behaviours in
a bounded rectangular arena. We assess the biomimetism of the generated models
and compare them to the fish experimental behaviours.

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Targeting the Mouse Ventral Hippocampus in the Intrahippocampal Kainic Acid Model of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/4/ENEURO.0158-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Here we describe a novel mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) that moves the site of kainate injection from the rodent dorsal hippocampus (corresponding to the human posterior hippocampus) to the ventral hippocampus (corresponding to the human anterior hippocampus). We compare the phenotypes of this new model—with respect to seizures, cognitive impairment, affective deficits, and histopathology—to the standard dorsal intrahippocampal kainate model. Our results demonstrate that histopathological measures of granule cell dispersion and mossy fiber sprouting maximize near the site of kainate injection. Somewhat surprisingly, both the dorsal and ventral models exhibit similar spatial memory impairments in addition to similar electrographic and behavioral seizure burdens. In contrast, we find a more pronounced affective (anhedonic) phenotype specifically in the ventral model. These results demonstrate that the ventral intrahippocampal kainic acid model recapitulates critical pathologies of the dorsal model while providing a means to further study affective phenotypes such as depression in TLE.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Wakefulness Is Promoted during Day Time by PDFR Signalling to Dopaminergic Neurons in Drosophila melanogaster</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/4/ENEURO.0129-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Circadian clocks modulate timing of sleep/wake cycles in animals; however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;, large ventral lateral neurons (l-LN&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) are known to promote wakefulness through the action of the neuropeptide pigment dispersing factor (PDF), but the downstream targets of PDF signalling remain elusive. In a screen using downregulation or overexpression (OEX) of the gene encoding PDF receptor (&lt;i&gt;pdfr&lt;/i&gt;), we found that a subset of dopaminergic neurons responds to PDF to promote wakefulness during the day. Moreover, we found that small LN&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; (s-LN&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) and dopaminergic neurons form synaptic contacts, and PDFR signalling inhibited dopaminergic neurons specifically during day time. We propose that these dopaminergic neurons that respond to PDFR signalling are sleep-promoting and that during the day when PDF levels are high, they are inhibited, thereby promoting wakefulness. Thus, we identify a novel circadian clock pathway that mediates wake promotion specifically during day time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Flexible resonance in prefrontal networks with strong feedback inhibition</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/9krHxaH4sa8/article</link>

Oscillations are ubiquitous features of brain dynamics that undergo task-related changes in synchrony, power, and frequency. The impact of those changes on target networks is poorly understood. In this work, we used a biophysically detailed model of prefrontal cortex (PFC) to explore the effects of varying the spike rate, synchrony, and waveform of strong oscillatory inputs on the behavior of cortical networks driven by them. Interacting populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons with strong feedback inhibition are inhibition-based network oscillators that exhibit resonance (i.e., larger responses to preferred input frequencies). We quantified network responses in terms of mean firing rates and the population frequency of network oscillation; and characterized their behavior in terms of the natural response to asynchronous input and the resonant response to oscillatory inputs. We show that strong feedback inhibition causes the PFC to generate internal (natural) oscillations in the beta/gamma frequency range (&amp;gt;15 Hz) and to maximize principal cell spiking in response to external oscillations at slightly higher frequencies. Importantly, we found that the fastest oscillation frequency that can be relayed by the network maximizes local inhibition and is equal to a frequency even higher than that which maximizes the firing rate of excitatory cells; we call this phenomenon population frequency resonance. This form of resonance is shown to determine the optimal driving frequency for suppressing responses to asynchronous activity. Lastly, we demonstrate that the natural and resonant frequencies can be tuned by changes in neuronal excitability, the duration of feedback inhibition, and dynamic properties of the input. Our results predict that PFC networks are tuned for generating and selectively responding to beta- and gamma-rhythmic signals due to the natural and resonant properties of inhibition-based oscillators. They also suggest strategies for optimizing transcranial stimulation and using oscillatory networks in neuromorphic engineering.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9krHxaH4sa8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Phylogeny-corrected identification of microbial gene families relevant to human gut colonization</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/NwEaQS18QuE/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Patrick H. Bradley, Stephen Nayfach, Katherine S. Pollard&lt;/p&gt;

The mechanisms by which different microbes colonize the healthy human gut versus other body sites, the gut in disease states, or other environments remain largely unknown. Identifying microbial genes influencing fitness in the gut could lead to new ways to engineer probiotics or disrupt pathogenesis. We approach this problem by measuring the statistical association between a species having a gene and the probability that the species is present in the gut microbiome. The challenge is that closely related species tend to be jointly present or absent in the microbiome and also share many genes, only a subset of which are involved in gut adaptation. We show that this phylogenetic correlation indeed leads to many false discoveries and propose phylogenetic linear regression as a powerful solution. To apply this method across the bacterial tree of life, where most species have not been experimentally phenotyped, we use metagenomes from hundreds of people to quantify each species’ prevalence in and specificity for the gut microbiome. This analysis reveals thousands of genes potentially involved in adaptation to the gut across species, including many novel candidates as well as processes known to contribute to fitness of gut bacteria, such as acid tolerance in Bacteroidetes and sporulation in Firmicutes. We also find microbial genes associated with a preference for the gut over other body sites, which are significantly enriched for genes linked to fitness in an &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; competition experiment. Finally, we identify gene families associated with higher prevalence in patients with Crohn’s disease, including Proteobacterial genes involved in conjugation and fimbria regulation, processes previously linked to inflammation. These gene targets may represent new avenues for modulating host colonization and disease. Our strategy of combining metagenomics with phylogenetic modeling is general and can be used to identify genes associated with adaptation to any environment.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NwEaQS18QuE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Characterization of Tissue Plasminogen Activator Expression and Trafficking in the Adult Murine Brain</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/4/ENEURO.0119-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is an immediate-early gene important for regulating physiological processes like synaptic plasticity and neurovascular coupling. It has also been implicated in several pathological processes including blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, seizure progression, and stroke. These varied reports suggest that tPA is a pleiotropic mediator whose actions are highly compartmentalized in space and time. The specific localization of tPA, therefore, can provide useful information about its function. Accordingly, the goal of this study was to provide a detailed characterization of tPA’s regional, cellular, and subcellular localization in the brain. To achieve this, two new transgenic mouse lines were utilized: (1) a PlatβGAL reporter mouse, which houses the β-galactosidase gene in the tPA locus and (2) a tPA&lt;sup&gt;BAC&lt;/sup&gt;-Cerulean mouse, which has a cerulean-fluorescent protein fused in-frame to the tPA C-terminus. Using these two transgenic reporters, we show that while tPA is expressed throughout most regions of the adult murine brain, it appears to be preferentially targeted to fiber tracts in the limbic system. In the hippocampus, confocal microscopy revealed tPA-Cerulean (tPA-Cer) puncta localized to giant mossy fiber boutons (MFBs) and astrocytes in stratum lucidum. With amplification of the tPA-Cer signal, somatically localized tPA was also observed in the stratum oriens (SO)/alveus layer of both CA1 and CA3 subfields. Coimmunostaining of tPA-Cer and interneuronal markers indicates that these tPA-positive cell bodies belong to a subclass of somatostatin (SST)/oriens-lacunosum moleculare (O-LM) interneurons. Together, these data imply that tPA’s localization is differentially regulated, suggesting that its neuromodulatory effects may be compartmentalized and specialized to cell type.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Interlimb Generalization of Learned Bayesian Visuomotor Prior Occurs in Extrinsic Coordinates</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/4/ENEURO.0183-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent work suggests that the brain represents probability distributions and performs Bayesian integration during sensorimotor learning. However, our understanding of the neural representation of this learning remains limited. To begin to address this, we performed two experiments. In the first experiment, we replicated the key behavioral findings of Körding and Wolpert (2004), demonstrating that humans can perform in a Bayes-optimal manner by combining information about their own sensory uncertainty and a statistical distribution of lateral shifts encountered in a visuomotor adaptation task. In the second experiment, we extended these findings by testing whether visuomotor learning occurring during the same task generalizes from one limb to the other, and relatedly, whether this learning is represented in an extrinsic or intrinsic reference frame. We found that the learned mean of the distribution of visuomotor shifts generalizes to the opposite limb only when the perturbation is congruent in extrinsic coordinates, indicating that the underlying representation of learning acquired during training is available to the untrained limb and is coded in an extrinsic reference frame.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Sodium Channel-Dependent and -Independent Mechanisms Underlying Axonal Afterdepolarization at Mouse Hippocampal Mossy Fibers</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0254-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Action potentials propagating along axons are often followed by prolonged afterdepolarization (ADP) lasting for several tens of milliseconds. Axonal ADP is thought to be an important factor in modulating the fidelity of spike propagation during repetitive firings. However, the mechanism as well as the functional significance of axonal ADP remain unclear, partly due to inaccessibility to small structures of axon for direct electrophysiological recordings. Here, we examined the ionic and electrical mechanisms underlying axonal ADP using whole-bouton recording from mossy fiber terminals in mice hippocampal slices. ADP following axonal action potentials was strongly enhanced by focal application of veratridine, an inhibitor of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel inactivation. On the contrary, tetrodotoxin (TTX) partly suppressed ADP, suggesting that a Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel-dependent component is involved in axonal ADP. The remaining TTX-resistant Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel-independent component represents slow capacitive discharge reflecting the shape and electrical properties of the axonal membrane. We also addressed the functional impact of axonal ADP on presynaptic function. In paired-pulse stimuli, we found that axonal ADP minimally affected the peak height of subsequent action potentials, although the rising phase of action potentials was slightly slowed, possibly due to steady-state inactivation of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels by prolonged depolarization. Voltage clamp analysis of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; current elicited by action potential waveform commands revealed that axonal ADP assists short-term facilitation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry into the presynaptic terminals. Taken together, axonal ADP maintains reliable firing during repetitive stimuli and plays important roles in the fine-tuning of short-term plasticity of transmitter release by modulating Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry into presynaptic terminals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Axonal action potentials are often followed by depolarizing or hyperpolarizing afterpotentials. This study illuminated the mechanisms of ADP in the hippocampal mossy fibers, where morphologic as well as biophysical data were accumulated. We found that slow activating Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels are partly involved in ADP. Capacitive components also substantially contribute to ADP, suggesting that axonal shape and electrical properties are optimized for high-fidelity propagation during repetitive stimuli. We also tested the roles of ADP in the activity-dependent tuning of the presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; current. Action potential-driven Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry into the axon terminals was facilitated by paired stimuli, possibly due to Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; current facilitation by ADP. Therefore, ADP contributes to fine-tuning of transmitter release and ensures high-fidelity spiking of axons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The transfer-appropriate processing (TAP) account holds that episodic memory depends on the overlap between encoding and retrieval processing. In the current study, we employed multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) of electroencephalography to examine the relevance of spontaneously engaged visual processing during encoding for later retrieval. Human participants encoded word- picture associations, where the picture could be a famous face, a landmark, or an object. At test, we manipulated the retrieval demands by asking participants to retrieve either visual or verbal information about the pictures. MVPA revealed classification between picture categories during early perceptual stages of encoding (~170 ms). Importantly, these visual category-specific neural patterns were predictive of later episodic remembering, but the direction of the relationship was contingent on the particular retrieval demand of the memory task: a benefit for the visual and a cost for the verbal. A reinstatement of the category-specific neural patterns established during encoding was observed during retrieval, and again the relationship with behavior varied with retrieval demands. Reactivation of visual representations during retrieval was associated with better memory in the visual task, but with lower performance in the verbal task. Our findings support and extend the TAP account by demonstrating that processing of particular aspects during memory formation can also have detrimental effects on later episodic remembering when other aspects of the event are called-for and shed new light on encoding and retrieval interactions in episodic memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Episodic memory allows us to mentally travel in time to relive our personal past. The likelihood that a previous episode will be remembered is considered to depend on the extent to which processes engaged during encoding are also engaged at the time of retrieval. In the present study, we leveraged multivariate pattern analysis of high time-resolution oscillatory brain activity to assess participants’ category-specific visual processing during memory formation, and later cortical reinstatement at retrieval. The results demonstrate that category-specific visual processing may predict both benefits and costs in episodic memory, depending on the retrieval requirements. These novel findings elucidate the neurocognitive dynamics of encoding and retrieval, which mediate the access to our personal past.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Integrated Information is a quantitative measure from information theory
how tightly all parts of a system are interconnected in terms of information

Analytically and numerically we show that the presence of astrocyte may be
essential for this information attribute in neuro-astrocytic ensembles.
Moreover, the proposed &quot;spiking-bursting&quot; mechanism of generating positive
Integrated Information is shown to be generic and not limited to neuroglial

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Age-dependent dormant resident progenitors are stimulated by injury to regenerate Purkinje neurons</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/39879</link>
	<content:encoded>Outside of the neurogenic niches of the brain, postmitotic neurons have not been found to undergo efficient regeneration. We demonstrate that mouse Purkinje cells (PCs), which are born at midgestation and are crucial for development and function of cerebellar circuits, are rapidly and fully regenerated following their ablation at birth. New PCs are produced from immature FOXP2+ neural precursors (iPCs) that are able to enter the cell cycle and support normal cerebellum development. The number of iPCs and their regenerative capacity, however, diminish soon after birth and consequently PCs are poorly replenished when ablated at postnatal day five. Nevertheless, the PC-depleted cerebella reach a normal size by increasing cell size, but scaling of neuron types is disrupted and cerebellar function is impaired. Our findings provide a new paradigm in the field of neuron regeneration by identifying a population of immature neurons that buffers against perinatal brain injury in a stage-dependent process.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>We generated two new genetic tools to efficiently tag genes in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. The first, Double Header (DH) utilizes intronic MiMIC/CRIMIC insertions to generate artificial exons for GFP mediated protein trapping or T2A-GAL4 gene trapping &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt;based on Cre recombinase to avoid embryo injections. DH significantly increases integration efficiency compared to previous strategies and faithfully reports the expression pattern of genes and proteins. The second technique targets genes lacking coding introns using a two-step cassette exchange. First, we replace the endogenous gene with an excisable compact dominant marker using CRISPR making a null allele. Second, the insertion is replaced with a protein::tag cassette. This sequential manipulation allows the generation of numerous tagged alleles or insertion of other DNA fragments that facilitates multiple downstream applications. Both techniques allow precise gene manipulation and facilitate detection of gene expression, protein localization and assessment of protein function, as well as numerous other applications.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Targeting light-gated chloride channels to neuronal somatodendritic domain reduces their excitatory effect in the axon</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38506</link>
	<content:encoded>Light-gated chloride channels are emerging as promising optogenetic tools for inhibition of neural activity. However, their effects depend on the transmembrane chloride electrochemical gradient and may be complex due to the heterogeneity of this gradient in different developmental stages, neuronal types, and subcellular compartments. Here we characterized a light-gated chloride channel, GtACR2, in mouse cortical neurons. We found that GtACR2 activation inhibited the soma, but unexpectedly depolarized the presynaptic terminals resulting in neurotransmitter release. Other light-gated chloride channels had similar effects. Reducing the chloride concentrations in the axon and presynaptic terminals diminished the GtACR2-induced neurotransmitter release, indicating an excitatory effect of chloride channels in these compartments. A novel hybrid somatodendritic targeting motif reduced the GtACR2-induced neurotransmitter release while enhancing the somatic photocurrents. Our results highlight the necessity of precisely determining the effects of light-gated chloride channels under specific experimental conditions and provide a much-improved light-gated chloride channel for optogenetic inhibition.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38232</link>
	<content:encoded>D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase (DTD) acts on achiral glycine, in addition to D-amino acids, attached to tRNA. We have recently shown that this activity enables DTD to clear non-cognate Gly-tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Ala&lt;/sup&gt; with 1000-fold higher efficiency than its activity on Gly-tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Gly&lt;/sup&gt;, indicating tRNA-based modulation of DTD (Pawar et al., 2017). Here, we show that tRNA's discriminator base predominantly accounts for this activity difference and is the key to selection by DTD. Accordingly, the uracil discriminator base, serving as a negative determinant, prevents Gly-tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Gly&lt;/sup&gt; misediting by DTD and this protection is augmented by EF-Tu. Intriguingly, eukaryotic DTD has inverted discriminator base specificity and uses only G3•U70 for tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Gly/Ala&lt;/sup&gt; discrimination. Moreover, DTD prevents alanine-to-glycine misincorporation in proteins rather than only recycling mischarged tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Ala&lt;/sup&gt;. Overall, the study reveals the unique co-evolution of DTD and discriminator base, and suggests DTD's strong selection pressure on bacterial tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Gly&lt;/sup&gt;s to retain a pyrimidine discriminator code.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37621</link>
	<content:encoded>The influence of biomechanics on the tempo and mode of morphological evolution is unresolved, yet is fundamental to organismal diversification. Across multiple four-bar linkage systems in animals, we discovered that rapid morphological evolution (tempo) is associated with mechanical sensitivity (strong correlation between a mechanical system's output and one or more of its components). Mechanical sensitivity is explained by size: the smallest link(s) are disproportionately affected by length changes and most strongly influence mechanical output. Rate of evolutionary change (tempo) is greatest in the smallest links and trait shifts across phylogeny (mode) occur exclusively via the influential, small links. Our findings illuminate the paradigms of many-to-one mapping, mechanical sensitivity, and constraints: tempo and mode are dominated by strong correlations that exemplify mechanical sensitivity, even in linkage systems known for exhibiting many-to-one mapping. Amidst myriad influences, mechanical sensitivity imparts distinct, predictable footprints on morphological diversity.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>VivosX is an &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; disulfide crosslinking approach that utilizes a pair of strategically positioned cysteines on two proteins to probe physical interactions within cells. Histone H2A.Z, which often replaces one or both copies of H2A in nucleosomes downstream of promoters, was used to validate VivosX. Disulfide crosslinks between cysteine-modified H2A.Z and/or H2A histones within nucleosomes were induced using a membrane-permeable oxidant. VivosX detected different combinations of H2A.Z and H2A within nucleosomes in yeast cells. This assay correctly reported the change in global H2A.Z occupancy previously observed when the deposition and eviction pathways of H2A.Z were perturbed. Homotypic H2A.Z/H2A.Z (ZZ) nucleosomes accumulated when assembly of the transcription preinitiation complex was blocked, revealing that the transcription machinery preferentially disassembles ZZ nucleosomes. VivosX works in human cells and distinguishes ZZ nucleosomes with one or two ubiquitin moieties, demonstrating that it can be used to detect protein-protein interactions inside cells from different species.</content:encoded>

We present a semi-parametric framework to quantitatively analyze and visualize the spatio-temporal distribution of intracellular events from different conditions. From the spatial coordinates of intracellular features such as segmented subcellular structures or vesicle trajectories, QuantEv automatically estimates weighted densities that are easy to interpret and performs a comprehensive statistical analysis from distribution distances. We apply this approach to study the spatio-temporal distribution of moving Rab6 fluorescently labeled membranes with respect to their direction of movement in crossbow- and disk-shaped cells.

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/388868v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>UNC-13 proteins play an essential role in synaptic transmission by recruiting synaptic vesicles (SVs) to become available for release, which is termed SV priming. Here we show that the C2A domain of UNC-13L, like the corresponding domain in mammalian Munc13-1, displays two conserved binding modes: forming C2A/C2A homodimers, or forming a heterodimer with the zinc finger domain of UNC-10/RIM (C2A/RIM). Functional analysis revealed that UNC-13Ls C2A promotes synaptic transmission by regulating a post-priming process. Stimulus-evoked release but not SV priming, was impaired in unc-10 mutants deficient for C2A/RIM heterodimerization, leading to decreased release probability. Disrupting C2A/C2A homodimerization in UNC-13L-rescued animals had no effect on synaptic transmission, but fully restored the evoked release and the release probability of unc-10/RIM mutants deficient for C2A/RIM heterodimerization. Thus, our results support the model that RIM binding C2A releases UNC-13L from an autoinhibitory homodimeric complex to become fusion-competent by functioning as a switch only.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/388793v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Monocytes are amongst the first cells recruited into the brain after traumatic brain injury (TBI). We have shown monocyte depletion 24 hours prior to TBI reduces brain edema, decreases neutrophil infiltration and improves behavioral outcomes. Additionally, both lesion and ventricle size correlate with poor neurologic outcome after TBI. Therefore, we aimed to determine the association between monocyte infiltration, lesion size, and ventricle volume. We hypothesized that monocyte depletion would attenuate lesion size, decrease ventricle enlargement, and preserve white matter in mice after TBI. C57BL/6 mice underwent pan monocyte depletion via intravenous injection of liposome-encapsulated clodronate. Control mice were injected with liposome-encapsulated PBS. TBI was induced via an open-head, controlled cortical impact. Mice were imaged using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 1, 7, and 14 days post-injury to evaluate progression of lesion and to detect morphological changes associated with injury (3D T1-weighted MRI) including regional alterations in white matter patterns (multi-direction diffusion MRI). Lesion size and ventricle volume were measured using semi-automatic segmentation and active contour methods with the software program ITK-SNAP. Data was analyzed with the statistical software program PRISM. No significant effect of monocyte depletion on lesion size was detected using MRI following TBI (p=0.4). However, progressive ventricle enlargement following TBI was observed to be attenuated in the monocyte-depleted cohort (5.3 {+/-} 0.9mm3) as compared to the sham-depleted cohort (13.2 {+/-} 3.1mm3; p=0.02). Global white matter integrity and regional patterns were evaluated and quantified for each mouse after extracting fractional anisotropy maps from the multi-direction diffusion-MRI data using Siemens Syngo DTI analysis package. Fractional anisotropy values were preserved in the monocyte-depleted cohort (123.0 {+/-} 4.4mm3) as compared to sham-depleted mice (94.9 {+/-} 4.6mm3; p=0.025) by 14 days post-TBI. The MRI derived data suggests that monocyte depletion at the time of injury may be a novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of TBI. Furthermore, non-invasive longitudinal imaging allows for the evaluation of both TBI progression as well as therapeutic response over the course of injury.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/388587v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The efficiency of neuronal information transfer in activated brain networks may affect behavioral performance. Gamma-band synchronization has been proposed to be a mechanism that facilitates neuronal processing of behaviorally relevant stimuli. In line with this, it has been shown that strong gamma-band activity in visual cortical areas leads to faster responses to a visual go cue. We investigated whether there are directly observable consequences of trial-by-trial fluctuations in non-invasively observed gamma-band activity on the neuronal response. Specifically, we hypothesized that the amplitude of the visual evoked response to a go cue can be predicted by gamma power in the visual system, in the window preceding the evoked response. Thirty-three human subjects (22 female) performed a visual speeded response task while their magnetoencephalogram (MEG) was recorded. The participants had to respond to a pattern reversal of a concentric moving grating. We estimated single trial stimulus-induced visual cortical gamma power, and correlated this with the estimated single trial amplitude of the most prominent event-related field (ERF) peak within the first 100 ms after the pattern reversal. In parieto-occipital cortical areas, the amplitude of the ERF correlated positively with gamma power, and correlated negatively with reaction times. No effects were observed for the alpha and beta frequency bands, despite clear stimulus onset induced modulation at those frequencies. These results support a mechanistic model, in which gamma-band synchronization enhances the neuronal gain to relevant visual input, thus leading to more efficient downstream processing and to faster responses.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Loss of function mutations in the human AMPA receptor-associated protein, ferric chelate reductase 1-like (FRRS1L), are associated with a devastating neurological condition incorporating choreoathetosis, cognitive deficits and epileptic encephalopathies. Furthermore, evidence from overexpression and ex vivo studies have implicated FRRS1L in AMPA receptor biogenesis and assembly, suggesting that changes in glutamatergic signalling might underlie the disorder. Here, we investigated the neurological and neurobehavioural correlates of the disorder using a mouse Frrs1l null mutant. The study revealed several neurological defects that mirrored those seen in human patients. We established that mice lacking Frrs1l suffered from a broad spectrum of early-onset motor deficits with no progressive, age-related deterioration. Moreover, Frrs1l-/- mice were hyperactive irrespective of test environment, exhibited working memory deficits and displayed significant sleep fragmentation. Longitudinal electroencephalographic recordings also revealed abnormal EEG in Frrs1l-/- mice. Parallel investigations into disease aetiology identified a specific deficiency in AMPA receptor levels in the brain of Frrs1l-/- mice, while the general levels of several other synaptic components remained unchanged with no obvious alterations in the number of synapses. Furthermore, we established that Frrsl1 deletion results in glycosylation deficits in GLUA2 and GLUA4 AMPA receptor proteins, leading to cytoplasmic retention and a reduction of those specific AMPA receptor levels in the postsynaptic membrane. Overall, this study determines, for the first time in vivo, how loss of FRRS1L function can affect glutamatergic signalling and provides mechanistic insight into the development and progression of a human hyperkinetic disorder.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/388538v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Microglia are non-neuronal cells of the myeloid lineage that invade and take up long-term residence in the brain during development (Ginhoux et al. 2010) and are increasingly implicated in neuronal maturation, homeostasis, and pathology (Bessis et al. 2007; Paolicelli et al. 2011; Li et al. 2012; Aguzzi et al. 2013, Cunningham 2013, Cunningham et al. 2013). Since the early twentieth century several methods for staining and visualizing microglia have been developed. Scientists in Ramon y Cajal's group (Achucarro 1913, Rio-Hortega 1919) pioneered these methods and their work led to the christening of microglia as the third element of the nervous system, distinct from astrocytes and neurons. More recently, a combination of imaging, genetic, and immunological tools has been used to visualize microglia in living brain (Davalos et al. 2005; Nimmerjahn et al. 2005). It was found that microglia are highly motile under resting conditions and rapidly respond to injuries (Kettenmann et al. 2011) suggesting a role for microglia in both brain homeostasis and pathology. Transmission Electron microscopy (TEM) has provided crucial complementary information on microglia morphology and physiology but until recently EM analyses have been limited to single or limited serial section studies (Tremblay et al. 2010; Paolicelli et al. 2011; Schafer et al. 2012; Tremblay et al. 2012 ; Sipe et al. 2016). TEM studies were successful in defining a set of morphological criteria for microglia: a polygonal nucleus with peripheral condensed chromatin, a relatively small cytoplasm with abundant presence of rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), and a large volume of lysosomes and inclusions in the perikaryon. Recent advances in volumetric electron microscopy techniques allow for 3D reconstruction of large samples at nanometer-resolution, thus opening up new avenues for the understanding of cell biology and architecture in intact tissues. At the same time, correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) techniques have been extended to 3D brain samples to help navigate and identify critical molecular landmarks within large EM volumes (Briggman and Denk 2006; Maco et al. 2013; Blazquez-Llorca et al. 2015, Bosch et al. 2015). Here we present the first volumetric ultrastructural reconstruction of an entire mouse hippocampal microglia using serial block face scanning electron microscopy (SBEM). Using CLEM we have ensured the inclusion of both large, small, and filopodial microglia processes. Segmentation of the dataset allowed us to carry out a comprehensive inventory of microglia cell structures, including vesicles, organelles, membrane protrusions, and processes. This study provides a reference that can serve as a data mining resource for investigating microglia cell biology.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/388504v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The theory of phase oscillators is an essential tool for understanding population dynamics of pacemaking neurons. GABAergic pacemakers in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), a main basal ganglia (BG) output nucleus, receive inputs from the direct and indirect pathways at distal and proximal regions of their dendritic arbors, respectively. We combine theory, optogenetic stimulation and electrophysiological experiments in acute brain slices to ask how dendritic properties impact the propensity of the various inputs, arriving at different locations along the dendrite, to recruit or entrain SNr pacemakers. By combining cable theory with sinusoidally-modulated optogenetic activation of either proximal somatodendritic regions or the entire dendritic arbor of SNr neurons, we construct an analytical model that accurately predicts the empirically measured somatic current response to inputs arising from illuminating various portions of the dendritic field. We show that the extent of the dendritic tree that is illuminated generates measurable and systematic differences in the pacemaker's phase response curve (PRC), causing a shift in its peak. Finally we show that the divergent PRCs correctly predict differences in two major features of the collective dynamics of SNr neurons: the fidelity of population responses to sudden step-like changes in inputs; and the phase latency at which SNr neurons are entrained by rhythmic stimulation, which can occur in the BG under both physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Our novel method generates measurable and physiologically meaningful spatial effects, and provides the first empirical demonstration of how the collective responses of SNr pacemakers are determined by the transmission properties of their dendrites. SNr dendrites may serve to delay distal striatal inputs so that they impinge on the spike initiation zone simultaneously with pallidal and subthalamic inputs in order to guarantee a fair competition between the influence of the monosynaptic direct- and polysynaptic indirect pathways.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A speech envelope landmark for syllable encoding in human superior temporal gyrus</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/388280v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Listeners use the slow amplitude modulations of speech, known as the envelope, to segment continuous speech into syllables. However, the underlying neural computations are heavily debated. We used high-density intracranial cortical recordings while participants listened to natural and synthesized control speech stimuli to determine how the envelope is represented in the human superior temporal gyrus (STG), a critical auditory brain area for speech processing. We found that the STG does not encode the instantaneous, moment-by-moment amplitude envelope of speech. Rather, a zone of the middle STG detects discrete acoustic onset edges, defined by local maxima in the rate-of-change of the envelope. Acoustic analysis demonstrated that acoustic onset edges reliably cue the information-rich transition between the consonant-onset and vowel-nucleus of syllables. Furthermore, the steepness of the acoustic edge cued whether a syllable was stressed. Synthesized amplitude-modulated tone stimuli showed that steeper edges elicited monotonically greater cortical responses, confirming the encoding of relative but not absolute amplitude. Overall, encoding of the timing and magnitude of acoustic onset edges in STG underlies our perception of the syllabic rhythm of speech.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/388132v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The contrast sensitivity function (CSF), how sensitivity varies with the spatial frequency of the stimulus, is a fundamental assessment of visual performance. The CSF is generally assumed to be determined by low-level sensory processes. However, the sensitivities of neurons in the early visual pathways, as measured in experiments with immobilized eyes, diverge from psychophysical CSF measurements in primates. Under natural viewing conditions, as in typical psychophysical measurements, humans continually move their eyes, drifting in a seemingly erratic manner even when looking at a fixed point. Here, we show that the resulting transformation of the visual scene into a spatiotemporal flow on the retina constitutes a processing stage that reconciles human CSF and the response characteristics of retinal ganglion cells under a broad range of conditions. Our findings suggest a fundamental integration between perception and action: eye movements work synergistically with the sensitivities of retinal neurons to encode spatial information.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Atypical flexibility in dynamic functional connectivity quantifies the severity in autism spectrum disorder</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/387886v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Resting-state functional connectivity (FC) analyses have shown atypical connectivity in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as compared to typically developing (TD). However, this view emerges from investigating static FC overlooking the age, disease phenotype and their interaction in the whole brain transient connectivity patterns. Contrasting with most extant literature in the present study, we investigated precisely how age and disease phenotypes factors into dynamic changes in functional connectivity of TD and ASD using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data stratified into three cohorts: children (7-11 years) and adolescents (12-17 years), and adults (18+) for the analysis. The dynamic variability in the connection strength and the modular organization in terms of measures: flexibility, cohesion strength and disjointness were explored for each subject to characterize the differences between ASD and TD. In ASD, we observed significantly higher inter-subject dynamic variability in connection strength as compared to TD. This hypervariability relates to the symptom severity in ASD. We found that whole-brain flexibility correlates with static modularity only in TD. Further, we observed a coreperiphery organization in the resting-state, with Sensorimotor and Visual regions in the rigid core; and DMN and attention areas in the flexible periphery. TD also develops a more cohesive organization of sensorimotor areas. However, in ASD we found a strong positive correlation of symptom severity with the flexibility of rigid areas and with disjointness of sensorimotor areas. The regions of the brain showing the high predictive power of symptom severity were distributed across the cortex, with stronger bearings in the frontal, motor and occipital cortices. Our study demonstrates that the dynamic framework best characterizes the variability in ASD.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/387837v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Persistent activity, the elevated firing of a neuron after the termination of a stimulus, is hypothesized to play a critical role in working memory. This form of activity is therefore typically studied within the context of a behavioural task that includes a working memory component. Here we investigated whether persistent activity is observed in sensory cortex and thalamus in the absence of any explicit behavioural task.We recorded spiking activity from single units in the auditory cortex (fields A1, R and RT) and thalamus of awake, passively-listening marmosets. We observed persistent activity that lasted for hundreds of milliseconds following the termination of the acoustic stimulus, in the absence of a task. Persistent activity was observed following both adapting and sustained responses during the stimulus and showed similar stimulus tuning to these evoked responses. Persistent activity was also observed following suppression in firing during the stimulus. These response types were observed across all cortical fields tested, but were largely absent from thalamus. As well as being of shorter duration, thalamic persistent activity emerged following a longer latency than in cortex, indicating that persistent activity may be generated within auditory cortex during passive listening. Given that these responses were observed in the absence of a explicit behavioural task, persistent activity in sensory cortex may have functional importance beyond storing task-relevant information in working memory.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The genetic basis and uniquely human character of schizophrenia has led to the notion of human brain evolution to have resulted in vulnerability to the disorder. We examined schizophrenia-related changes in brain connectivity in the context of evolutionary changes in human brain wiring by comparing in-vivo neuroimaging data from humans, chimpanzees and macaque monkeys. We find that evolutionary changes in human connectome organization overlap with the pattern of schizophrenia-related changes in brain connectivity, with connections evolutionary enhanced in the human brain showing significantly more involvement in schizophrenia pathology than connections shared between humans and non-human primates (effects shown in three independent patient-control datasets). Our findings suggest that the evolution of brain wiring in support of complex brain function in humans may have come at the cost of an increased vulnerability to brain dysfunction in disease.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/387498v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Searching for items that are useful given current goals, or &quot;target&quot; recognition, requires an observer to generalize across identity-preserving transformations such as viewpoint changes, as well as to incorporate contextual information. While past work has found target recognition signals in areas of ventral visual cortex, it is not clear whether these signals support performance on demanding tasks that require invariant, flexible search. Here, we used a task that required subjects to match novel object stimuli based on invariant features (identity and viewpoint). Based on multivariate fMRI analyses, the data suggest that the multiple-demand (MD) network, including sub-regions of parietal and frontal cortex, encodes invariant representations of an object's status as a target. Furthermore, target information in MD regions, but not early or ventral visual cortex, was higher on correct compared to incorrect trials, suggesting a strong link between MD target signals and behavior.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/386318v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Predictive models for neural or fMRI data are often fit using regression methods that employ priors on the model parameters. One widely used method is ridge regression, which employs a spherical Gaussian prior that assumes equal and independent variance for all parameters. However, a spherical prior is not always optimal or appropriate. There are many cases where expert knowledge or hypotheses about the structure of the model parameters could be used to construct a better prior. In these cases, non-spherical Gaussian priors can be employed using a generalized form of ridge known as Tikhonov regression. Yet Tikhonov regression is only rarely used in neuroscience. In this paper we discuss the theoretical basis for Tikhonov regression, demonstrate a computationally efficient method for its application, and show several examples of how Tikhonov regression can improve predictive models for fMRI data. We also show that many earlier studies have implicitly used Tikhonov regression by linearly transforming the regressors before performing ridge regression.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Motor cortical beta transients delay movement initiation and track errors</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/384370v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Motor cortical activity in the beta range (13-30 Hz) is a hallmark signature of healthy and pathological movement, but its behavioural relevance remains unclear. Recent work in primates and human sensory cortex suggests that sustained oscillatory beta activity observed on average, may arise from the summation of underlying short-lasting, high-amplitude bursts of activity. Classical human movement-related event-related beta desynchronisation (ERD) and synchronization (ERS) may thus provide insufficient, non-dynamic, summaries of underlying focal spatio-temporal burst activity, limiting insight into their functional role during healthy and pathological movement. Here we directly investigate this transient beta burst activity and its putative behavioural relevance for movement control, using high-precision magnetoencephalography (MEG). We quantified the subject-specific (n=8), trial-wise (n&amp;gt;12,000) dynamics of beta bursts, before and after movement. We show that beta activity on individual trials is dominated by high amplitude, short lasting bursts. While average beta changes generally manifest as bilaterally distributed activity (FWHM = 25mm), individual bursts are spatially more focal (FWHM = 6 mm), sporadic (1.3 -1.5/s), and transient (mean: 96 ms). Prior to movement (the period of the classical ERD), the timing of the last pre-movement burst predicts movement onset, suggesting a role in the specification of the goal of movement. After movement (the period of the classical ERS), the first beta burst is delayed by ~100ms after a response error occurs, intimating a role in error monitoring and evaluation. Movement-related beta activity is therefore dominated by a spatially dispersed summation of short lasting, sporadic and focal bursts. Movement-related beta bursts coordinate the retrieval and updating of movement goals in the pre- and post-movement periods, respectively.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/382002v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Vision formation is classically based on projections from the retinal ganglion cells (RGC) to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and the primary visual cortex (V1). Although the cellular information of the retina and the LGN has been widely studied, the transcriptome profiles of single neurons with specific functions in V1 still remain unknown. Some neurons in mouse V1 are tuned to light stimulus. To determine the molecular properties of light-stimulated neurons in layer 2/3 of V1, we developed a method of functional in vivo single-cell transcriptome (FIST) analysis that integrates sensory evoked calcium imaging, whole-cell electrophysiological patch-clamp recordings, single-cell mRNA sequencing and three-dimensional morphological characterization in a live mouse, based on a two-photon microscope system. In our study, 58 individual cells from layer 2/3 of V1 were identified as either light-sensitive (LS) or non-light-sensitive (NS) by single-cell light-evoked calcium evaluation and action potential spiking. The contents of every single cell after individual functional tests were aspirated through the patch-clamp pipette for mRNA sequencing. Furthermore, the three-dimensional (3-D) morphological characterizations of the neurons were reconstructed in the live mouse after the whole-cell recordings. Our sequencing results indicated that V1 neurons with high expression of genes related to transmission regulation, such as Rtn4r, Nr4a1, and genes involved in membrane transport, such as Na+/K+ ATPase, NMDA-type glutamatergic receptor, preferentially respond to light stimulation. Our findings demonstrate the ability of FIST analysis to characterize the functional, morphological and transcriptomic properties of a single cell in alive animal, thereby providing precise neuronal information and predicting its network contribution in the brain.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Transmembrane Domain of Synaptobrevin Influences Neurotransmitter Flux through Synaptic Fusion Pores</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/32/7179?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The soluble &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor (SNARE) proteins synaptobrevin (Syb), syntaxin, and SNAP-25 function in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-triggered exocytosis in both endocrine cells and neurons. The transmembrane domains (TMDs) of Syb and syntaxin span the vesicle and plasma membrane, respectively, and influence flux through fusion pores in endocrine cells as well as fusion pores formed during SNARE-mediated fusion of reconstituted membranes. These results support a model for exocytosis in which SNARE TMDs form the initial fusion pore. The present study sought to test this model in synaptic terminals. Patch-clamp recordings of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) were used to probe fusion pore properties in cultured hippocampal neurons from mice of both sexes. Mutants harboring tryptophan at four different sites in the Syb TMD reduced the rate-of-rise of mEPSCs. A computer model that simulates glutamate diffusion and receptor activation kinetics could account for this reduction in mEPSC rise rate by slowing the flux of glutamate through synaptic fusion pores. TMD mutations introducing positive charge also reduced the mEPSC rise rate, but negatively charged residues and glycine, which should have done the opposite, had no effect. The sensitivity of mEPSCs to pharmacological blockade of receptor desensitization was enhanced by a mutation that slowed the mEPSC rate-of-rise, suggesting that the mutation prolonged the residence of glutamate in the synaptic cleft. The same four Syb TMD residues found here to influence synaptic release were found previously to influence endocrine release, leading us to propose that a similar TMD-lined fusion pore functions widely in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-triggered exocytosis in mammalian cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; SNARE proteins function broadly in biological membrane fusion. Evidence from non-neuronal systems suggests that SNARE proteins initiate fusion by forming a fusion pore lined by transmembrane domains, but this model has not yet been tested in synapses. The present study addressed this question by testing mutations in the synaptic vesicle SNARE synaptobrevin for an influence on the rise rate of miniature synaptic currents. These results indicate that synaptobrevin's transmembrane domain interacts with glutamate as it passes through the fusion pore. The sites in synaptobrevin that influence this flux are identical to those shown previously to influence flux through endocrine fusion pores. Thus, SNARE transmembrane domains may function in the fusion pores of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-triggered exocytosis of both neurotransmitters and hormones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Beta-Blocker Propranolol Modulates Decision Urgency During Sequential Information Gathering</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/32/7170?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Arbitrating between timely choice and extended information gathering is critical for effective decision making. Aberrant information gathering behavior is thought to be a feature of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder, but we know little about the underlying neurocognitive control mechanisms. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled drug study involving 60 healthy human subjects (30 female), we examined the effects of noradrenaline and dopamine antagonism on information gathering during performance of an information sampling task. We show that modulating noradrenaline function with 40 mg of the β-blocker propranolol leads to decreased information gathering behavior. Modulating dopamine function via a single dose of 400 mg of amisulpride revealed some effects that were intermediate between those of propranolol and placebo. Using a Bayesian computational model, we show that sampling behavior is best explained by inclusion of a nonlinear urgency signal that promotes commitment to an early decision. Noradrenaline blockade promotes the expression of this decision-related urgency signal during information gathering. We discuss the findings with respect to psychopathological conditions that are linked to aberrant information gathering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Knowing when to stop gathering information and commit to a choice option is nontrivial. This is an important element in arbitrating between information gain and energy conservation. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled drug study, we investigated the role of catecholamines noradrenaline and dopamine on sequential information gathering. We found that blockade of noradrenaline led to a decrease in information gathering. Dopamine blockade showed an intermediate, but nonsignificant, effect. Using a Bayesian computational model, we show that this noradrenaline effect is driven by increased decision urgency, a signal that reflects an escalating subjective cost of sampling. The observation that noradrenaline modulates decision urgency suggests new avenues for treating patients that show information gathering deficits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Generic Mechanism for Perceptual Organization in the Parietal Cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/32/7158?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Our visual system's ability to group visual elements into meaningful entities and to separate them from others is referred to as scene segmentation. Visual motion often provides a powerful cue for this process as parallax or coherence can inform the visual system about scene or object structure. Here we tested the hypothesis that scene segmentation by motion cues relies on a common neural substrate in the parietal cortex. We used fMRI and a set of three entirely distinct motion stimuli to examine scene segmentation in the human brain. The stimuli covered a wide range of high-level processes, including perceptual grouping, transparent motion, and depth perception. All stimuli were perceptually bistable such that percepts alternated every few seconds while the physical stimulation remained constant. The perceptual states were asymmetric, in that one reflected the default (nonsegmented) interpretation, and the other the non-default (segmented) interpretation. We confirmed behaviorally that upon stimulus presentation, the default percept was always perceived first, before perceptual alternations ensued. Imaging results showed that across all stimulus classes perceptual scene-segmentation was associated with an increase of activity in the posterior parietal cortex together with a decrease of neural signal in the early visual cortex. This pattern of activation is compatible with predictive coding models of visual perception, and suggests that parietal cortex hosts a generic mechanism for scene segmentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Making sense of cluttered visual scenes is crucial for everyday perception. An important cue to scene segmentation is visual motion: slight movements of scene elements give away which elements belong to the foreground or background or to the same object. We used three distinct stimuli that engage visual scene segmentation mechanisms based on motion. They involved perceptual grouping, transparent motion, and depth perception. Brain activity associated with all three mechanisms converged in the same parietal region with concurrent deactivation of early visual areas. The results suggest that posterior parietal cortex is a hub involved in structuring visual scenes based on different motion cues, and that feedback modulates early cortical processing in accord with predictive coding theory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neural Computations Underlying Causal Structure Learning</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/32/7143?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Behavioral evidence suggests that beliefs about causal structure constrain associative learning, determining which stimuli can enter into association, as well as the functional form of that association. Bayesian learning theory provides one mechanism by which structural beliefs can be acquired from experience, but the neural basis of this mechanism is poorly understood. We studied this question with a combination of behavioral, computational, and neuroimaging techniques. Male and female human subjects learned to predict an outcome based on cue and context stimuli while being scanned using fMRI. Using a model-based analysis of the fMRI data, we show that structure learning signals are encoded in posterior parietal cortex, lateral prefrontal cortex, and the frontal pole. These structure learning signals are distinct from associative learning signals. Moreover, representational similarity analysis and information mapping revealed that the multivariate patterns of activity in posterior parietal cortex and anterior insula encode the full posterior distribution over causal structures. Variability in the encoding of the posterior across subjects predicted variability in their subsequent behavioral performance. These results provide evidence for a neural architecture in which structure learning guides the formation of associations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Animals are able to infer the hidden structure behind causal relations between stimuli in the environment, allowing them to generalize this knowledge to stimuli they have never experienced before. A recently published computational model based on this idea provided a parsimonious account of a wide range of phenomena reported in the animal learning literature, suggesting a dedicated neural mechanism for learning this hidden structure. Here, we validate this model by measuring brain activity during a task that involves both structure learning and associative learning. We show that a distinct network of regions supports structure learning and that the neural signal corresponding to beliefs about structure predicts future behavioral performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Efficient Coding in Visual Working Memory Accounts for Stimulus-Specific Variations in Recall</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/32/7132?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recall of visual features from working memory varies in both bias and precision depending on stimulus parameters. Whereas a number of models can approximate the average distribution of recall error across target stimuli, attempts to model how error varies with the choice of target have been &lt;i&gt;ad hoc&lt;/i&gt;. Here we adapt a neural model of working memory to provide a principled account of these stimulus-specific effects, by allowing each neuron's tuning function to vary according to the principle of efficient coding, which states that neural responses should be optimized with respect to the frequency of stimuli in nature. For orientation, this means incorporating a prior that favors cardinal over oblique orientations. While continuing to capture the changes in error distribution with set size, the resulting model accurately described stimulus-specific variations as well, better than a slot-based competitor. Efficient coding produces a repulsive bias away from cardinal orientations, a bias that ought to be sensitive to changes in the environmental statistics. We subsequently tested whether shifts in the stimulus distribution influenced response bias to uniformly sampled target orientations in human subjects (of either sex). Across adaptation blocks, we manipulated the distribution of nontarget items by sampling from a bimodal congruent (incongruent) distribution with peaks centered on cardinal (oblique) orientations. Preadaptation responses were repulsed away from the cardinal axes. However, exposure to the incongruent distribution produced systematic decreases in repulsion that persisted after adaptation. This result confirms the role of prior expectation in generating stimulus-specific effects and validates the neural framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Theories of neural coding have been used successfully to explain how errors in recall from working memory depend on the number of items stored. However, recall of visual features also shows stimulus-specific variation in bias and precision. Here we unify two previously unconnected theories, the neural resource model of working memory and the efficient coding framework, to provide a principled account of these stimulus-specific effects. Given the importance of working memory limitations to multiple aspects of human and animal behavior, and the recent high-profile advances in theories of efficient coding, our modeling framework provides a richer, yet parsimonious, description of how orientation encoding influences visual working memory performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the striatum, medium spiny neurons (MSNs) are heavily involved in controlling movement and reward. MSNs form two distinct populations expressing either dopamine receptor 1 (D1-MSN) or dopamine receptor 2 (D2-MSN), which differ in their projection targets and neurochemical composition. The activity of both types of MSNs is shaped by multiple neuromodulatory inputs processed by GPCRs that fundamentally impact their synaptic properties biasing behavioral outcomes. How these GPCR signaling cascades are regulated and what downstream targets they recruit in D1-MSN and D2-MSN populations are incompletely understood. In this study, we examined the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the action of RGS9–2, a key GPCR regulator in MSNs implicated in both movement control and actions of addictive drugs. Imaging cultured striatal neurons, we found that ablation of RGS9–2 significantly reduced calcium influx through NMDARs. Electrophysiological recordings in slices confirmed inhibition of NMDAR function in MSNs, resulting in enhanced AMPAR/NMDAR ratio. Accordingly, male mice lacking RGS9–2 displayed behavioral hypersensitivity to NMDAR blockade by MK-801 or ketamine. Recordings from genetically identified populations of striatal neurons revealed that these changes were selective to D2-MSNs. Surprisingly, we found that these postsynaptic effects resulted in remodeling of presynaptic inputs to D2-MSNs increasing the frequency of mEPSC and inhibiting paired-pulse ratio. Pharmacological dissection revealed that these adaptations were mediated by the NMDAR-dependent inhibition of retrograde endocannabinoid signaling from D2-MSNs to CB1 receptor on presynaptic terminals. Together, these data demonstrate a novel mechanism for pathway selective regulation of synaptic plasticity in MSNs controlled by GPCR signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study identifies a role for a major G-protein regulator in controlling synaptic properties of striatal neurons in a pathway selective fashion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Synaptopathy in the Aging Cochlea: Characterizing Early-Neural Deficits in Auditory Temporal Envelope Processing</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/32/7108?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aging listeners, even in the absence of overt hearing loss measured as changes in hearing thresholds, often experience impairments processing temporally complex sounds such as speech in noise. Recent evidence has shown that normal aging is accompanied by a progressive loss of synapses between inner hair cells and auditory nerve fibers. The role of this cochlear synaptopathy in degraded temporal processing with age is not yet understood. Here, we used population envelope following responses, along with other hair cell- and neural-based measures from an age-graded series of male and female CBA/CaJ mice to study changes in encoding stimulus envelopes. By comparing responses obtained before and after the application of the neurotoxin ouabain to the inner ear, we demonstrate that we can study changes in temporal processing on either side of the cochlear synapse. Results show that deficits in neural coding with age emerge at the earliest neural stages of auditory processing and are correlated with the degree of cochlear synaptopathy. These changes are seen before losses in neural thresholds and particularly affect the suprathreshold processing of sound. Responses obtained from more central sources show smaller differences with age, suggesting compensatory gain. These results show that progressive cochlear synaptopathy is accompanied by deficits in temporal coding at the earliest neural generators and contribute to the suprathreshold sound processing deficits observed with age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Aging listeners often experience difficulty hearing and understanding speech in noisy conditions. The results described here suggest that age-related loss of cochlear synapses may be a significant contributor to those performance declines. We observed aberrant neural coding of sounds in the early auditory pathway, which was accompanied by and correlated with an age-progressive loss of synapses between the inner hair cells and the auditory nerve. Deficits first appeared before changes in hearing thresholds and were largest at higher sound levels relevant to real world communication. The noninvasive tests described here may be adapted to detect cochlear synaptopathy in the clinical setting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Drug Refraining and Seeking Potentiate Synapses on Distinct Populations of Accumbens Medium Spiny Neurons</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/32/7100?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cocaine-associated cues and contexts can precipitate drug seeking in humans and in experimental animals. Glutamatergic synapses in the core subcompartment of the nucleus accumbens (NAcore) undergo transient potentiation in response to presenting drug-associated cues. The NAcore contains two populations of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) that differentially express D1 or D2 dopamine receptors. By recording the ratio of AMPA and NMDA glutamate receptor currents (AMPA/NMDA ratio) from MSNs in NAcore tissue slices, we endeavored to understand which subpopulation of MSNs was undergoing transient potentiation. Transgenic female and male mice differentially expressing fluorescent reporters in D1 or D2 MSNs were withdrawn for 2–3 weeks after being trained to self-administer cocaine. In some mice, discrete cocaine-conditioned cues were isolated from the drug-associated context via extinction training, which causes rodents to refrain from drug seeking in the extinguished context. By measuring AMPA/NMDA ratios in the drug context with or without contextual or discrete cues, and with or without extinction training, we made the following three discoveries: (1) mice refraining from cocaine seeking in the extinguished context showed selective elevation in AMPA/NMDA ratios in D2 MSNs; (2) without extinction training, the drug-associated context selectively increased AMPA/NMDA ratios in D1 MSNs; (3) mice undergoing cue-induced cocaine seeking after extinction training in the drug-associated context showed AMPA/NMDA ratio increases in both D1 and D2 MSNs. These findings reveal that the NAcore codes drug seeking through transient potentiation of D1 MSNs, and that refraining from cocaine seeking in an extinguished context is coded through transient potentiation of D2 MSNs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Relapse is a primary symptom of addiction that can involve competition between the desire to use drugs and the desire to refrain from using drugs. Drug-associated cues induce relapse, which is correlated with transiently potentiated glutamatergic synapses in the nucleus accumbens core. We determined which of two cell populations in the accumbens core, D1-expressing or D2-expressing neurons, undergo transient synaptic potentiation. After being trained to self-administer cocaine, mice underwent withdrawal, some with and others without extinguishing responding in the drug-associated context. Extinguished mice showed transient potentiation in D2-expressing neurons in the extinguished environment, and all mice engaged in context-induced or cue-induced drug seeking showed transient potentiation of D1-expressing neurons. A simple binary engram in accumbens for seeking drugs and refraining from drugs offers opportunities for cell-specific therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Targeting TrkB with a Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Mimetic Promotes Myelin Repair in the Brain</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/32/7088?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Methods to promote myelin regeneration in response to central myelin loss are essential to prevent the progression of clinical disability in demyelinating diseases. The neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is known to promote myelination during development via oligodendrocyte expressed TrkB receptors. Here, we use a structural mimetic of BDNF to promote myelin regeneration in a preclinical mouse model of central demyelination. In female mice, we show that selective targeting of TrkB with the BDNF-mimetic enhances remyelination, increasing oligodendrocyte differentiation, the frequency of myelinated axons, and myelin sheath thickness after a demyelinating insult. Treatment with exogenous BDNF exerted an attenuated effect, increasing myelin sheath thickness only. Further, following conditional deletion of TrkB from premyelinating oligodendrocytes, we show the effects of the BDNF-mimetic on oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination are lost, indicating these are dependent on oligodendrocyte expression of TrkB. Overall, these studies demonstrate that targeting oligodendrocyte TrkB promotes &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; remyelination in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Novel strategies to promote myelin regeneration are required to prevent progressive neurodegeneration and clinical disability in patients with central demyelinating disease. Here, we test whether selectively targeting the TrkB receptor on the myelin-producing oligodendrocytes, can promote remyelination in the brain. Using a structural mimetic of its native ligand, BDNF, we show that stimulation of TrkB enhances remyelination, increasing oligodendrocyte differentiation, the frequency of myelinated axons and thickness of the myelin sheath following a demyelinating insult. Further, we show that these effects are dependent on the phosphorylation of oligodendrocyte expressed TrkB receptors &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Overall, we demonstrate that selective targeting of TrkB has therapeutic potential to promote remyelination in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Claudin-like Protein HPO-30 Is Required to Maintain LAChRs at the C. elegans Neuromuscular Junction</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/32/7072?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Communications across chemical synapses are primarily mediated by neurotransmitters and their postsynaptic receptors. There are diverse molecular systems to localize and regulate the receptors at the synapse. Here, we identify HPO-30, a member of the claudin superfamily of membrane proteins, as a positive regulator for synaptic localization of levamisole-dependent AChRs (LAChRs) at the &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; neuromuscular junction (NMJ). The HPO-30 protein localizes at the NMJ and shows genetic and physical association with the LAChR subunits LEV-8, UNC-29, and UNC-38. Using genetic and electrophysiological assays in the hermaphrodite &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;, we demonstrate that HPO-30 functions through Neuroligin at the NMJ to maintain postsynaptic LAChR levels at the synapse. Together, this work suggests a novel function for a tight junction protein in maintaining normal receptor levels at the NMJ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Claudins are a large superfamily of membrane proteins. Their role in maintaining the functional integrity of tight junctions has been widely explored. Our experiments suggest a critical role for the claudin-like protein, HPO-30, in maintaining synaptic levamisole-dependent AChR (LAChR) levels. LAChRs contribute to &amp;lt;20% of the acetylcholine-mediated conductance in adult &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;; however, they play a significant functional role in worm locomotion. This study provides a new perspective in the study of LAChR physiology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Regional Distribution of CNS Antigens Differentially Determines T-Cell Mediated Neuroinflammation in a CX3CR1-Dependent Manner</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/32/7058?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;T cells continuously sample CNS-derived antigens in the periphery, yet it is unknown how they sample and respond to CNS antigens derived from distinct brain areas. We expressed ovalbumin (OVA) neoepitopes in regionally distinct CNS areas (Cnp-OVA and Nes-OVA mice) to test peripheral antigen sampling by OVA-specific T cells under homeostatic and neuroinflammatory conditions. We show that antigen sampling in the periphery is independent of regional origin of CNS antigens in both male and female mice. However, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is differentially influenced in Cnp-OVA and Nes-OVA female mice. Although there is the same frequency of CD45&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; CD11b+ CD11c+ CX3CL1+ myeloid cell–T-cell clusters in neoepitope-expressing areas, EAE is inhibited in Nes-OVA female mice and accelerated in CNP-OVA female mice. Accumulation of OVA-specific T cells and their immunomodulatory effects on EAE are CX3C chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1) dependent. These data show that despite similar levels of peripheral antigen sampling, CNS antigen-specific T cells differentially influence neuroinflammatory disease depending on the location of cognate antigens and the presence of CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Our data show that peripheral T cells similarly recognize neoepitopes independent of their origin within the CNS under homeostatic conditions. Contrastingly, during ongoing autoimmune neuroinflammation, neoepitope-specific T cells differentially influence clinical score and pathology based on the CNS regional location of the neoepitopes in a CX3CR1-dependent manner. Altogether, we propose a novel mechanism for how T cells respond to regionally distinct CNS derived antigens and contribute to CNS autoimmune pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Angiotensin II Triggers Peripheral Macrophage-to-Sensory Neuron Redox Crosstalk to Elicit Pain</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/32/7032?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Injury, inflammation, and nerve damage initiate a wide variety of cellular and molecular processes that culminate in hyperexcitation of sensory nerves, which underlies chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Using behavioral readouts of pain hypersensitivity induced by angiotensin II (Ang II) injection into mouse hindpaws, our study shows that activation of the type 2 Ang II receptor (AT2R) and the cell-damage-sensing ion channel TRPA1 are required for peripheral mechanical pain sensitization induced by Ang II in male and female mice. However, we show that AT2R is not expressed in mouse and human dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons. Instead, expression/activation of AT2R on peripheral/skin macrophages (Ms) constitutes a critical trigger of mouse and human DRG sensory neuron excitation. Ang II-induced peripheral mechanical pain hypersensitivity can be attenuated by chemogenetic depletion of peripheral Ms. Furthermore, AT2R activation in Ms triggers production of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, which &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-activate TRPA1 on mouse and human DRG sensory neurons via cysteine modification of the channel. Our study thus identifies a translatable immune cell-to-sensory neuron signaling crosstalk underlying peripheral nociceptor sensitization. This form of cell-to-cell signaling represents a critical peripheral mechanism for chronic pain and thus identifies multiple druggable analgesic targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Pain is a widespread health problem that is undermanaged by currently available analgesics. Findings from a recent clinical trial on a type II angiotensin II receptor (AT2R) antagonist showed effective analgesia for neuropathic pain. AT2R antagonists have been shown to reduce neuropathy-, inflammation- and bone cancer-associated pain in rodents. We report that activation of AT2R in macrophages (Ms) that infiltrate the site of injury, but not in sensory neurons, triggers an intercellular redox communication with sensory neurons via activation of the cell damage/pain-sensing ion channel TRPA1. This M-to-sensory neuron crosstalk results in peripheral pain sensitization. Our findings provide an evidence-based mechanism underlying the analgesic action of AT2R antagonists, which could accelerate the development of efficacious non-opioid analgesic drugs for multiple pain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Persistent activity generated in the PFC during the delay period of working memory tasks represents information about stimuli held in memory and determines working memory performance.

	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/32/7013?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Persistent spiking has been thought to underlie working memory (WM). However, virtually all of the evidence for this comes from studies that averaged spiking across time and across trials, which masks the details. On single trials, activity often occurs in sparse transient bursts. This has important computational and functional advantages. In addition, examination of more complex tasks reveals neural coding in WM is dynamic over the course of a trial. All this suggests that spiking is important for WM, but that its role is more complex than simply persistent spiking.&lt;/p&gt;

for generally incompatible contexts in the common Kolmogorov probability space.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Experimental Design Modulates Variance in BOLD Activation: The Variance Design General Linear Model. (arXiv:1808.02157v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02157</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Typical fMRI studies have focused on either the mean trend in the
blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) time course or functional connectivity
(FC). However, other statistics of the neuroimaging data may contain important
information. Despite studies showing links between the variance in the BOLD
time series (BV) and age and cognitive performance, a formal framework for
testing these effects has not yet been developed. We introduce the Variance
Design General Linear Model (VDGLM), a novel framework that facilitates the
detection of variance effects. We designed the framework for general use in any
fMRI study by modeling both mean and variance in BOLD activation as a function
of experimental design. The flexibility of this approach allows the VDGLM to i)
simultaneously make inferences about a mean or variance effect while
controlling for the other and ii) test for variance effects that could be
associated with multiple conditions and/or noise regressors. We demonstrate the
use of the VDGLM in a working memory application and show that engagement in a
working memory task is associated with whole-brain decreases in BOLD variance.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37818</link>
	<content:encoded>Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) is both a first responder to DNA damage and a chromatin architectural protein. How PARP1 rapidly finds DNA damage sites in the context of a nucleus filled with undamaged DNA, to which it also binds, is an unresolved question. Here we show that PARP1 association with DNA is diffusion-limited, and release of PARP1 from DNA is promoted by binding of an additional DNA molecule that facilitates a 'monkey bar' mechanism, also known as intersegment transfer. The WGR-domain of PARP1 is essential to this mechanism, and a point mutation (W589A) recapitulates the altered kinetics of the domain deletion. Demonstrating the physiological importance of the monkey bar mechanism for PARP1 function, the W589A mutant accumulates at sites of DNA damage more slowly following laser micro-irradiation than wild-type PARP1. Clinically relevant inhibitors of PARP1 did not alter the rate or mechanism of the release of PARP1 from DNA.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/388223v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Assimilation of novel strategies into a consolidated action repertoire is a crucial function for behavioral adaptation and cognitive flexibility. Acetylcholine in the striatum plays a pivotal role in such adaptation and its release has been causally associated with the activity of cholinergic interneurons. Here we show that the midbrain, a previously unknown source of acetylcholine in the striatum, is a major contributor to cholinergic transmission in the striatal complex. Neurons of the pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei synapse with striatal cholinergic interneurons and give rise to excitatory responses that, in turn, mediate inhibition of spiny projection neurons. Inhibition of acetylcholine release from midbrain terminals in the striatum impairs action shifting and mimics the effects observed following inhibition of acetylcholine release from striatal cholinergic interneurons. These results suggest the existence of two hierarchically-organized modes of cholinergic transmission in the striatum where cholinergic interneurons are modulated by cholinergic neurons of the midbrain.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The maternal brain displays considerable plasticity, and motherhood is associated with changes in affective and cognitive function. Motherhood can alter the trajectory of brain ageing, including modifications to neuroplasticity and cognition. Here, we investigated the short- and long-term effects of motherhood on hippocampal neurogenesis, microglial density and morphology, and circulating cytokines, domains known to be altered with age and implicated in cognition and mood. Female rats were bred then euthanized during gestation or at various postpartum timepoints, culminating in middle age, and nulliparous rats served as age-matched controls. Hippocampal neurogenesis was significantly suppressed during gestation and the postpartum period. Interestingly, neurogenesis declined significantly in middle-aged nulliparous rats, but increased in primiparous rats across the same period. Transient postpartum adaptations to the neuroimmune environment of the hippocampus were evidenced, as Iba-1-immunoreactive microglia assumed a de-ramified morphology followed by increased density. Intriguingly, ageing-related changes in circulating cytokines were dependent on parity. These adaptations in neurogenic and immune processes may have ramifications for maternal mood and cognition across the peripartum period and beyond.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Prevalence of Depression among Epileptic Patients and its Association with Drug Therapy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/387571v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract Background: Despite the high prevalence of epilepsy in sub-Saharan Africa and the established relationship between depression and epilepsy, the extent of comorbid epilepsy and depression in the region is still poorly understood. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to address this gap in the literature by determining the pooled prevalence of depression among epileptic patients in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: A systematic desk review and electronic web-based search of PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, PsycINFO and the World Health Organizations Hinari portal (which includes the SCOPUS, African Index Medicus, and African Journals Online databases) identified peer-reviewed research studies and doctoral dissertations on the prevalence of depression among patients with epilepsy using pre-defined quality and inclusion criteria. Relevant data were extracted and descriptive summaries of the studies presented in tabular form. The I2 test was used to assess heterogeneity across studies. A random effects model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence of comorbidity at a 95% confidence interval (CI). Funnel plot asymmetry and Eggers tests were used to check for publication bias. The final effect size was determined by applying a trim and fill analysis in a random-effects model. Results: Our search identified 167 studies, of which 16 articles were eligible for inclusion the final analysis. The pooled estimate of prevalence of depression among patients with epilepsy was 32.71 (95% CI: 25.50 - 39.91). Regional sub-group analysis found that the pooled prevalence in East Africa was 34.52 (95% CI: 23.53 - 45.51) and 29.69 (95% CI: 22.7 - 36.68) in Southern and West Africa. The odds of depression among epileptic patients receiving polytherapy were 2.65 higher than in those receiving monotherapy (95% CI: 1.49 - 4.71, I2=79.1%, p &amp;lt; 0.05). Conclusion: Our findings indicate high comorbidity in sub-Saharan Africa and suggests that it may be more prevalent there than elsewhere. Comorbidity is statistically associated with polytherapy. Given the high levels of epilepsy in the region, more attention should be paid to incorporating depression screening and treatment into existing epilepsy programs and to revising treatment guidelines on comorbid depression to reduce polytherapy.

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/387555v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Neurokinin B (NKB) signaling is critical for reproduction in all studied species. The existing consensus is that NKB induces GnRH release via kisspeptin (Kiss1) stimulation in the arcuate nucleus. However, the stimulatory action of NKB is dependent on circulating estrogen (E2) levels, without which, NKB inhibits LH release. Importantly, the evidence supporting the kisspeptin-dependent role of NKB, derives from models of persistent hypogonadal state [e.g. Kiss1r knock-out (KO) mice], with reduced E2 levels. Here, we demonstrate that in the presence of E2, NKB signaling induces LH release in a kisspeptin-independent manner. Moreover, senktide (NKB receptor agonist) delivery to the medial amygdala (MeA) increases LH in E2-treated Kiss1 KO females (but not males or sham-treated females) similar to controls, and thus, this increase is independent of Kiss1 neurons. These results document a novel kisspeptin-independent regulatory pathway of reproductive function in females mediated by NKB-responsive neurons in the MeA.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/387332v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Performance-based incentives tend to increase an individual's motivation, resulting in enhancements in behavioral output. While much work has focused on understanding how the brain's reward circuitry influences incentive motivated performance, fewer studies have investigated how such reward representations act on the motor system. Here we measured motor cortical excitability with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) while female and male human participants performed a motoric incentive motivation task for prospective monetary gains and losses. We found that individuals' performance increased for increasing prospective gains and losses. While motor cortical excitability appeared insensitive to prospective loss, temporal features of motor cortical excitability for prospective gains were modulated by an independent measure of an individual's subjective preferences for incentive (i.e., loss aversion). Those individuals that were more loss averse had a greater motor cortical sensitivity to prospective gain, closer to movement onset. Critically, behavioral sensitivity to incentive and motor cortical sensitivity to prospective gains were both predicted by loss aversion. Furthermore, causal modeling indicated that motor cortical sensitivity to incentive mediated the relationship between subjective preferences for incentive and behavioral sensitivity to incentive. Together our findings suggest that motor cortical activity integrates information about the subjective value of reward to invigorate incentive motivated performance.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Network-level allosteric effects are elucidated by detailing how ligand-binding events modulate utilization of catalytic potentials</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/cFSQuS8gwrc/article</link>

Allosteric regulation has traditionally been described by mathematically-complex allosteric rate laws in the form of ratios of polynomials derived from the application of simplifying kinetic assumptions. Alternatively, an approach that explicitly describes all known ligand-binding events requires no simplifying assumptions while allowing for the computation of enzymatic states. Here, we employ such a modeling approach to examine the “catalytic potential” of an enzyme—an enzyme’s capacity to catalyze a biochemical reaction. The catalytic potential is the fundamental result of multiple ligand-binding events that represents a “tug of war” among the various regulators and substrates within the network. This formalism allows for the assessment of interacting allosteric enzymes and development of a network-level understanding of regulation. We first define the catalytic potential and use it to characterize the response of three key kinases (hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase) in human red blood cell glycolysis to perturbations in ATP utilization. Next, we examine the sensitivity of the catalytic potential by using existing personalized models, finding that the catalytic potential allows for the identification of subtle but important differences in how individuals respond to such perturbations. Finally, we explore how the catalytic potential can help to elucidate how enzymes work in tandem to maintain a homeostatic state. Taken together, this work provides an interpretation and visualization of the dynamic interactions and network-level effects of interacting allosteric enzymes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cFSQuS8gwrc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Network supporting contextual fear learning after dorsal hippocampal damage has increased dependence on retrosplenial cortex</title>

Hippocampal damage results in profound retrograde, but no anterograde amnesia in contextual fear conditioning (CFC). Although the content learned in the latter have been discussed, alternative regions supporting CFC learning were seldom proposed and never empirically addressed. Here, we employed network analysis of pCREB expression quantified from brain slices of rats with dorsal hippocampal lesion (dHPC) after undergoing CFC session. Using inter-regional correlations of pCREB-positive nuclei between brain regions, we modelled functional networks using different thresholds. The dHPC network showed small-world topology, equivalent to SHAM (control) network. However, diverging hubs were identified in each network. In a direct comparison, hubs in both networks showed consistently higher centrality values compared to the other network. Further, the distribution of correlation coefficients was different between the groups, with most significantly stronger correlation coefficients belonging to the SHAM network. These results suggest that dHPC network engaged in CFC learning is partially different, and engage alternative hubs. We next tested if pre-training lesions of dHPC and one of the new dHPC network hubs (perirhinal, Per; or disgranular retrosplenial, RSC, cortices) would impair CFC. Only dHPC-RSC, but not dHPC-Per, impaired CFC. Interestingly, only RSC showed a consistently higher centrality in the dHPC network, suggesting that the increased centrality reflects an increased functional dependence on RSC. Our results provide evidence that, without hippocampus, the RSC, an anatomically central region in the medial temporal lobe memory system might support CFC learning and memory.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Nut-R4-WNSE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The high specificity of calcium-binding proteins has been intriguing since Mg2+ has a higher charge density than Ca2+ and is expected to...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/epKeY7ZFEeU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Differential Involvement of Kinase Activity of Ca2+/Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase II{alpha} in Hippocampus- and Amygdala-Dependent Memory Revealed by Kinase-Dead Knock-in Mouse</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0133-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα (CaMKIIα) is a key mediator of activity-dependent neuronal modifications and has been implicated in the molecular mechanisms of learning and memory. Indeed, several types of CaMKIIα knock-in and knock-out mice revealed impairments in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and behavioral learning. On the other hand, a similar role for CaMKIIα has been implicated in amygdala-dependent memory, but detailed analyses have not much been performed yet. To better understand its involvement in amygdala-dependent memory as compared to hippocampus-dependent memory, here we performed biochemical analyses and behavioral memory tests using the kinase-dead CaMKIIα (K42R) knock-in mouse. In the Morris water maze tasks, homozygous mutants performed well in the visible platform trials, while they failed to form spatial memory in the hippocampus-dependent hidden platform trials. In fear conditioning, these mice were impaired but showed a certain level of amygdala-dependent cued fear memory, which lasted four weeks, while they showed virtually no hippocampus-dependent context discrimination. Neither stronger stimulation nor repetitive stimulation compensated for their memory deficits. The differential outcome of hippocampus- and amygdala-dependent memory in the mutant mouse was not due to differential expression of CaMKIIα between the hippocampus and the amygdala, because biochemical analyses revealed that both kinase activity and protein levels of CaMKII were indistinguishable between the two brain regions. These results indicate that kinase activity of CaMKIIα is indispensable for hippocampus-dependent memory, but not necessarily for amygdala-dependent memory. There may be a secondary, CaMKIIα activity-independent pathway, in addition to the CaMKIIα activity-dependent pathway, in the acquisition of amygdala-dependent memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Studying molecular mechanisms of learning and memory is important to confront memory-deficient and abnormal memory-associated disorders. An enzyme called Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα (CaMKIIα) that is abundant in the brain and phosphorylates important proteins has a key role in such mechanisms. However, how CaMKIIα enzymatic activity is involved in hippocampus- vs. amygdala-dependent memory is still not clear. Using our genetically engineered mouse that lacks kinase activity but retains protein expression of CaMKIIα, here we showed that kinase activity of CaMKIIα is indispensable for hippocampus-dependent space/context-related memory, but not necessarily for amygdala-dependent fear-related memory. The role of CaMKIIα kinase activity in distinguishing different contexts indicates its possible involvement as a measure against abnormal fear memory-associated disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Immediate-Early Promoter-Driven Transgenic Reporter System for Neuroethological Researches in a Hemimetabolous Insect</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0061-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Genes expressed in response to increased neuronal activity are widely used as activity markers in recent behavioral neuroscience. In the present study, we established transgenic reporter system for whole-brain activity mapping in the two-spotted cricket &lt;i&gt;Gryllus bimaculatus&lt;/i&gt;, a hemimetabolous insect used in neuroethology and behavioral ecology. In the cricket brain, a homolog of &lt;i&gt;early growth response-1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Gryllus egr-B&lt;/i&gt;) was rapidly induced as an immediate-early gene (IEG) in response to neuronal hyperexcitability. The upstream genomic fragment of &lt;i&gt;Gryllus egr-B&lt;/i&gt; contains potential binding sites for transcription factors regulated by various intracellular signaling pathways, as well as core promoter elements conserved across insect/crustacean &lt;i&gt;egr-B&lt;/i&gt; homologs. Using the upstream genomic fragment of &lt;i&gt;Gryllus egr-B,&lt;/i&gt; we established an IEG promoter-driven transgenic reporter system in the cricket. In the brain of transgenic crickets, the reporter gene (a nuclear-targeted destabilized EYFP) was induced in response to neuronal hyperexcitability. Inducible expression of reporter protein was detected in almost all neurons after neuronal hyperexcitability. Using our novel reporter system, we successfully detected neuronal activation evoked by feeding in the cricket brain. Our IEG promoter-driven activity reporting system allows us to visualize behaviorally relevant neural circuits at cellular resolution in the cricket brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Insects are the largest and most diverse group of organisms, and show a wide variety of behaviors. Despite the importance of a comparative approach, recent insect neuroethology mostly relies on the fruit fly &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;, a versatile model insect with particularly powerful genetic tools, and a relatively small number of researchers use non-&lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; insects. In the present study, a novel genetic reporting system for whole-brain activity mapping was established in the two-spotted cricket &lt;i&gt;Gryllus bimaculatus&lt;/i&gt; by using the newly identified and evolutionary conserved gene regulatory region of an immediate-early gene, &lt;i&gt;early growth response&lt;/i&gt;. This reporting system allowed us to analyze the behaviorally-evoked neural activity patterns at cellular resolution in the cricket brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Spiking Neural Networks modelled as Timed Automata with parameter learning. (arXiv:1808.01893v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01893</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this paper we present a novel approach to automatically infer parameters
of spiking neural networks. Neurons are modelled as timed automata waiting for
inputs on a number of different channels (synapses), for a given amount of time
(the accumulation period). When this period is over, the current potential
value is computed considering current and past inputs. If this potential
overcomes a given threshold, the automaton emits a broadcast signal over its
output channel , otherwise it restarts another accumulation period. After each
emission, the automaton remains inactive for a fixed refractory period. Spiking
neural networks are formalised as sets of automata, one for each neuron,
running in parallel and sharing channels according to the network structure.
Such a model is formally validated against some crucial properties defined via
proper temporal logic formulae. The model is then exploited to find an
assignment for the synaptical weights of neural networks such that they can
reproduce a given behaviour. The core of this approach consists in identifying
some correcting actions adjusting synaptical weights and back-propagating them
until the expected behaviour is displayed. A concrete case study is discussed.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01805</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Social and affective relations may shape empathy to others' affective states.
Previous studies also revealed that people tend to form very different mental
representations of stimuli on the basis of their physical distance. In this
regard, embodied cognition proposes that different physical distances between
individuals activate different interpersonal processing modes, such that close
physical distance tends to activate the interpersonal processing mode typical
of socially and affectively close relationships. In Experiment 1, two groups of
participants were administered a pain decision task involving upright and
inverted face stimuli painfully or neutrally stimulated, and we monitored their
neural empathic reactions by means of event-related potentials (ERPs)
technique. Crucially, participants were presented with face stimuli of one of
two possible sizes in order to manipulate retinal size and perceived physical
distance, roughly corresponding to the close and far portions of social
distance. ERPs modulations compatible with an empathic reaction were observed
only for the group exposed to face stimuli appearing to be at a close social
distance from the participants. This reaction was absent in the group exposed
to smaller stimuli corresponding to face stimuli observed from a far social
distance. In Experiment 2, one different group of participants was engaged in a
match-to-sample task involving the two-size upright face stimuli of Experiment
1 to test whether the modulation of neural empathic reaction observed in
Experiment 1 could be ascribable to differences in the ability to identify
faces of the two different sizes. Results suggested that face stimuli of the
two sizes could be equally identifiable. In line with the Construal Level and
Embodied Simulation theoretical frameworks, we conclude that perceived physical
distance may shape empathy as well as social and affective distance.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Multi-Objective Cognitive Model: a supervised approach for multi-subject fMRI analysis. (arXiv:1808.01642v1 [stat.ML])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01642</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In order to decode the human brain, Multivariate Pattern (MVP) classification
generates cognitive models by using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(fMRI) datasets. As a standard pipeline in the MVP analysis, brain patterns in
multi-subject fMRI dataset must be mapped to a shared space and then a
classification model is generated by employing the mapped patterns. However,
the MVP models may not provide stable performance on a new fMRI dataset because
the standard pipeline uses disjoint steps for generating these models. Indeed,
each step in the pipeline includes an objective function with independent
optimization approach, where the best solution of each step may not be optimum
for the next steps. For tackling the mentioned issue, this paper introduces the
Multi-Objective Cognitive Model (MOCM) that utilizes an integrated objective
function for MVP analysis rather than just using those disjoint steps. For
solving the integrated problem, we proposed a customized multi-objective
optimization approach, where all possible solutions are firstly generated, and
then our method ranks and selects the robust solutions as the final results.
Empirical studies confirm that the proposed method can generate superior
performance in comparison with other techniques.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Colour for behavioural success. (arXiv:1808.01612v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01612</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Colour information not only helps sustain the survival of animal species by
guiding sexual selection and foraging behaviour, but also is an important
factor in the cultural and technological development of our own species. This
is illustrated by examples from the visual arts and from state-of-the-art
imaging technology, where the strategic use of colour has become a powerful
tool for guiding the planning and execution of interventional procedures. The
functional role of colour information in terms of its potential benefits to
behavioural success across the species is addressed in the introduction here to
clarify why colour perception may have evolved to generate behavioural success.
It is argued that evolutionary and environmental pressures influence not only
colour trait production in the different species, but also their ability to
process and exploit colour information for goal-specific purposes. We then leap
straight to the human primate with insight from current research on the
facilitating role of colour cues on performance training with precision
technology for image-guided surgical planning and intervention. It is shown
that local colour cues in 2D images generated by a surgical fisheye camera help
individuals become more precise rapidly across a limited number of trial sets
in simulator training for specific manual gestures with a tool. The
progressively facilitating effect of a local colour cue on performance
evolution in a video controlled simulator task can be explained in terms of
colour-based figure-ground segregation guiding attention towards local image
parts, with an immediate cost on performance time, and a lasting long-term
benefit in terms of greater task precision.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01503</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Grid cells in the entorhinal cortex are believed to establish their regular,
spatially correlated firing patterns by path integration of the animal's
motion. Mechanisms for path integration, e.g. in attractor network models,
predict stochastic drift of grid responses, which is not observed
experimentally. We demonstrate a biologically plausible mechanism of dynamic
self-organization by which border cells, which fire at environmental
boundaries, can correct such drift in grid cells. In our model,
experience-dependent Hebbian plasticity during exploration allows border cells
to learn connectivity to grid cells. Border cells in this learned network reset
the phase of drifting grids. This error-correction mechanism is robust to
environmental shape and complexity, including enclosures with interior
barriers, and makes distinctive predictions for environmental deformation
experiments. Our work demonstrates how diverse cell types in the entorhinal
cortex could interact dynamically and adaptively to achieve robust path
integration.

	<title>eLife: latest articles: PIP2 depletion promotes TRPV4 channel activity in mouse brain capillary endothelial cells</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38689</link>
	<content:encoded>We recently reported that the inward-rectifier Kir2.1 channel in brain capillary endothelial cells (cECs) plays a major role in neurovascular coupling (NVC) by mediating a neuronal activity-dependent, propagating vasodilatory (hyperpolarizing) signal. We further demonstrated that Kir2.1 activity is suppressed by depletion of plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Whether cECs express depolarizing channels that intersect with Kir2.1-mediated signaling remains unknown. Here, we report that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-permeable TRPV4 (transient receptor potential vanilloid 4) channels are expressed in cECs and are tonically inhibited by PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. We further demonstrate that depletion of PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by agonists, including putative NVC mediators, that promote PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrolysis by signaling through G&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;-protein-coupled receptors (G&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;PCRs) caused simultaneous disinhibition of TRPV4 channels and suppression of Kir2.1 channels. These findings collectively support the concept that G&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;PCR activation functions as a molecular switch to favor capillary TRPV4 activity over Kir2.1 signaling, an observation with potentially profound significance for the control of cerebral blood flow.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Pharmacologic arm-selective unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling pathway activation is emerging as a promising strategy to ameliorate imbalances in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteostasis implicated in diverse diseases. The small molecule &lt;i&gt;N-&lt;/i&gt;(2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)-3-phenylpropanamide (&lt;b&gt;147&lt;/b&gt;) was previously identified (&lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml#bib35&quot;&gt;Plate et al., 2016&lt;/a&gt;) to preferentially activate the ATF6 arm of the UPR, promoting protective remodeling of the ER proteostasis network. Here we show that &lt;b&gt;147&lt;/b&gt;-dependent ATF6 activation requires metabolic oxidation to form an electrophile that preferentially reacts with ER proteins. Proteins covalently modified by &lt;b&gt;147&lt;/b&gt; include protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs), known to regulate ATF6 activation. Genetic depletion of PDIs perturbs &lt;b&gt;147&lt;/b&gt;-dependent induction of the ATF6-target gene, &lt;i&gt;BiP&lt;/i&gt;, implicating covalent modifications of PDIs in the preferential activation of ATF6 afforded by treatment with &lt;b&gt;147&lt;/b&gt;. Thus, &lt;b&gt;147&lt;/b&gt; is a pro-drug that preferentially activates ATF6 signaling through a mechanism involving localized metabolic activation and selective covalent modification of ER resident proteins that regulate ATF6 activity.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36745</link>
	<content:encoded>Cortical dynein generates pulling forces via microtubule (MT) end capture-shrinkage and lateral MT sliding mechanisms. In &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, the dynein attachment molecule Num1 interacts with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria to facilitate spindle positioning across the mother-bud neck, but direct evidence for how these cortical contacts regulate dynein-dependent pulling forces is lacking. We show that loss of Scs2/Scs22, ER tethering proteins, resulted in defective Num1 distribution and loss of dynein-dependent MT sliding, the hallmark of dynein function. Cells lacking Scs2/Scs22 performed spindle positioning via MT end capture-shrinkage mechanism, requiring dynein anchorage to an ER- and mitochondria-independent population of Num1, dynein motor activity, and CAP-Gly domain of dynactin Nip100/p150&lt;sup&gt;Glued&lt;/sup&gt; subunit. Additionally, a CAAX-targeted Num1 rescued loss of lateral patches and MT sliding in the absence of Scs2/Scs22. These results reveal distinct populations of Num1 and underline the importance of their spatial distribution as a critical factor for regulating dynein pulling force.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection constitutes a global public health problem. In order to establish how HBV was disseminated across different geographic regions, we estimated the levels of regional clustering for genotypes D and A. We used 916 HBV-D and 493 HBV-A full-length sequences to reconstruct their global phylogeny. Phylogeographic analysis was conducted by reconstruction of ancestral states using the criterion of parsimony. The putative origin of genotype D was in North Africa/Middle East. HBV-D sequences form low levels of regional clustering for the Middle East and Southern Europe. In contrast, HBV-A sequences form two major clusters, the first including sequences mostly from sub-Saharan Africa, and the second including sequences mostly from Western and Central Europe. Conclusion: We observed considerable differences in the global dissemination patterns of HBV-D and HBV-A and different levels of monophyletic clustering in relation to the regions of prevalence of each genotype.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/35738</link>
	<content:encoded>HIV-1 accesses the nuclear DNA of interphase cells via a poorly defined process involving functional interactions between the capsid protein (CA) and nucleoporins (Nups). Here, we show that HIV-1 CA can bind multiple Nups, and that both natural and manipulated variation in Nup levels impacts HIV-1 infection in a manner that is strikingly dependent on cell-type, cell-cycle, and cyclophilin A (CypA). We also show that Nups mediate the function of the antiviral protein MX2, and that MX2 can variably inhibit non-viral NLS function. Remarkably, both enhancing and inhibiting effects of cyclophilin A and MX2 on various HIV-1 CA mutants could be induced or abolished by manipulating levels of the Nup93 subcomplex, the Nup62 subcomplex, NUP88, NUP21, RANBP2, or NUP153. Our findings suggest that several Nup-dependent 'pathways' are variably exploited by HIV-1 to target host DNA in a cell-type, cell-cycle, CypA and CA-sequence dependent manner, and are differentially inhibited by MX2.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34963</link>
	<content:encoded>Encoding precision in visual working memory decreases with the number of encoded items. Here, we propose a normative theory for such set size effects: the brain minimizes a weighted sum of an error-based behavioral cost and a neural encoding cost. We construct a model from this theory and find that it predicts set size effects. Notably, these effects are mediated by probing probability, which aligns with previous empirical findings. The model accounts well for effects of both set size and probing probability on encoding precision in nine delayed-estimation experiments. Moreover, we find support for the prediction that the total amount of invested resource can vary non-monotonically with set size. Finally, we show that it is sometimes optimal to encode only a subset or even none of the relevant items in a task. Our findings raise the possibility that cognitive 'limitations' arise from rational cost minimization rather than from constraints.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Growth cones navigate axonal projection in response to guidance cues. However, it is unclear how they can decide the migratory direction by transducing the local spatial cues into protrusive forces. Here we show that knockout mice of &lt;i&gt;Shootin1&lt;/i&gt; display abnormal projection of the forebrain commissural axons, a phenotype similar to that of the axon guidance molecule netrin-1. Shallow gradients of netrin-1 elicited highly polarized Pak1-mediated phosphorylation of shootin1 within growth cones. We demonstrate that netrin-1–elicited shootin1 phosphorylation increases shootin1 interaction with the cell adhesion molecule L1-CAM; this, in turn, promotes F-actin–adhesion coupling and concomitant generation of forces for growth cone migration. Moreover, the spatially regulated shootin1 phosphorylation within growth cones is required for axon turning induced by netrin-1 gradients. Our study defines a mechano-effector for netrin-1 signaling and demonstrates that shootin1 phosphorylation is a critical readout for netrin-1 gradients that results in a directional mechanoresponse for axon guidance.</content:encoded>

Dynamic correlations are pervasive in high-throughput data. Large numbers of gene pairs can change their correlation patterns in response to observed/unobserved changes in physiological states. Finding changes in correlation patterns can reveal important regulatory mechanisms. Currently there is no method that can effectively detect global dynamic correlation patterns in a dataset. Given the challenging nature of the problem, the currently available methods use genes as surrogate measurements of physiological states, which cannot faithfully represent true underlying biological signals. In this study we develop a new method that directly identifies strong latent dynamic correlation signals from the data matrix, named DCA: Dynamic Correlation Analysis. At the center of the method is a new metric for the identification of pairs of variables that are highly likely to be dynamically correlated, without knowing the underlying physiological states that govern the dynamic correlation. We validate the performance of the method with extensive simulations. We applied the method to three real datasets: a single cell RNA-seq dataset, a bulk RNA-seq dataset, and a microarray gene expression dataset. In all three datasets, the method reveals novel latent factors with clear biological meaning, bringing new insights into the data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PtZYXnfwjiY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Differentiation in Theta and Beta Electrocortical Activity between Visual and Physical Perturbations to Walking and Standing Balance</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0207-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Human balance is a complex process in healthy adults, requiring precisely-timed coordination between sensory information, cognitive processing, and motor control. It has been difficult to quantify brain dynamics during human balance control due to limitations in brain imaging modalities. The goal of this study was to determine if by using high-density electroencephalography (EEG) and independent component analysis, we can identify common cortical responses to visual and physical balance perturbations during walking and standing. We studied the responses of 30 healthy young adults to sensorimotor perturbations that challenged their balance. Subjects performed four 10-minute trials of beam-walking and tandem stance while either being mediolaterally pulled at the waist or viewing brief 20° field-of-view rotations in virtual reality. We recorded high-density EEG, motion capture, lower leg electromyography (EMG), and neck EMG. We hypothesized that both physical pull and visual rotation perturbations would elicit time-frequency fluctuations in theta (4-8 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) bands, with increased occipito-parietal activity during visual rotations compared to pull perturbations. Our results confirmed this hypothesis. For both perturbations, we found early theta synchronization and late alpha-beta (8-30 Hz) desynchronization following perturbation onset. This pattern was strongest in occipito-parietal areas during visual perturbations and strongest in sensorimotor areas during pull perturbations. These results suggest a similar time-frequency electrocortical pattern when humans respond to sensorimotor conflict, but with substantive differences in the brain areas involved for visual vs. physical perturbations. Our findings may have important implications for assessing and training balance in individuals with and without motor disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; We performed the first EEG time-frequency analysis on source-localized human electrocortical responses to physical and visual balance perturbations during both walking and standing. Perturbations elicited similar time-frequency patterns, but in notably different cortical areas for physical versus visual perturbations. Perturbation-evoked EEG fluctuations localized primarily to occipito-parietal areas during visual perturbations and motor areas during physical perturbations. These similarities suggest a common electrocortical response to sensorimotor perturbations. Notably, standing had greater electrocortical responses than walking. The results from this study may have applications in assessing and assisting treatment of balance dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Built to Last: Functional and structural mechanisms in the moth olfactory network mitigate effects of neural injury. (arXiv:1808.01279v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01279</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Most organisms are exposed to neural damage throughout their lives, which can
reduce their ability to carry out core behavioral tasks. Their neural circuits
need to maintain functionality despite injury, which often requires that key
readout signals from the system be preserved. In this work, we explore whether
and how certain structural and functional network motifs act as injury
mitigation mechanisms by protecting these readouts. Specifically, we examine
how (i) Hebbian learning, (ii) high levels of noise, and (iii) presence of
parallel inhibitory and excitatory connections contribute to robustness of the
olfactory system in the Manduca sexta moth.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We simulate injuries on a detailed computational model of the moth olfactory
network in which structures-under-test are parametrically varied. Neuronal
impairments are modeled as focal axonal swellings, an axonal pathology observed
across all severities of traumatic brain injuries and present in other leading
brain disorders. Axonal swellings effectively compromise spike train
propagation along the axon and consequently reduce the effective neural firing
rate delivered to downstream neurons.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three of the network motifs examined significantly mitigate the effects
of injury on readout neurons, either by reducing injury's impact on readout
neuron responses or by restoring these responses to pre-injury levels through
reinforcement learning. These motifs may thus be partially explained by their
value as adaptive mechanisms to minimize the functional effects of neural
injury. More generally, these experiments suggest that robustness to injury is
a vital design principle to consider when analyzing biological neural systems.
Indeed, it is possible that some neural structures and mechanisms, including
the ability to learn, are best understood as evolutionary solutions to the
challenge of maintaining system function despite injury.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01058</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the information processing roles of cortical circuits is an
outstanding problem in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. The
theoretical setting of Bayesian inference has been suggested as a framework for
understanding cortical computation. Based on a recently published generative
model for visual inference (George et al., 2017), we derive a family of
anatomically instantiated and functional cortical circuit models. In contrast
to simplistic models of Bayesian inference, the underlying generative model's
representational choices are validated with real-world tasks that required
efficient inference and strong generalization. The cortical circuit model is
derived by systematically comparing the computational requirements of this
model with known anatomical constraints. The derived model suggests precise
functional roles for the feedforward, feedback and lateral connections observed
in different laminae and columns, and assigns a computational role for the path
through the thalamus.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36898</link>
	<content:encoded>Recent studies have challenged the prevailing dogma that transcription is repressed during mitosis. Transcription was also proposed to sustain a robust spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) response. Here we used live-cell imaging of human cells, RNA-seq and qPCR to investigate the requirement for de novo transcription during mitosis. Under conditions of persistently unattached kinetochores, transcription inhibition with actinomycin D, or treatment with other DNA-intercalating drugs, delocalized the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) protein Aurora B from centromeres, compromising SAC signalling and cell fate. However, we were unable to detect significant changes in mitotic transcript levels. Moreover, inhibition of transcription independently of DNA intercalation had no effect on Aurora B centromeric localization, SAC response, mitotic progression, exit or death. Mechanistically, we show that DNA intercalating agents reduce the interaction of the CPC with nucleosomes. Thus, mitotic progression, arrest, exit or death is determined by centromere structural integrity, rather than de novo transcription.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36851</link>
	<content:encoded>Centrioles are cylindrical assemblies comprised of 9 singlet, doublet, or triplet microtubules, essential for the formation of motile and sensory cilia. While the structure of the cilium is being defined at increasing resolution, centriolar structure remains poorly understood. Here, we used electron cryo-tomography to determine the structure of mammalian (triplet) and &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; (doublet) centrioles. Mammalian centrioles have two distinct domains: a 200 nm proximal core region connected by A-C linkers, and a distal domain where the C-tubule is incomplete and a pair of novel linkages stabilize the assembly producing a geometry more closely resembling the ciliary axoneme. &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; centrioles resemble the mammalian core, but with their doublet microtubules linked through the A tubules. The commonality of core-region length, and the abrupt transition in mammalian centrioles, suggests a conserved length-setting mechanism. The unexpected linker diversity suggests how unique centriolar architectures arise in different tissues and organisms.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36456</link>
	<content:encoded>Planar cell polarity (PCP) controls convergent extension and axis elongation in all vertebrates. Though asymmetric localization of PCP proteins is central to their function, we understand little about PCP protein localization during convergent extension. Here, we use quantitative live imaging to simultaneously monitor cell intercalation behaviors and PCP protein dynamics in the &lt;i&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/i&gt; neural plate epithelium. We observed asymmetric enrichment of PCP proteins, but more interestingly, we observed tight correlation of PCP protein enrichment with actomyosin-driven contractile behavior of cell-cell junctions. Moreover, we found that the turnover rates of junctional PCP proteins also correlated with the contractile behavior of individual junctions. All of these dynamic relationships were disrupted when PCP signaling was manipulated. Together, these results provide a dynamic and quantitative view of PCP protein localization during convergent extension and suggest a complex and intimate link between the dynamic localization of core PCP proteins, actomyosin assembly, and polarized junction shrinking during cell intercalation in the closing vertebrate neural tube.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/35720</link>
	<content:encoded>ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling proteins represent a diverse family of proteins that share ATPase domains that are adapted to regulate protein-DNA interactions. Here we present structures of the &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; Chd1 protein engaged with nucleosomes in the presence of the transition state mimic ADP-beryllium fluoride. The path of DNA strands through the ATPase domains indicates the presence of contacts conserved with single strand translocases and additional contacts with both strands that are unique to Snf2 related proteins. The structure provides connectivity between rearrangement of ATPase lobes to a closed, nucleotide bound state and the sensing of linker DNA. Two turns of linker DNA are prised off the surface of the histone octamer as a result of Chd1 binding, and both the histone H3 tail and ubiquitin conjugated to lysine 120 are re-orientated towards the unravelled DNA. This indicates how changes to nucleosome structure can alter the way in which histone epitopes are presented.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Epigenetic changes have likely contributed to the large size and enhanced cognitive abilities of the human brain which evolved within the last 2 million years after the human–chimpanzee split. Using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing, we have compared the methylomes of neuronal and non-neuronal cells from 3 human and 3 chimpanzee cortices. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) with genome-wide significance were enriched in specific genomic regions. Intraspecific methylation differences between neuronal and non-neuronal cells were approximately 3 times more abundant than interspecific methylation differences between human and chimpanzee cell types. The vast majority (&amp;gt;90%) of human intraspecific DMRs (including DMRs in retrotransposons) were hypomethylated in neurons, compared with glia. Intraspecific DMRs were enriched in genes associated with different neuropsychiatric disorders. Interspecific DMRs were enriched in genes showing human-specific brain histone modifications. Human–chimpanzee methylation differences were much more frequent in non-neuronal cells (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n. DMRs&lt;/span&gt; = 666) than in neurons (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n. DMRs&lt;/span&gt; = 96). More than 95% of interspecific DMRs in glia were hypermethylated in humans. Although without an outgroup we cannot assign whether a change in methylation occurred in the human or chimpanzee lineage, our results are consistent with a wave of methylation affecting several hundred non-neuronal genes during human brain evolution.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>How are synaptic vesicles tied together in a nerve terminal? A recent study by Milovanovic and colleagues offers a new mechanism for this old and important problem: synapsin proteins establish a liquid phase that clusters vesicles. Liquid–liquid phase separation provides a fluid-like state that accommodates the dynamic demands of presynaptic vesicle traffic.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A mechanism for bistability in glycosylation</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/lG3i3Zrauw4/article</link>

Glycosyltransferases are a class of enzymes that catalyse the posttranslational modification of proteins to produce a large number of glycoconjugate acceptors from a limited number of nucleotide-sugar donors. The products of one glycosyltransferase can be the substrates of several other enzymes, causing a combinatorial explosion in the number of possible glycan products. The kinetic behaviour of systems where multiple acceptor substrates compete for a single enzyme is presented, and the case in which high concentrations of an acceptor substrate are inhibitory as a result of abortive complex formation, is shown to result in non-Michaelian kinetics that can lead to bistability in an open system. A kinetic mechanism is proposed that is consistent with the available experimental evidence and provides a possible explanation for conflicting observations on the &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-1,4-galactosyltransferases. Abrupt switching between steady states in networks of glycosyltransferase-catalysed reactions may account for the observed changes in glycosyl-epitopes in cancer cells.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lG3i3Zrauw4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Rare-event sampling of epigenetic landscapes and phenotype transitions</title>

Stochastic simulation has been a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of gene regulatory networks, particularly in terms of understanding how cell-phenotype stability and fate-transitions are impacted by noisy gene expression. However, gene networks often have dynamics characterized by multiple attractors. Stochastic simulation is often inefficient for such systems, because most of the simulation time is spent waiting for rare, barrier-crossing events to occur. We present a rare-event simulation-based method for computing epigenetic landscapes and phenotype-transitions in metastable gene networks. Our computational pipeline was inspired by studies of metastability and barrier-crossing in protein folding, and provides an automated means of computing and visualizing essential stationary and dynamic information that is generally inaccessible to conventional simulation. Applied to a network model of pluripotency in Embryonic Stem Cells, our simulations revealed rare phenotypes and approximately Markovian transitions among phenotype-states, occurring with a broad range of timescales. The relative probabilities of phenotypes and the transition paths linking pluripotency and differentiation are sensitive to global kinetic parameters governing transcription factor-DNA binding kinetics. Our approach significantly expands the capability of stochastic simulation to investigate gene regulatory network dynamics, which may help guide rational cell reprogramming strategies. Our approach is also generalizable to other types of molecular networks and stochastic dynamics frameworks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ct0OUsyiK38&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: ApoE Regulates the Development of Adult Newborn Hippocampal Neurons</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/4/ENEURO.0155-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Adult hippocampal neurogenesis occurs throughout life and is believed to participate in cognitive functions such as learning and memory. A number of genes that regulate adult hippocampal neurogenesis have been identified, although most of these have been implicated in progenitor proliferation and survival, but not in the development into fully differentiated neurons. Among these genes, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is particularly compelling because the human ApoE isoform E4 is a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer’s disease, where hippocampal neurogenesis is reported to be dysfunctional. To investigate the effects of ApoE and its human isoforms on adult hippocampal neurogenesis and neuronal development, retroviruses carrying a GFP-expressing vector were injected into wild-type (WT), ApoE-deficient, and human targeted replacement (ApoE3 and ApoE4) mice to infect progenitors in the dentate gyrus and analyze the morphology of fully developed GFP-expressing neurons. Analysis of these adult-born neurons revealed significant decreases in the complexity of dendritic arborizations and spine density in ApoE-deficient mice compared with WT mice, as well as in ApoE4 mice compared with ApoE3. These findings demonstrate that ApoE deficiency and the ApoE4 human isoform both impair hippocampal neurogenesis and give insight into how ApoE may influence hippocampal-related neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: {Delta}FosB Decreases Excitability of Dorsal Hippocampal CA1 Neurons</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/4/ENEURO.0104-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Both the function of hippocampal neurons and hippocampus-dependent behaviors are dependent on changes in gene expression, but the specific mechanisms that regulate gene expression in hippocampus are not yet fully understood. The stable, activity-dependent transcription factor FosB plays a role in various forms of hippocampal-dependent learning and in the structural plasticity of synapses onto CA1 neurons. The authors examined the consequences of viral-mediated overexpression or inhibition of FosB on the function of adult mouse hippocampal CA1 neurons using &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; slice whole-cell physiology. We found that the overexpression of FosB decreased the excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons, while inhibition increased excitability. Interestingly, these manipulations did not affect resting membrane potential or spike frequency adaptation, but FosB overexpression reduced hyperpolarization-activated current. Both FosB overexpression and inhibition decreased spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents, while only FosB inhibition affected the AMPA/NMDA ratio, which was mediated by decreased NMDA receptor current, suggesting complex effects on synaptic inputs to CA1 that may be driven by homeostatic cell-autonomous or network-driven adaptations to the changes in CA1 cell excitability. Because FosB is induced in hippocampus by drugs of abuse, stress, or antidepressant treatment, these results suggest that FosB-driven changes in hippocampal cell excitability may be critical for learning and, in maladaptive states, are key drivers of aberrant hippocampal function in diseases such as addiction and depression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Estradiol Increases Glutamate and GABA Neurotransmission into GnRH Neurons via Retrograde NO-Signaling in Proestrous Mice during the Positive Estradiol Feedback Period</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/4/ENEURO.0057-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Surge release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is essential in the activation of pituitary gonadal unit at proestrus afternoon preceded by the rise of serum 17β-estradiol (E2) level during positive feedback period. Here, we describe a mechanism of positive estradiol feedback regulation acting directly on GnRH-green fluorescent protein (GFP) neurons of mice. Whole-cell clamp and loose patch recordings revealed that a high physiological dose of estradiol (200 pM), significantly increased firing rate at proestrus afternoon. The mPSC frequency at proestrus afternoon also increased, whereas it decreased at metestrus afternoon and had no effect at proestrus morning. Inhibition of the estrogen receptor β (ERβ), intracellular blockade of the Src kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) and scavenge of nitric oxide (NO) inside GnRH neurons prevented the facilitatory estradiol effect indicating involvement of the ERβ/Src/PI3K/Akt/nNOS pathway in this fast, direct stimulatory effect. Immunohistochemistry localized soluble guanylate cyclase, the main NO receptor, in both glutamatergic and GABAergic terminals innervating GnRH neurons. Accordingly, estradiol facilitated neurotransmissions to GnRH neurons via both GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;-R and glutamate/AMPA/kainate-R. These results indicate that estradiol acts directly on GnRH neurons via the ERβ/Akt/nNOS pathway at proestrus afternoon generating NO that retrogradely accelerates GABA and glutamate release from the presynaptic terminals contacting GnRH neurons. The newly explored mechanism might contribute to the regulation of the GnRH surge, a fundamental prerequisite of the ovulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00756</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;What is the physiological basis of long term memory? The current dogma in
theoretical neuroscience attributes changes in synaptic efficacy to memory
acquisition. This view implies that in the absence of learning, synaptic
efficacies should be constant; in other words, stable memories correspond to
stable connectivity patterns. However, an increasing body of experimental
evidence points to significant, activity-independent dynamics in synaptic
strengths. These fluctuations seem to be occurring continuously, without
specific reference to a learning process, but with similar magnitude. Motivated
by these observations, we explore the possibility of memory storage within a
specific component of network connectivity, while individual connections
fluctuate in time. We find a family of neural network models in which memory is
acquired by means of biologically-inspired learning rules; the properties of
these rules, in turn, determine the storing component in which memory can
persist indefinitely. Memory representations manifest as time-varying
attractors in neural state-space and support associative retrieval of learned
information. Our results suggest a link between the properties of learning
rules and those of network-level memory representations, which generates
experimentally-testable predictions.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00675</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Experimental observations of neuroscience suggest that the brain is working a
probabilistic way when computing information with uncertainty. This processing
could be modeled as Bayesian inference. However, it remains unclear how
Bayesian inference could be implemented at the level of neuronal circuits of
the brain. In this study, we propose a novel general-purpose neural
implementation of probabilistic inference based on a ubiquitous network of
cortical microcircuits, termed winner-take-all (WTA) circuit. We show that each
WTA circuit could encode the distribution of states defined on a variable. By
connecting multiple WTA circuits together, the joint distribution can be
represented for arbitrary probabilistic graphical models. Moreover, we prove
that the neural dynamics of WTA circuit is able to implement one of the most
powerful inference methods in probabilistic graphical models, mean-field
inference. We show that the synaptic drive of each spiking neuron in the WTA
circuit encodes the marginal probability of the variable in each state, and the
firing probability (or firing rate) of each neuron is proportional to the
marginal probability. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate
that the WTA circuits can get comparable inference result as mean-field
approximation. Taken together, our results suggest that the WTA circuit could
be seen as the minimal inference unit of neuronal circuits.

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The location of GABAergic synapses on dendrites is likely key for neuronal integration. In particular, inhibitory inputs on dendritic spines could serve to selectively veto or modulate individual excitatory inputs, greatly expanding the computational power of individual neurons. To investigate this, we have undertaken a combined functional, molecular, and ultrastructural mapping of the location of GABAergic inputs onto dendrites of pyramidal neurons from upper layers of juvenile mouse somatosensory cortex. Using two-photon uncaging of GABA, intracellular labeling with gerphyrin intrabodies, and focused ion beam milling with scanning electron microscopy, we find that most (96–98%) spines lack GABAergic synapses, although they still display GABAergic responses, potentially due to extrasynaptic GABA receptors. We conclude that GABAergic inputs, in practice, contact dendritic shafts and likely control clusters of excitatory inputs, defining functional zones on dendrites.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Cellular morphology and associated morphodynamics are widely used for qualitative and quantitative assessments of cell state. Here we implement a framework to profile cellular morphodynamics based on an adaptive decomposition of local cell boundary motion into instantaneous frequency spectra defined by the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT). Our approach revealed that spontaneously migrating cells with approximately homogeneous molecular makeup show remarkably consistent instantaneous frequency distributions, though they have markedly heterogeneous mobility. Distinctions in cell edge motion between these cells are captured predominantly by differences in the magnitude of the frequencies. We found that acute photo-inhibition of Vav2 guanine exchange factor, an activator of the Rho family of signaling proteins coordinating cell motility, produces significant shifts in the frequency distribution, but does not affect frequency magnitude. We therefore concluded that the frequency spectrum encodes the wiring of the molecular circuitry that regulates cell boundary movements, whereas the magnitude captures the activation level of the circuitry. We also used HHT spectra as multi-scale spatiotemporal features in statistical region merging to identify subcellular regions of distinct motion behavior. In line with our conclusion that different HHT spectra relate to different signaling regimes, we found that subcellular regions with different morphodynamics indeed exhibit distinct Rac1 activities. This algorithm thus can serve as an accurate and sensitive classifier of cellular morphodynamics to pinpoint spatial and temporal boundaries between signaling regimes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v0zeezADMos&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Several channels, ranging from TRP receptors to Gap junctions, allow the exchange of small organic solute across cell membrane. However, very little is known about the molecular mechanism of their permeation. Cyclic Nucleotide Gated (CNG) channels, despite their homology with K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels and in contrast with them, allow the passage of larger methylated and ethylated ammonium ions like dimethylammonium (DMA) and ethylammonium (EA). We combined electrophysiology and molecular dynamics simulations to examine how DMA interacts with the pore and permeates through it. Due to the presence of hydrophobic groups, DMA enters easily in the channel and, unlike the alkali cations, does not need to cross any barrier. We also show that while the crystal structure is consistent with the presence of a single DMA ion at full occupancy, the channel is able to conduct a sizable current of DMA ions only when two ions are present inside the channel. Moreover, the second DMA ion dramatically changes the free energy landscape, destabilizing the crystallographic binding site and lowering by almost 25 kJ/mol the binding affinity between DMA and the channel. Based on the results of the simulation the experimental electron density maps can be re-interpreted with the presence of a second ion at lower occupancy. In this mechanism the flexibility of the channel plays a key role, extending the classical multi-ion permeation paradigm in which conductance is enhanced by the plain interaction between the ions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Lr7lghkzqrk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Although NSCs were thought to merely represent a stem cell type in the brain, recent advances have demonstrated the incredible complexity of NSC identity and functions. Ranging between quiescence, activation and intermediary subtypes, NSCs choose their fate through their developmental inheritance, regional positioning within the niche, as well as dynamic transcriptional and metabolic states. The plasticity of their developmental program is reflected in the tremendous changes they undergo upon external environmental cues and extrinsic manipulations, and harnessing these potentials can open new avenues to fight against brain injury, neurodegenerative and age-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Efficient pattern separation in dentate gyrus plays an important role in
storing information in the hippocampus. Current knowledge of the structure and
function of the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and dentate gyrus, in pattern
separation are incorporated in our model. A three-layer feedforward spiking
neural network inspired by the rodent hippocampus an equipped with simplified
synaptic and molecular mechanisms is developed. The aim of the study is to make
an spiking neural network capable of pattern separation in imbalanced
excitation/inhibition ratios caused by different levels of stimulations or
network damage. This work present a novel theory on the cellular mechanisms of
robustness to damges to synapses and connectivity of neurons in dentate gyrus
that results in imbalanced excitation-inhibition activity of neurons. This
spiking neural network uses simplified molecular and cellular hypothetical
mechanisms and demonstrates efficient storing of information in different
levels of stimulation and can be implemented in cognitive robotics.

Annual incidence rates of varicella infection in the general population in France have been rather stable since 1991 when clinical surveillance started. Rates however show a statistically significant increase over time in children aged 0–3 years, and a decline in older individuals. A significant increase in day-care enrolment and structures’ capacity in France was also observed in the last decade. In this work we investigate the potential interplay between an increase of contacts of young children possibly caused by earlier socialization in the community and varicella transmission dynamics. To this aim, we develop an age-structured mathematical model, informed with historical demographic data and contact matrix estimates in the country, accounting for longitudinal linear increase of early childhood contacts. While the reported overall varicella incidence is well reproduced independently of mixing variations, age-specific empirical trends are better captured by accounting for an increase in contacts among pre-school children in the last decades. We found that the varicella data are consistent with a 30% increase in the number of contacts at day-care facilities, which would imply a 50% growth in the contribution of 0-3y old children to overall yearly infections in 1991–2015. Our findings suggest that an earlier exposure to pathogens due to changes in day-care contact patterns, represents a plausible explanation for the epidemiological patterns observed in France. Obtained results suggest that considering temporal changes in social factors in addition to demographic ones is critical to correctly interpret varicella transmission dynamics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZNcGQQSchNU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Irrelevance by inhibition: Learning, computation, and implications for schizophrenia</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/rsPCF-wkzJY/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Nathan Insel, Jordan Guerguiev, Blake A. Richards&lt;/p&gt;

Symptoms of schizophrenia may arise from a failure of cortical circuits to filter-out irrelevant inputs. Schizophrenia has also been linked to disruptions in cortical inhibitory interneurons, consistent with the possibility that in the normally functioning brain, these cells are in some part responsible for determining which sensory inputs are relevant versus irrelevant. Here, we develop a neural network model that demonstrates how the cortex may learn to ignore irrelevant inputs through plasticity processes affecting inhibition. The model is based on the proposal that the amount of excitatory output from a cortical circuit encodes the expected magnitude of reward or punishment (“relevance”), which can be trained using a temporal difference learning mechanism acting on feedforward inputs to inhibitory interneurons. In the model, irrelevant and blocked stimuli drive lower levels of excitatory activity compared with novel and relevant stimuli, and this difference in activity levels is lost following disruptions to inhibitory units. When excitatory units are connected to a competitive-learning output layer with a threshold, the relevance code can be shown to “gate” both learning and behavioral responses to irrelevant stimuli. Accordingly, the combined network is capable of recapitulating published experimental data linking inhibition in frontal cortex with fear learning and expression. Finally, the model demonstrates how relevance learning can take place in parallel with other types of learning, through plasticity rules involving inhibitory and excitatory components, respectively. Altogether, this work offers a theory of how the cortex learns to selectively inhibit inputs, providing insight into how relevance-assignment problems may emerge in schizophrenia.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rsPCF-wkzJY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Parallel Arousal Pathways in the Lateral Hypothalamus</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0228-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Until recently, hypocretin (Hcrt) neurons were the only known wake-promoting neuronal population in the lateral hypothalamus (LH), but subpopulations of inhibitory neurons in this area and glutamatergic neurons in the nearby supramammillary nucleus (SuM) have recently been found that also promote wakefulness. We performed chemogenetic excitation of LH neurons in mice and observed increased wakefulness that lasted more than 4h without unusual behavior or EEG anomalies. The increased wakefulness was similar in the presence or absence of the dual orexin receptor blocker almorexant (ALM). Analysis of hM3Dq transfection and c-FOS expression in LH inhibitory neurons and in the SuM failed to confirm that the increased wakefulness was due to these wake-promoting populations, although this possibility cannot be completely excluded. To evaluate the relationship to the Hcrt system, we repeated the study in &lt;i&gt;Orexin-tTA&lt;/i&gt; mice in the presence or absence of dietary doxycycline (DOX), which enabled us to manipulate the percentage of Hcrt neurons that expressed hM3Dq. In DOX-fed mice, 18% of Hcrt neurons as well as many other LH neurons expressed hM3Dq; these mice showed a profound increase in wake after hM3Dq activation even in the presence of ALM. In mice switched to normal chow, 62% of Hcrt neurons expressed hM3Dq along with other LH cells; chemogenetic activation produced even more sustained arousal which could be reduced to previous levels by ALM treatment. Together, these results indicate an LH neuron population that promotes wakefulness through an Hcrt-independent pathway that can act synergistically with the Hcrt system to prolong arousal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance&lt;/b&gt; Despite nearly a century of evidence suggesting that the lateral hypothalamus contains neurons essential to sustain wakefulness, the primary wake-promoting cells in this brain region studied to date have been the hypocretin/orexin neurons. Here, we show that chemogenetic excitation of lateral hypothalamus neurons can induce sustained wakefulness even in absence of hypocretin signaling and that concurrent hypocretin neuron activation can prolong arousal. These results indicate the existence of parallel arousal pathways in the lateral hypothalamus and suggest a new therapeutic target for disorders of excessive sleepiness such as hypersomnia and narcolepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Novel Quantitative Analyses of Spontaneous Synaptic Events in Cortical Pyramidal Cells Reveal Subtle Parvalbumin-Expressing Interneuron Dysfunction in a Knock-in Mouse Model of Alzheimers Disease</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0059-18.2018v2?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that has become a compelling global public health concern. Besides pathological hallmarks such as extracellular amyloid plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, and loss of neurons and synapses, clinical reports have shown that epileptiform activity, even seizures, can occur early in the disease. Aberrant synaptic and network activities as well as epileptiform discharges have also been observed in various mouse models of AD. The new &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mouse model is generated by a gene knock-in approach and there are limited studies on basic synaptic properties in &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice. Therefore, we applied quantitative methods to analyze spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory synaptic events in parietal cortex layer 2/3 pyramidal cells. First, by an objective amplitude distribution analysis, we found decreased amplitudes of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in aged &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice caused by a reduction in the amplitudes of the large sIPSCs with fast rates of rise, consistent with deficits in the function of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV INs). Second, we calculated the burstiness and memory in a series of successive synaptic events. Lastly, by using a novel approach to determine the excitation to inhibition (E/I) ratio, we found no changes in the &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice, indicating that homeostatic mechanisms may have maintained the overall balance of excitation and inhibition in spite of a mildly impaired PV IN function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Using novel quantitative analyses of spontaneous synaptic currents in L2/3 pyramidal cells, we revealed subtle deficits in the function of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV INs) in a new mouse model of AD, the &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice. We applied novel statistical and analytical methods to further characterize the properties of spontaneous postsynaptic currents. Our approach provides rigorous quantitative tools for the analysis of synaptic events in mouse models of disease for objectively and reliably revealing even subtle disease-related alterations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Grid-Cell Activity on Linear Tracks Indicates Purely Translational Remapping of 2D Firing Patterns at Movement Turning Points</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/31/7004?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Grid cells in rodent medial entorhinal cortex are thought to play a critical role for spatial navigation. When the animal is freely moving in an open arena the firing fields of each grid cell tend to form a hexagonal lattice spanning the environment. For movements along a linear track the cells seem to respond differently. They show multiple firing fields that are not periodically arranged and whose shape and position change when the running direction is reversed. In addition, peak firing rates vary widely from field to field. Measured along one running direction only, firing fields are, however, compatible with a slice through a two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal pattern. It is an open question, whether this is also true if leftward and rightward runs are jointly considered. By analyzing data from 15 male Long–Evans rats, we show that a single hexagonal firing pattern explains the linear-track data if translational shifts of the pattern are allowed at the movement turning points. A rotation or scaling of the grid is not required. The agreement is further improved if the peak firing rates of the underlying 2D grid fields can vary from field to field, as suggested by recent studies. These findings have direct consequences for experiments using linear tracks in virtual reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Various types of neurons support spatial navigation. Their response properties are often studied in reduced settings and might change when the animal can freely explore its environment. Grid cells in rodents, for example, exhibit seemingly irregular firing fields when animal movement is restricted to a linear track but highly regular patterns in two-dimensional (2D) arenas. We show that linear-track responses of a cell for both leftward and rightward running directions can be explained as cuts through a single hexagonal pattern if translational remapping is allowed at movement turning points; neither rotations nor scale transformations are needed. These results provide a basis to quantify grid-cell activity in 1D virtual reality and could help to detect and categorize grid cells without experiments in 2D environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide-Immunoreactive Interneurons within Circuits of the Mouse Basolateral Amygdala</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/31/6983?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In cortical structures, principal cell activity is tightly regulated by different GABAergic interneurons (INs). Among these INs are vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-expressing (VIP+) INs, which innervate preferentially other INs, providing a structural basis for temporal disinhibition of principal cells. However, relatively little is known about VIP+ INs in the amygdaloid basolateral complex (BLA). In this study, we report that VIP+ INs have a variable density in the distinct subdivisions of the mouse BLA. Based on different anatomical, neurochemical, and electrophysiological criteria, VIP+ INs could be identified as IN-selective INs (IS-INs) and basket cells expressing CB1 cannabinoid receptors. Whole-cell recordings of VIP+ IS-INs revealed three different spiking patterns, none of which was associated with the expression of calretinin. Genetic targeting combined with optogenetics and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; recordings enabled us to identify several types of BLA INs innervated by VIP+ INs, including other IS-INs, basket and neurogliaform cells. Moreover, light stimulation of VIP+ basket cell axon terminals, characterized by CB1 sensitivity, evoked IPSPs in ~20% of principal neurons. Finally, we show that VIP+ INs receive a dense innervation from both GABAergic inputs (although only 10% from other VIP+ INs) and distinct glutamatergic inputs, identified by their expression of different vesicular glutamate transporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, our study provides a wide-range analysis of single-cell properties of VIP+ INs in the mouse BLA and of their intrinsic and extrinsic connectivity. Our results reinforce the evidence that VIP+ INs are structurally and functionally heterogeneous and that this heterogeneity could mediate different roles in amygdala-dependent functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We provide the first comprehensive analysis of the distribution of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-expressing (VIP+) interneurons (INs) across the entire mouse amygdaloid basolateral complex (BLA), as well as of their morphological and physiological properties. VIP+ INs in the neocortex preferentially target other INs to form a disinhibitory network that facilitates principal cell firing. Our study is the first to demonstrate the presence of such a disinhibitory circuitry in the BLA. We observed structural and functional heterogeneity of these INs and characterized their input/output connectivity. We also identified several types of BLA INs that, when inhibited, may provide a temporal window for principal cell firing and facilitate associative plasticity, e.g., in fear learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;From interacting cellular components to networks of neurons and neural
systems, interconnected units comprise a fundamental organizing principle of
the nervous system. Understanding how their patterns of connections and
interactions give rise to the many functions of the nervous system is a primary
goal of neuroscience. Recently, this pursuit has begun to benefit from the
development of new mathematical tools that can relate a system's architecture
to its dynamics and function. These tools, which are known collectively as
network science, have been used with increasing success to build models of
neural systems across spatial scales and species. Here we discuss the nature of
network models in neuroscience. We begin with a review of model theory from a
philosophical perspective to inform our view of networks as models of complex
systems in general, and of the brain in particular. We then summarize the types
of models that are frequently studied in network neuroscience along three
primary dimensions: from data representations to first-principles theory, from
biophysical realism to functional phenomenology, and from elementary
descriptions to coarse-grained approximations. We then consider ways to
validate these models, focusing on approaches that perturb a system to probe
its function. We close with a description of important frontiers in the
construction of network models and their relevance for understanding
increasingly complex functions of neural systems.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To learn how cognition is implemented in the brain, we must build
computational models that can perform cognitive tasks, and test such models
with brain and behavioral experiments. Cognitive science has developed
computational models of human cognition, decomposing task performance into
computational components. However, its algorithms still fall short of human
intelligence and are not grounded in neurobiology. Computational neuroscience
has investigated how interacting neurons can implement component functions of
brain computation. However, it has yet to explain how those components interact
to explain human cognition and behavior. Modern technologies enable us to
measure and manipulate brain activity in unprecedentedly rich ways in animals
and humans. However, experiments will yield theoretical insight only when
employed to test brain-computational models. It is time to assemble the pieces
of the puzzle of brain computation. Here we review recent work in the
intersection of cognitive science, computational neuroscience, and artificial
intelligence. Computational models that mimic brain information processing
during perceptual, cognitive, and control tasks are beginning to be developed
and tested with brain and behavioral data.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Farzaneh Mohajerani, Michael F. Hagan&lt;/p&gt;

Bacterial microcompartments are large, roughly icosahedral shells that assemble around enzymes and reactants involved in certain metabolic pathways in bacteria. Motivated by microcompartment assembly, we use coarse-grained computational and theoretical modeling to study the factors that control the size and morphology of a protein shell assembling around hundreds to thousands of molecules. We perform dynamical simulations of shell assembly in the presence and absence of cargo over a range of interaction strengths, subunit and cargo stoichiometries, and the shell spontaneous curvature. Depending on these parameters, we find that the presence of a cargo can either increase or decrease the size of a shell relative to its intrinsic spontaneous curvature, as seen in recent experiments. These features are controlled by a balance of kinetic and thermodynamic effects, and the shell size is assembly pathway dependent. We discuss implications of these results for synthetic biology efforts to target new enzymes to microcompartment interiors.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VqXYLlYSdr8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Individual Differences in Motor Noise and Adaptation Rate Are Optimally Related</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/4/ENEURO.0170-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Individual variations in motor adaptation rate were recently shown to correlate with movement variability or &quot;motor noise&quot; in a forcefield adaptation task. However, this finding could not be replicated in a meta-analysis of adaptation experiments. Possibly, this inconsistency stems from noise being composed of distinct components that relate to adaptation rate in different ways. Indeed, previous modeling and electrophysiological studies have suggested that motor noise can be factored into planning noise, originating from the brain, and execution noise, stemming from the periphery. Were the motor system optimally tuned to these noise sources, planning noise would correlate positively with adaptation rate, and execution noise would correlate negatively with adaptation rate, a phenomenon familiar in Kalman filters. To test this prediction, we performed a visuomotor adaptation experiment in 69 subjects. Using a novel Bayesian fitting procedure, we succeeded in applying the well-established state-space model of adaptation to individual data. We found that adaptation rate correlates positively with planning noise (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; = 0.44; 95% HDI = [0.27 0.59]) and negatively with execution noise (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; = –0.39; 95% HDI = [–0.50 –0.30]). In addition, the steady-state Kalman gain calculated from planning and execution noise correlated positively with adaptation rate (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.54; 95% HDI = [0.38 0.66]). These results suggest that motor adaptation is tuned to approximate optimal learning, consistent with the &quot;optimal control&quot; framework that has been used to explain motor control. Since motor adaptation is thought to be a largely cerebellar process, the results further suggest the sensitivity of the cerebellum to both planning noise and execution noise.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Nausea-Induced 5-HT Release in the Interoceptive Insular Cortex and Regulation by Monoacylglycerol Lipase (MAGL) Inhibition and Cannabidiol</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/4/ENEURO.0256-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Using the rat conditioned gaping model of nausea, the interoceptive insular cortex (IIC) has been identified as a critical site for the regulation of lithium chloride (LiCl)-induced nausea. Indirect evidence supports a model where serotonin (5-HT) acts on postsynaptic 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptors and its release is suppressed by elevating 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG) by monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) inhibition to suppress nausea. Here, we directly test the hypothesis that systemic LiCl elevates 5-HT in the IIC, and this is prevented by pretreatments that reduce 5-HT release. Using male Sprague Dawley rats, LiCl (but not saline), elevated 5-HT selectively in the IIC, for 20 min after LiCl administration (127.2 mg/kg, i.p.). Systemic pretreatment with the MAGL inhibitor, MJN110, prevented the LiCl-induced elevation of 5-HT in the IIC. Systemic cannabidiol (CBD), which reduces LiCl-induced nausea by acting at 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt; somatodendritic autoreceptors, also prevented LiCl-induced elevation of 5-HT in the IIC. Since 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptor agonists delivered to the IIC produce nausea, we tested and confirmed the hypothesis that the intra-IIC administration of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonist, ondansetron, but not MJN110, would prevent LiCl-induced conditioned gaping reactions produced by intra-IIC administration of the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptor agonist, &lt;i&gt;m-&lt;/i&gt;chlorophenylbiguanide (mCPBG). Finally, we demonstrate that exposure to a LiCl-paired flavor (but not a saline-paired flavor) produces elevated 5-HT release in the IIC, while rats display conditioned gaping reactions. These results confirm that LiCl-induced nausea is triggered by elevated 5-HT release in the IIC and is attenuated by treatments that reduce 5-HT availability in this region.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Maternal Regulation of Pups Cortical Activity: Role of Serotonergic Signaling</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/4/ENEURO.0093-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A developing brain shows intense reorganization and heightened neuronal plasticity allowing for environmental modulation of its development. During early life, maternal care is a key factor of this environment and defects in this care can derail adaptive brain development and may result in susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which those maternal interactions immediately impact the offspring’s brain activity to initiate the pathway to pathology are not well understood. We do know that multiple neurotransmitter systems are involved, including the serotonergic system, a key neuromodulator involved in brain development and emotional regulation. We tested the importance of the serotonergic system and pups’ immediate neural response to maternal presence using wireless electrophysiological recordings, a novel approach allowing us to record neural activity during pups’ interactions with their mother. We found that maternal contact modulates the P10–P12 rat pups’ anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity by notably increasing local-field potential (LFP) power in low-frequency bands. We demonstrated, by blocking serotonergic receptors, that this increase is mediated through 5-HT2 receptors (5-HT2Rs). Finally, we showed in isolated pups that enhancing serotonergic transmission, using a selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitor, is sufficient to enhance LFP power in low-frequency bands in a pattern similar to that observed when the mother is in the nest. Our results highlight a significant contribution of the serotonergic system in mediating changes of cortical activity in pups related to maternal presence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Modeling Human Decision-making: An Overview of the Brussels Quantum Approach. (arXiv:1807.11036v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11036</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We present the fundamentals of the quantum theoretical approach we have
developed in the last decade to model cognitive phenomena that resisted
modeling by means of classical logical and probabilistic structures, like
Boolean, Kolmogorovian and, more generally, set theoretical structures. We
firstly sketch the operational-realistic foundations of conceptual entities,
i.e. concepts, conceptual combinations, propositions, decision-making entities,
etc. Then, we briefly illustrate the application of the quantum formalism in
Hilbert space to represent combinations of natural concepts, discussing its
success in modeling a wide range of empirical data on concepts and their
conjunction, disjunction and negation. Next, we naturally extend the quantum
theoretical approach to model some long-standing `fallacies of human
reasoning', namely, the `conjunction fallacy' and the `disjunction effect'.
Finally, we put forward an explanatory hypothesis according to which human
reasoning is a defined superposition of `emergent reasoning' and `logical
reasoning', where the former generally prevails over the latter. The quantum
theoretical approach explains human fallacies as the consequence of genuine
quantum structures in human reasoning, i.e. `contextuality', `emergence',
`entanglement', `interference' and `superposition'. As such, it is alternative
to the Kahneman-Tversky research programme, which instead aims to explain human
fallacies in terms of `individual heuristics and biases'.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Revealing a Cortical Circuit Responsive to Predatory Threats and Mediating Contextual Fear Memory</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy173/5062357?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The ventral part of the anteromedial thalamic nucleus (AMv) receives substantial inputs from hypothalamic sites that are highly responsive to a live predator or its odor trace and represents an important thalamic hub for conveying predatory threat information to the cerebral cortex. In the present study, we begin by examining the cortico-amygdalar-hippocampal projections of the main AMv cortical targets, namely, the caudal prelimbic, rostral anterior cingulate, and medial visual areas, as well as the rostral part of the ventral retrosplenial area, one of the main targets of the anterior cingulate area. We observed that these areas form a clear cortical network. Next, we revealed that in animals exposed to a live cat, all of the elements of this circuit presented a differential increase in Fos, supporting the idea of a predator threat-responsive cortical network. Finally, we showed that bilateral cytotoxic lesions in each element of this cortical network did not change innate fear responses but drastically reduced contextual conditioning to the predator-associated environment. Overall, the present findings suggest that predator threat has an extensive representation in the cerebral cortex and revealed a cortical network that is responsive to predatory threats and exerts a critical role in processing fear memory.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy171/5062355?rss=1</link>

Schizotypy is associated with an increased risk of psychosis, with some studies implicating similar neurobiological mechanisms to schizophrenia. The present study sought to interrogate the link between the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;COMT&lt;/span&gt; Val158Met polymorphism and schizotypy using electroencephalogram (EEG) to identify neurophysiological mechanisms underpinning psychosis risk. Neurotypical (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 91) adults were genotyped for the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;COMT&lt;/span&gt; Val158Met polymorphism, completed the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ), and had eyes open resting-state EEG recorded for 4 min. SPQ suspiciousness subscale scores were higher for individuals homozygous for Val/Val and Met/Met versus Val/Met genotypes. Delta, theta, alpha-2, beta-1, and beta-2 amplitudes were lower for Val/Val than Met/Met individuals. Lower theta amplitudes were correlated with higher total SPQ scores (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; = 0.050), and multiple regression revealed that higher delta, and lower theta and beta-2 amplitudes (but not &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;COMT&lt;/span&gt; genotype) best predicted total SPQ scores (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; = 0.014). This study demonstrates the importance of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;COMT&lt;/span&gt; genotype in determining trait suspiciousness and EEG oscillatory activity. It also highlights relationships between dopaminergic alterations, EEG and schizotypy that are dissimilar to those observed in schizophrenia.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Although frequently discussed in terms of sex dimorphism, the neurobiology of sexual orientation and identity is unknown. We report multimodal magnetic resonance imaging data, including cortical thickness (Cth), subcortical volumes, and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging, from 27 transgender women (TrW), 40 transgender men (TrM), and 80 heterosexual (40 men) and 60 homosexual cisgender controls (30 men). These data show that whereas homosexuality is linked to cerebral sex dimorphism, gender dysphoria primarily involves cerebral networks mediating self–body perception. Among the homosexual cisgender controls, weaker sex dimorphism was found in white matter connections and a partly reversed sex dimorphism in Cth. Similar patterns were detected in transgender persons compared with heterosexual cisgender controls, but the significant clusters disappeared when adding homosexual controls, and correcting for sexual orientation. Instead, both TrW and TrM displayed singular features, showing greater Cth as well as weaker structural and functional connections in the anterior cingulate-precuneus and right occipito-parietal cortex, regions known to process own body perception in the context of self.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Selective attention is central to cognition. Dramatic advances have been made in understanding the neural circuits that mediate selective attention. Forebrain networks, most elaborated in primates, control all forms of attention based on task demands and the physical salience of stimuli. These networks contain circuits that distribute top-down signals to sensory processing areas and enhance information processing in those areas. A midbrain network, most elaborated in birds, controls spatial attention.</content:encoded>

The accuracy of machine learning tasks critically depends on high quality ground truth data. Therefore, in many cases, producing good ground truth data typically involves trained professionals; however, this can be costly in time, effort, and money. Here we explore the use of crowdsourcing to generate a large number of training data of good quality. We explore an image analysis task involving the segmentation of corn tassels from images taken in a field setting. We investigate the accuracy, speed and other quality metrics when this task is performed by students for academic credit, Amazon MTurk workers, and Master Amazon MTurk workers. We conclude that the Amazon MTurk and Master Mturk workers perform significantly better than the for-credit students, but with no significant difference between the two MTurk worker types. Furthermore, the quality of the segmentation produced by Amazon MTurk workers rivals that of an expert worker. We provide best practices to assess the quality of ground truth data, and to compare data quality produced by different sources. We conclude that properly managed crowdsourcing can be used to establish large volumes of viable ground truth data at a low cost and high quality, especially in the context of high throughput plant phenotyping. We also provide several metrics for assessing the quality of the generated datasets.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PSYkmktapmQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Inter-trial effects in visual pop-out search: Factorial comparison of Bayesian updating models</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/0rQcDnT9JDA/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Fredrik Allenmark, Hermann J. Müller, Zhuanghua Shi&lt;/p&gt;

Many previous studies on visual search have reported inter-trial effects, that is, observers respond faster when some target property, such as a defining feature or dimension, or the response associated with the target repeats versus changes across consecutive trial episodes. However, what processes drive these inter-trial effects is still controversial. Here, we investigated this question using a combination of Bayesian modeling of belief updating and evidence accumulation modeling in perceptual decision-making. In three visual singleton (‘pop-out’) search experiments, we explored how the probability of the response-critical states of the search display (e.g., target presence/absence) and the repetition/switch of the target-defining dimension (color/ orientation) affect reaction time distributions. The results replicated the mean reaction time (RT) inter-trial and dimension repetition/switch effects that have been reported in previous studies. Going beyond this, to uncover the underlying mechanisms, we used the Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM) and the Linear Approach to Threshold with Ergodic Rate (LATER) model to explain the RT distributions in terms of decision bias (starting point) and information processing speed (evidence accumulation rate). We further investigated how these different aspects of the decision-making process are affected by different properties of stimulus history, giving rise to dissociable inter-trial effects. We approached this question by (i) combining each perceptual decision making model (DDM or LATER) with different updating models, each specifying a plausible rule for updating of either the starting point or the rate, based on stimulus history, and (ii) comparing every possible combination of trial-wise updating mechanism and perceptual decision model in a factorial model comparison. Consistently across experiments, we found that the (recent) history of the response-critical property influences the initial decision bias, while repetition/switch of the target-defining dimension affects the accumulation rate, likely reflecting an implicit ‘top-down’ modulation process. This provides strong evidence of a disassociation between response- and dimension-based inter-trial effects.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0rQcDnT9JDA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Wakefulness is promoted during daytime by PDFR signalling to dopaminergic neurons in Drosophila melanogaster</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0129-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Circadian clocks modulate timing of sleep/wake cycles in animals; however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;, large ventral lateral neurons (l-LN&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) are known to promote wakefulness through the action of the neuropeptide Pigment Dispersing Factor (PDF), but the downstream targets of PDF signalling remain elusive. In a screen using down-regulation or over-expression of the gene encoding PDF receptor (&lt;i&gt;pdfr&lt;/i&gt;), we found that a subset of dopaminergic neurons respond to PDF to promote wakefulness during the day. Moreover, we found that small LN&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; (s-LN&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) and dopaminergic neurons form synaptic contacts, and PDFR signalling inhibited dopaminergic neurons specifically during day-time. We propose that these dopaminergic neurons that respond to PDFR signalling are sleep-promoting and that during the day when PDF levels are high, they are inhibited, thereby promoting wakefulness. Thus we identify a novel circadian clock pathway that mediates wake promotion specifically during daytime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; It is well established that sleep is controlled by two major factors, the circadian clock as well as a sleep homeostat. Organisms need to remain awake during appropriate times of the day in order to engage in activities such as feeding and mating that increase their chances of survival. How wakefulness during the day is maintained remains unknown. Here, we show that circadian clock neurons direct their inhibitory peptidergic wake-promoting signal to dopamine neurons specifically during the day-time. Importantly, contact of dopamine neurons with known homeostatic structures established through previous studies, underlies an important pathway bridging together circadian and homeostatic neurons in sleep/wake regulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Novel Quantitative Analyses of Spontaneous Synaptic Events in Cortical Pyramidal Cells Reveal Subtle Parvalbumin-Expressing Interneuron Dysfunction in a Knock-in Mouse Model of Alzheimers Disease</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0059-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that has become a compelling global public health concern. Besides pathological hallmarks such as extracellular amyloid plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, and loss of neurons and synapses, clinical reports have shown that epileptiform activity, even seizures, can occur early in the disease. Aberrant synaptic and network activities as well as epileptiform discharges have also been observed in various mouse models of AD. The new &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mouse model is generated by a gene knock-in approach and there are limited studies on basic synaptic properties in &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice. Therefore, we applied quantitative methods to analyze spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory synaptic events in parietal cortex layer 2/3 pyramidal cells. First, by an objective amplitude distribution analysis, we found decreased amplitudes of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in aged &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice caused by a reduction in the amplitudes of the large sIPSCs with fast rates of rise, consistent with deficits in the function of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV INs). Second, we calculated the burstiness and memory in a series of successive synaptic events. Lastly, by using a novel approach to determine the excitation to inhibition (E/I) ratio, we found no changes in the &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice, indicating that homeostatic mechanisms may have maintained the overall balance of excitation and inhibition in spite of a mildly impaired PV IN function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Using novel quantitative analyses of spontaneous synaptic currents in L2/3 pyramidal cells, we revealed subtle deficits in the function of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV INs) in a new mouse model of AD, the &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice. We applied novel statistical and analytical methods to further characterize the properties of spontaneous postsynaptic currents. Our approach provides rigorous quantitative tools for the analysis of synaptic events in mouse models of disease for objectively and reliably revealing even subtle disease-related alterations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Finding any Waldo: zero-shot invariant and efficient visual search. (arXiv:1807.10587v1 [cs.CV])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10587</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Searching for a target object in a cluttered scene constitutes a fundamental
challenge in daily vision. Visual search must be selective enough to
discriminate the target from distractors, invariant to changes in the
appearance of the target, efficient to avoid exhaustive exploration of the
image, and must generalize to locate novel target objects with zero-shot
training. Previous work has focused on searching for perfect matches of a
target after extensive category-specific training. Here we show for the first
time that humans can efficiently and invariantly search for natural objects in
complex scenes. To gain insight into the mechanisms that guide visual search,
we propose a biologically inspired computational model that can locate targets
without exhaustive sampling and generalize to novel objects. The model provides
an approximation to the mechanisms integrating bottom-up and top-down signals
during search in natural scenes.

These behavioral responses are thought to be largely driven by genetically pre-programmed circuits. However, they can also vary significantly according to the animal’s previous social experience and physiological state, suggesting that the underlying circuits are shaped by adaptive modulatory changes. Modern tools of neuroscience have enabled the direct interrogation of circuits driving sex-specific behaviors and helped unravel key neural mechanisms underlying their function and modulation. In particular, recent work has shown how individual neuronal responses may combine with population activity to encode specific social information in both sexes. In this review, we summarize recent findings on how sex-specific sensory information is processed in social behavioral circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Activation of the DNA-repair mechanism through NBS1 and MRE11 diffusion</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/Goom-28bvCg/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Ida Friis, Ilia A. Solov’yov&lt;/p&gt;

The non-homologous end joining of a DNA double strand break is initiated by the MRE11-NBS1-RAD50 complex whose subunits are the first three proteins to arrive to the breakage site thereby making the recruitment time of MRE11, NBS1 and RAD50 essential for cell survival. In the present investigation, the nature of MRE11 and NBS1 transportation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, hosting the damaged DNA strand, is hypothesized to be a passive diffusive process. The feasibility of such a mechanism is addressed through theoretical and computational approaches which permit establishing the characteristic recruitment time of MRE11 and NBS1 by the nucleus. A computational model of a cell is constructed from a set of biological parameters and the kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm is used to simulate the diffusing MRE11 and NBS1 particles as a random walk process. To accurately describe the experimented data, it is discovered that MRE11 and NBS1 should start diffusion from significantly different starting positions which suggests that diffusion might not be the only transport mechanism of repair protein recruitment to the DNA break.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Goom-28bvCg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Bayesian comparison of explicit and implicit causal inference strategies in multisensory heading perception</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/ZGcPnbf7Gpw/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Luigi Acerbi, Kalpana Dokka, Dora E. Angelaki, Wei Ji Ma&lt;/p&gt;

The precision of multisensory perception improves when cues arising from the same cause are integrated, such as visual and vestibular heading cues for an observer moving through a stationary environment. In order to determine how the cues should be processed, the brain must infer the causal relationship underlying the multisensory cues. In heading perception, however, it is unclear whether observers follow the Bayesian strategy, a simpler non-Bayesian heuristic, or even perform causal inference at all. We developed an efficient and robust computational framework to perform Bayesian model comparison of causal inference strategies, which incorporates a number of alternative assumptions about the observers. With this framework, we investigated whether human observers’ performance in an &lt;i&gt;explicit&lt;/i&gt; cause attribution and an &lt;i&gt;implicit&lt;/i&gt; heading discrimination task can be modeled as a causal inference process. In the explicit causal inference task, all subjects accounted for cue disparity when reporting judgments of common cause, although not necessarily all in a Bayesian fashion. By contrast, but in agreement with previous findings, data from the heading discrimination task only could not rule out that several of the same observers were adopting a forced-fusion strategy, whereby cues are integrated regardless of disparity. Only when we combined evidence from both tasks we were able to rule out forced-fusion in the heading discrimination task. Crucially, findings were robust across a number of variants of models and analyses. Our results demonstrate that our proposed computational framework allows researchers to ask complex questions within a rigorous Bayesian framework that accounts for parameter and model uncertainty.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZGcPnbf7Gpw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

However, the millisecond timescales for association often do not match the much longer delays for behaviorally relevant signals that supervise learning. In particular, information about the behavioral outcome of neural activity can be delayed, leading to a problem of temporal credit assignment. Recent studies suggest that synaptic plasticity can have temporal rules that not only accommodate the delays relevant to the circuit, but also be precisely tuned to the behavior the circuit supports. These discoveries highlight the diversity of plasticity rules, whose temporal requirements may depend on circuit delays and the contingencies of behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: ACC Sulcal Patterns and Their Modulation on Cognitive Control Efficiency Across Lifespan: A Neuroanatomical Study on Bilinguals and Monolinguals</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy175/5060274?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a key structure implicated in the regulation of cognitive control (CC). Previous studies suggest that variability in the ACC sulcal pattern—a neurodevelopmental marker unaffected by maturation or plasticity after birth—is associated with intersubject differences in CC performance. Here, we investigated whether bilingual experience modulates the effects of ACC sulcal variability on CC performance across the lifespan. Using structural MRI, we first established the distribution of the ACC sulcal patterns in a large sample of healthy individuals (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 270) differing on gender and ethnicity. Second, a participants’ subsample (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 157) was selected to test whether CC performance was differentially affected by ACC sulcation in bilinguals and monolinguals across age. A prevalent leftward asymmetry unaffected by gender or ethnicity was reported. Sulcal variability in the ACC predicted CC performance differently in bilinguals and monolinguals, with a reversed pattern of structure–function relationship: asymmetrical versus symmetrical ACC sulcal patterns were associated with a performance advantage in monolinguals and a performance detriment to bilinguals and vice versa. Altogether, these findings provide novel insights on the dynamic interplay between early neurodevelopment, environmental background and cognitive efficiency across age.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Hippocampal Network Oscillations Rescue Memory Consolidation Deficits Caused by Sleep Loss</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy174/5060282?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Oscillations in the hippocampal network during sleep are proposed to play a role in memory storage by patterning neuronal ensemble activity. Here we show that following single-trial fear learning, sleep deprivation (which impairs memory consolidation) disrupts coherent firing rhythms in hippocampal area CA1. State-targeted optogenetic inhibition of CA1 parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons during postlearning NREM sleep, but not REM sleep or wake, disrupts contextual fear memory (CFM) consolidation in a manner similar to sleep deprivation. NREM-targeted inhibition disrupts CA1 network oscillations which predict successful memory storage. Rhythmic optogenetic activation of PV+ interneurons following learning generates CA1 oscillations with coherent principal neuron firing. This patterning of CA1 activity rescues CFM consolidation in sleep-deprived mice. Critically, behavioral and optogenetic manipulations that disrupt CFM also disrupt learning-induced stabilization of CA1 ensembles’ communication patterns in the hours following learning. Conversely, manipulations that promote CFM also promote long-term stability of CA1 communication patterns. We conclude that sleep promotes memory consolidation by generating coherent rhythms of CA1 network activity, which provide consistent communication patterns within neuronal ensembles. Most importantly, we show that this rhythmic patterning of activity is sufficient to promote long-term memory storage in the absence of sleep.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Dynamic Reorganization of Motor Networks During Recovery from Partial Spinal Cord Injury in Monkeys</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy172/5060284?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;After spinal cord injury (SCI), the motor-related cortical areas can be a potential substrate for functional recovery in addition to the spinal cord. However, a dynamic description of how motor cortical circuits reorganize after SCI is lacking. Here, we captured the comprehensive dynamics of motor networks across SCI in a nonhuman primate model. Using electrocorticography over the sensorimotor areas in monkeys, we collected broadband neuronal signals during a reaching-and-grasping task at different stages of recovery of dexterous finger movements after a partial SCI at the cervical levels. We identified two distinct network dynamics: grasping-related intrahemispheric interactions from the contralesional premotor cortex (PM) to the contralesional primary motor cortex (M1) in the high-γ band (&amp;gt;70 Hz), and motor-preparation-related interhemispheric interactions from the contralesional to ipsilesional PM in the α and low-β bands (10–15 Hz). The strengths of these networks correlated to the time course of behavioral recovery. The grasping-related network showed enhanced activation immediately after the injury, but gradually returned to normal while the strength of the motor-preparation-related network gradually increased. Our findings suggest a cortical compensatory mechanism after SCI, where two interdependent motor networks redirect activity from the contralesional hemisphere to the other hemisphere to facilitate functional recovery.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Control Engagement During Sentence and Inhibition fMRI Tasks in Children With Reading Difficulties</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Recent reading research implicates executive control regions as sites of difference in struggling readers. However, as studies often employ only reading or language tasks, the extent of deviation in control engagement in children with reading difficulties is not known. The current study investigated activation in reading and executive control brain regions during both a sentence comprehension task and a nonlexical inhibitory control task in third–fifth grade children with and without reading difficulties. We employed both categorical (group-based) and individual difference approaches to relate reading ability to brain activity. During sentence comprehension, struggling readers had less activation in the left posterior temporal cortex, previously implicated in language, semantic, and reading research. Greater negative activity (relative to fixation) during sentence comprehension in a left inferior parietal region from the executive control literature correlated with poorer reading ability. Greater comprehension scores were associated with less dorsal anterior cingulate activity during the sentence comprehension task. Unlike the sentence task, there were no significant differences between struggling and nonstruggling readers for the nonlexical inhibitory control task. Thus, differences in executive control engagement were largely specific to reading, rather than a general control deficit across tasks in children with reading difficulties, informing future intervention research.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Timing of Sensory-Guided Behavioral Response is Represented in
the Mouse Primary Somatosensory Cortex</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy169/5060281?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Whisker-guided decision making in mice is thought to critically depend on
information processing occurring in the primary somatosensory cortex. However,
it is not clear if neuronal activity in this “early”
sensory region contains information about the timing and speed of motor
response. To address this question we designed a new task in which freely moving
mice learned to associate a whisker stimulus to reward delivery. The task was
tailored in such a way that a wide range of delays between whisker stimulation
and reward collection were observed due to differences of motivation and
perception. After training, mice were anesthetized and neuronal responses evoked
by stimulating trained and untrained whiskers were recorded across several
cortical columns of barrel cortex. We found a strong correlation between the
delay of the mouse behavioral response and the timing of multiunit activity
evoked by the trained whisker, outside its principal cortical column, in layers
4 and 5A but not in layer 2/3. Circuit mapping ex vivo revealed this effect was
associated with a weakening of layer 4 to layer 2/3 projection. We conclude that
the processes controlling the propagation of key sensory inputs to naive
cortical columns and the timing of sensory-guided action are linked.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Prefrontal Control Over Occipital Responses to Crossmodal Overlap Varies Across the Congruency Spectrum</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy168/5060272?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;While matched crossmodal information is known to facilitate object recognition, it is unclear how our perceptual systems encode the more gradual congruency variations that occur in our natural environment. Combining visual objects with odor mixtures to create a gradual increase in semantic object overlap, we demonstrate high behavioral acuity to linear variations of olfactory–visual overlap in a healthy adult population. This effect was paralleled by a linear increase in cortical activation at the intersection of occipital fusiform and lingual gyri, indicating linear encoding of crossmodal semantic overlap in visual object recognition networks. Effective connectivity analyses revealed that this integration of olfactory and visual information was achieved by direct information exchange between olfactory and visual areas. In addition, a parallel pathway through the superior frontal gyrus was increasingly recruited towards the most ambiguous stimuli. These findings demonstrate that cortical structures involved in object formation are inherently crossmodal and encode sensory overlap in a linear manner. The results further demonstrate that prefrontal control of these processes is likely required for ambiguous stimulus combinations, a fact of high ecological relevance that may be inappropriately captured by common task designs juxtaposing congruency and incongruency.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;A frequently repeated finding is that the default mode network (DMN) shows activation decreases during externally focused tasks. This finding has led to an emphasis in DMN research on internally focused self-relevant thought processes. A recent study, in contrast, implicates the DMN in substantial externally focused task switches. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we scanned 24 participants performing a task switch experiment. Whilst replicating previous DMN task switch effects, we also found large DMN increases for brief rests as well as task restarts after rest. Our findings are difficult to explain using theories strictly linked to internal or self-directed cognition. In line with principal results from the literature, we suggest that the DMN encodes scene, episode or context, by integrating spatial, self-referential, and temporal information. Context representations are strong at rest, but rereference to context also occurs at major cognitive transitions.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Here, we examine how potential reward and its influence on arousal, measured by pupil dynamics, are represented in the brain while preparing for a challenging task. We further ask how neural representations during preparation relate to actual performance. Trials resulting in performance failure were characterized by increased pupil dilation as a function of increasing reward magnitude during preparation. Such failure trials were also associated with activation of the right amygdala representing pupil dilation, and the left caudate representing reward magnitude. Notably, increases in functional connectivity between amygdala and caudate preceded performance failure. These findings highlight increased connectivity between neural regions representing reward and arousal in circumstances where reward-driven arousal impairs performance.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a multisystem disorder affecting muscle and central nervous system (CNS) function. The cellular mechanisms underlying CNS alterations are poorly understood and no useful treatments exist for the neuropsychological deficits observed in DM1 patients. We investigated the progression of behavioral deficits present in male and female muscleblind-like 2 (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mbnl2&lt;/span&gt;) knockout (KO) mice, a rodent model of CNS alterations in DM1, and determined the biochemical and electrophysiological correlates in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), striatum and hippocampus (HPC). Male KO exhibited more cognitive impairment and depressive-like behavior than female KO mice. In the mPFC, KO mice showed an overexpression of proinflammatory microglia, increased transcriptional levels of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Dat&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Drd1&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Drd2&lt;/span&gt;, exacerbated dopamine levels, and abnormal neural spiking and oscillatory activities in the mPFC and HPC. Chronic treatment with methylphenidate (MPH) (1 and 3 mg/kg) reversed the behavioral deficits, reduced proinflammatory microglia in the mPFC, normalized prefrontal &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Dat&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Drd2&lt;/span&gt; gene expression, and increased &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Bdnf&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Nrf2&lt;/span&gt; mRNA levels.

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is thought to encode and represent the number of objects in a visual scene (i.e., numerosity). Whether this representation is shared for simultaneous and sequential stimuli (i.e., mode independency) is debated. We tested the existence of a common neural substrate for the encoding of these modes using fMRI. While both modes elicited overlapping BOLD response in occipital areas, only simultaneous numerosities significantly activated PPC. Unique activation for sequential numerosities was found in bilateral temporal areas. Multivoxel pattern analysis revealed numerosity selectivity in PPC only for simultaneous numerosities and revealed differential encoding of presentation modes. Voxel-wise numerosity tuning functions for simultaneous numerosities in occipital and parietal ROIs revealed increasing numerosity selectivity along an occipito-to-parietal gradient. Our results suggest that the parietal cortex is involved in the extraction of spatial but not temporal numerosity and question the idea of commonly used cortical circuits for a mode-independent numerosity representation.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and multivariate pattern analyses to examine the effects of acute stress during retrieval. We report that stress reduced the probability of recollecting the details of past experience, and that this impairment was driven, in part, by a disruption of the relationship between hippocampal activation, cortical reinstatement, and memory performance. Moreover, even memories expressed with high confidence were less accurate under stress, and this stress-induced decline in accuracy was explained by reduced posterior hippocampal engagement despite similar levels of category-level cortical reinstatement. Finally, stress degraded the relationship between the engagement of frontoparietal control networks and retrieval decision uncertainty. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the widespread consequences of acute stress on the neural systems of remembering.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Mitochondria play a key role in energy production and calcium buffering, among many other functions. They provide most of the energy required by neurons, and they are transported along axons and dendrites to the regions of higher energy demands. We have used focused ion beam milling and scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM) to obtain stacks of serial sections from the somatosensory cortex of the juvenile rat. We have estimated the volume fraction occupied by mitochondria and their distribution between dendritic, axonal, and nonsynaptic processes. The volume fraction of mitochondria increased from layer I (4.59%) to reach its maximum in layer IV (7.74%) and decreased to its minimum in layer VI (4.03%). On average, 44% of mitochondrial volume was located in dendrites, 15% in axons and 41% in nonsynaptic elements. Given that dendrites, axons, and nonsynaptic elements occupied 38%, 23%, and 39% of the neuropil, respectively, it can be concluded that dendrites are proportionally richer in mitochondria with respect to axons, supporting the notion that most energy consumption takes place at the postsynaptic side. We also found a positive correlation between the volume fraction of mitochondria located in neuronal processes and the density of synapses.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Mutations in this pathway are associated with a collection of neurodevelopmental syndromes, Rasopathies; among these, Noonan syndrome (NS) is the most common (1:2000). Prior research has focused on identifying genetic mutations and cellular mechanisms of the disorder, however, effects of NS on the human brain remain unknown. Here, imaging and cognitive data were collected from 12 children with &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;PTPN11&lt;/span&gt;-related NS, ages 4.0–11.0 years (8.98 ± 2.33) and 12 age- and sex-matched typically developing controls (8.79 ± 2.17). We observe reduced gray matter volume in bilateral corpus striatum (Cohen’s &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; = −1.0:−1.3), reduced surface area in temporal regions (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; = −1.8:−2.2), increased cortical thickness in frontal regions (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; = 1.2–1.3), and reduced cortical thickness in limbic regions (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; = −1.6), including limbic structures integral to the circuitry of the hippocampus. Further, we find high levels of inattention, hyperactivity, and memory deficits in children with NS. Taken together, these results identify effects of NS on specific brain regions associated with ADHD and learning in children. While our research lays the groundwork for elucidating the neural and behavioral mechanisms of NS, it also adds an essential tier to understanding the Ras-MAPK pathway’s role in human brain development.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Mental Imagery Follows Similar Cortical Reorganization as Perception: Intra-Modal and Cross-Modal Plasticity in Congenitally Blind</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Cortical plasticity in congenitally blind individuals leads to cross-modal activation of the visual cortex and may lead to superior perceptual processing in the intact sensory domains. Although mental imagery is often defined as a quasi-perceptual experience, it is unknown whether it follows similar cortical reorganization as perception in blind individuals. In this study, we show that auditory versus tactile perception evokes similar intra-modal discriminative patterns in congenitally blind compared with sighted participants. These results indicate that cortical plasticity following visual deprivation does not influence broad intra-modal organization of auditory and tactile perception as measured by our task. Furthermore, not only the blind, but also the sighted participants showed cross-modal discriminative patterns for perception modality in the visual cortex. During mental imagery, both groups showed similar decoding accuracies for imagery modality in the intra-modal primary sensory cortices. However, no cross-modal discriminative information for imagery modality was found in early visual cortex of blind participants, in contrast to the sighted participants. We did find evidence of cross-modal activation of higher visual areas in blind participants, including the representation of specific-imagined auditory features in visual area V4.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Target Interneuron Preference in Thalamocortical Pathways Determines the Temporal Structure of Cortical Responses</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy148/5060266?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Sensory processing relies on fast detection of changes in environment, as well as integration of contextual cues over time. The mechanisms by which local circuits of the cerebral cortex simultaneously perform these opposite processes remain obscure. Thalamic “specific” nuclei relay sensory information, whereas “nonspecific” nuclei convey information on the environmental and behavioral contexts. We expressed channelrhodopsin in the ventrobasal specific (sensory) or the rhomboid nonspecific (contextual) thalamic nuclei. By selectively activating each thalamic pathway, we found that nonspecific inputs powerfully activate adapting (slow-responding) interneurons but weakly connect fast-spiking interneurons, whereas specific inputs exhibit opposite interneuron preference. Specific inputs thereby induce rapid feedforward inhibition that limits response duration, whereas, in the same cortical area, nonspecific inputs elicit delayed feedforward inhibition that enables lasting recurrent excitation. Using a mean field model, we confirm that cortical response dynamics depends on the type of interneuron targeted by thalamocortical inputs and show that efficient recruitment of adapting interneurons prolongs the cortical response and allows the summation of sensory and contextual inputs. Hence, target choice between slow- and fast-responding inhibitory neurons endows cortical networks with a simple computational solution to perform both sensory detection and integration.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Integrated information theory provides a mathematical framework to fully characterize the cause-effect structure of a physical system. Here, we introduce &lt;i&gt;PyPhi&lt;/i&gt;, a Python software package that implements this framework for causal analysis and unfolds the full cause-effect structure of discrete dynamical systems of binary elements. The software allows users to easily study these structures, serves as an up-to-date reference implementation of the formalisms of integrated information theory, and has been applied in research on complexity, emergence, and certain biological questions. We first provide an overview of the main algorithm and demonstrate PyPhi’s functionality in the course of analyzing an example system, and then describe details of the algorithm’s design and implementation. PyPhi can be installed with Python’s package manager via the command ‘pip install pyphi’ on Linux and macOS systems equipped with Python 3.4 or higher. PyPhi is open-source and licensed under the GPLv3; the source code is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/wmayner/pyphi. Comprehensive and continually-updated documentation is available at https://pyphi.readthedocs.io. The pyphi-users mailing list can be joined at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pyphi-users. A web-based graphical interface to the software is available at http://integratedinformationtheory.org/calculate.html.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/E2D_ME0roU4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Edvin Fuglebakk, Nathalie Reuter&lt;/p&gt;

With remarkable spatial and temporal specificities, peripheral membrane proteins bind to biological membranes. They do this without compromising solubility of the protein, and their binding sites are not easily distinguished. Prototypical peripheral membrane binding sites display a combination of patches of basic and hydrophobic amino acids that are also frequently present on other protein surfaces. The purpose of this contribution is to identify simple but essential components for membrane binding, through structural criteria that distinguish exposed hydrophobes at membrane binding sites from those that are frequently found on any protein surface. We formulate the concepts of &lt;i&gt;protruding hydrophobes&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;co-insertability&lt;/i&gt; and have analysed more than 300 families of proteins that are classified as peripheral membrane binders. We find that this structural motif strongly discriminates the surfaces of membrane-binding and non-binding proteins. Our model constitutes a novel formulation of a structural pattern for membrane recognition and emphasizes the importance of subtle structural properties of hydrophobic membrane binding sites.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2OkhnFitdjc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Movement is fundamental to human and animal life, emerging through interaction of complex neural, muscular, and skeletal systems. Study of movement draws from and contributes to diverse fields, including biology, neuroscience, mechanics, and robotics. OpenSim unites methods from these fields to create fast and accurate simulations of movement, enabling two fundamental tasks. First, the software can calculate variables that are difficult to measure experimentally, such as the forces generated by muscles and the stretch and recoil of tendons during movement. Second, OpenSim can predict novel movements from models of motor control, such as kinematic adaptations of human gait during loaded or inclined walking. Changes in musculoskeletal dynamics following surgery or due to human–device interaction can also be simulated; these simulations have played a vital role in several applications, including the design of implantable mechanical devices to improve human grasping in individuals with paralysis. OpenSim is an extensible and user-friendly software package built on decades of knowledge about computational modeling and simulation of biomechanical systems. OpenSim’s design enables computational scientists to create new state-of-the-art software tools and empowers others to use these tools in research and clinical applications. OpenSim supports a large and growing community of biomechanics and rehabilitation researchers, facilitating exchange of models and simulations for reproducing and extending discoveries. Examples, tutorials, documentation, and an active user forum support this community. The OpenSim software is covered by the Apache License 2.0, which permits its use for any purpose including both nonprofit and commercial applications. The source code is freely and anonymously accessible on GitHub, where the community is welcomed to make contributions. Platform-specific installers of OpenSim include a GUI and are available on simtk.org.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0Se-b8BemAY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The specific patterns and properties of these synaptic connections are fundamental to the computations cortical neurons perform. How such specificity arises in cortical circuits has remained elusive. Here, we first consider the cell-type, subcellular and synaptic specificity required for generating mature patterns of cortical connectivity and responses. Next, we focus on recent progress in understanding how the synaptic connections among excitatory cortical projection neurons are established during development using the primary visual cortex of the mouse as a model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Graphical abstract for this article&quot; src=&quot;https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438818300655-fx1.jpg&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;301&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>ScienceDirect Publication: Current Opinion in Neurobiology: Dendritic mechanisms of hippocampal place field formation</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438818300734?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: February 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 54&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Mark EJ Sheffield, Daniel A Dombeck&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Place cells in the hippocampus are thought to form a cognitive map of space and a memory of places. How this map forms when animals are exposed to novel environments has been the subject of a great deal of research. Numerous technical advances over the past decade greatly increased our understanding of the precise mechanisms underlying place field formation. In particular, it is now possible to connect cellular and circuit mechanisms of integration, firing, and plasticity discovered in brain slices, to processes taking place &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; as animals learn and encode novel environments. Here, we focus on recent results and describe the dendritic mechanisms most likely responsible for the formation of place fields. We also discuss key open questions that are likely to be answered in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>
