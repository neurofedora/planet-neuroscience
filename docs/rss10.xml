	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: MHC binding affects the dynamics of different T-cell receptors in different ways</title>

T cells use their T-cell receptors (TCRs) to scan other cells for antigenic peptides presented by MHC molecules (pMHC). If a TCR encounters a pMHC, it can trigger a signalling pathway that could lead to the activation of the T cell and the initiation of an immune response. It is currently not clear how the binding of pMHC to the TCR initiates signalling within the T cell. One hypothesis is that conformational changes in the TCR lead to further downstream signalling. Here we investigate four different TCRs in their free state as well as in their pMHC bound state using large scale molecular simulations totalling 26 000 ns. We find that the dynamical features within TCRs differ significantly between unbound TCR and TCR/pMHC simulations. However, apart from expected results such as reduced solvent accessibility and flexibility of the interface residues, these features are not conserved among different TCR types. The presence of a pMHC alone is not sufficient to cause cross-TCR-conserved dynamical features within a TCR. Our results argue against models of TCR triggering involving conserved allosteric conformational changes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pWUJJpzBfnc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Prepaid parameter estimation without likelihoods</title>

In various fields, statistical models of interest are analytically intractable and inference is usually performed using a simulation-based method. However elegant these methods are, they are often painstakingly slow and convergence is difficult to assess. As a result, statistical inference is greatly hampered by computational constraints. However, for a given statistical model, different users, even with different data, are likely to perform similar computations. Computations done by one user are potentially useful for other users with different data sets. We propose a pooling of resources across researchers to capitalize on this. More specifically, we preemptively chart out the entire space of possible model outcomes in a prepaid database. Using advanced interpolation techniques, any individual estimation problem can now be solved on the spot. The prepaid method can easily accommodate different priors as well as constraints on the parameters. We created prepaid databases for three challenging models and demonstrate how they can be distributed through an online parameter estimation service. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art estimation techniques in both speed (with a 23,000 to 100,000-fold speed up) and accuracy, and is able to handle previously quasi inestimable models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/o2pSi36siNM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Chemotherapy resistance is a major challenge to the effective treatment of cancer. Thus, a systematic pipeline for the efficient identification of effective combination treatments could bring huge biomedical benefit. In order to facilitate rational design of combination therapies, we developed a comprehensive computational model that incorporates the available biological knowledge and relevant experimental data on the life-and-death response of individual cancer cells to cisplatin or cisplatin combined with the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). The model’s predictions, that a combination treatment of cisplatin and TRAIL would enhance cancer cell death and exhibit a “two-wave killing” temporal pattern, was validated by measuring the dynamics of p53 accumulation, cell fate, and cell death in single cells. The validated model was then subjected to a systematic analysis with an ensemble of diverse machine learning methods. Though each method is characterized by a different algorithm, they collectively identified several molecular players that can sensitize tumor cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis (sensitizers). The identified sensitizers are consistent with previous experimental observations. Overall, we have illustrated that machine learning analysis of an experimentally validated mechanistic model can convert our available knowledge into the identity of biologically meaningful sensitizers. This knowledge can then be leveraged to design treatment strategies that could improve the efficacy of chemotherapy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5J8yM9XG9_w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: An Open Source Syringe Pump Controller for Fluid Delivery of Multiple Volumes</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/5/ENEURO.0240-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Syringe pumps are a necessary piece of laboratory equipment that are used for fluid delivery in behavioral neuroscience laboratories. Many experiments provide rodents and primates with fluid rewards such as juice, water, or liquid sucrose. Current commercialized syringe pumps are not customizable and do not have the ability to deliver multiple volumes of fluid based on different inputs to the pump. Additionally, many syringe pumps are expensive and cannot be used in experiments with paired neurophysiological recordings due to electrical noise. We developed an open source syringe pump controller using commonly available parts. The controller adjusts the acceleration and speed of the motor to deliver three different volumes of fluid reward within one common time epoch. This syringe pump controller is cost effective and has been successfully implemented in rodent behavioral experiments with paired neurophysiological recordings in the rat frontal cortex while rats lick for different volumes of liquid sucrose rewards. Our syringe pump controller will enable new experiments to address the potential confound of temporal information in studies of reward signaling by fluid magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Large-Scale Networks for Auditory Sensory Gating in the Awake Mouse</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/5/ENEURO.0207-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The amplitude of the brain response to a repeated auditory stimulus is diminished as compared to the response to the first tone (T1) for interstimulus intervals (ISI) lasting up to hundreds of milliseconds. This adaptation process, called auditory sensory gating (ASG), is altered in various psychiatric diseases including schizophrenia and is classically studied by focusing on early evoked cortical responses to the second tone (T2) using 500-ms ISI. However, mechanisms underlying ASG are still not well-understood. We investigated ASG in awake mice from the brainstem to cortex at variable ISIs (125–2000 ms) using high-density EEG and intracerebral recordings. While ASG decreases at longer ISIs, it is still present at durations (500–2000 ms) far beyond the time during which brain responses to T1 could still be detected. T1 induces a sequence of specific stable scalp EEG topographies that correspond to the successive activation of distinct neural networks lasting about 350 ms. These brain states remain unaltered if T2 is presented during this period, although T2 is processed by the brain, suggesting that ongoing networks of brain activity are active for longer than early evoked-potentials and are not overwritten by an upcoming new stimulus. Intracerebral recordings demonstrate that ASG is already present at the level of ventral cochlear nucleus (vCN) and inferior colliculus and is amplified across the hierarchy in bottom-up direction. This study uncovers the extended stability of sensory-evoked brain states and long duration of ASG, and sheds light on generators of ASG and possible interactions between bottom-up and top-down mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Hand posture as localizing sign in adult focal epileptic seizures</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25589?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to identify specific ictal hand postures (HP) as localizing signs of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) in patients with frontal or temporal lobe epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study we retrospectively analyzed ictal semiology of 489 temporal lobe or frontal lobe seizures recorded over a 6‐year period at the Seizure Disorder Center of UCLA ‐ USA (45 patients) or at the “C. Munari” Epilepsy Surgery Centre of the Niguarda Hospital in Milan ‐ Italy (34 patients). Our criterion for EZ localization was at least two years of seizure freedom after surgery. We analyzed presence and latency of ictal HP. We then examined if specific initial HP are predictive for EZ localization.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that ictal HP were present in 72.5% of patients with frontal and 54.5% of patients with temporal lobe seizures. We divided HP into 6 classes depending on the reciprocal position of the fingers (“fist”, “cup”, “politician's fist”, “pincer”, “extended hand”, “pointing”). We found a striking correlation between EZ localization and ictal HP. In particular “fist” and “pointing” HP are strongly predictive of frontal lobe EZ; “cup”, “politician's fist” and “pincer” are strongly predictive of temporal lobe EZ.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study offers simple ictal signs that appear to clarify differential diagnosis of temporal vs frontal lobe EZ localization. These results are meant to be used as a novel complementary tool, during presurgical evaluation for epilepsy. At the same time they give us important insight into the neurophysiology of hand movements.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Intravenous thrombolysis for suspected ischemic stroke with seizure at onset</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25582?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seizure at onset (SaO) has been considered a relative contraindication for intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in patients with acute ischemic stroke, although this appraisal is not evidence based. Here, we investigated the prognostic significance of SaO in patients treated with IVT for suspected ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this multicenter, IVT‐registry–based study we assessed the association between SaO and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH, European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study II definition), 3‐month mortality, and 3‐month functional outcome on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) using unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression, coarsened exact matching, and inverse probability weighted analyses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among 10,074 IVT‐treated patients, 146 (1.5%) had SaO. SaO patients had significantly higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and glucose on admission, and more often female sex, prior stroke, and prior functional dependence than non‐SaO patients. In unadjusted analysis, they had generally less favorable outcomes. After controlling for confounders in adjusted, matched, and weighted analyses, all associations between SaO and any of the outcomes disappeared, including sICH (odds ratio [OR]&lt;sub&gt;unadjusted&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.53 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.74–3.14], OR&lt;sub&gt;adjusted&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.52 [95% CI = 0.13–2.16], OR&lt;sub&gt;matched&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.68 [95% CI = 0.15–3.03], OR&lt;sub&gt;weighted&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.95 [95% CI = 0.39–2.32]), mortality (OR&lt;sub&gt;unadjusted&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.49 [95% CI = 1.00–2.24], OR&lt;sub&gt;adjusted&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.98 [95% CI = 0.5–1.92], OR&lt;sub&gt;matched&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.13 [95% CI = 0.55–2.33], OR&lt;sub&gt;weighted&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.17 [95% CI = 0.73–1.88]), and functional outcome (mRS ≥ 3/ordinal mRS: OR&lt;sub&gt;unadjusted&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.33 [95% CI = 0.96–1.84]/1.35 [95% CI = 1.01–1.81], OR&lt;sub&gt;adjusted&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.78 [95% CI = 0.45–1.32]/0.78 [95% CI = 0.52–1.16], OR&lt;sub&gt;matched&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.75 [95% CI = 0.43–1.32]/0.45 [95% CI = 0.10–2.06], OR&lt;sub&gt;weighted&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.87 [95% CI = 0.57–1.34]/1.00 [95% CI = 0.66–1.52]). These results were consistent regardless of whether patients had an eventual diagnosis of ischemic stroke (89/146) or stroke mimic (57/146 SaO patients).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SaO was not an independent predictor of poor prognosis. Withholding IVT from patients with assumed ischemic stroke presenting with SaO seems unjustified. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02947</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Combinatorial threshold-linear networks (CTLNs) are a special class of neural
networks whose dynamics are tightly controlled by an underlying directed graph.
In prior work, we showed that target-free cliques of the graph correspond to
stable fixed points of the dynamics, and we conjectured that these are the only
stable fixed points allowed. In this paper we prove that the conjecture holds
in a variety of special cases, including for graphs with very strong inhibition
and graphs of size $n \leq 4$. We also provide further evidence for the
conjecture by showing that sparse graphs and graphs that are nearly cliques can
never support stable fixed points. Finally, we translate some results from
extremal combinatorics to upper bound the number of stable fixed points of
CTLNs in cases where the conjecture holds.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Cooperative regulation of cellular identity in systems with intercellular communication defects. (arXiv:1909.02944v1 [q-bio.CB])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02944</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The cooperative dynamics of cellular populations emerging from the underlying
interactions determines cellular functions, and thereby their identity in
tissues. Global deviations of this dynamics on the other hand reflects
pathological conditions. However, how these conditions are stabilized from
dis-regulation on the level of the single entities is still unclear. Using
generic Hodgkin-Huxley type of models, we investigate here how channel defects
in single beta-cells affect the intercellular communication, and whether the
collective dynamics of the population can be thereby influenced. We identify a
stark contrast between the dynamical behavior of homogeneous and heterogenous
populations of cells. Whereas in the first case, when all of the cells acquired
channel defects, a coupling interval can be found for which the pathological
dynamics is stabilized and will be exhibited with $\approx 100\%$ probability,
in a heterogenous population, at least $N/2+1$ cells must have the channel
defects in order for the pathological dynamics to be stabilizied. The numerical
simulations demonstrated however that the probability to exhibit the
pathological dynamics in this case is maintained at $&amp;lt;10\%$, even when the
population contains only a single cell that displays physiological dynamics.
This results therefore suggest that the physiological bursting dynamics of a
population of beta-cells is cooperatively regulated, even when single-cells
acquire disfunctional channels that induce intercellular communication defects.

information measures are found to bear a lot of similarity, showing their
mutual asymptotic convergence as time-uncorrelated activity is increased, with
the sign transition of the &quot;whole minus sum&quot; information associated to a rapid
growth in the &quot;decoder based&quot; information. The study aims at creating a
theoretical base for using the spiking-bursting model as a well understood
reference point for applying Integrated Information concepts to systems
exhibiting similar bursting behavior (in particular, to neuron-astrocyte
networks). The model can also be of interest as a new discrete-state test bench
for different formulations of Integrated Information.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02833</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;With the advancement of synthetic biology, several new tools have been
conceptualized over the years as alternative treatments for current medical
procedures. Most of those applications are applied to various chronic diseases.
This work investigates how synthetically engineered neurons can operate as
digital logic gates that can be used towards bio-computing for the brain. We
quantify the accuracy of logic gates under high firing rates amid a network of
neurons and by how much it can smooth out uncontrolled neuronal firings. To
test the efficacy of our method, simulations composed of computational models
of neurons connected in a structure that represents a logic gate are performed.
The simulations demonstrated the accuracy of performing the correct logic
operation, and how specific properties such as the firing rate can play an
important role in the accuracy. As part of the analysis, the Mean squared error
is used to quantify the quality of our proposed model and predicting the
accurate operation of a gate based on different sampling frequencies. As an
application, the logic gates were used to trap epileptic seizures in a neuronal
network, where the results demonstrated the effectiveness of reducing the
firing rate. Our proposed system has the potential for computing numerous
neurological conditions of the brain.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02603</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many biological learning systems such as the mushroom body, hippocampus, and
cerebellum are built from sparsely connected networks of neurons. For a new
understanding of such networks, we study the function spaces induced by sparse
random features and characterize what functions may and may not be learned. A
network with $d$ inputs per neuron is found to be equivalent to an additive
model of order $d$, whereas with a degree distribution the network combines
additive terms of different orders. We identify three specific advantages of
sparsity: additive function approximation is a powerful inductive bias that
limits the curse of dimensionality, sparse networks are stable to outlier noise
in the inputs, and sparse random features are scalable. Thus, even simple brain
architectures can be powerful function approximators. Finally, we hope that
this work helps popularize kernel theories of networks among computational
neuroscientists.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02076</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The increasing access to brain signal data using electroencephalography
creates new opportunities to study electrophysiological brain activity and
perform ambulatory diagnoses of neuronal diseases. This work proposes a
pairwise distance learning approach for Schizophrenia classification relying on
the spectral properties of the signal. Given the limited number of observations
(i.e. the case and/or control individuals) in clinical trials, we propose a
Siamese neural network architecture to learn a discriminative feature space
from pairwise combinations of observations per channel. In this way, the
multivariate order of the signal is used as a form of data augmentation,
further supporting the network generalization ability. Convolutional layers
with parameters learned under a cosine contrastive loss are proposed to
adequately explore spectral images derived from the brain signal. Results on a
case-control population show that the features extracted using the proposed
neural network lead to an improved Schizophrenia diagnosis (+10pp in accuracy
and sensitivity) against spectral features, thus suggesting the existence of
non-trivial, discriminative electrophysiological brain patterns.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00905</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human sensorimotor control exhibits remarkable speed and accuracy, and the
tradeoff between them is encapsulated in Fitts' Law for reaching and pointing.
While Fitts related this to Shannon's channel capacity theorem, despite
widespread study of Fitts' Law, a theory that connects implementation of
sensorimotor control at the system and hardware level has not emerged. Here we
describe a theory that connects hardware (neurons and muscles with inherent
severe speed-accuracy tradeoffs) with system level control to explain Fitts'
Law for reaching and related laws. The results supporting the theory show that
diversity between hardware components is exploited to achieve both fast and
accurate control performance despite slow or inaccurate hardware. Such
&quot;diversity-enabled sweet spots&quot; (DESSs) are ubiquitous in biology and
technology, and explain why large heterogeneities exist in biological and

Subjects brain health was evaluated using MRI scans, neurocognitive evaluation, and computerized testing and compared to DELPHI analysis of brain network functionality.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;A significant decrease in signal coherence is observed with age in connectivity maps, mostly in inter-hemispheric temporal, and parietal areas. MD patients display a pronounced decrease in global and inter-hemispheric frontal connectivity compared to healthy controls. Early and late signal slope ratio also display a significant, age dependent, change with pronounced early slope, phase shift, between normal healthy aging, and MD. History dependent analysis demonstrates a binary step function classification of healthy brain vs. abnormal aging subjects mostly for late slope. DELPHI measures demonstrate high reproducibility with reliability coefficients of around 0.9.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These results indicate that features of evoked response, as charge transfer, slopes of response, and plasticity are altered during abnormal aging and that these fundamental properties of network functionality can be directly evaluated and monitored using DELPHI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/50130</link>
	<content:encoded>Centrosomes are formed when mother centrioles recruit pericentriolar material (PCM) around themselves. The PCM expands dramatically as cells prepare to enter mitosis (a process termed centrosome maturation), but it is unclear how this expansion is achieved. In flies, Spd-2 and Cnn are thought to form a scaffold around the mother centriole that recruits other components of the mitotic PCM, and the Polo-dependent phosphorylation of Cnn at the centrosome is crucial for scaffold assembly. Here, we show that, like Cnn, Spd-2 is specifically phosphorylated at centrosomes. This phosphorylation appears to create multiple phosphorylated S-S/T(p) motifs that allow Spd-2 to recruit Polo to the expanding scaffold. If the ability of Spd-2 to recruit Polo is impaired, the scaffold is initially assembled around the mother centriole, but it cannot expand outwards, and centrosome maturation fails. Our findings suggest that interactions between Spd-2, Polo and Cnn form a positive feedback loop that drives the dramatic expansion of the mitotic PCM in fly embryos.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/49682</link>
	<content:encoded>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) imports ATP and uses energy from ATP hydrolysis for protein folding and trafficking. However, little is known about how this vital ATP transport occurs across the ER membrane. Here, using three commonly used cell lines (CHO, INS1 and HeLa), we report that ATP enters the ER lumen through a cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-antagonized mechanism, or &lt;i&gt;Ca&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;ATiER&lt;/i&gt; (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-Antagonized Transport into ER). Significantly, we show that mitochondria supply ATP to the ER and a SERCA-dependent Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; gradient across the ER membrane is necessary for ATP transport into the ER, through SLC35B1/AXER. We propose that under physiological conditions, increases in cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; inhibit ATP import into the ER lumen to limit ER ATP consumption. Furthermore, the ATP level in the ER is readily depleted by oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) inhibitors and that ER protein misfolding increases ATP uptake from mitochondria into the ER. These findings suggest that ATP usage in the ER may increase mitochondrial OxPhos while decreasing glycolysis, i.e., an '&lt;i&gt;anti-Warburg&lt;/i&gt;' effect.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/48629</link>
	<content:encoded>Kinesin-1 and cytoplasmic dynein are microtubule (MT) motors that transport intracellular cargos. It remains unclear how these motors move along MTs densely coated with obstacles of various sizes in the cytoplasm. Here, we tested the ability of single and multiple motors to bypass synthetic obstacles on MTs &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Contrary to previous reports, we found that mammalian dynein is highly capable of bypassing obstacles. Human kinesin-1 motors fail to avoid obstacles, consistent with their inability to take sideways steps on to neighboring MT protofilaments. Kinesins overcome this limitation when working in teams, bypassing obstacles as effectively as multiple dyneins. Cargos driven by multiple kinesin or dyneins are also capable of rotating around the MT to bypass large obstacles. These results suggest that multiplicity of motors is required not only for transporting cargos over long distances and generating higher forces, but also for maneuvering of the cargos on obstacle-coated MT surfaces.</content:encoded>

Human brain slice cultures derived from neurosurgical resections may offer novel avenues to approach this translational gap. We now demonstrate robust preservation of the complex neuronal cytoarchitecture and electrophysiological properties of human pyramidal neurons in long-term brain slice cultures. Further experiments delineate the optimal conditions for efficient viral transduction of cultures, enabling ‘high throughput’ fluorescence-mediated 3D reconstruction of genetically targeted neurons at comparable quality to state-of-the-art biocytin fillings, and demonstrate feasibility of long term live cell imaging of human cells &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;.

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Evolution of Yin and Yang isoforms of a chromatin remodeling subunit precedes the creation of two genes</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/48119</link>
	<content:encoded>Genes can encode multiple isoforms, broadening their functions and providing a molecular substrate to evolve phenotypic diversity. Evolution of isoform function is a potential route to adapt to new environments. Here we show that &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt;, beneficial alleles in the &lt;i&gt;nurf-1 &lt;/i&gt;gene became fixed in two laboratory lineages of &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; after isolation from the wild in 1951, before methods of cryopreservation were developed. &lt;i&gt;nurf-1 &lt;/i&gt;encodes an ortholog of BPTF, a large (&amp;gt;300kD) multidomain subunit of the NURF chromatin remodeling complex. Using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing and transgenic rescue, we demonstrate that in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;nurf-1 &lt;/i&gt;has split into two, largely non-overlapping isoforms (NURF-1.D and NURF-1.B, which we call Yin and Yang, respectively) that share only two of 26 exons. Both isoforms are essential for normal gametogenesis but have opposite effects on male/female gamete differentiation. Reproduction in hermaphrodites, which involves production of both sperm and oocytes, requires a balance of these opposing Yin and Yang isoforms. Transgenic rescue and genetic position of the fixed mutations suggest that different isoforms are modified in each laboratory strain. In a related clade of &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis &lt;/i&gt;nematodes, the shared exons have duplicated, resulting in the split of the Yin and Yang isoforms into separate genes, each containing approximately 200 amino acids of duplicated sequence that has undergone accelerated protein evolution following the duplication. Associated with this duplication event is the loss of two additional &lt;i&gt;nurf-1 &lt;/i&gt;transcripts, including the long-form transcript and a newly identified, highly expressed transcript encoded by the duplicated exons. We propose these lost transcripts are non-functional side products necessary to transcribe the Yin and Yang transcripts in the same cells. Our work demonstrates how gene sharing, through the production of multiple isoforms, can precede the creation of new, independent genes.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/47142</link>
	<content:encoded>The principles underlying the animacy organization of the ventral temporal cortex (VTC) remain hotly debated, with recent evidence pointing to an animacy continuum rather than a dichotomy. What drives this continuum? According to the visual categorization hypothesis, the continuum reflects the degree to which animals contain animal-diagnostic features. By contrast, the agency hypothesis posits that the continuum reflects the degree to which animals are perceived as (social) agents. Here, we tested both hypotheses with a stimulus set in which visual categorizability and agency were dissociated based on representations in convolutional neural networks and behavioral experiments. Using fMRI, we found that visual categorizability and agency explained independent components of the animacy continuum in VTC. Modeled together, they fully explained the animacy continuum. Finally, clusters explained by visual categorizability were localized posterior to clusters explained by agency. These results show that multiple organizing principles, including agency, underlie the animacy continuum in VTC.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/46275</link>
	<content:encoded>Coordinated migration of cell collectives is important during embryonic development and relies on cells integrating multiple mechanical and chemical cues. Recently, we described that focal activation of the FGF pathway promotes the migration of the parapineal in the zebrafish epithalamus. How FGF activity is restricted to leading cells in this system is, however, unclear. Here, we address the role of Notch signaling in modulating FGF activity within the parapineal. While Notch loss-of-function results in an increased number of parapineal cells activating the FGF pathway, global activation of Notch signaling decreases it; both contexts result in defects in parapineal migration and specification. Decreasing or increasing FGF signaling in a Notch loss-of-function context respectively rescues or aggravates parapineal migration defects without affecting parapineal cells specification. We propose that Notch signaling controls the migration of the parapineal through its capacity to restrict FGF pathway activation to a few leading cells.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/42766</link>
	<content:encoded>Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic-nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels control electrical rhythmicity and excitability in the heart and brain, but the function of HCN channels at the subcellular level in axons remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the action potential conduction velocity in both myelinated and unmyelinated central axons can be bidirectionally modulated by a HCN channel blocker, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and neuromodulators. Recordings from mouse cerebellar mossy fiber boutons show that HCN channels ensure reliable high-frequency firing and are strongly modulated by cAMP (EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 40 µM; estimated endogenous cAMP concentration 13 µM). In addition, immunogold-electron microscopy revealed HCN2 as the dominating subunit in cerebellar mossy fibers. Computational modeling indicated that HCN2 channels control conduction velocity primarily by altering the resting membrane potential and are associated with significant metabolic costs. These results suggest that the cAMP-HCN pathway provides neuromodulators with an opportunity to finely tune energy consumption and temporal delays across axons in the brain.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The \&quot;Locus of Learning\&quot; Problem: Effects of Stimulus and Task Structure on Temporal Perceptual Learning</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/762633v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The ability to discriminate sub-second intervals can be improved with practice, a process known as temporal perceptual learning (TPL). A central question in TPL is whether training improves the low-level sensory representation of a temporal interval or optimizes a set of task-specific response strategies. Here, we trained three groups of participants over five days on a single-interval temporal discrimination task using either fixed intervals (FI) or random intervals (RI). Before and after training, discrimination thresholds were also obtained on an untrained task. Our results revealed that only the FI group showed improvements with five days of training, but this learning did not generalize from the trained task to the untrained task in any group. These results highlight task-specificity in TPL and suggest that training-dependent improvements in timing ability might reflect an active reweighting of decision units, in addition to refinements in the sensory representation of a learned interval.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Serotonergic development of active sensing</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/762534v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Active sensing requires adaptive motor (positional) control of sensory organs based on contextual, sensory and task requirements, and develops postnatally after the maturation of intracortical circuits. Alterations in sensorimotor network connectivity during this period are likely to impact sensorimotor computation also in adulthood. Serotonin is among the cardinal developmental regulators of network formation, thus changing the serotonergic drive might have consequences for the emergence and maturation of sensorimotor control. Here we tested this hypothesis on an object localization task by quantifying the motor control dynamics of whiskers during tactile navigation. The results showed that sustained alterations in serotonergic signaling in serotonin transporter knockout rats, or the transient pharmacological inactivation of the transporter during early postnatal development, impairs the emergence of adaptive motor control of whisker position based on recent sensory information. A direct outcome of this altered motor control is that the mechanical force transmitted to whisker follicles upon contact is reduced, suggesting that increased excitability observed upon altered serotonergic signaling is not due to increased synaptic drive originating from the periphery upon whisker contact. These results argue that postnatal development of adaptive motor control requires intact serotonergic signaling and that even its transient dysregulation during early postnatal development causes lasting sensorimotor impairments in adulthood.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: MicroRNA-210 Knockout Alters Dendritic Density and Behavioural Flexibility</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/762450v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>MicroRNAs exert post-transcriptional control over eukaryotic genomes and are integral for regulating complex functions in neurodevelopment, neuroplasticity and cognitive processing. The microRNA-210 (miR-210) is a highly-conserved, hypoxia-regulated miRNA that has been shown to be dysregulated in Alzheimer's Disease. We have recently also identified a significant enrichment of neurodegenerative diseases among miR-210 targets within the human transcriptome. To further elucidate the role of miR-210 in neuronal function and cognitive behaviour, we utilised conditional miR-210 knockout mice to characterise miR-210 regulation and function in primary hippocampal neurons and measured visual discrimination and reversal learning using rodent touchscreen assays. We found that miR-210 expression was induced by neuronal activation and loss of neuronal miR-210 increased oxidative metabolism and ROS production as well as dendritic density and branching in vitro. We also found that loss of miR-210 in knockout mice increased behavioural flexibility and reduced perseverative responding during reversal learning which required updating of information and feedback. These data support a conserved, activity-dependent role for miR-210 in cognitive function through modulation of neuronal metabolism.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Development of adaptive motor control for tactile navigation</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/762443v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Navigation is a result of complex sensorimotor computation which requires integration of sensory information in allocentric and egocentric coordinates as the brain computes a motor plan to drive navigation. In this active sensing process, motor commands are adaptively regulated based on prior sensory information. In the darkness, rodents commonly rely on their tactile senses, in particular to their whiskers, to gather the necessary sensory information and instruct navigation. Previous research has shown that rodents can process whisker input to guide mobility even prior to whisking onset by the end of the second postnatal week, however, when and how adaptive sensorimotor control of whisker position matures is still not known. Here, we addressed this question in rats longitudinally as animals searched for a stationary target in darkness. The results showed that juvenile rats perform object localization by controlling their body, but not whisker position, based on the expected location of the target. Adaptive, closed-loop, control of whisker position matures only after the third postnatal week. Computational modeling of the active whisking showed the emergence of the closed-loop control of whisker position and reactive retraction, i.e. whisker retraction that ensures the constancy of duration of tactile sampling, facilitate the maturation of sensorimotor exploration strategies during active sensing. These results argue that adaptive motor control of body and whiskers develop sequentially, and sensorimotor control of whisker position emerges later in postnatal development upon the maturation of intracortical sensorimotor circuits.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/762377v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Social interactive learning denotes the ability to acquire new information from a conspecific - a prerequisite for cultural evolution and survival. As inspired by recent neurophysiological research, here we tested whether social interactive learning can be augmented by exogenously synchronizing oscillatory brain activity across an instructor and a learner engaged in a naturalistic song-learning task. We used a dual brain stimulation protocol entailing the trans-cranial delivery of synchronized electric currents in two individuals simultaneously. When we stimulated inferior frontal brain regions, with 6 Hz alternating currents being in-phase between the instructor and the learner, the dyad exhibited spontaneous and synchronized body movement. Remarkably, this stimulation also led to enhanced learning performance. A mediation analysis further disclosed that interpersonal movement synchrony acted as a partial mediator of the effect of dual brain stimulation on learning performance, i.e. possibly facilitating the effect of dual brain stimulation on learning. Our results provide a causal demonstration that inter-brain synchrony is a sufficient condition to improve real-time information transfer between pairs of individuals.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/762344v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Ongoing thought patterns constitute important aspects of both healthy and abnormal human cognition. However, the neural mechanisms behind these daily experiences and their contribution to well-being remain a matter of debate. Here, using resting state fMRI and retrospective thought sampling in a large neurotypical cohort (n = 211) we identified two distinct patterns of thought, broadly describing the participants' current concerns and future plans, that significantly explained variability in the individual functional connectomes. Consistent with the view that ongoing thoughts are an emergent property of multiple neural systems, network-based analysis highlighted the central importance of both unimodal and transmodal cortices in the generation of these experiences. Importantly, while state-dependent current concerns predicted better psychological health, mediating the effect of functional connectomes; trait-level future plans were related to better social health, yet with no mediatory influence. Collectively, we show that ongoing thoughts can influence the link between brain physiology and well-being.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Distributions of hypothalamic neuron populations co-expressing tyrosine hydroxylase and the vesicular GABA transporter in the mouse</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/762328v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The hypothalamus, which includes the zona incerta, contains a discrete population of catecholaminergic neurons marked by the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). As multiple chemical messengers may coexist in each neuron, we determined if hypothalamic TH-immunoreactive (ir) neurons may also express glutamate or GABA. We used Cre/loxP recombination to express enhanced GFP fluorescence in neurons that express the vesicular glutamate (vGLUT2) or GABA transporter (vGAT) and determined TH immunoreactivity in glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons, respectively. EGFP-labeled vGLUT2 neurons were not TH-ir. However, there were discrete TH-ir signals that colocalized with EGFP-positive vGAT neurons, which we validated by in situ hybridization for Vgat mRNA. In order to contextualize the observed pattern of TH+EGFP colocalization in vGAT neurons, we first performed Nissl-based parcellation and plane-of-section analysis, and then mapped the distribution of TH-ir vGAT neurons onto atlas templates from the Allen Reference Atlas of the mouse brain. TH-ir vGAT neurons were distributed throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the hypothalamus and were localized primarily to the periventricular hypothalamic zone, periventricular hypothalamic region, and lateral hypothalamic zone. There was a very strong incidence of EGFP fluorescence in TH-ir neurons across all brain regions where it was observed, but the most striking colocalization was found in the zona incerta (ZI), where every TH-ir neuron was EGFP-positive. Neurochemical characterization of these ZI revealed that they display immunoreactivity for dopamine but not dopamine {beta}-hydroxylase. In aggregate, these findings indicate the existence of a novel hypothalamic population that may signal through the release of GABA and/or dopamine.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Dynamic changes in rhythmic and arrhythmic neural signatures in the subthalamic nucleus induced by anaesthesia and intubation</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/762260v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Subcortical structures including the basal ganglia have been proposed to be crucial for arousal, consciousness, and behavioural responsiveness. However, how basal ganglia contributes to the loss and recovery of consciousness during anaesthesia has not been well characterized. Methods: In this study, using local field potentials (LFPs) from subthalamic nucleus (STN) and scalp electroencephalogram in 12 Parkinson's disease patients, we investigate STN neural signatures during propofol general anaesthesia and during intubation as an arousal intervention in anaesthesia. Results: Propofol-induced anaesthesia resulted in changes in multiple frequency bands in STN LFPs, including increased low-frequency activities (slow-wave oscillation, delta, theta, and alpha bands) and decreased higher-frequency activities. This was also accompanied by increased STN-frontal cortical coherence in alpha frequency band. Beta and high-gamma activities in the STN temporally increased during intubation compared to the status of loss of consciousness. We also show that the dynamic changes in the high frequency activities (80-180 Hz) in STN LFPs induced by propofol and intubation correlated with power-law exponent in the power spectra between 2 and 80 Hz. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that anaesthesia and intubation induced changes in the STN LFPs in multiple frequency bands. They are also consistent with the hypothesis that the power-law exponent in the power spectra between 2 and 80 Hz reflect the excitation/inhibition balance in the STN, which is modulated by anaesthesia and intubation, and further modulate the high frequency activity.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Autophagy-dependent filopodial kinetics restrict synaptic partner choice during Drosophila brain wiring</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/762179v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Brain wiring is remarkably precise, yet most neurons readily form synapses with incorrect partners when given the opportunity. Dynamic axon-dendritic positioning can restrict synaptogenic encounters, but the spatiotemporal interaction kinetics and their regulation remain essentially unknown inside developing brains. Here we show that the kinetics of axonal filopodia restrict synapse formation and partner choice for neurons that are not otherwise prevented from making incorrect synapses. Using 4D imaging in developing Drosophila brains, we show that filopodial kinetics are regulated by autophagy, a prevalent degradation mechanism whose role in brain development remains poorly understood. With surprising specificity, autophagosomes form in synaptogenic filopodia, followed by filopodial collapse. Altered autophagic degradation of synaptic building material quantitatively regulates synapse formation as shown by computational modeling and genetic experiments. Increased filopodial stability enables incorrect synaptic partnerships. Hence, filopodial autophagy restricts inappropriate partner choice through a process of kinetic exclusion that critically contributes to wiring specificity.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/761783v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In vocal communication, vocal signals can provide listeners with information and also elicit motivated responses. Auditory cortical and mesolimbic reward circuits are often considered to have distinct roles in these processes, with auditory cortical circuits responsible for detecting and discriminating sounds and mesolimbic circuits ascribing salience and modulating preference for those sounds. Here, we investigated whether dopamine within auditory cortical circuits themselves can shape the incentive salience of a vocal signal. Using female zebra finches, who show natural preferences for vocal signals produced by males (songs), we found that pairing passive song playback with pharmacological manipulations of dopamine in the secondary auditory cortex drives changes to song preferences. Plasticity of song preferences by dopamine lasted for at least one week and was not influenced by norepinephrine manipulations. These data suggest that dopamine acting directly in sensory processing areas can shape the incentive salience of communication signals.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Homeostatic recovery of embryonic spinal activity initiated by compensatory changes in resting membrane potential.</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/761767v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>When baseline firing rate in a neuronal network is modified by external challenges, a set of mechanisms is prompted to restore spiking to its original rate. We have previously shown that 2-day blockade of excitatory GABAergic or glutamatergic transmission in the living embryo transiently blocks the movements generated by spontaneous network activity (SNA). However, within 12 hours of persistent receptor blockade the embryonic movements homeostatically recover. Although GABAergic and AMPAergic synaptic scaling is expressed in motoneurons by 48 hour blockade of GABAergic transmission, it was not expressed following 12 hours of blockade, when embryonic movements had recovered. Rather, compensatory changes in voltage-gated conductances in motoneurons were observed at this 12 hour time point. Here, we tested for changes in cell excitability and synaptic scaling in both motoneurons and spinal interneurons at the initiation and during the process of the homeostatic recovery of movements. We find no evidence of synaptic upscaling during the recovery process in motoneurons or interneurons following GABAAR blockade. While we did find compensatory changes in intrinsic membrane excitability at times before 12 hours in motoneurons and interneurons, most of the changes that occurred in the first hours of GABAergic or glutamatergic blockade surprisingly involved a depolarization of resting membrane potential. Therefore, fast changes in resting membrane potential represent a key homeostatic mechanism for the maintenance of network activity in the living embryonic nervous system. The findings are the first to show compensatory changes in intrinsic excitability that are expressed during a homeostatic recovery of activity in vivo.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Mental geometry of 3D size and shape perception</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/761650v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Judging poses, sizes and shapes of objects accurately is necessary for organisms and machines to operate successfully in the world. Retinal images of 3D objects are mapped by the rules of projective geometry, and preserve the invariants of that geometry. Since Plato, it has been debated whether geometry is innate to the human brain, and Poincare and Einstein thought it worth examining whether formal geometry arises from experience with the world. We examine if humans have learned to exploit projective geometry to estimate sizes and shapes of objects in 3D scenes. Numerous studies have examined size invariance as a function of physical distance, which changes scale on the retina, but surprisingly, possible constancy or inconstancy of relative size seems not to have been investigated for object pose, which changes retinal image size differently along different axes. We show systematic underestimation of length for extents pointing towards or away from the observer, both for static objects and dynamically rotating objects. Observers do correct for projected shortening according to the optimal back-transform, obtained by inverting the projection function, but the correction is inadequate by a multiplicative factor. The clue is provided by the greater underestimation for longer objects, and the observation that they appear more slanted towards the observer. Adding a multiplicative factor for perceived slant in the back-transform model provides good fits to the corrections used by observers. We quantify the slant illusion with relative slant measurements, and use a dynamic demonstration to show the power of the slant illusion. In biological and mechanical objects, distortions of shape are manifold, and changes in aspect ratio and relative limb sizes are functionally important. Our model shows that observers try to retain invariance of these aspects of shape to 3D rotation by correcting retinal image distortions due to perspective projection, but the corrections can fall short. We discuss how these results imply that humans have internalized particular aspects of projective geometry through evolution or learning, and how assuming that images are preserving the continuity, collinearity, and convergence invariances of projective geometry, supplements the Generic Viewpoint assumption, and simply explains other illusions, such as Ames Chair.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>How does information from seconds earlier affect neocortical responses to new input? Here, we used empirical measurements and computational modeling to study the integration and forgetting of prior information. We found that when two groups of participants heard the same sentence in a narrative, preceded by different contexts, the neural responses of each group were initially different, but gradually fell into alignment. We observed a hierarchical gradient: sensory cortices aligned most quickly, followed by mid-level regions, while higher-order cortical regions aligned last. In some higher order regions, responses to the same sentence took more than 10 seconds to align. What kinds of computations can explain this hierarchical organization of contextual alignment? Passive linear integration models predict that regions which are slower to integrate new information should also be slower to forget old information. However, we found that higher order regions could rapidly forget prior context. The data were better captured by a model composed of hierarchical autoencoders in time (HAT). In HAT, cortical regions maintain a temporal context representation which is actively integrated with input at each moment, and this integration is gated by prediction error. These data and models suggest that sequences of information are combined throughout the cortical hierarchy using an active and gated integration process.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/761460v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Understanding how higher order cognitive function emerges from the underlying brain structure depends on quantifying how the behaviour of discrete regions are integrated within the broader cortical landscape. Recent work has established that this macroscale brain organization and function can be quantified in a compact manner through the use of multivariate machine learning approaches that identify manifolds often described as cortical gradients. By quantifying topographic principles of macroscale organization, cortical gradients lend an analytical framework to study structural and functional brain organization across species, throughout development and aging, and its perturbations in disease. More generally, its macroscale perspective on brain organization offers novel possibilities to investigate the complex relationships between brain structure, function, and cognition in a quantified manner. Here, we present a compact workflow and open-access toolbox that allows for (i) the identification of gradients (from structural or functional imaging data), (ii) their alignment (across subjects or modalities), and (iii) their visualization (in embedding or cortical space). Our toolbox also allows for controlled association studies between gradients with other brain-level features, adjusted with respect to several null models that account for spatial autocorrelation. The toolbox is implemented in both Python and Matlab, programming languages widely used by the neuroimaging and network neuroscience communities. Several use-case examples and validation experiments demonstrate the usage and consistency of our tools for the analysis of functional and microstructural gradients across different spatial scales.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/761395v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Across sensory areas, neural microcircuits consolidate diverse streams of sensory information into unified, representations of the external world, but the developmental process underlying alignment of sensory representations remains poorly understood. Using two-photon and widefield epifluorescence calcium imaging in developing ferret visual cortex, we find an early developmental period in which monocular stimulation reveals two divergent representations of orientation at the network and cellular-scales. During the period of monocular network misalignment, binocular stimulation drives a third orientation representation, distinct from the constituent monocular representations. Alignment towards a single, binocularly unified representation requires binocular visual experience shortly after eye-opening. Chronic imaging demonstrates that the monocular and binocular orientation representations functionally reorganize towards a single representation resembling the early binocular representation through concerted shifts in preferred orientation across the cellular-scale and network-scale representations. Thus, we propose that an experience-dependent learning process drives the emergence of a unified binocular representation of orientation.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Inhibitory autapses are self-innervating synaptic connections in GABAergic interneurons in the brain. Autapses in the neocortical layers have not been systematically investigated, and their function in different mammalian species and specific interneuron types is poorly known. We investigated GABAergic parvalbumin-expressing basket cells (pvBCs) in layer 2/3 (L2/3) in mice as well as in human neocortical tissue resected in deep-brain surgery. Most pvBCs showed robust GABAAR-mediated self-innervation in both species, but autapses were rare in nonfast spiking GABAergic interneurons. Light- and electron microscopy analyses revealed pvBC axons innervating their own soma and proximal dendrites. GABAergic self-inhibition conductance was similar in human and mouse pvBCs and comparable to that of synapses from pvBCs to other L2/3 neurons. Autaptic conductance prolonged somatic inhibition in pvBCs after a spike and inhibited repetitive firing. Perisomatic autaptic inhibition has evolved in pvBCs of various cortical layers and different mammalian species to control discharge of these interneurons.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The first year of life is a key period of brain development, characterized by dramatic structural and functional modifications. Here, we measured rest cerebral blood flow (CBF) modifications throughout babies' first year of life using arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging sequence in 52 infants, from 3 to 12 months of age. Overall, global rest CBF significantly increased during this age span. In addition, we found marked regional differences in local functional brain maturation. While primary sensorimotor cortices and insula showed early maturation, temporal and prefrontal region presented great rest CBF increase across the first year of life. Moreover, we highlighted a late and remarkably synchronous maturation of the prefrontal and posterior superior temporal cortices. These different patterns of regional cortical rest CBF modifications reflect a timetable of local functional brain maturation and are consistent with baby's cognitive development within the first year of life.</content:encoded>

In congenital olfactory sensory loss (anosmia), the only consistent morphological finding is a decreased depth of the olfactory sulci, linked to small or absent olfactory bulbs. Here, we aimed to establish whether congenital anosmia leads to more widespread alterations by comparing gray matter volume, cortical thickness, and curvature between 34 individuals with isolated congenital anosmia and 34 matched controls. Individuals with anosmia demonstrated alterations in bilateral olfactory sulci, encompassing decreased sulcus depth, gray matter atrophy, and decreased curvature. They further demonstrated increased gray matter volume and cortical thickness in the medial orbital gyri; regions strongly linked to olfactory processing, sensory integration and value coding. No structural alterations in the primary olfactory (piriform) cortex were, however, demonstrated. Our results replicate and extend previous knowledge with findings of divergent morphological alterations in bilateral orbitofrontal cortex, indicating influences of different plastic processes and suggesting that a lifelong absence of sensory input does not necessarily lead to morphological alterations in primary sensory cortex.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/760603v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction: alpha-synuclein aggregates have been identified in the retina of Parkinson's disease patients associated to vision impairment. In this study, we sought to determine the effects of alpha-synuclein overexpression on the survival and function of dopaminergic (DA) amacrine cells in the retina. Methods: Adult mice were intravitreally injected with an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector to overexpress human wild-type alpha-synuclein in the inner retina. Following systemic injections of levodopa (L-DOPA), retinal responses and visual acuity driven behavior were measured by electroretinography (ERG) and water maze task, respectively. Amacrine cells and ganglion cells were counted at 1, 2 and 3 months post-injection. Results: alpha-synuclein led to an early loss of DA cells, which was associated with the decrease of light-adapted ERG responses and visual acuity. Systemic injections of L-DOPA rescued these retinal and visual abnormalities. Conclusions: The data show that alpha-synuclein affects dopamine neurons in the retina. The approach provides a novel accessible mode of modeling the underlying mechanisms implicated in synucleinophaties pathogenesis and for testing novel treatments.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Spike sorting is a standard preprocessing step to obtain ensembles of single unit data from multiunit, multichannel recordings. However, more recently, some researchers have started doing analyses directly on the unsorted data. Here we present a new computational model that is an extension of the standard (unsupervised) switching Poisson hidden Markov model (where observations are time-binned spike counts from each of N neurons), to a clusterless approximation in which we observe only a d-dimensional mark for each spike. Such an unsupervised yet clusterless approach has the potential to incorporate more information than is typically available from spike-sorted approaches, and to uncover temporal structure in neural data without access to behavioral correlates. We show that our approach can recover model parameters from simulated data, and that it can uncover task-relevant structure from real neural data.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/S86QKhfqMKs/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Amir Dezfouli, Bernard W. Balleine&lt;/p&gt;

State-space and action representations form the building blocks of decision-making processes in the brain; states map external cues to the current situation of the agent whereas actions provide the set of motor commands from which the agent can choose to achieve specific goals. Although these factors differ across environments, it is currently unknown whether or how accurately state and action representations are acquired by the agent because previous experiments have typically provided this information a priori through instruction or pre-training. Here we studied how state and action representations adapt to reflect the structure of the world when such a priori knowledge is not available. We used a sequential decision-making task in rats in which they were required to pass through multiple states before reaching the goal, and for which the number of states and how they map onto external cues were unknown a priori. We found that, early in training, animals selected actions as if the task was not sequential and outcomes were the immediate consequence of the most proximal action. During the course of training, however, rats recovered the true structure of the environment and made decisions based on the expanded state-space, reflecting the multiple stages of the task. Similarly, we found that the set of actions expanded with training, although the emergence of new action sequences was sensitive to the experimental parameters and specifics of the training procedure. We conclude that the profile of choices shows a gradual shift from simple representations to more complex structures compatible with the structure of the world.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/S86QKhfqMKs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Value-based decision-making involves trading off the cost associated with an action against its expected reward. Research has shown that both physical and mental effort constitute such subjective costs, biasing choices away from effortful actions, and discounting the value of obtained rewards. Facing conflicts between competing action alternatives is considered aversive, as recruiting cognitive control to overcome conflict is effortful. Moreover, engaging control to proactively suppress irrelevant information that could conflict with task-relevant information would presumably also be cognitively costly. Yet, it remains unclear whether the cognitive control demands involved in preventing and resolving conflict also constitute costs in value-based decisions. The present study investigated this question by embedding irrelevant distractors (flanker arrows) within a reversal-learning task, with intermixed free and instructed trials. Results showed that participants learned to adapt their free choices to maximize rewards, but were nevertheless biased to follow the suggestions of irrelevant distractors. Thus, the perceived cost of investing cognitive control to suppress an external suggestion could sometimes trump internal value representations. By adapting computational models of reinforcement learning, we assessed the influence of conflict at both the decision and learning stages. Modelling the decision showed that free choices were more biased when participants were less sure about which action was more rewarding. This supports the hypothesis that the costs linked to conflict management were traded off against expected rewards. During the learning phase, we found that learning rates were reduced in instructed, relative to free, choices. Learning rates were further reduced by conflict between an instruction and subjective action values, whereas learning was not robustly influenced by conflict between one’s actions and external distractors. Our results show that the subjective cognitive control costs linked to conflict factor into value-based decision-making, and highlight that different types of conflict may have different effects on learning about action outcomes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pJISSmHKN50&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Deciphering the mechanisms of regulation of metabolic networks subjected to perturbations, including disease states and drug-induced stress, relies on tracing metabolic fluxes. One of the most informative data to predict metabolic fluxes are &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C based metabolomics, which provide information about how carbons are redistributed along central carbon metabolism. Such data can be integrated using &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C Metabolic Flux Analysis (&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C MFA) to provide quantitative metabolic maps of flux distributions. However, &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C MFA might be unable to reduce the solution space towards a unique solution either in large metabolic networks or when small sets of measurements are integrated. Here we present parsimonious &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C MFA (p&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CMFA), an approach that runs a secondary optimization in the &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C MFA solution space to identify the solution that minimizes the total reaction flux. Furthermore, flux minimization can be weighted by gene expression measurements allowing seamless integration of gene expression data with &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C data. As proof of concept, we demonstrate how p&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CMFA can be used to estimate intracellular flux distributions from &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C measurements and transcriptomics data. We have implemented p&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CMFA in Iso2Flux, our in-house developed isotopic steady-state &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C MFA software.

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Adaptations during Maturation in an Identified Honeybee Interneuron Responsive to Waggle Dance Vibration Signals</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/5/ENEURO.0454-18.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Honeybees are social insects, and individual bees take on different social roles as they mature, performing a multitude of tasks that involve multi-modal sensory integration. Several activities vital for foraging, like flight and waggle dance communication, involve sensing air vibrations through their antennae. We investigated changes in the identified vibration-sensitive interneuron DL-Int-1 in the honeybee &lt;i&gt;Apis mellifera&lt;/i&gt; during maturation by comparing properties of neurons from newly emerged adult and forager honeybees. Although comparison of morphological reconstructions of the neurons revealed no significant changes in gross dendritic features, consistent and region-dependent changes were found in dendritic density. Comparison of electrophysiological properties showed an increase in the firing rate differences between stimulus and nonstimulus periods in foragers compared with newly emerged adult bees. The observed differences in neurons of foragers compared with newly emerged adult honeybees suggest refined connectivity, improved signal propagation, and enhancement of response features possibly important for the network processing of air vibration signals relevant for the waggle dance communication of honeybees.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02297</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Most information dynamics and statistical causal analysis frameworks rely on
the common intuition that causal interactions are intrinsically pairwise --
every 'cause' variable has an associated 'effect' variable, so that a 'causal
arrow' can be drawn between them. However, analyses that depict
interdependencies as directed graphs fail to discriminate the rich variety of
modes of information flow that can coexist within a system. This, in turn,
creates problems with attempts to operationalise the concepts of 'dynamical
complexity' or `integrated information.' To address this shortcoming, we
combine concepts of partial information decomposition and integrated
information, and obtain what we call Integrated Information Decomposition, or
$\Phi$ID. We show how $\Phi$ID paves the way for more detailed analyses of
interdependencies in multivariate time series, and sheds light on collective
modes of information dynamics that have not been reported before. Additionally,
$\Phi$ID reveals that what is typically referred to as 'integration' is
actually an aggregate of several heterogeneous phenomena. Furthermore, $\Phi$ID
can be used to formulate new, tailored measures of integrated information, as
well as to understand and alleviate the limitations of existing measures.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02295</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In primate brains, tactile and proprioceptive inputs are relayed to the
somatosensory cortex which is known for somatotopic representations, or,
&quot;homunculi&quot;. Our research centers on understanding the mechanisms of the
formation of these and more higher-level body representations (body schema) by
using humanoid robots and neural networks to construct models. We specifically
focus on how spatial representation of the body may be learned from
somatosensory information in self-touch configurations. In this work, we target
the representation of proprioceptive inputs, which we take to be joint angles
in the robot. The inputs collected in different body postures serve as inputs
to a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) with a 2D lattice on the output. With
unrestricted, all-to-all connections, the map is not capable of representing
the input space while preserving the topological relationships, because the
intrinsic dimensionality of the body posture space is too large. Hence, we use
a method we developed previously for tactile inputs (Hoffmann, Straka et al.
2018) called MRF-SOM, where the Maximum Receptive Field of output neurons is
restricted so they only learn to represent specific parts of the input space.
This is in line with the receptive fields of neurons in somatosensory areas
representing proprioception that often respond to combination of few joints
(e.g. wrist and elbow).

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The DSM-1 was published in 1952, contains 128 diagnostic categories,
described in 132 pages. The DSM-5 appeared in 2013, contains 541 diagnostic
categories, described in 947 pages. The field of psychology is characterised by
a steady proliferation of diagnostic models and subcategories, that seems to be
inspired by the principle of &quot;divide and inflate&quot;. This approach is in contrast
with experimental evidence, which suggests on one hand that traumas of various
kind are often present in the anamnesis of patients and, on the other, that the
gene variants implicated are shared across a wide range of diagnoses. In this
work I propose a holistic approach, built with tools borrowed from the field of
Artificial Intelligence. My model is based on two pillars. The first one is
trauma, which represents the attack to the mind, is psychological in nature and
has its origin in the environment. The second pillar is dissociation, which
represents the mind defence in both physiological and pathological conditions,
and incorporates all other defence mechanisms. Damages to dissociation can be
considered as another category of attacks, that are neurobiological in nature
and can be of genetic or environmental origin. They include, among other
factors, synaptic over-pruning, abuse of drugs and inflammation. These factors
concur to weaken the defence, represented by the neural networks that implement
the dissociation mechanism in the brain. The model is subsequently used to
interpret five mental conditions: PTSD, complex PTSD, dissociative identity
disorder, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Ideally, this is a first step
towards building a model that aims to explain a wider range of
psychopathological affections with a single theoretical framework. The last
part is dedicated to sketching a new psychotherapy for psychological trauma.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To understand the learning process in brains, biologically plausible
algorithms have been explored by modeling the detailed neuron properties and
dynamics. On the other hand, simplified multi-layer models of neural networks
have shown great success on computational tasks such as image classification
and speech recognition. However, the computational models that can achieve good
accuracy for these learning applications are very different from the
bio-plausible models. This paper studies whether a bio-plausible model of a in
vitro living neural network can be used to perform machine learning tasks and
achieve good inference accuracy. A novel two-layer bio-hardware hybrid neural
network is proposed. The biological layer faithfully models variations of
synapses, neurons, and network sparsity in in vitro living neural networks. The
hardware layer is a computational fully-connected layer that tunes parameters
to optimize for accuracy. Several techniques are proposed to improve the
inference accuracy of the proposed hybrid neural network. For instance, an
adaptive pre-processing technique helps the proposed neural network to achieve
good learning accuracy for different living neural network sparsity. The
proposed hybrid neural network with realistic neuron parameters and variations
achieves a 98.3% testing accuracy for the handwritten digit recognition task on
the full MNIST dataset.

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00209</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of focal epilepsy with about 30% of patients developing pharmacoresistance. These patients continue to suffer from seizures despite polytherapy with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and have an increased risk for premature death, thus requiring further efforts for the development of new antiepileptic therapies. The molecule dimethylethanolamine (DMEA) has been tested as a potential treatment in various neurological diseases, albeit the functional mechanism of action was never fully understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of DMEA on neuronal activity in single-cell recordings of primary neuronal cultures. DMEA decreased the frequency of spontaneous synaptic events in a concentration-dependent manner with no apparent effect on resting membrane potential (RMP) or action potential (AP) threshold. We further tested whether DMEA can exert antiepileptic effects in human brain tissue ex vivo. We analyzed the effect of DMEA on epileptiform activity in the CA1 region of the resected hippocampus of TLE patients in vitro by recording extracellular field potentials in the pyramidal cell layer. Epileptiform burst activity in resected hippocampal tissue from TLE patients remained stable over several hours and was pharmacologically suppressed by lacosamide, demonstrating the applicability of our platform to test antiepileptic efficacy. Similar to lacosamide, DMEA also suppressed epileptiform activity in the majority of samples, albeit with variable interindividual effects. In conclusion, DMEA might present a new approach for treatment in pharmacoresistant TLE and further studies will be required to identify its exact mechanism of action and the involved molecular targets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Years of research have added to our understanding of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). None-the-less there is still much that is poorly understood. There is a need for, and ongoing interest in, developing a deeper understanding of this disorder to optimally identify risk and better inform treatment. Here, we present a compilation of findings examining ADHD both behaviorally and using neurophysiologic markers. Drawing on early work of McIntosh and co-investigators, we examined response to sensory challenge in children with ADHD, measuring HPA activity and electrodermal response (EDR) secondary to sensory stressors. In addition, we have examined the relationship between these physiologic measures, and reports of behavioral sensory over-responsivity and anxiety. Findings suggest that sensory responsivity differentiates among children with ADHD and warrants consideration. We link these findings with research conducted both prior to and after our own work and emphasize that there a growing knowledge supporting a relationship between ADHD and sensory over-responsivity, but more research is needed. Given the call from the National Institute of Health to move toward a more dimensional diagnostic process for mental health concerns, and away from the more routine categorical diagnostic process, we suggest sensory over-responsivity as a dimension in the diagnostic process for children with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

It has been widely recognized that the myelin sheath accelerates axon signal conduction and provides neuroprotection. Recent studies have begun to reveal its role in plasticity. The major mechanism that enables this process is activity-dependent myelination – the phenomenon where neuronal activity supports oligodendrocyte maturation and myelin sheath formation. In light of recent discoveries, a better understanding of this phenomenon has a potential to provide therapeutic targets for not only demyelinating diseases, but also psychiatric disorders. There is a growing need for experimental platforms capable of dissecting the effect of neural activity on myelination in health and disease. The effect of neural activity is commonly studied by comparing the myelination levels in cultures with neurons of low and high activity. Electrical stimulation is particularly well suited as a method of inducing neural activity in these systems. In this review, we describe in vitro platforms for studying activity-dependent myelination, which utilize neuron stimulation via electrical field. We also discuss stimulation profiles, as well as the alternatives to electrical stimulation in the context of regular, compartmentalized, and organotypic co-cultures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is a major neurological disorder characterized by repeated seizures afflicting 1% of the global population. The emergence of seizures is associated with several comorbidities and severely decreases the quality of life of patients. Unfortunately, around 30% of patients do not respond to first-line treatment using anti-seizure drugs (ASDs). Furthermore, it is still unclear how seizures arise in the healthy brain. Therefore, it is critical to have well developed models where a causal understanding of epilepsy can be investigated. While the development of seizures has been studied in several animal models, using chemical or electrical induction, deciphering the results of such studies has been difficult due to the uncertainty of the cell population being targeted as well as potential confounds such as brain damage from the procedure itself. Here we describe novel approaches using combinations of optical and genetic methods for studying epileptogenesis. These approaches can circumvent some shortcomings associated with the classical animal models and may thus increase the likelihood of developing new treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are incurable neurodegenerative conditions. A non-coding hexanucleotide (GGGGCC) repeat expansion in the c9orf72 gene is the most common genetic cause of ALS/FTD. We present a cellular model of c9ALS/FTD where induced neurons (iNeurons) are generated within 2 weeks by direct conversion of patients‘ dermal fibroblasts through down-regulation of polypyrimidine-tract-binding protein 1 (PTB1). While sense (S) and anti-sense (AS) intranuclear RNA foci were observed in both fibroblasts and iNeurons, the accumulation of (S) and (AS) repeat-associated non-ATG translation (RANT) products were detected only in iNeurons. Importantly, anti-sense oligonucleotides (ASOs) against the (S) repeat transcript lead to decreased (S) RNA foci staining and a reduction of the corresponding RANT products without affecting its (AS) counterparts. ASOs treatment also rescued the cell viability upon stressful stimulus. The results indicate that iNeurons is an advantageous model that not only recapitulates c9ALS/FTD hallmark features but can also help uncover promising therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Optogenetics provide a potential alternative approach to the treatment of chronic pain, in which complex pathology often hampers efficacy of standard pharmacological approaches. Technological advancements in the development of thin, wireless, and mechanically flexible optoelectronic implants offer new routes to control the activity of subsets of neurons and nerve fibers in vivo. This study reports a novel and advanced design of battery-free, flexible, and lightweight devices equipped with one or two miniaturized LEDs, which can be individually controlled in real time. Two proof-of-concept experiments in mice demonstrate the feasibility of these devices. First, we show that blue-light devices implanted on top of the lumbar spinal cord can excite channelrhodopsin expressing nociceptors to induce place aversion. Second, we show that nocifensive withdrawal responses can be suppressed by green-light optogenetic (Archaerhodopsin-mediated) inhibition of action potential propagation along the sciatic nerve. One salient feature of these devices is that they can be operated via modern tablets and smartphones without bulky and complex lab instrumentation. In addition to the optical stimulation, the design enables the simultaneously wireless recording of the temperature in proximity of the stimulation area. As such, these devices are primed for translation to human patients with implications in the treatment of neurological and psychiatric conditions far beyond chronic pain syndromes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Evaluation of Neural Degeneration Biomarkers in the Prefrontal Cortex for Early Identification of Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment: An fNIRS Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00317</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a condition characterizing poor cognition, is associated with aging and depicts early symptoms of severe cognitive impairment, known as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Meanwhile, early detection of MCI can prevent progression to AD. A great deal of research has been performed in the past decade on MCI detection. However, availability of biomarkers for MCI detection requires greater attention. In our study, we evaluated putative and reliable biomarkers for diagnosing MCI by performing different mental tasks (i.e., N-back task, Stroop task, and verbal fluency task) using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals on a group of 15 MCI patients and 9 healthy control (HC). The 15 digital biomarkers (i.e., five means, seven slopes, peak, skewness, and kurtosis) and two image biomarkers (t-map, correlation map) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) (i.e., left PFC, middle PFC, and right PFC) between the MCI and HC groups were investigated by the statistical analysis, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and convolutional neural network (CNN) individually. The results reveal that the statistical analysis using digital biomarkers (with a p-value &amp;lt; 0.05) could not distinguish the MCI patients from the HC over 60% accuracy. Therefore, the current statistical analysis needs to be improved to be used for diagnosing the MCI patients. The best accuracy with LDA was 76.67% with the N-back and Stroop tasks. However, the CNN classification results trained by image biomarkers showed a high accuracy. In particular, the CNN results trained via t-maps revealed the best accuracy (90.62%) with the N-back task, whereas the CNN result trained by the correlation maps was 85.58% with the N-back task. Also, the results illustrated that investigating the sub-regions (i.e., right, middle, left) of the PFC for detecting MCI would be better than examining the whole PFC. The t-map (or/and the correlation map) is conclusively recommended as an image biomarker for early detection of AD. The combination of CNN and image biomarkers can provide a reliable clinical tool for diagnosing MCI patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Adaptation to Laterally Asymmetrical Visuomotor Delay Has an Effect on Action But Not on Perception</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00312</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When interacting with the environment, the sensorimotor system faces temporal and spatial discrepancies between sensory inputs, such as delay in sensory information transmission, and asymmetrical visual inputs across space. These discrepancies can affect motor control and the representation of space. We recently showed that adaptation to a laterally asymmetric delay in the visual feedback induces neglect-like effects in blind drawing movements, expressed by asymmetrical elongation of circles that are drawn in different workspaces and directions; this establishes a possible connection between delayed feedback and asymmetrical spatial processing in the control of action. In the current study, we investigate whether such adaptation also influences visual perception. In addition, we examined transfer to another motor task – a line bisection task that is commonly used to detect spatial disorders, and extend these results to examine the mapping of these neglect-like effects. We performed two sets of experiments in which participants executed lateral reaching movements, and were exposed to visual feedback delay only in the left workspace. We examined transfer of adaptation to a perceptual line bisection task – answers about the perceived midline of lines that were presented in different directions and workspaces, and to a blind motor line bisection task – reaching movements toward the centers of similar lines. We found that the adaptation to the asymmetrical delay transferred to the control of lateral movements, but did not affect the perceived location of the midlines. Our results clarify the effect of asymmetrical delayed visual feedback on perception and action, and provide potential insights on the link between visuomotor delay and neurological disorders such as the hemispatial neglect syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: How Neurophysiological Measures Can be Used to Enhance the Evaluation of Remote Tower Solutions</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00303</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;New solutions in operational environments are often, among objective measurements, evaluated by using subjective assessment and judgment from experts. Anyhow, it has been demonstrated that subjective measures suffer from poor resolution due to a high intra and inter-operator variability. Also, performance measures, if available, could provide just partial information, since an operator could achieve the same performance but experiencing a different workload. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate: (i) the higher resolution of neurophysiological measures in comparison to subjective ones; and (ii) how the simultaneous employment of neurophysiological measures and behavioral ones could allow a holistic assessment of operational tools. In this regard, we tested the effectiveness of an electroencephalography (EEG)-based neurophysiological index (W&lt;sub&gt;EEG&lt;/sub&gt; index) in comparing two different solutions (i.e., Normal and Augmented) in terms of experienced workload. In this regard, 16 professional air traffic controllers (ATCOs) have been asked to perform two operational scenarios. Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) has also been recorded to evaluate the level of arousal (i.e., operator involvement) during the two scenarios execution. NASA-TLX questionnaire has been used to evaluate the perceived workload, and an expert was asked to assess performance achieved by the ATCOs. Finally, reaction times on specific operational events relevant for the assessment of the two solutions, have also been collected. Results highlighted that the Augmented solution induced a local increase in subjects performance (Reaction times). At the same time, this solution induced an increase in the workload experienced by the participants (W&lt;sub&gt;EEG&lt;/sub&gt;). Anyhow, this increase is still acceptable, since it did not negatively impact the performance and has to be intended only as a consequence of the higher engagement of the ATCOs. This behavioral effect is totally in line with physiological results obtained in terms of arousal (GSR), that increased during the scenario with augmentation. Subjective measures (NASA-TLX) did not highlight any significant variation in perceived workload. These results suggest that neurophysiological measure provide additional information than behavioral and subjective ones, even at a level of few seconds, and its employment during the pre-operational activities (e.g., design process) could allow a more holistic and accurate evaluation of new solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Simultaneous EEG-NIRS Measurement of the Inferior Parietal Lobule During a Reaching Task With Delayed Visual Feedback</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00301</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We investigated whether the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) responds in real-time to multisensory inconsistency during movement. The IPL is thought to be involved in both the detection of inconsistencies in multisensory information obtained during movement and that obtained during self-other discrimination. However, because of the limited temporal resolution of conventional neuroimaging techniques, it is difficult to distinguish IPL activity during movement from that during self-other discrimination. We simultaneously conducted electroencephalography (EEG) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) with the goal of examining IPL activity with a high spatiotemporal resolution during single reaching movements. Under a visual feedback-delay condition, gamma event-related synchronization (γ-ERS), i.e., an increase in gamma (31–47 Hz) EEG power occurred during reaching movements. This γ-ERS is considered to reflect processing of information about prediction errors. To integrate this temporal information with spatial information from the NIRS signals, we developed a new analysis technique that enabled estimation of the regions that show a hemodynamic response characterized by EEG fluctuation present in the visual feedback-delay condition. As a result, IPL activity was explained by γ-ERS specific to visual feedback delay during movements. Thus, we succeeded in demonstrating real-time activation of the IPL in response to multisensory inconsistency. However, we did not find any correlation between either IPL activity or γ-ERS with the sense of agency. Therefore, our results suggest that while the IPL is influenced by prediction error signals, it does not engage in direct processing underlying the conscious experience of making a movement, which is the foundation of self-other discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Over Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex Modulates Risk-Attitude in Motor Decision-Making</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00297</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Humans often face situations requiring a decision about where to throw an object or when to respond to a stimulus under risk. Several behavioral studies have shown that such motor decisions can be suboptimal, which results from a cognitive bias toward risk-seeking behavior. However, brain regions involved in risk-attitude of motor decision-making remain unclear. Here, we investigated the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in risky motor decisions using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). The experiment comprised a selective timing task requiring participants to make a continuous decision about the timing of their response under the risk of no rewards. The participants performed this task twice in a day: before and while receiving either anodal stimulation over the right DLPFC with cathodal stimulation over the left DLPFC (20 min, 2 mA), cathodal stimulation over the right DLPFC with anodal stimulation over the left DLPFC, or sham stimulation. In line with previous studies, their strategies before the stimulation were biased toward risk-seeking. During anodal stimulation over right DLPFC with cathodal stimulation over left DLPFC, participants showed a more conservative strategy to avoid the risk of no rewards. The additional experiment confirmed that tDCS did not affect the ability of timing control regarding the time intervals at which they aimed to respond. These results suggest a potential role for the DLPFC in modulating action selection in motor decision-making under risk.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Brain–Computer Interface-Based Adaptive Automation to Prevent Out-Of-The-Loop Phenomenon in Air Traffic Controllers Dealing With Highly Automated Systems</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00296</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Increasing the level of automation in air traffic management is seen as a measure to increase the performance of the service to satisfy the predicted future demand. This is expected to result in new roles for the human operator: he will mainly monitor highly automated systems and seldom intervene. Therefore, air traffic controllers (ATCos) would often work in a supervisory or control mode rather than in a direct operating mode. However, it has been demonstrated how human operators in such a role are affected by human performance issues, known as Out-Of-The-Loop (OOTL) phenomenon, consisting in lack of attention, loss of situational awareness and de-skilling. A countermeasure to this phenomenon has been identified in the adaptive automation (AA), i.e., a system able to allocate the operative tasks to the machine or to the operator depending on their needs. In this context, psychophysiological measures have been highlighted as powerful tool to provide a reliable, unobtrusive and real-time assessment of the ATCo’s mental state to be used as control logic for AA-based systems. In this paper, it is presented the so-called “Vigilance and Attention Controller”, a system based on electroencephalography (EEG) and eye-tracking (ET) techniques, aimed to assess in real time the vigilance level of an ATCo dealing with a highly automated human–machine interface and to use this measure to adapt the level of automation of the interface itself. The system has been tested on 14 professional ATCos performing two highly realistic scenarios, one with the system disabled and one with the system enabled. The results confirmed that (i) long high automated tasks induce vigilance decreasing and OOTL-related phenomena; (ii) EEG measures are sensitive to these kinds of mental impairments; and (iii) AA was able to counteract this negative effect by keeping the ATCo more involved within the operative task. The results were confirmed by EEG and ET measures as well as by performance and subjective ones, providing a clear example of potential applications and related benefits of AA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a potentially novel strategy for cognitive enhancement in patients with mild or major neurocognitive disorders. This study aims to assess the safety and efficacy of tDCS during cognitive training on cognitive functioning in patients with mild or major neurocognitive disorders.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;This study was primarily a single arm for safety, secondary a two-arm, parallel, randomized, and sham-controlled trial for potential efficacy. Patients with mild or major neurocognitive disorders were recruited. The participants and raters were blinded to the group assignment. The participants in the active arm received tDCS (anodal; F3, cathodal, Fp2, 2A, 20 min) twice daily for five consecutive days, whereas those in the sham arm received the same amount of sham-tDCS. Calculation and reading tasks were conducted in both arms as a form of cognitive intervention for 20 min during tDCS. The primary outcome was the attrition rate during the trial in the active arm, which is expected to be less than 10%. The secondary outcomes were the between-group differences of adjusted means for several cognitive scales from baseline to post-intervention and follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Twenty patients [nine women (45%)], with a mean (standard deviation) age of 76.1 years participated; nine patients (45%) with minor neurocognitive disorders and 11 (55%) with major neurocognitive disorders were randomized, and 19 of them completed the trial. The attrition rate in the active arm was 0%, with no serious adverse events. Further, in the Intention-to-Treat analysis, patients in the active arm showed no statistically significant improvement compared with those who received the sham in the mean change scores of the mini-mental state examination [0.41; 95% CI (−1.85; 2.67) at day five, 1.08; 95% CI (−1.31; 3.46) at follow-up] and Alzheimer’s disease assessment scale – cognition subscale [1.61; 95% CI (−4.2; 0.98) at day 5, 0.36; 95%CI (−3.19; 2.47) at follow-up].&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that tDCS is safe and tolerable but causes no statistically significant cognitive effects in patients with mild or major neurocognitive disorders. Additional large-scale, well-designed clinical trials are warranted to evaluate the cognitive effects of tDCS as an augmentation to cognitive training.&lt;/p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration&lt;p&gt;www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT03050385.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00062</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Metastability refers to the fact that the state of a dynamical system spends a large amount of time in a restricted region of its available phase space before a transition takes place, bringing the system into another state from where it might recur into the previous one. beim Graben and Hutt (2013) suggested to use the recurrence plot (RP) technique introduced by Eckmann et al. (1987) for the segmentation of system's trajectories into metastable states using recurrence grammars. Here, we apply this recurrence structure analysis (RSA) for the first time to resting-state brain dynamics obtained from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Brain regions are defined according to the brain hierarchical atlas (BHA) developed by Diez et al. (2015), and as a consequence, regions present high-connectivity in both structure (obtained from diffusion tensor imaging) and function (from the blood-level dependent-oxygenation—BOLD—signal). Remarkably, regions observed by Diez et al. were completely time-invariant. Here, in order to compare this static picture with the metastable systems dynamics obtained from the RSA segmentation, we determine the number of metastable states as a measure of complexity for all subjects and for region numbers varying from 3 to 100. We find RSA convergence toward an optimal segmentation of 40 metastable states for normalized BOLD signals, averaged over BHA modules. Next, we build a bistable dynamics at population level by pooling 30 subjects after Hausdorff clustering. In link with this finding, we reflect on the different modeling frameworks that can allow for such scenarios: heteroclinic dynamics, dynamics with riddled basins of attraction, multiple-timescale dynamics. Finally, we characterize the metastable states both functionally and structurally, using templates for resting state networks (RSNs) and the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dysregulation of various APP trafficking components in the endosome has been previously implicated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Although single nucleotide polymorphisms within the gene locus encoding the endosomal component, SNX8 have been previously associated with AD, how SNX8 levels are altered and its contribution to AD onset is currently unknown. Here, we observe decreased expression of SNX8 in human AD and AD mouse brain. SNX8 predominantly localized to early and late endosomes, where SNX8 overexpression enhanced total APP levels, cell surface APP distribution and consequent soluble APPα cleavage. SNX8 depletion resulted in elevated β-amyloid (Aβ) levels, while SNX8 overexpression reduced Aβ levels in cells and in an APP/PS1 AD mouse model. Importantly, SNX8 overexpression rescued cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 mice. Together, these results implicate a neuroprotective role for SNX8 in enhancing non-amyloidogenic APP trafficking and processing pathways. Given that endosomal dysfunction is an early event in AD, restoration of dysfunctional endosomal components such as SNX8 may be beneficial in future therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Excitability Tuning of Axons by Afterdepolarization</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00407</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The axon provides a sole output of the neuron which propagates action potentials reliably to the axon terminal and transmits neuronal information to the postsynaptic neuron across the synapse. A classical view of neuronal signaling is based on these two processes, namely binary (all or none) signaling along the axon and graded (tunable) signaling at the synapse. Recent studies, however, have revealed that the excitability of the axon is subject to dynamic tuning for a short period after axonal action potentials. This was first described as post-spike hyperexcitability, as measured by the changes in stimulus threshold for a short period after an action potential. Later on, direct recordings from central nervous system (CNS) axons or axon terminals using subcellular patch-clamp recording showed that axonal spikes are often followed by afterdepolarization (ADP) lasting for several tens of milliseconds and has been suggested to mediate post-spike hyperexcitability. In this review article, I focused on the mechanisms as well as the functional significance of ADP in fine-scale modulation of axonal spike signaling in the CNS, with special reference to hippocampal mossy fibers, one of the best-studied CNS axons. As a common basic mechanism underlying axonal ADP, passive propagation by the capacitive discharge of the axonal membrane as well as voltage-dependent K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductance underlies the generation of ADP. Small but prolonged axonal ADP lasting for several tens of milliseconds may influence the subsequent action potential and transmitter release from the axon terminals. Both duration and amplitude of axonal spike are subject to such modulation by preceding action potential-ADP sequence, deviating from the conventional assumption of digital nature of axonal spike signaling. Impact on the transmitter release is also discussed in the context of axonal spike plasticity. Axonal spike is subject to dynamic control on a fine-scale and thereby contributes to the short-term plasticity at the synapse.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Over the last years, sophisticated patch-clamp investigations have provided unexpected and exciting data on axonal phenomena and functioning, but there is still a need for methods to investigate full axonal arbors at sufficient throughput. Here, we present a new method for the simultaneous mapping of the axonal arbors of a large number of individual neurons, which relies on their extracellular signals that have been recorded with high-density microelectrode arrays (HD-MEAs). The segmentation of axons was performed based on the local correlation of extracellular signals. Comparison of the results with both, ground truth and receiver operator characteristics, shows that the new segmentation method outperforms previously used methods. Using a standard HD-MEA, we mapped the axonal arbors of 68 neurons in &amp;lt;6 h. The fully automated method can be extended to new generations of HD-MEAs with larger data output and is estimated to provide data of axonal arbors of thousands of neurons within recording sessions of a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Unique Features of Network Bursts Emerge From the Complex Interplay of Excitatory and Inhibitory Receptors in Rat Neocortical Networks</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00377</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spontaneous network activity plays a fundamental role in the formation of functional networks during early development. The landmark of this activity is the recurrent emergence of intensive time-limited network bursts (NBs) rapidly spreading across the entire dissociated culture in vitro. The main excitatory mediators of NBs are glutamatergic alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) and N-Methyl-D-aspartic-acid receptors (NMDARs) that express fast and slow ion channel kinetics, respectively. The fast inhibition of the activity is mediated through gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Rs). Although the AMPAR, NMDAR and GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R kinetics have been biophysically characterized in detail at the monosynaptic level in a variety of brain areas, the unique features of NBs emerging from the kinetics and the complex interplay of these receptors are not well understood. The goal of this study is to analyze the contribution of fast GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Rs on AMPAR- and NMDAR- mediated spontaneous NB activity in dissociated neonatal rat cortical cultures at 3 weeks in vitro. The networks were probed by both acute and gradual application of each excitatory receptor antagonist and combinations of acute excitatory and inhibitory receptor antagonists. At the same time, the extracellular network-wide activity was recorded with microelectrode arrays (MEAs). We analyzed the characteristic NB measures extracted from NB rate profiles and the distributions of interspike intervals, interburst intervals, and electrode recruitment time as well as the similarity of spatio-temporal patterns of network activity under different receptor antagonists. We show that NBs were rapidly initiated and recruited as well as diversely propagated by AMPARs and temporally and spatially maintained by NMDARs. GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Rs reduced the spiking frequency in AMPAR-mediated networks and dampened the termination of NBs in NMDAR-mediated networks as well as slowed down the recruitment of activity in all networks. Finally, we show characteristic super bursts composed of slow NBs with highly repetitive spatio-temporal patterns in gradually AMPAR blocked networks. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to unravel in detail how the three main mediators of synaptic transmission uniquely shape the NB characteristics, such as the initiation, maintenance, recruitment and termination of NBs in cortical cell cultures in vitro.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Accelerated Ovarian Failure as a Unique Model to Study Peri-Menopause Influence on Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00242</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Despite decades of extensive research efforts, efficacious therapies for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are lacking. The multi-factorial nature of AD neuropathology and symptomatology has taught us that a single therapeutic approach will most likely not fit all. Women constitute ~70% of the affected AD population, and pathology and rate of symptoms progression are 2–3 times higher in women than men. Epidemiological data suggest that menopausal estrogen loss may be causative of the more severe symptoms observed in AD women, however, results from clinical trials employing estrogen replacement therapy are inconsistent. AD pathological hallmarks—amyloid β (Aβ), neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and chronic gliosis—are laid down during a 20-year prodromal period before clinical symptoms appear, which coincides with the menopause transition (peri-menopause) in women (~45–54-years-old). Peri-menopause is marked by widely fluctuating estrogen levels resulting in periods of irregular hormone-receptor interactions. Recent studies showed that peri-menopausal women have increased indicators of AD phenotype (brain Aβ deposition and hypometabolism), and peri-menopausal women who used hormone replacement therapy (HRT) had a reduced AD risk. This suggests that neuroendocrine changes during peri-menopause may be a trigger that increases risk of AD in women. Studies on sex differences have been performed in several AD rodent models over the years. However, it has been challenging to study the menopause influence on AD due to lack of optimal models that mimic the human process. Recently, the rodent model of accelerated ovarian failure (AOF) was developed, which uniquely recapitulates human menopause, including a transitional peri-AOF period with irregular estrogen fluctuations and a post-AOF stage with low estrogen levels. This model has proven useful in hypertension and cognition studies with wild type animals. This review article will highlight the molecular mechanisms by which peri-menopause may influence the female brain vulnerability to AD and AD risk factors, such as hypertension and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. Studies on these biological mechanisms together with the use of the AOF model have the potential to shed light on key molecular pathways underlying AD pathogenesis for the development of precision medicine approaches that take sex and hormonal status into account.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Involvement of Peripheral and Brain Insulin Resistance in Late Onset Alzheimer’s Dementia</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00236</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a severe sociological and clinical problem. Since it was first described, there has been a constant increase in its incidence and, for now, there are no effective treatments since current approved medications have only shown short-term symptomatic benefits. Therefore, it is imperative to increase efforts in the search for molecules and non-pharmacological strategies that are capable of slowing or stopping the progress of the disease and, ideally, to reverse it. The amyloid cascade hypothesis based on the fundamental role of amyloid has been the central hypothesis in the last 30 years. However, since amyloid-directed treatments have shown no relevant beneficial results other theories have been postulated to explain the origin of the pathology. The brain is a highly metabolically active energy-consuming tissue in the human body. It has an almost complete dependence on the metabolism of glucose and uses most of its energy for synaptic transmission. Thus, alterations on the utilization or availability of glucose may be cause for the appearance of neurodegenerative pathologies like AD. In this review article, the hypothesis known as Type 3 Diabetes (T3D) will be evaluated by summarizing some of the data that has been reported in recent years. According to published research, the adherence over time to low saturated fatty acids diets in the context of the Mediterranean diet would reduce the inflammatory levels in brain, with a decrease in the pro-inflammatory glial activation and mitochondrial oxidative stress. In this situation, the insulin receptor pathway would be able to fine tune the mitochondrial biogenesis in neuronal cells, regulation the adenosine triphosphate/adenosine diphosphate intracellular balance, and becoming a key factor involved in the preservation of the synaptic connexions and neuronal plasticity. In addition, new targets and strategies for the treatment of AD will be considered in this review for their potential as new pharmacological or non-pharmacological approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;To examine the prospective association between blood biomarkers of immune functioning (i.e., innate immune activation, adaptive immunity, and inflammation) and subsequent cognitive decline and clinical progression to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in cognitively normal individuals.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The BIOCARD study is an observational cohort study of N = 191 initially cognitively healthy participants (mean age 65.2 years). Blood plasma samples were assayed for markers of chronic inflammation (TNFR1, IL-6), adaptive immunity (CD25), and innate immune activation (CD14 and CD163). Participants were followed annually for ongoing clinical assessment and cognitive testing for up to 7.3 years. Primary study outcomes were progression to MCI and cognitive change over time, as measured by a global factor score encompassing multiple cognitive domains.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Higher levels of plasma TNFR1 were associated with greater risk of progression from normal cognition to MCI (HR: 3.27; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.27, 8.40). Elevated levels of TNFR1 were also associated with steeper rate of cognitive decline on follow-up but not with baseline cognitive performance. Baseline IL-6 levels and markers of innate and adaptive immune activation showed no relationship with MCI risk or cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Inflammation, mediated by TNF signaling, may play a selective role in the early phase of AD. Accordingly, plasma TNFR1 may facilitate improved prediction of disease progression for individuals in the preclinical stage of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/49995</link>
	<content:encoded>Cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical loops are largely conceived as parallel circuits that process limbic, associative, and sensorimotor information separately. Whether and how these functionally distinct loops interact remains unclear. Combining genetic and viral approaches, we systemically mapped the limbic and motor cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical loops in rodents. Despite largely closed loops within each functional domain, we discovered a unidirectional influence of the limbic over the motor loop via ventral striatum-substantia nigra (SNr)-motor thalamus circuitry. Slice electrophysiology verifies that the projection from ventral striatum functionally inhibits nigro-thalamic SNr neurons. In vivo optogenetic stimulation of ventral or dorsolateral striatum to SNr pathway modulates activity in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and motor cortex (M1), respectively. However, whereas the dorsolateral striatum-SNr pathway exerts little impact on mPFC, activation of the ventral striatum-SNr pathway effectively alters M1 activity. These results demonstrate an open cortico-basal ganglia loop whereby limbic information could modulate motor output through ventral striatum control of M1.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Voltage-gated potassium channels (K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;s) are gated by transmembrane voltage sensors (VS) that move in response to changes in membrane voltage. K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;10.1 or Eag1 also has three intracellular domains: PAS, C-linker, and CNBHD. We demonstrate that the Eag1 intracellular domains are not required for voltage-dependent gating but likely interact with the VS to modulate gating. We identified specific interactions between the PAS, CNBHD, and VS that modulate voltage-dependent gating and provide evidence that VS movement destabilizes these interactions to promote channel opening. Additionally, mutation of these interactions renders Eag1 insensitive to calmodulin inhibition. The structure of the calmodulin insensitive mutant in a pre-open conformation suggests that channel opening may occur through a rotation of the intracellular domains and calmodulin may prevent this rotation by stabilizing interactions between the VS and intracellular domains. Intracellular domains likely play a similar modulatory role in voltage-dependent gating of the related K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;11-12 channels.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/48702</link>
	<content:encoded>Rhythmic events recruit neuronal activity in the basal ganglia and cerebellum, but their roles remain elusive. In monkeys attempting to detect a single omission of isochronous visual stimulus, we found that neurons in the caudate nucleus showed increased activity for each stimulus in sequence, while those in the cerebellar dentate nucleus showed decreased activity. Firing modulation in the majority of caudate neurons and all cerebellar neurons was proportional to the stimulus interval, but a quarter of caudate neurons displayed a clear duration tuning. Furthermore, the time course of population activity in the cerebellum well predicted stimulus timing, whereas that in the caudate reflected stochastic variation of response latency. Electrical stimulation to the respective recording sites confirmed a causal role in the detection of stimulus omission. These results suggest that striatal neurons might represent periodic response preparation while cerebellar nuclear neurons may play a role in temporal prediction of periodic events.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/48627</link>
	<content:encoded>In eukaryotes, the organization and function of the microtubule cytoskeleton depend on the allocation of different roles to individual microtubules. For example, many asymmetrically dividing cells differentially specify microtubule behavior at old and new centrosomes. Here we show that yeast spindle pole bodies (SPBs, yeast centrosomes) differentially control the plus-end dynamics and cargoes of their astral microtubules, remotely from the minus-end. The old SPB recruits the kinesin motor protein Kip2, which then translocates to the plus-end of the emanating microtubules, promotes their extension and delivers dynein into the bud. Kip2 recruitment at the SPB depends on Bub2 and Bfa1, and phosphorylation of cytoplasmic Kip2 prevents random lattice binding. Releasing Kip2 of its control by SPBs equalizes its distribution, the length of microtubules and dynein distribution between the mother cell and its bud. These observations reveal that microtubule organizing centers use minus to plus-end directed remote control to individualize microtubule function.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/42951</link>
	<content:encoded>Regulators of G-protein Signaling are a conserved family of proteins required in various biological processes including cell differentiation. We previously demonstrated that Rgs12 is essential for osteoclast differentiation and its deletion in vivo protected mice against pathological bone loss. To characterize its mechanism in osteoclastogenesis, we selectively deleted Rgs12 in C57BL/6J mice targeting osteoclast precursors using &lt;i&gt;LyzM&lt;/i&gt;-driven Cre mice or overexpressed Rgs12 in RAW264.7 cells. Rgs12 deletion in vivo led to an osteopetrotic phenotype evidenced by increased trabecular bone, decreased osteoclast number and activity but no change in osteoblast number and bone formation. Rgs12 overexpression increased osteoclast number and size, and bone resorption activity. Proteomics analysis of Rgs12-depleted osteoclasts identified an upregulation of antioxidant enzymes under the transcriptional regulation of Nrf2, the master regulator of oxidative stress. We confirmed an increase of Nrf2 activity and impaired reactive oxygen species production in Rgs12-deficient cells. Conversely, Rgs12 overexpression suppressed Nrf2 through a mechanism dependent on the 26S proteasome, and promoted RANKL-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and NFκB, which was abrogated by antioxidant treatment. Our study therefore identified a novel role of Rgs12 in regulating Nrf2, thereby controlling cellular redox state and osteoclast differentiation.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Tingyu Ming, Bowen Jin, Jialei Song, Haoxiang Luo, Ruxu Du, Yang Ding&lt;/p&gt;

How muscles are used is a key to understanding the internal driving of fish swimming. However, the underlying mechanisms of some features of the muscle activation patterns and their differential appearance in different species are still obscure. In this study, we explain the muscle activation patterns by using 3D computational fluid dynamics models coupled to the motion of fish with prescribed deformation and examining the torque and power required along the fish body with two primary swimming modes. We find that the torque required by the hydrodynamic forces and body inertia exhibits a wave pattern that travels faster than the curvature wave in both anguilliform and carangiform swimmers, which can explain the traveling wave speeds of the muscle activations. Notably, intermittent negative power (i.e., power delivered by the fluid to the body) on the posterior part, along with a timely transfer of torque and energy by tendons, explains the decrease in the duration of muscle activation towards the tail. The torque contribution from the body elasticity further clarifies the wave speed increase or the reverse of the wave direction of the muscle activation on the posterior part of a carangiform swimmer. For anguilliform swimmers, the absence of the aforementioned changes in the muscle activation on the posterior part is consistent with our torque prediction and the absence of long tendons from experimental observations. These results provide novel insights into the functions of muscles and tendons as an integral part of the internal driving system, especially from an energy perspective, and they highlight the differences in the internal driving systems between the two primary swimming modes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/A2T-f6QuEvU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/5/ENEURO.0506-18.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;How experience causes long-lasting changes in the brain is a central question in neuroscience. The common view is that synaptic function is altered by experience to change brain circuit functions that underlie conditioned behavior. We examined hippocampus synaptic circuit function &lt;i&gt;in vivo,&lt;/i&gt; in three groups of animals, to assess the impact of experience on hippocampus function in rats. The &quot;conditioned&quot; group acquired a shock-conditioned place response during a cognitively-challenging, hippocampus synaptic plasticity-dependent task. The no-shock group had similar exposure to the environmental conditions but no conditioning. The home-cage group was experimentally naive. After the one-week retention test, under anesthesia, we stimulated the perforant path inputs to CA1, which terminate in stratum lacunosum moleculare (slm), and to the dentate gyrus (DG), which terminate in the molecular layer. We find synaptic compartment specific changes that differ amongst the groups. The evoked field EPSP (fEPSP) and pre-spike field response are enhanced only at the DG input layer and only in conditioned animals. The DG responses, measured by the population spiking activity and post-spike responses, are enhanced in both the conditioned and no-shock groups compared to home-cage animals. These changes are pathway specific because no differences are observed in slm of CA1. These findings demonstrate long-term, experience-dependent, pathway-specific alterations to synaptic circuit function of the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Bursts with High and Low Load of Epileptiform Spikes Show Context-Dependent Correlations in Epileptic Mice</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/5/ENEURO.0299-18.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hypersynchronous network activity is the defining hallmark of epilepsy and manifests in a wide spectrum of phenomena, of which electrographic activity during seizures is only one extreme. The aim of this study was to differentiate between different types of epileptiform activity (EA) patterns and investigate their temporal succession and interactions. We analyzed local field potentials (LFPs) from freely behaving male mice that had received an intrahippocampal kainate injection to model mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). Epileptiform spikes occurred in distinct bursts. Using machine learning, we derived a scale reflecting the spike load of bursts and three main burst categories that we labeled high-load, medium-load, and low-load bursts. We found that bursts of these categories were non-randomly distributed in time. High-load bursts formed clusters and were typically surrounded by transition phases with increased rates of medium-load and low-load bursts. In apparent contradiction to this, increased rates of low-load bursts were also associated with longer background phases, i.e., periods lacking high-load bursting. Furthermore, the rate of low-load bursts was more strongly correlated with the duration of background phases than the overall rate of epileptiform spikes. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that low-level EA could promote network stability but could also participate in transitions towards major epileptiform events, depending on the current state of the network.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Stimulus-Locked Responses on Human Upper Limb Muscles and Corrective Reaches are Preferentially Evoked by Low Spatial Frequencies</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0301-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;In situations requiring immediate action, humans can generate visually-guided responses at remarkably short latencies. Here, to better understand the visual attributes that best evoke such rapid responses, we recorded upper limb muscle activity while participants performed visually-guided reaches towards Gabor patches composed of differing spatial frequencies. We studied reaches initiated from a stable posture (experiment 1, a static condition), or during on-line reach corrections to an abruptly displaced target (experiment 2, a dynamic condition). In both experiments, we detail the latency and prevalence of stimulus-locked responses (SLRs), which are brief bursts of EMG activity that are time-locked to target presentation rather than movement onset. SLRs represent the first wave of EMG recruitment influenced by target presentation, and enable quantification of rapid visuomotor transformations. In both experiments, reach targets composed of low spatial frequencies elicited the shortest latency and most prevalent SLRs, with SLR latency increasing and SLR prevalence decreasing for reach targets composed of progressively higher spatial frequencies. SLRs could be evoked in either the static or dynamic condition, and when present in experiment 2, were associated with shorter latency and larger magnitude corrections. The results in experiment 2 are consistent with a linkage between the forces produced by SLRs and the earliest portion of on-line reach corrections. Overall, our results demonstrate that stimuli composed of low spatial frequencies preferentially evoke the most rapid visuomotor responses that, in the context of rapidly correcting an on-going reaching movement, are associated with earlier and larger on-line reach corrections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Humans have a remarkable capacity to respond quickly to changes in our visual environment. Although our visual world is composed of a range of spatial frequencies, surprisingly little is known about which frequencies preferentially evoke rapid reaching responses. Here, we systematically varied the spatial frequency of peripheral reach targets while measuring EMG activity on an upper limb muscle. We found that visual stimuli composed of low-spatial frequencies elicit the most rapid and robust EMG responses, and also elicit corrective reaches at shorter latencies. Thus, when time is of the essence, low spatial frequencies preferentially drive fast visuomotor responses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0121-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;High-throughput automated experiments accelerate discovery in neuroscience research and reduce bias. To enable high-throughput behavioral experiments, we developed a user-friendly and scalable automated system that can simultaneously train hundreds of mice on behavioral tasks, with time-stamped behavioral information recorded continuously for weeks. We trained 12 cages of C57Bl6/J mice (24 mice, 2 mice per cage) to perform auditory behavioral tasks. We found that circadian rhythms modulated overall behavioral activity as expected for nocturnal animals. However, auditory detection and discrimination accuracy remained consistently high in both light and dark cycles. We also found a periodic modulation of behavioral response rates only during the discrimination task, suggesting that the mice periodically reduce task-engagement (i.e., take ‘breaks’) when task difficulty increases due to the more complex stimulus-response paradigm for discrimination vs detection. Our results highlight how automated systems for continuous high-throughput behavioral experiments enable both efficient data collection and new observations on animal behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Automated high-throughput behavioral experiments in mice promise researchers the ability to quickly and reliably asses the behavior of large animal populations, while also minimizing experimenter-induced bias. However, the technical complexities of automation have limited widespread adoption of high-throughput behavioral methods. Here, we present a new tool for behavioral research, the ToneBox, which allows both novice and expert behaviorists to automatically test hundreds of mice simultaneously on different behavioral tasks. We provide manufacturing specifications and detailed documentation of system operation. Using C57Bl6/J mice we show that the ToneBox tracks circadian cycles via behavioral response rates, and that task difficultly modulates duty-cycles of task-engagement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 alpha (HIF-1{alpha}) counteracts the acute death of cells transplanted into the injured spinal cord</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0092-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Cellular transplantation is in clinical testing for a number of central nervous system disorders, including spinal cord injury (SCI). One challenge is acute transplanted cell death. To prevent this death, there is a need to both establish when the death occurs and develop approaches to mitigate its effects. Here, using luciferase (luc) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressing Schwann cell (SC) transplants in the contused thoracic rat spinal cord 7 days post-injury, we establish via &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; bioluminescent (IVIS) imaging and stereology that cell death occurs prior to 2-3 days post-implantation. We then test an alternative approach to the current paradigm of enhancing transplant survival by including multiple factors along with the cells. To stimulate multiple cellular adaptive pathways concurrently, we activate the hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) transcriptional pathway. Retroviral expression of VP16-HIF-1α in SCs increased HIF-α by 5.9-fold and its target genes implicated in oxygen transport and delivery (VEGF, 2.2-fold) and cellular metabolism (enolase, 1.7-fold). In cell death assays &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, HIF-1α protected cells from H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced oxidative damage. It also provided some protection against camptothecin-induced DNA damage, but not thapsigargin-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress or tunicamycin-induced unfolded protein response. Following transplantation, VP16-HIF-1α increased SC survival by 34.3%. The increase in cell survival was detectable by stereology, but not by &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; luciferase or &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; GFP IVIS imaging. The results support the hypothesis that activating adaptive cellular pathways enhances transplant survival and identifies an alternative pro-survival approach that, with optimization, could be amenable to clinical translation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; To maximize the benefits of cellular transplants for human therapeutic use, there is a critical need to develop strategies that effectively promote transplant survival and permit rapid assessment of transplant survival. The current study: 1) identifies the narrow time window in which transplanted cells die within the injured rat spinal cord, thus establishing the time window in which cytoprotection should be targeted to counteract transplanted cell death; 2) tests the effects of elevating HIF-1α on spinal cord transplant survival, thus demonstrating that activating adaptive transcriptional pathways is protective in SCI, and; 3) demonstrates, by comparing three approaches to quantifying transplant survival, that until faster and more sensitive methods can be developed, stereology remains the most reliable method.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01915</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;INTRODUCTION: Assessment of cognitively complex instrumental activities of
daily living (IADL) is important in (incipient) dementia, but little is known
about the influence of cultural differences. We aim to investigate the
cross-cultural comparability of IADL. METHODS: IADL were measured in 3,571
individuals (67.1 +- 9.5 years old, 44.7% female) in 11 international studies
using the Amsterdam IADL Questionnaire (A-IADL-Q). Cultural, age and gender
bias were assessed on item level using differential item functioning (DIF) and
on scale level by calculating correlations between IADL and cognitive and
functional measures. RESULTS: We did not find meaningful bias on item or on
scale level, as indicated by low DIF effect sizes (R2 range 0-0.03) and
correlations in expected directions and of similar magnitude. DISCUSSION: Our
results suggest that IADL may be universally suitable as outcome measure. The
A-IADL-Q seems robust to demographic diversity and is capable of reliably
measuring IADL impairment.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01908</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A complex interplay of single-neuron properties and the recurrent network
structure shapes the activity of individual cortical neurons, which differs in
general from the respective population activity. We develop a theory that makes
it possible to investigate the influence of both network structure and
single-neuron properties on the single-neuron statistics in block-structured
sparse random networks of spiking neurons. In particular, the theory predicts
the neuron-level autocorrelation times, also known as intrinsic timescales, of
the neuronal activity. The theory is based on a postulated extension of dynamic
mean-field theory from rate networks to spiking networks, which is validated
via simulations. It accounts for both static variability, e.g. due to a
distributed number of incoming synapses per neuron, and dynamical fluctuations
of the input. To illustrate the theory, we apply it to a balanced random
network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons, a balanced random network of
generalized linear model neurons, and a biologically constrained network of
leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. For the generalized linear model network, an
analytical solution to the colored noise problem allows us to obtain
self-consistent firing rate distributions, single-neuron power spectra, and
intrinsic timescales. For the leaky integrate-and-fire networks, we obtain the
same quantities by means of a novel analytical approximation of the colored
noise problem that is valid in the fluctuation-driven regime. Our results
provide a further step towards an understanding of the dynamics in recurrent
spiking cortical networks.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01689</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this paper we investigate the role of symmetry in visual stimuli designed
to probe human sensitivity to image statistics. Our starting point is a
recently published parameter space, a point in which defines a family of binary
texture images displaying a prescribed content of \nth{1}- to \nth{4}-order
correlations among pixels in 2x2 patches. We show that this parameter space can
be represented by fewer variables, namely the \emph{orbit invariants} obtained
by exploiting texture symmetry. Next we show how a class of locally countable
texture statistics, the Minkowski functionals -- recently shown to be a proxy
for human performance in texture discrimination tasks - can be written as a
linear combination of the dihedral orbit invariants. Furthermore, by recasting
these functionals as a combination of dihedral invariants, a generalization of
these functionals can be obtained for textures of any number of grey-levels,
patch sizes, or lattice types -- greatly reducing the number of
dimensions/parameters needed to characterize the generated images. Orbit
invariants may therefore provide a clue on the discrimination of these richer
textures, as the ordinary Minkowski functionals do for binary textures.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01437</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A main goal in the analysis of a complex system is to infer its underlying
network structure from time-series observations of its behaviour. The inference
process is often done by using bi-variate similarity measures, such as the
cross-correlation (CC), however, the main factors favouring or hindering its
success are still puzzling. Here, we use synthetic neuron models in order to
reveal the main topological properties that frustrate or facilitate inferring
the underlying network from CC measurements. Specifically, we use pulse-coupled
Izhikevich neurons connected as in the Caenorhabditis elegans neural networks
as well as in networks with similar randomness and small-worldness. We analyse
the effectiveness and robustness of the inference process under different
observations and collective dynamics, contrasting the results obtained from
using membrane potentials and inter-spike interval time-series. We find that
overall, small-worldness favours network inference and degree heterogeneity
hinders it. In particular, success rates in C. elegans networks -- that combine
small-world properties with degree heterogeneity -- are closer to success rates
in Erd\&quot;os-R\'enyi network models rather than those in Watts-Strogatz network
models. These results are relevant to understand better the relationship
between topological properties and function in different neural networks.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/50231</link>
	<content:encoded>Cultured mouse peritoneal macrophages release large numbers of ~30-nm cholesterol-rich particles. Here, we show that those particles represent fragments of the plasma membrane that are pulled away and left behind during the projection and retraction of filopodia and lamellipodia. Consistent with this finding, the particles are enriched in proteins found in focal adhesions, which attach macrophages to the substrate. The release of particles is abolished by blocking cell movement (either by depolymerizing actin with latrunculin A or by inhibiting myosin II with blebbistatin). Confocal microscopy and NanoSIMS imaging studies revealed that the plasma membrane–derived particles are enriched in 'accessible cholesterol' (a mobile pool of cholesterol detectable with the modified cytolysin ALO-D4) but not in sphingolipid-sequestered cholesterol (a pool detectable with ostreolysin A (OlyA)]. The discovery that macrophages release cholesterol-rich particles during cellular locomotion is likely relevant to cholesterol efflux and could contribute to extracellular cholesterol deposition in atherosclerotic plaques.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>WW domain tandem-containing proteins such as KIBRA, YAP, and MAGI play critical roles in cell growth and polarity via binding to and positioning target proteins in specific subcellular regions. An immense disparity exists between promiscuity of WW domain-mediated target bindings and specific roles of WW domain proteins in cell growth regulation. Here, we discovered that WW domain tandems of KIBRA and MAGI, but not YAP, bind to specific target proteins with extremely high affinity and exquisite sequence specificity. Via systematic structural biology and biochemistry approaches, we decoded the target binding rules of WW domain tandems from cell growth regulatory proteins and uncovered a list of previously unknown WW tandem binding proteins including β-Dystroglycan, JCAD, and PTPN21. The WW tandem-mediated target recognition mechanisms elucidated here can guide functional studies of WW domain proteins in cell growth and polarity as well as in other cellular processes including neuronal synaptic signaling.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/47972</link>
	<content:encoded>Action potentials trigger neurotransmitter release at active zones, specialized release sites in axons. Many neurons also secrete neurotransmitters or neuromodulators from their somata and dendrites. However, it is unclear whether somatodendritic release employs specialized sites for release, and the molecular machinery for somatodendritic release is not understood. Here, we identify an essential role for the active zone protein RIM in stimulated somatodendritic dopamine release in the midbrain. In mice in which RIMs are selectively removed from dopamine neurons, action potentials failed to evoke significant somatodendritic release detected via D2 receptor-mediated currents. Compellingly, spontaneous dopamine release was normal upon RIM knockout. Dopamine neuron morphology, excitability, and dopamine release evoked by amphetamine, which reverses dopamine transporters, were also unaffected. We conclude that somatodendritic release employs molecular scaffolds to establish secretory sites for rapid dopamine signaling during firing. In contrast, basal release that is independent of action potential firing does not require RIM.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Deficient motivation contributes to numerous psychiatric disorders, including withdrawal from drug use, depression, schizophrenia, and others. Nucleus accumbens (NAc) has been implicated in motivated behavior, but it remains unclear whether motivational drive is linked to discrete neurobiological mechanisms within the NAc. To examine this, we profiled cohorts of Sprague-Dawley rats in a test of motivation to consume sucrose. We found that substantial variability in willingness to exert effort for reward was not associated with operant responding under low-effort conditions or stress levels. Instead, effort-based motivation was mirrored by a divergent NAc shell transcriptome with differential regulation at potassium and dopamine signaling genes. Functionally, motivation was inversely related to excitability of NAc principal neurons. Furthermore, neuronal and behavioral outputs associated with low motivation were linked to faster inactivation of a voltage-gated potassium channel, K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.4. These results raise the prospect of targeting K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.4 gating in psychiatric conditions associated with motivational dysfunction.</content:encoded>

In this paper we take a different approach, fitting variational autoencoder (VAE) models parameterized by deep neural networks to T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires. We show that simple VAE models can perform accurate cohort frequency estimation, learn the rules of VDJ recombination, and generalize well to unseen sequences. Further, we demonstrate that VAE-like models can distinguish between real sequences and sequences generated according to a recombination-selection model, and that many characteristics of VAE-generated sequences are similar to those of real sequences.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Adherens junction (AJ) assembly under force is essential for many biological processes like epithelial monolayer bending, collective cell migration, cell extrusion and wound healing. The acto-myosin cytoskeleton acts as a major force-generator during the de novo formation and remodelling of AJ. Here, we investigated the role of myosinII isoforms in epithelial junction assembly. Myosin IIA (NMIIA) and Myosin IIB (NMIIB) differentially regulate biogenesis of adherens junction through association with distinct actin networks. Analysis of junction dynamics, actin organization, and mechanical forces of control and knockdown cells for myosins revealed that NMIIA provides the mechanical tugging force necessary for cell-cell junction reinforcement and maintenance. NMIIB is involved in E-cadherin clustering, maintenance of a branched actin layer connecting E-cadherin complexes and perijunctional actin fibres leading to the building-up of anisotropic stress. These data reveal unanticipated complementary functions of NMIIA and NMIIB in the biogenesis and integrity of AJ.</content:encoded>

Predicting RNA-binding protein (RBP) specificity is important for understanding gene expression regulation and RNA-mediated enzymatic processes. It is widely believed that RBP binding specificity is determined by both the sequence and structural contexts of RNAs. Existing approaches, including traditional machine learning algorithms and more recently, deep learning models, have been extensively applied to integrate RNA sequence and its predicted or experimental RNA structural probabilities for improving the accuracy of RBP binding prediction. Such models were trained mostly on the large-scale &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; datasets, such as the RNAcompete dataset. However, in RNAcompete, most synthetic RNAs are unstructured, which makes machine learning methods not effectively extract RBP-binding structural preferences. Furthermore, RNA structure may be variable or multi-modal according to both theoretical and experimental evidence. In this work, we propose ThermoNet, a thermodynamic prediction model by integrating a new sequence-embedding convolutional neural network model over a thermodynamic ensemble of RNA secondary structures. First, the sequence-embedding convolutional neural network generalizes the existing k-mer based methods by jointly learning convolutional filters and k-mer embeddings to represent RNA sequence contexts. Second, the thermodynamic average of deep-learning predictions is able to explore structural variability and improves the prediction, especially for the structured RNAs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, including RCK, DeepBind and several other recent state-of-the-art methods for predictions on both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; data. The implementation of ThermoNet is available at https://github.com/suyufeng/ThermoNet.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wUFHIbk0RKo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;To assess whether biological aging as measured by leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is associated with clinical disability and brain volume loss in multiple sclerosis (MS).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adults with MS/CIS in the UCSF‐EPIC cohort study were included. LTL was measured on DNA samples by quantitative PCR and expressed as telomere to somatic DNA ratio (T/S). Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and 3D T1‐weighted brain MRI were performed at baseline and follow‐up. Associations of baseline LTL with cross‐sectional and longitudinal outcomes were assessed using simple and mixed effects linear regression models. A subset (n=46) had LTL measured over time, and we assessed the association of LTL change with EDSS change with mixed effects models.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Included were 356 women and 160 men (mean age 43 years, median disease duration 6 years, median EDSS 1.5 (range 0‐7), mean T/S ratio 0.97 (SD 0.18)). In baseline analyses adjusted for age, disease duration and sex, for every 0.2 lower LTL, EDSS was 0.27 higher (95%CI 0.13‐0.42, p&amp;lt;0.001) and brain volume was 7.4 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; lower (0.10‐14.7, p=0.047). In longitudinal adjusted analyses, those with lower baseline LTL had higher EDSS and lower brain volumes over time. In adjusted analysis of the subset, LTL change was associated with EDSS change over 10 years: for every 0.2 LTL decrease, EDSS was 0.34 higher (0.08‐0.61, p=0.012).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shorter telomere length was associated with disability independent of chronological age, suggesting biological aging may contribute to neurological injury in MS. Targeting aging‐related mechanisms is a potential therapeutic strategy against MS progression.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neuroinflammation and Functional Connectivity in Alzheimer's Disease: Interactive Influences on Cognitive Performance</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/36/7218?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuroinflammation is a key part of the etio-pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We tested the relationship between neuroinflammation and the disruption of functional connectivity in large-scale networks, and their joint influence on cognitive impairment. We combined [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PK11195 positron emission tomography (PET) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) in 28 patients (12 females/16 males) with clinical diagnosis of probable AD or mild cognitive impairment with positive PET biomarker for amyloid, and 14 age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy controls (8 females/6 males). Source-based &quot;inflammetry&quot; was used to extract principal components of [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PK11195 PET signal variance across all participants. rs-fMRI data were preprocessed via independent component analyses to classify neuronal and non-neuronal signals. Multiple linear regression models identified sources of signal covariance between neuroinflammation and brain connectivity profiles, in relation to the diagnostic group (patients, controls) and cognitive status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients showed significantly higher [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PK11195 binding relative to controls, in a distributed spatial pattern including the hippocampus, frontal, and inferior temporal cortex. Patients with enhanced loading on this [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PK11195 binding distribution displayed diffuse abnormal functional connectivity. The expression of a stronger association between such abnormal connectivity and higher levels of neuroinflammation correlated with worse cognitive deficits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study suggests that neuroinflammation relates to the pathophysiological changes in network function that underlie cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease. Neuroinflammation, and its association with functionally-relevant reorganization of brain networks, is proposed as a target for emerging immunotherapeutic strategies aimed at preventing or slowing the emergence of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neuroinflammation is an important aspect of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but it was not known whether the influence of neuroinflammation on brain network function in humans was important for cognitive deficit. Our study provides clear evidence that &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; neuroinflammation in AD impairs large-scale network connectivity; and that the link between neuro inflammation and functional network connectivity is relevant to cognitive impairment. We suggest that future studies should address how neuroinflammation relates to network function as AD progresses, and whether the neuroinflammation in AD is reversible, as the basis of immunotherapeutic strategies to slow the progression of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Indirect Medium Spiny Neurons in the Dorsomedial Striatum Regulate Ethanol-Containing Conditioned Reward Seeking</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/36/7206?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Adenosine 2A receptor (A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R)-containing indirect medium spiny neurons (iMSNs) in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) contribute to reward-seeking behaviors. However, those roles for ethanol-seeking behaviors remain unknown. To investigate ethanol-seeking behaviors, we used an ethanol-containing reward (10% ethanol and 10% sucrose solution; 10E10S). Upon conditioning with 10E10S, mice that initially only preferred 10% sucrose, not 10E10S, showed a stronger preference for 10E10S. Then, we investigated whether the manipulation of the DMS–external globus pallidus (GPe) iMSNs circuit alters the ethanol-containing reward (10E10S) seeking behaviors using the combination of pharmacologic and optogenetic approaches. DMS A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R activation dampened operant conditioning-induced ethanol-containing reward, whereas A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R antagonist abolished the effects of the A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R agonist and restored ethanol-containing reward-seeking. Moreover, pre-ethanol exposure potentiated the A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R-dependent reward-seeking. Interestingly, mice exhibiting ethanol-containing reward-seeking showed the reduction of the DMS iMSNs activity, suggesting that disinhibiting iMSNs decreases reward-seeking behaviors. In addition, we found that A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R activation reversed iMSNs neural activity in the DMS. Similarly, optogenetic stimulation of the DMS-GPe iMSNs reduced ethanol-containing reward-seeking, whereas optogenetic inhibition of the DMS-GPe iMSNs reversed this change. Together, our study demonstrates that DMS A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R and iMSNs regulate ethanol-containing reward-seeking behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Our findings highlight the mechanisms of how operant conditioning develops the preference of ethanol-containing conditioned reward. Mice exhibiting ethanol-containing reward-seeking showed a reduction of the indirect medium spiny neuronal activity in the dorsomedial striatum. Pharmacological activation of adenosine A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor (A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R) or optogenetic activation of indirect medium spiny neurons dampened operant conditioned ethanol-containing reward-seeking, whereas inhibiting this neuronal activity restored ethanol-containing reward-seeking. Furthermore, repeated intermittent ethanol exposure potentiated A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R-dependent reward-seeking. Therefore, our finding suggests that A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R-containing indirect medium spiny neuronal activation reduces ethanol-containing reward-seeking, which may provide a potential therapeutic target for alcohol use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Diverse Mechanisms Lead to Common Dysfunction of Striatal Cholinergic Interneurons in Distinct Genetic Mouse Models of Dystonia</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/36/7195?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Clinical and experimental data indicate striatal cholinergic dysfunction in dystonia, a movement disorder typically resulting in twisted postures via abnormal muscle contraction. Three forms of isolated human dystonia result from mutations in the &lt;i&gt;TOR1A&lt;/i&gt; (DYT1), &lt;i&gt;THAP1&lt;/i&gt; (DYT6), and &lt;i&gt;GNAL&lt;/i&gt; (DYT25) genes. Experimental models carrying these mutations facilitate identification of possible shared cellular mechanisms. Recently, we reported elevated extracellular striatal acetylcholine by &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; microdialysis and paradoxical excitation of cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) by dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) agonism using &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; slice electrophysiology in &lt;i&gt;Dyt1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;GAG/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice. The paradoxical excitation was caused by overactive muscarinic receptors (mAChRs), leading to a switch in D2R coupling from canonical G&lt;sub&gt;i/o&lt;/sub&gt; to noncanonical β-arrestin signaling. We sought to determine whether these mechanisms in &lt;i&gt;Dyt1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;GAG/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice are shared with &lt;i&gt;Thap1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;C54Y/+&lt;/sup&gt; knock-in and &lt;i&gt;Gnal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt; knock-out dystonia models and to determine the impact of sex. We found &lt;i&gt;Thap1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;C54Y/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice of both sexes have elevated extracellular striatal acetylcholine and D2R-induced paradoxical ChI excitation, which was reversed by mAChR inhibition. Elevated extracellular acetylcholine was absent in male and female &lt;i&gt;Gnal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice, but the paradoxical D2R-mediated ChI excitation was retained and only reversed by inhibition of adenosine A2ARs. The G&lt;sub&gt;i/o&lt;/sub&gt;-preferring D2R agonist failed to increase ChI excitability, suggesting a possible switch in coupling of D2Rs to β-arrestin, as seen previously in a DYT1 model. These data show that, whereas elevated extracellular acetylcholine levels are not always detected across these genetic models of human dystonia, the D2R-mediated paradoxical excitation of ChIs is shared and is caused by altered function of distinct G-protein-coupled receptors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Dystonia is a common and often disabling movement disorder. The usual medical treatment of dystonia is pharmacotherapy with nonselective antagonists of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, which have many undesirable side effects. Development of new therapeutics is a top priority for dystonia research. The current findings, considered in context with our previous investigations, establish a role for cholinergic dysfunction across three mouse models of human genetic dystonia: DYT1, DYT6, and DYT25. The commonality of cholinergic dysfunction in these models arising from diverse molecular etiologies points the way to new approaches for cholinergic modulation that may be broadly applicable in dystonia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Two Spatially Distinct Posterior Alpha Sources Fulfill Different Functional Roles in Attention</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/36/7183?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Directing attention helps to extract relevant information and suppress distracters. Alpha brain oscillations (8–12 Hz) are crucial for this process, with power decreases facilitating processing of important information and power increases inhibiting brain regions processing irrelevant information. Evidence for this phenomenon arises from visual attention studies (Worden et al., 2000); however, the effect also exists in other modalities, including the somatosensory system (Haegens et al., 2011) and intersensory attention tasks (Foxe and Snyder, 2011). We investigated in human participants (10 females, 10 males) the role of alpha oscillations in focused (0/100%) versus divided (40/60%) attention, both across modalities (visual/somatosensory; Experiment 1) and within the same modality (visual domain: across hemifields; Experiment 2) while recording EEG over 128 scalp electrodes. In Experiment 1, participants divided their attention between visual and somatosensory modality to determine the temporal/spatial frequency of a target stimulus (vibrotactile stimulus/Gabor grating). In Experiment 2, participants divided attention between two visual hemifields to identify the orientation of a Gabor grating. In both experiments, prestimulus alpha power in visual areas decreased linearly with increasing attention to visual stimuli. In contrast, prestimulus alpha power in parietal areas was lower when attention was divided between modalities/hemifields compared with focused attention. These results suggest there are two alpha sources, one of which reflects the &quot;visual spotlight of attention&quot; and the other reflects attentional effort. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that attention recruits two spatially distinct alpha sources in occipital and parietal brain regions, acting simultaneously but serving different functions in attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Attention to one spatial location/sensory modality leads to power changes of alpha oscillations (~10 Hz) with decreased power over regions processing relevant information and power increases to actively inhibit areas processing &quot;to-be-ignored&quot; information. Here, we used detailed source modeling to investigate EEG data recorded during separate unimodal (visual) and multimodal (visual and somatosensory) attention tasks. Participants either focused their attention on one modality/spatial location or directed it to both. We show for the first time two distinct alpha sources are active simultaneously but play different roles. A sensory (visual) alpha source was linearly modulated by attention representing the &quot;visual spotlight of attention.&quot; By contrast, a parietal alpha source was modulated by attentional effort, showing lowest alpha power when attention was divided.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Stimulation of the Posterior Cingulate Cortex Impairs Episodic Memory Encoding</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/36/7173?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging experiments implicate the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) in episodic memory processing, making it a potential target for responsive neuromodulation strategies outside of the hippocampal network. However, causal evidence for the role that PCC plays in memory encoding is lacking. In human female and male participants (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 17) undergoing seizure mapping, we investigated functional properties of the PCC using deep brain stimulation (DBS) and stereotactic electroencephalography. We used a verbal free recall paradigm in which the PCC was stimulated during presentation of half of the study lists, whereas no stimulation was applied during presentation of the remaining lists. We investigated whether stimulation affected memory and modulated hippocampal activity. Results revealed four main findings. First, stimulation during episodic memory encoding impaired subsequent free recall, predominantly for items presented early in the study lists. Second, PCC stimulation increased hippocampal gamma-band power. Third, stimulation-induced hippocampal gamma power predicted the magnitude of memory impairment. Fourth, functional connectivity between the hippocampus and PCC predicted the strength of the stimulation effect on memory. Our findings offer causal evidence implicating the PCC in episodic memory encoding. Importantly, the results indicate that stimulation targeted outside of the temporal lobe can modulate hippocampal activity and impact behavior. Furthermore, measures of connectivity between brain regions within a functional network can be informative in predicting behavioral effects of stimulation. Our findings have significant implications for developing therapies to treat memory disorders and cognitive impairment using DBS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cognitive impairment and memory loss are critical public health challenges. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a promising tool for developing strategies to ameliorate memory disorders by targeting brain regions involved in mnemonic processing. Using DBS, our study sheds light on the lesser-known role of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) in memory encoding. Stimulating the PCC during encoding impairs subsequent recall memory. The degree of impairment is predicted by stimulation-induced hippocampal gamma oscillations and functional connectivity between PCC and hippocampus. Our findings provide the first causal evidence implicating PCC in memory encoding and highlight the PCC as a favorable target for neuromodulation strategies using &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; connectivity measures to predict stimulation effects. This has significant implications for developing therapies for memory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Development of Human Emotion Circuits Investigated Using a Big-Data Analytic Approach: Stability, Reliability, and Robustness</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/36/7155?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Emotion perception is fundamental to affective and cognitive development and is thought to involve distributed brain circuits. Efforts to chart neurodevelopmental changes in emotion have been severely hampered by narrowly focused approaches centered on activation of individual brain regions and small sample sizes. Here we investigate the maturation of human functional brain circuits associated with identification of fearful, angry, sad, happy, and neutral faces using a large sample of 759 children, adolescents, and adults (ages 8–23; female/male = 419/340). Network analysis of emotion-related brain circuits revealed three functional modules, encompassing lateral frontoparietal, medial prefrontal-posterior cingulate, and subcortical-posterior insular cortices, with hubs in medial prefrontal, but not posterior cingulate, cortex. This overall network architecture was stable by age 8, and it anchored maturation of circuits important for salience detection and cognitive control, as well as dissociable circuit patterns across distinct emotion categories. Our findings point to similarities and differences in functional circuits associated with identification of fearful, angry, sad, happy, and neutral faces, and reveal aspects of brain circuit organization underlying emotion perception that are stable over development as well as features that change with age. Reliability analyses demonstrated the robustness of our findings and highlighted the importance of large samples for probing functional brain circuit development. Our study emphasizes a need to focus beyond amygdala circuits and provides a robust neurodevelopmental template for investigating emotion perception and identification in psychopathology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Emotion perception is fundamental to cognitive and affective development. However, efforts to chart neurodevelopmental changes in emotion perception have been hampered by narrowly focused approaches centered on the amygdala and prefrontal cortex and small sample sizes. Using a large sample of 759 children, adolescents, and adults and a multipronged analytical strategy, we investigated the development of brain network organization underlying identification and categorization of fearful, happy, angry, sad, and neutral facial expressions. Results revealed a developmentally stable modular architecture that anchored robust age-related and emotion category-related changes in brain connectivity across multiple brain systems that extend far beyond amygdala circuits and provide a new template for investigation of emotion processing in the developing brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Ca2+-Activated K+ Channels Reduce Network Excitability, Improving Adaptability and Energetics for Transmitting and Perceiving Sensory Information</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/36/7132?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels (BK and SK) are ubiquitous in synaptic circuits, but their role in network adaptation and sensory perception remains largely unknown. Using electrophysiological and behavioral assays and biophysical modeling, we discover how visual information transfer in mutants lacking the BK channel (&lt;i&gt;dSlo&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;), SK channel (&lt;i&gt;dSK&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;), or both (&lt;i&gt;dSK&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;;; &lt;i&gt;dSlo&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) is shaped in the female fruit fly (&lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;) R1–R6 photoreceptor-LMC circuits (R-LMC-R system) through synaptic feedforward-feedback interactions and reduced R1–R6 &lt;i&gt;Shaker&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Shab&lt;/i&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductances. This homeostatic compensation is specific for each mutant, leading to distinctive adaptive dynamics. We show how these dynamics inescapably increase the energy cost of information and promote the mutants' distorted motion perception, determining the true price and limits of chronic homeostatic compensation in an &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; genetic animal model. These results reveal why Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels reduce network excitability (energetics), improving neural adaptability for transmitting and perceiving sensory information.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: MAP7 Prevents Axonal Branch Retraction by Creating a Stable Microtubule Boundary to Rescue Polymerization</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/36/7118?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Complex neural circuits are built from axonal branches that allow each neuron to connect with multiple targets. During development, maturation of nascent branches depends on stabilization of newly assembled or transported microtubules, which are thought to be regulated by microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). However, because many known MAPs inhibit branch formation, it is not clear which MAP is responsible for regulating microtubule stability during branch development. Here, we show that MAP7, a less-well understood MAP that is localized to branch junctions, provides a key molecular mechanism to regulate microtubule stability during branch formation. In developing rodent sensory neurons of mixed sex, MAP7 is required for branch maturation mainly by preventing branch retraction. This function is mediated by the ability of MAP7 to control microtubule stability, as microtubules are more stable at branch junctions where MAP7 is localized. Consistently, nascent branches depleted of MAP7 have decreased stable microtubules but increased dynamic microtubules. Moreover, MAP7 binds to the acetylated and stable region of individual microtubules and avoids the dynamic plus end, thereby creating a boundary that prevents microtubule depolymerization and rescues microtubule polymerization. This unique binding property, which is not observed for other MAPs, can prevent branch retraction caused by laser-induced severing or nocodazole-induced microtubule depolymerization. Together, our study identifies a novel molecular mechanism mediated by MAP7 to regulate microtubule stability and strengthen branches at different stages of axonal branch morphogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Development and maintenance of axonal branches rely on microtubule stability, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we show that MAP7, a unique protein that interacts with both microtubules and the motor protein kinesin-1, plays a key role at branch junctions. MAP7 stabilizes microtubules in nascent branches and prevents branch retraction during branch maturation or after laser-induced injury. MAP7 also binds to the acetylated region of microtubules to prevent depolymerization and rescue polymerization. This unique binding property supports a novel mechanism mediated by MAP7 to cooperate with other MAPs and control microtubule stability during axonal branch development. This mechanism could also impact microtubule regulation in branch regeneration after nerve injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: TMEM16B Calcium-Activated Chloride Channels Regulate Action Potential Firing in Lateral Septum and Aggression in Male Mice</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/36/7102?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The lateral septum (LS) plays an important role in regulating aggression. It is well recognized that LS lesions lead to a dramatic increase in aggressive behaviors. A better understanding of LS neurophysiology and its functional output is therefore important to assess LS involvement in regulating aggression. The LS is a heterogeneous structure that maintains inputs and outputs with multiple brain regions, and is also divided into subregions that innervate one another. Thus, it is challenging to identify the exact cell type and projections for characterization. In this study, we determined the expression pattern of the calcium-activated chloride channel, TMEM16B, in the LS of both male and female mice. We then investigated the physiological contribution of the calcium-activated chloride channel to LS neuronal signaling. By performing whole-cell patch-clamp recording, we showed that TMEM16B alters neurotransmitter release at the hippocampal-LS synapse, and regulates spike frequency and spike frequency adaptation in subpopulations of LS neurons. We further demonstrated that loss of TMEM16B function promotes lengthened displays of aggressive behaviors by male mice during the resident intruder paradigm. In conclusion, our findings suggest that TMEM16B function contributes to neuronal excitability in subpopulations of LS neurons and the regulation of aggression in male mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Aggression is a behavior that arose evolutionarily from the necessity to compete for limited resources and survival. One particular brain region involved in aggression is the lateral septum (LS). In this study, we characterized the expression of the TMEM16B calcium-activated chloride channel in the LS and showed that TMEM16B regulates the action potential firing frequency of LS neurons. We discovered that loss of TMEM16B function lengthens the displays of aggressive behaviors in male mice. These findings suggest that TMEM16B plays an important role in regulating LS neuronal excitability and behaviors associated with LS function, thereby contributing to our understanding of how the LS may regulate aggression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Tetrodotoxin-Sensitive Sodium Channels Mediate Action Potential Firing and Excitability in Menthol-Sensitive Vglut3-Lineage Sensory Neurons</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/36/7086?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Small-diameter vesicular glutamate transporter 3-lineage (Vglut3&lt;sup&gt;lineage&lt;/sup&gt;) dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons play an important role in mechanosensation and thermal hypersensitivity; however, little is known about their intrinsic electrical properties. We therefore set out to investigate mechanisms of excitability within this population. Calcium microfluorimetry analysis of male and female mouse DRG neurons demonstrated that the cooling compound menthol selectively activates a subset of Vglut3&lt;sup&gt;lineage&lt;/sup&gt; neurons. Whole-cell recordings showed that small-diameter Vglut3&lt;sup&gt;lineage&lt;/sup&gt; DRG neurons fire menthol-evoked action potentials and exhibited robust, transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8)-dependent discharges at room temperature. This heightened excitability was confirmed by current-clamp and action potential phase-plot analyses, which showed menthol-sensitive Vglut3&lt;sup&gt;lineage&lt;/sup&gt; neurons to have more depolarized membrane potentials, lower firing thresholds, and higher evoked firing frequencies compared with menthol-insensitive Vglut3&lt;sup&gt;lineage&lt;/sup&gt; neurons. A biophysical analysis revealed voltage-gated sodium channel (Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;) currents in menthol-sensitive Vglut3&lt;sup&gt;lineage&lt;/sup&gt; neurons were resistant to entry into slow inactivation compared with menthol-insensitive neurons. Multiplex &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization showed similar distributions of tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; transcripts between TRPM8-positive and -negative Vglut3&lt;sup&gt;lineage&lt;/sup&gt; neurons; however, Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 transcripts, which encode TTX-resistant channels, were more prevalent in TRPM8-negative neurons. Conversely, pharmacological analyses identified distinct functional contributions of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; subunits, with Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.1 driving firing in menthol-sensitive neurons, whereas other small-diameter Vglut3&lt;sup&gt;lineage&lt;/sup&gt; neurons rely primarily on TTX-resistant Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; channels. Additionally, when Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.1 channels were blocked, the remaining Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; current readily entered into slow inactivation in menthol-sensitive Vglut3&lt;sup&gt;lineage&lt;/sup&gt; neurons. Thus, these data demonstrate that TTX-sensitive Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;s drive action potential firing in menthol-sensitive sensory neurons and contribute to their heightened excitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Somatosensory neurons encode various sensory modalities including thermoreception, mechanoreception, nociception, and itch. This report identifies a previously unknown requirement for tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium channels in action potential firing in a discrete subpopulation of small-diameter sensory neurons that are activated by the cooling agent menthol. Together, our results provide a mechanistic understanding of factors that control intrinsic excitability in functionally distinct subsets of peripheral neurons. Furthermore, as menthol has been used for centuries as an analgesic and anti-pruritic, these findings support the viability of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.1 as a therapeutic target for sensory disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: PINK1 Content in Mitochondria is Regulated by ER-Associated Degradation</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/36/7074?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a pool of functional mitochondria requires degradation of damaged ones within the cell. PINK1 is critical in this quality-control process: loss of mitochondrial membrane potential causes PINK1 to accumulate on the mitochondrial surface, triggering mitophagy. However, little is known about how PINK1 is regulated. Recently, we showed that PINK1 content is kept low in healthy mitochondria by continuous ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of its mature form via a mechanism inconsistent with the proposed N-end rule process. Using both human female and monkey cell lines, we now demonstrate that once generated within the mitochondria, 52 kDa PINK1 adopts a mitochondrial topology most consistent with it being at the mitochondrial–endoplasmic reticulum (ER) interface. From this particular submitochondrial location, PINK1 interacts with components of the ER-associated degradation pathway, such as the E3 ligases gp78 and HRD1, which cooperate to catalyze PINK1 ubiquitination. The valosin-containing protein and its cofactor, UFD1, then target ubiquitinated PINK1 for proteasomal degradation. Our data show that PINK1 in healthy mitochondria is negatively regulated via an interplay between mitochondria and ER, and shed light on how this mitochondrial protein gains access to the proteasome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Regulation of mitochondrial content of PINK1, a contributor to mitophagy, is an important area of research. Recently, we found that PINK1 content is kept low in healthy mitochondria by continuous ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. We now extend and refine this novel finding by showing that PINK1 localizes at the mitochondrial–endoplasmic reticulum (ER) interface, from where it interacts with the ER-associated degradation machinery, which catalyzes its ubiquitination and transfer to the proteasome. Thus, these data show that PINK1 in healthy mitochondria is negatively regulated via a mitochondria and ER interplay, and how this mitochondrial protein gains access to the proteasome.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: In Vitro Nociceptor Neuroplasticity Associated with In Vivo Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/36/7061?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) is a serious adverse event produced by opioid analgesics. Lack of an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; model has hindered study of its underlying mechanisms. Recent evidence has implicated a role of nociceptors in OIH. To investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of OIH in nociceptors, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, subcutaneous administration of an analgesic dose of fentanyl (30 μg/kg, s.c.) was performed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in male rats. Two days later, when fentanyl was administered intradermally (1 μg, i.d.), in the vicinity of peripheral nociceptor terminals, it produced mechanical hyperalgesia (OIH). Additionally, 2 d after systemic fentanyl, rats had also developed hyperalgesic priming (opioid-primed rats), long-lasting nociceptor neuroplasticity manifested as prolongation of prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) hyperalgesia. OIH was reversed, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, by intrathecal administration of cordycepin, a protein translation inhibitor that reverses priming. When fentanyl (0.5 nm) was applied to dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, cultured from opioid-primed rats, it induced a μ-opioid receptor (MOR)-dependent increase in [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; in 26% of small-diameter neurons and significantly sensitized (decreased action potential rheobase) weakly IB4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and IB4&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; neurons. This sensitizing effect of fentanyl was reversed in weakly IB4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; DRG neurons cultured from opioid-primed rats after &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; treatment with cordycepin, to reverse of OIH. Thus, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; administration of fentanyl induces nociceptor neuroplasticity, which persists in culture, providing evidence for the role of nociceptor MOR-mediated calcium signaling and peripheral protein translation, in the weakly IB4-binding population of nociceptors, in OIH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Clinically used μ-opioid receptor agonists such as fentanyl can produce hyperalgesia and hyperalgesic priming. We report on an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; model of nociceptor neuroplasticity mediating this opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) and priming induced by fentanyl. Using this model, we have found qualitative and quantitative differences between cultured nociceptors from opioid-naive and opioid-primed animals, and provide evidence for the important role of nociceptor μ-opioid receptor-mediated calcium signaling and peripheral protein translation in the weakly IB4-binding population of nociceptors in OIH. These findings provide information useful for the design of therapeutic strategies to alleviate OIH, a serious adverse event of opioid analgesics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Learning Induces Transient Upregulation of Brevican in the Auditory Cortex during Consolidation of Long-Term Memories</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/36/7049?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It is a daily challenge for our brains to establish new memories via learning while providing stable storage of remote memories. In the adult vertebrate brain, bimodal regulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) may regulate the delicate balance of learning-dependent plasticity and stable memory formation. Here, we trained adult male mice in a cortex-dependent auditory discrimination task and measured the abundance of ECM proteins brevican (BCN) and tenascin-R over the course of acquisition learning, consolidation, and long-term recall in two learning-relevant brain regions; the auditory cortex and hippocampus. Although early training led to a general downregulation of total ECM proteins, successful retrieval correlated with a region-specific and transient upregulation of BCN levels in the auditory cortex. No other parameter such as arousal or stress could account for the transient and region-specific BCN upregulation. This performance-dependent biphasic regulation of the ECM may assist transient plasticity to facilitate initial learning and subsequently promote the long-term consolidation of memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The capacity to learn throughout life and at the same time guarantee lifelong storage and remote recall of established memories is a daily challenge. Emerging evidence suggests an important function of the extracellular matrix (ECM), a conglomerate of secreted proteins and polysaccharides in the adult vertebrate brain. We trained mice in an auditory long-term memory task and measured learning-related dynamic changes of the ECM protein brevican. Specifically, in the auditory cortex brevican is downregulated during initial learning and subsequently upregulated in exclusively those animals that have learned the task, suggesting a performance-dependent regulation in the service of memory consolidation and storage. Our data may provide novel therapeutic implications for several neuropsychiatric diseases involving dysregulation of the ECM.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Strengthening of the Efferent Olivocochlear System Leads to Synaptic Dysfunction and Tonotopy Disruption of a Central Auditory Nucleus</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/36/7037?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The auditory system in many mammals is immature at birth but precisely organized in adults. Spontaneous activity in the inner ear plays a critical role in guiding this maturation process. This is shaped by an efferent pathway that descends from the brainstem and makes transient direct synaptic contacts with inner hair cells. In this work, we used an α9 cholinergic nicotinic receptor knock-in mouse model (of either sex) with enhanced medial efferent activity (&lt;i&gt;Chrna9L9&lt;/i&gt;'&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;L9&lt;/i&gt;'&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;) to further understand the role of the olivocochlear system in the correct establishment of auditory circuits. Wave III of auditory brainstem responses (which represents synchronized activity of synapses within the superior olivary complex) was smaller in &lt;i&gt;L9&lt;/i&gt;'&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; mice, suggesting a central dysfunction. The mechanism underlying this functional alteration was analyzed in brain slices containing the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB), where neurons are topographically organized along a mediolateral (ML) axis. The topographic organization of MNTB physiological properties observed in wildtype (WT) was abolished in &lt;i&gt;L9&lt;/i&gt;'&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; mice. Additionally, electrophysiological recordings in slices indicated MNTB synaptic alterations. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; multielectrode recordings showed that the overall level of MNTB activity was reduced in the &lt;i&gt;L9&lt;/i&gt;'&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. The present results indicate that the transient cochlear efferent innervation to inner hair cells during the critical period before the onset of hearing is involved in the refinement of topographic maps as well as in setting the properties of synaptic transmission at a central auditory nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cochlear inner hair cells of altricial mammals display spontaneous electrical activity before hearing onset. The pattern and firing rate of these cells are crucial for the correct maturation of the central auditory pathway. A descending efferent innervation from the CNS contacts the hair cells during this developmental window. The present work shows that genetic enhancement of efferent function disrupts the orderly topographic distribution of biophysical and synaptic properties in the auditory brainstem and causes severe synaptic dysfunction. This work adds to the notion that the transient efferent innervation to the cochlea is necessary for the correct establishment of the central auditory circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

In making a clinical diagnosis or progression estimates of GSS, magnetic resonance imaging and real‐time quaking‐induced conversion may be helpful, but the results should be evaluated with respect to the overall clinical context.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01012</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The impairment of cognitive function in Alzheimer's is clearly correlated to
synapse loss. However, the mechanisms underlying this correlation are only
poorly understood. Here, we investigate how the loss of excitatory synapses in
sparsely connected random networks of spiking excitatory and inhibitory neurons
alters their dynamical characteristics. Beyond the effects on the network's
activity statistics, we find that the loss of excitatory synapses on excitatory
neurons shifts the network dynamic towards the stable regime. The decrease in
sensitivity to small perturbations to time varying input can be considered as
an indication of a reduction of computational capacity. A full recovery of the
network performance can be achieved by firing rate homeostasis, here
implemented by an up-scaling of the remaining excitatory-excitatory synapses.
By analysing the stability of the linearized network dynamics, we explain how
homeostasis can simultaneously maintain the network's firing rate and
sensitivity to small perturbations.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mapping all the neurons in the brain requires automatic reconstruction of
entire cells from volume electron microscopy data. The flood-filling networks
(FFN) architecture can achieve leading performance. However, the training of
the network is computationally very expensive. In order to reduce the training
time, we implemented synchronous and data-parallel distributed training using
the Horovod framework on top of the published FFN code. We demonstrated the
scaling of FFN training up to 1024 Intel Knights Landing (KNL) nodes at Argonne
Leadership Computing Facility. We investigated the training accuracy with
different optimizers, learning rates, and optional warm-up periods. We
discovered that square root scaling for learning rate works best beyond 16
nodes, which is contrary to the case of smaller number of nodes, where linear
learning rate scaling with warm-up performs the best. Our distributed training
reaches 95% accuracy in approximately 4.5 hours on 1024 KNL nodes using Adam

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Neuronal Avalanches in Input and Associative Layers of Auditory Cortex</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00045</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The primary auditory cortex processes acoustic sequences for the perception of behaviorally meaningful sounds such as speech. Sound information arrives at its input layer four from where activity propagates to associative layer 2/3. It is currently not known whether there is a characteristic organization of neuronal population activity across layers and sound levels during sound processing. Here, we identify neuronal avalanches, which in theory and experiments have been shown to maximize dynamic range and optimize information transfer within and across networks, in primary auditory cortex. We used in vivo 2-photon imaging of pyramidal neurons in cortical layers L4 and L2/3 of mouse A1 to characterize the populations of neurons that were active spontaneously, i.e., in the absence of a sound stimulus, and those recruited by single-frequency tonal stimuli at different sound levels. Single-frequency sounds recruited neurons of widely ranging frequency selectivity in both layers. We defined neuronal ensembles as neurons being active within or during successive temporal windows at the temporal resolution of our imaging. For both layers, neuronal ensembles were highly variable in size during spontaneous activity as well as during sound presentation. Ensemble sizes distributed according to power laws, the hallmark of neuronal avalanches, and were similar across sound levels. Avalanches activated by sound were composed of neurons with diverse tuning preference, yet with selectivity independent of avalanche size. Our results suggest that optimization principles identified for avalanches guide population activity in L4 and L2/3 of auditory cortex during and in-between stimulus processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Genome-Wide Alteration of 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine in Hypoxic-Ischemic Neonatal Rat Model of Cerebral Palsy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00214</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cerebral palsy (CP) is a neurodevelopmental disorder usually occurring early in life and persisting through the whole life. Several risk factors, including perinatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI), may contribute to occurrence of CP in preterm infants. DNA hydroxymethylation has been shown to play an important role in neurodevelopment and neurodegenerative disorders. However, the effect of DNA hydroxymethylation in CP remains unknown. The aim of this study is to explore whether and how DNA hydroxymethylation is involved in CP pathogenesis. We observed that overall 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) abundance in the cortex of the temporal lobe of rat pups was decreased significantly after hypoxic-ischemic injury, and the reduced expression of Tet1 and Tet2 enzymes might be responsible for this change. Identified differential hydroxymethylation regions (DhMRs) were richly involved in multiple signaling pathways related to neuronal development and function. Furthermore, we found that reduced 5hmC modification on the DhMRs-related genes were accompanied by decrease of their mRNA expression levels. These results suggest that 5hmC modifications are involved in the CP pathogenesis and may potentially serve as a new therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Dynamic Orchestration of Brains and Instruments During Free Guitar Improvisation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00050</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Playing music in ensemble requires enhanced sensorimotor coordination and the non-verbal communication of musicians that need to coordinate their actions precisely with those of others. As shown in our previous studies on guitar duets, and also on a guitar quartet, intra- and inter-brain synchronization plays an essential role during such interaction. At the same time, sensorimotor coordination as an essential part of this interaction requires being in sync with the auditory signals coming from the played instruments. In this study, using acoustic recordings of guitar playing and electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of brain activity from guitarists playing in duet, we aimed to explore whether the musicians' brain activity synchronized with instrument sounds produced during guitar playing. To do so, we established an analytical method based on phase synchronization between time-frequency transformed guitar signals and raw EEG signals. Given phase synchronization, or coupling between guitar and brain signals, we constructed so-called extended hyper-brain networks comprising all possible interactions between two guitars and two brains. Applying a graph-theoretical approach to these networks assessed across time, we present dynamic changes of coupling strengths or dynamic orchestration of brains and instruments during free guitar improvisation for the first time. We also show that these dynamic network topology changes are oscillatory in nature and are characterized by specific spectral peaks, indicating the temporal structure in the synchronization patterns between guitars and brains. Moreover, extended hyper-brain networks exhibit specific modular organization varying in time, and binding each time, different parts of the network into the modules, which were mostly heterogeneous (i.e., comprising signals from different instruments and brains or parts of them). This suggests that the method capturing synchronization between instruments and brains when playing music provides crucial information about the underlying mechanisms. We conclude that this method may be an indispensable tool in the investigation of social interaction, music therapy, and rehabilitation dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00940</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Film based round the ear electrodes (cEEGrids) provide both, the accessibility of unobtrusive mobile EEG as well as a rapid EEG application in stationary settings when extended measurements are not possible. In a large-scale evaluation of driving abilities of older adults (N &amp;gt; 350) in a realistic driving simulation, we evaluated to what extent mental demands can be measured using cEEGrids in a completely unrestricted environment. For a first frequency-based analysis, the driving scenario was subdivided into different street segments with respect to their task loads (low, medium, high) that was a priori rated by an expert. Theta activity increased with task load but no change in Alpha power was found. Effects gained clarity after removing pink noise effects, that were potentially high in this data set due to motion artifacts. Theta fraction increased with task load and Alpha fraction decreased. We mapped this effect to specific street segments by applying a track-frequency analysis. Whilst participants drove with constant speed and without high steering wheel activity, Alpha was high and theta low. The reverse was the case in sections that required either high activity or increased attentional allocation to the driving context. When calculating mental demands for different street segments based on EEG, this measure is highly significant correlated with the experts’ rating of task load. Deviances can be explained by specific features within the segments. Thus, modulations in spectral power of the EEG were validly reflected in the cEEGrids data. All findings were in line with the prominent literature in the field. The results clearly demonstrate the usability of this low-density EEG method for application in real-world settings where an increase in ecological validity might outweigh the loss of certain aspects of internal validity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Impairment of Mitochondrial Redox Status in Peripheral Lymphocytes of Multiple Sclerosis Patients</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00938</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Literature suggests that oxidative stress (OS) may be involved in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS), in which the immune system is known to play a key role. However, to date, the OS in peripheral lymphocytes and its contribution to the disease remain unknown. The aim of the present study was to explore the influence of OS in peripheral lymphocytes of MS patients. To that end, a cross-sectional, observational pilot study was conducted [n = 58: 34 MS and 24 healthy subjects (control group)]. We have measured superoxide production and protein mitochondrial complex levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from MS patients and control. Lactate levels and the antioxidant capacity were determined in plasma. We adjusted the comparisons between study groups by age, sex and cell count according to case. Results demonstrated that PBMCs, specifically T cells, from MS patients exhibited significantly increased superoxide anion production compared to control group (p = 0.027 and p = 0.041, respectively). Increased superoxide production in PBMCs was maintained after the adjustment (p = 0.044). Regarding mitochondrial proteins, we observe a significant decrease in the representative protein content of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I-V in PBMCs of MS patients (p = 0.002, p = 0.037, p = 0.03, p = 0.044, and p = 0.051, respectively), which was maintained for complexes I, III, and V after the adjustment (p = 0.026; p = 0.033; p = 0.033, respectively). In MS patients, a trend toward increased plasma lactate concentration was detected [8.04 mg lactate/dL (5.25, 9.49) in the control group, 11.36 mg lactate/dL (5.41, 14.81) in MS patients] that was statistically significant after the adjustment (p = 0.013). This might be indicative of compromised mitochondrial function. Finally, antioxidant capacity was also decreased in plasma from MS patients, both before (p = 0.027) and after adjusting for sex and age (p = 0.006). Our findings demonstrate that PBMCs of MS patients show impaired mitochondrial redox status and deficient antioxidant capacity. These results demonstrate for the first time the existence of mitochondrial alterations in the cells immune cells of MS patients already at the peripheral level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;The abnormal alterations of proteins 14-3-3 and tau in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are widely used for the diagnosis of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD), while the situations of CSF biomarkers in genetic prion diseases (gPrDs), particularly in Chinese gPrDs patients, have not been well documented.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Here, with the help of commercial 14-3-3 and total tau ELISA kits, we evaluated the levels of proteins 14-3-3 and tau in the CSF samples of 140 Chinese patients of 14 different types of gPrDs.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We found that CSF 14-3-3 ELISA values in the patients with P102L GSS and D178N FFI were remarkably low, while those in the patients with T188K, E196A, and E200K gCJD were relatively high. Linear correlation assays identified a positive correlation between positive rate in Western blot (WB) and ELISA values of CSF 14-3-3. ELISA assays for total tau in CSF samples identified relatively high levels in the cases of T188K, E196A, and E200K gCJD (median: 133840.81, 159992.80, and 153342.92 AU/ml), but relatively low levels in those of P102L GSS and D178N FFI (median: 64397.77 and 43856.79 AU/ml).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These data illustrate heterogeneous profiles of CSF 14-3-3 and tau in various types of gPrDs, depending on the differences in the mutations in PRNP.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) and cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF) promote the survival of midbrain dopamine neurons in animal models of Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, little is known about endogenous concentrations of MANF and CDNF in human PD patients, and their relation to PD pathogenesis. Our main objective was to study whether circulating concentrations of MANF and CDNF differ between PD patients and controls, and if they correlate with clinical parameters. Levels of circulating CDNF were studied for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;MANF and CDNF levels were measured from serum samples of 34 PD patients and 35 controls using validated in-lab-designed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISAs). MANF and CDNF mRNA levels in whole blood samples of 60 PD patients and 30 controls were measured by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). MANF concentrations in different blood cell types were measured by ELISA.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Circulating MANF concentrations were significantly higher in PD patients compared to controls (P &amp;lt; 0.001) and were positively correlated with Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) depression rating. MANF protein was present in blood cells, however, MANF mRNA levels in the blood did not differ between PD patients and controls (P = 0.44). The mean concentration of serum CDNF was 33 pg/ml in the controls. CDNF levels were not altered in PD patients (P = 0.25).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;MANF but not CDNF level was increased in the blood of PD patients. It would be interesting to examine the blood level of MANF from early stage PD patients in future studies to test whether MANF can be used as a clinical marker of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00911</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Over the last several decades, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has evolved from a treatment for select neuropsychiatric disorders to one that holds promise in treating numerous inflammatory conditions. Growing interest has focused on the use of VNS for other indications, such as heart failure, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, ischemic stroke, and traumatic brain injury. As pre-clinical research often guides expansion into new clinical avenues, animal models of VNS have also increased in recent years. To advance this promising treatment, however, there are a number of experimental parameters that must be considered when planning a study, such as physiology of the vagus nerve, electrical stimulation parameters, electrode design, stimulation equipment, and microsurgical technique. In this review, we discuss these important considerations and how a combination of clinically relevant stimulation parameters can be used to achieve beneficial therapeutic results in pre-clinical studies of sub-acute to chronic VNS, and provide a practical guide for performing this work in rodent models. Finally, by integrating clinical and pre-clinical research, we present indeterminate issues as opportunities for future research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Intrinsic Frequencies of the Resting-State fMRI Signal: The Frequency Dependence of Functional Connectivity and the Effect of Mode Mixing</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00900</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The frequency characteristics of the resting-state BOLD fMRI (rs-fMRI) signal are of increasing scientific interest, as we discover more frequency-specific biological interpretations. In this work, we use variational mode decomposition (VMD) to precisely decompose the rs-fMRI time series into its intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) in a data-driven manner. The accuracy of the VMD decomposition of constituent IMFs is verified through simulations, with higher reconstruction accuracy and much-reduced mode mixing relative to previous methods. Furthermore, we examine the relative contribution of the VMD-derived modes (frequencies) to the rs-fMRI signal as well as functional connectivity measurements. Our primary findings are: (1) The rs-fMRI signal within the 0.01–0.25 Hz range can be consistently characterized by four intrinsic frequency clusters, centered at 0.028 Hz (IMF4), 0.080 Hz (IMF3), 0.15 Hz (IMF2) and 0.22 Hz (IMF1); (2) these frequency clusters were highly reproducible, and independent of rs-fMRI data sampling rate; (3) not all frequencies were associated with equivalent network topology, in contrast to previous findings. In fact, while IMF4 is most likely associated with physiological fluctuations due to respiration and pulse, IMF3 is most likely associated with metabolic processes, and IMF2 with vasomotor activity. Both IMF3 and IMF4 could produce the brain-network topology typically observed in fMRI, whereas IMF1 and IMF2 could not. These findings provide initial evidence of feasibility in decomposing the rs-fMRI signal into its intrinsic oscillatory frequencies in a reproducible manner.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00867</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Inducing somatic cells into neural stem cells (iNSCs) in specific ways provides a new cell therapy in a variety of neurological diseases. In the past, iNSCs were generated by transcription factors which increased the risk of mutagenesis, tumor formations, and immune reactions by viral transduction vectors. Therefore, in this study, different small molecules were used to induce mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) into iNSCs in different reprogramming stages, which showed high reprogramming efficiency without altering the genome. We demonstrated that the small molecules staged-induction neural stem cells (SMSINS) have the characteristics of neural stem cells (NSCs) in morphology, gene expression, self-renewal and differentiation potential. Furthermore, valproic acid (VPA), one of small molecules, was showed to enhance neural induction with highest efficiency compared with six other small molecules, which were also investigated in the present study. Moreover, our results suggested that activating the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling enhanced the induction efficiency and neuronal differentiation. Collectively, our findings indicated that using this induction program allowed us to obtain safe and efficient iNSCs which were free of genetic manipulation. The VPA-mediated mTOR signaling pathway may enhance reprogramming efficiency and neuronal differentiation. So we suggested that this program could be a new method of obtaining iNSCs for the treatment of neurological diseases by cell replacement therapy in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Clinical imaging, however, relies heavily on X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans for diagnosis and prognosis. Currently, there is only one image processing pipeline for head CT, which focuses mainly on head CT data with lesions. We present tools and a complete pipeline for processing CT data, focusing on open-source solutions, that focus on head CT but are applicable to most CT analyses. We describe going from raw DICOM data to a spatially normalized brain within CT presenting a full example with code. Overall, we recommend anonymizing data with Clinical Trials Processor, converting DICOM data to NIfTI using dcm2niix, using BET for brain extraction, and registration using a publicly-available CT template for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness meditation has been shown to improve episodic memory and increase theta oscillations which are known to play a role in episodic memory retrieval. The present study examined the effect of mindfulness meditation on episodic memory retrieval and theta oscillations. Using a longitudinal design, subjects in the mindfulness meditation experimental group who underwent 4 weeks of mindfulness meditation training and practice were compared to a waitlist control group. During the pre-training and post-training experimental sessions, subjects completed the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) and studied adjectives and either imagined a scene (Place Task) or judged its pleasantness (Pleasant Task). During the recognition test, subjects decided which task was performed with each word (“Old Place Task” or “Old Pleasant Task”) or “New.” FFMQ scores and source discrimination were greater post-training than pre-training in the mindfulness meditation experimental group. Electroencephalography (EEG) results revealed that for the mindfulness meditation experimental group theta power was greater post-training than pre-training in right frontal and left parietal channels and changes in FFMQ scores correlated with changes in theta oscillations in right frontal channels (n = 20). The present results suggest that mindfulness meditation increases source memory retrieval and theta oscillations in a fronto-parietal network.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00310</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Relatively little attention has been paid to the neural basis of superior memory despite its potential in providing important insight into efforts to improve memory in the general population or to offset age-related cognitive decline. The current study reports a rare opportunity to reproduce and isolate specific neural activities directly associated with exceptional memory. To capture the brain processes responsible for superior memory, we returned to a laboratory task and analytic approach used to explore the nature of exceptional memory, namely, digit-span task combined with verbal protocol analysis. One participant with average memory received approximately 50 h of digit-span training and the participant’s digit-span increased from normative (8 digits) to exceptional (30 digits). Event-related potentials were recorded while the participant’s digit span increased from 19 to 30 digits. Protocol analysis allowed us to identify direct behavioral indices of idiosyncratic encoding processes underlying the superior memory performance. EEG indices directly corresponding to the behavioral indices of encoding processes were identified. The results suggest that the early attention-related encoding processes were reflected in theta and delta whereas the later attention-independent encoding processes were reflected in time-domain slow-wave. This fine-grained approach offers new insights into studying neural mechanism mediating superior memory and the cognitive effort necessary to develop it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and has plagued humans for more than 200 years. The etiology and detailed pathogenesis of PD is unclear, but is currently believed to be the result of the interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Studies have found that PD patients with the LRRK2:G2019S variation have the typical clinical manifestations of PD, which may be familial or sporadic, and have age-dependent pathogenic characteristics. Therefore, the LRRK2:G2019S variation may be an ideal model to study the interaction of multiple factors such as genetic, environmental and natural aging factors in PD in the future. This article reviewed the progress of LRRK2:G2019S studies in PD research in order to provide new research ideas and directions for the pathogenesis and treatment of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Controlling Synchronization of Spiking Neuronal Networks by Harnessing Synaptic Plasticity</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00061</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Disrupting the pathological synchronous firing patterns of neurons with high frequency stimulation is a common treatment for Parkinsonian symptoms and epileptic seizures when pharmaceutical drugs fail. In this paper, our goal is to design a desynchronization strategy for large networks of spiking neurons such that the neuronal activity of the network remains in the desynchronized regime for a long period of time after the removal of the stimulation. We develop a novel “Forced Temporal-Spike Time Stimulation (FTSTS)” strategy that harnesses the spike-timing dependent plasticity to control the synchronization of neural activity in the network by forcing the neurons in the network to artificially fire in a specific temporal pattern. Our strategy modulates the synaptic strengths of selective synapses to achieve a desired synchrony of neural activity in the network. Our simulation results show that the FTSTS strategy can effectively synchronize or desynchronize neural activity in large spiking neuron networks and keep them in the desired state for a long period of time after the removal of the external stimulation. Using simulations, we demonstrate the robustness of our strategy in desynchronizing neural activity of networks against uncertainties in the designed stimulation pulses and network parameters. Additionally, we show in simulation, how our strategy could be incorporated within the existing desynchronization strategies to improve their overall efficacy in desynchronizing large networks. Our proposed strategy provides complete control over the synchronization of neurons in large networks and can be used to either synchronize or desynchronize neural activity based on specific applications. Moreover, it can be incorporated within other desynchronization strategies to improve the efficacy of existing therapies for numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders associated with pathological synchronization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Normal and Pathological Tau Uptake Mediated by M1/M3 Muscarinic Receptors Promotes Opposite Neuronal Changes</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00403</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The microtubule associated protein tau is mainly found in the cell’s cytosol but recently it was also shown in the extracellular space. In neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer’s disease (AD), pathological tau spreads from neuron to neuron enhancing neurodegeneration. Here, we show that HEK293 cells and neurons in culture uptake extracellular normal and pathological Tau. Muscarinic receptor antagonists atropine and pirenzepine block 80% this uptake. CHO cells do not express these receptors therefore cannot uptake tau, unless transfected with M1 and/or M3 receptor. These results strongly suggest that muscarinic receptors mediate this process. Uptake of normal tau in neurons enhances neuronal process formation but a pseudophosphorylated form of tau (pathological human tau, PH-Tau) disrupts them and accumulates in the somatodendritic compartment. AD hyperphosphorylated tau (AD P-Tau) has similar effects as PH-Tau on cultured neurons. Addition of either PH-Tau or AD P-tau to neuronal cultures induced microglial activation. In conclusion, uptake of extracellular tau is mediated by muscarinic receptors with opposite effects: normal tau stabilizes neurites; whereas pathological tau disrupts this process leading to neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00401</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The purinergic receptor P2X7 is expressed in neural and immune cells known to be involved in neurological diseases. Its ligand, ATP, is a signaling molecule that can act as a neurotransmitter in physiological conditions or as a danger signal when released in high amount by damaged/dying cells or activated glial cells. Thus, ATP is a danger-associated molecular pattern. Binding of ATP by P2X7 leads to the activation of different biochemical pathways, depending on the physiological or pathological environment. The aim of this review is to discuss various functions of P2X7 in the immune and central nervous systems. We present evidence that P2X7 may have a detrimental or beneficial role in the nervous system, in the context of neurological pathologies: epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, age-related macular degeneration and cerebral artery occlusion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Memory Decline and Behavioral Inflexibility in Aged Mice Are Correlated With Dysregulation of Protein Synthesis Capacity</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00246</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying age-associated cognitive impairments will not only contribute to our general knowledge about “aging” biology, but also provide insights for more effective strategies to prevent and improve the quality of life for both normal aging and pathological aging such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Here we first assessed and compared the performance of cognition and synaptic plasticity in young (3–5-month old) and aged c57BL/6J mice (19–21 months old). Findings from behavioral tests demonstrated that old mice, compared to young mice, displayed impairments in spatial learning/memory, working memory, and behavioral flexibility. Further, synaptic electrophysiology experiments on hippocampal slices revealed that the early form of long-term potentiation (LTP, a synaptic model for memory formation) was inhibited in old mice. At the molecular level, biochemical assays on the hippocampus showed dysregulation of signaling pathways controlling protein synthesis capacity including: up-regulation of AKT-mTORC1-p70S6K signaling, which is associated with translation of terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) class of mRNAs that encode translational machinery; hyper-phosphorylation of mRNA translational elongation factor 2 (eEF2) and its upstream regulator AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), indicating repression of general protein synthesis. Moreover, young and old mice exhibited similar brain levels of translational initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) phosphorylation, which is known to be increased in AD and linked to the disease pathophysiology. Thus, our data provide evidence at the molecular level to highlight the similarity and difference between normal and pathological aging, which may contribute to future studies on diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers for aging-related dementia syndromes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Early and late mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients have been reported to have a distinctive prognosis of converting to Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;To evaluate the difference in gray matter volume and assess the association between cognitive function evaluated by comprehensive cognitive function test, and cortical thickness across healthy controls (HCs) (n = 37), early (n = 30), and late MCI patients (n = 35).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Differences in gray matter volume were evaluated by whole brain voxel-based morphometry across the groups. Multiple regression analysis was used to analyze group by memory performance interactions for the normalized gray matter volume.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The early MCI group showed reduced gray matter volume in the right middle temporal gyrus in comparison to the HC group. The late MCI group displayed atrophy in the left parahippocampal gyrus in comparison to the HC group. Late MCI patients exhibited a decreased gray matter volume in the left fusiform gyrus in comparison to patients in the early MCI group (Monte Carlo simulation corrected p &amp;lt; 0.01, Tukey post hoc tests). Furthermore, there was a significant group (HC vs. early MCI) by memory performance interaction for the normalized cortical volume of the right middle temporal gyrus. Additionally, a significant group (early MCI vs. late MCI) by memory performance interaction was found for the normalized gray matter volume of the left fusiform gyrus (p &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Early and late MCI patients showed distinctive associations of gray matter volumes in compensatory brain regions with memory performances. The findings can contribute to a better understanding of the structural changes in compensatory brain regions to elucidate memory decline in the trajectory of the subdivided prodromal stages of the Alzheimer’s disease (AD).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Appoptosin Mediates Lesions Induced by Oxidative Stress Through the JNK-FoxO1 Pathway</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00243</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Oxidative stress is a common feature of neurodegenerative diseases and plays an important role in disease progression. Appoptosin is a pro-apoptotic protein that contributes to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy. However, whether appoptosin mediates oxidative stress-induced neurotoxicity has yet to be determined. Here, we observe that appoptosin protein levels are induced by hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) exposure through the inhibition of proteasomal appoptosin degradation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that overexpression of appoptosin induces apoptosis through the JNK-FoxO1 pathway. Importantly, knockdown of appoptosin can ameliorate H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced JNK activation and apoptosis in primary neurons. Thus, we propose that appoptosin functions as an upstream regulator of the JNK-FoxO1 pathway, contributing to cell death in response to oxidative stress during neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Effect of Aging on Resting State Connectivity of Predefined Networks in the Brain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00234</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent studies have found a deleterious effect of age on a wide variety of measures of functional connectivity, and some hints at a relationship between connectivity at rest and cognitive functioning. However, few studies have combined multiple functional connectivity methods, or examined them over a wide range of adult ages, to try to uncover which metrics and networks seem to be particularly sensitive to age-related decline across the adult lifespan. The present study utilized multiple resting state functional connectivity methods in a sample of adults from 20–80 years old to gain a more complete understanding of the effect of aging on network function and integrity. Whole-brain results showed that aging results in weakening average within-network connectivity, lower system segregation and local efficiency, and higher participation coefficient. Network-level results suggested that nearly every primary sensory and cognitive network faces some degree of age-related decline, including reduced within-network connectivity, higher network-based participation coefficient, and reduced network-level local efficiency. Further, some of these connectivity metrics showed relationships with cognitive performance. Thus, these results suggest that a multi-method analysis of functional connectivity data may be critical to capture the full effect of aging on the health of brain networks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Effects of Exercise Modes on Neural Processing of Working Memory in Late Middle-Aged Adults: An fMRI Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00224</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent studies have highlighted the importance of regular exercise on cognitive function in aging populations, with aerobic exercise and cardiovascular fitness having received the largest amount of research attention. However, the relationship between exercise mode and cognitive function underlying behavioral modification and neural activation remains unknown. The present study, therefore, sought to examine the associations between different exercise modes and the working memory (WM) aspect of executive function as well as its task-evoked brain activation in the late middle-aged population. Seventy late middle-aged adults were classified into open-skill, closed-skill, or irregular exercise groups based on their participation in exercise activities prior to the study and then performed a spatial working memory (SWM) task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. The results revealed that exercise groups, regardless of exercise modes, showed better SWM and physical fitness performance. Additionally, the open-skill group exhibited greater brain activation in the prefrontal lobe, anterior cingulate cortex/supplementary motor area (ACC/SMA), and hippocampus than those in the closed-skill group, suggesting a mode-sensitive compensatory mechanism in late middle-aged adults. These findings indicate that exercise promotes cognitive health, improves WM, and enhances neurocognitive scaffolding in late middle-aged adults and further suggest that various exercise modes can effectively modulate frontal and hippocampal function in the face of age-related neurocognitive declines, implications that may inform the development of exercise programs for the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Prediction of antibiotic resistance phenotypes from whole genome sequencing data by machine learning methods has been proposed as a promising platform for the development of sequence-based diagnostics. However, there has been no systematic evaluation of factors that may influence performance of such models, how they might apply to and vary across clinical populations, and what the implications might be in the clinical setting. Here, we performed a meta-analysis of seven large &lt;i&gt;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&lt;/i&gt; datasets, as well as &lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/i&gt; datasets, with whole genome sequence data and antibiotic susceptibility phenotypes using set covering machine classification, random forest classification, and random forest regression models to predict resistance phenotypes from genotype. We demonstrate how model performance varies by drug, dataset, resistance metric, and species, reflecting the complexities of generating clinically relevant conclusions from machine learning-derived models. Our findings underscore the importance of incorporating relevant biological and epidemiological knowledge into model design and assessment and suggest that doing so can inform tailored modeling for individual drugs, pathogens, and clinical populations. We further suggest that continued comprehensive sampling and incorporation of up-to-date whole genome sequence data, resistance phenotypes, and treatment outcome data into model training will be crucial to the clinical utility and sustainability of machine learning-based molecular diagnostics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SZpLL4wo8Y0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Cellular microscopy images contain rich insights about biology. To extract this information, researchers use features, or measurements of the patterns of interest in the images. Here, we introduce a convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically design features for fluorescence microscopy. We use a self-supervised method to learn feature representations of single cells in microscopy images without labelled training data. We train CNNs on a simple task that leverages the inherent structure of microscopy images and controls for variation in cell morphology and imaging: given one cell from an image, the CNN is asked to predict the fluorescence pattern in a second different cell from the same image. We show that our method learns high-quality features that describe protein expression patterns in single cells both yeast and human microscopy datasets. Moreover, we demonstrate that our features are useful for exploratory biological analysis, by capturing high-resolution cellular components in a proteome-wide cluster analysis of human proteins, and by quantifying multi-localized proteins and single-cell variability. We believe paired cell inpainting is a generalizable method to obtain feature representations of single cells in multichannel microscopy images.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/K4OPTPuJ_EY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

We present a new computational model of speech motor control: the Feedback-Aware Control of Tasks in Speech or &lt;i&gt;FACTS&lt;/i&gt; model. FACTS employs a hierarchical state feedback control architecture to control simulated vocal tract and produce intelligible speech. The model includes higher-level control of speech tasks and lower-level control of speech articulators. The task controller is modeled as a dynamical system governing the creation of desired constrictions in the vocal tract, after Task Dynamics. Both the task and articulatory controllers rely on an internal estimate of the current state of the vocal tract to generate motor commands. This estimate is derived, based on efference copy of applied controls, from a forward model that predicts both the next vocal tract state as well as expected auditory and somatosensory feedback. A comparison between predicted feedback and actual feedback is then used to update the internal state prediction. FACTS is able to qualitatively replicate many characteristics of the human speech system: the model is robust to noise in both the sensory and motor pathways, is relatively unaffected by a loss of auditory feedback but is more significantly impacted by the loss of somatosensory feedback, and responds appropriately to externally-imposed alterations of auditory and somatosensory feedback. The model also replicates previously hypothesized trade-offs between reliance on auditory and somatosensory feedback and shows for the first time how this relationship may be mediated by acuity in each sensory domain. These results have important implications for our understanding of the speech motor control system in humans.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7tNJKTuTtS8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Pathway analysis is widely used to gain mechanistic insights from high-throughput omics data. However, most existing methods do not consider signal integration represented by pathway topology, resulting in enrichment of convergent pathways when downstream genes are modulated. Incorporation of signal flow and integration in pathway analysis could rank the pathways based on modulation in key regulatory genes. This implementation can be facilitated for large-scale data by discrete state network modeling due to simplicity in parameterization. Here, we model cellular heterogeneity using discrete state dynamics and measure pathway activities in cross-sectional data. We introduce a new algorithm, Boolean Omics Network Invariant-Time Analysis (BONITA), for signal propagation, signal integration, and pathway analysis. Our signal propagation approach models heterogeneity in transcriptomic data as arising from intercellular heterogeneity rather than intracellular stochasticity, and propagates binary signals repeatedly across networks. Logic rules defining signal integration are inferred by genetic algorithm and are refined by local search. The rules determine the impact of each node in a pathway, which is used to score the probability of the pathway’s modulation by chance. We have comprehensively tested BONITA for application to transcriptomics data from translational studies. Comparison with state-of-the-art pathway analysis methods shows that BONITA has higher sensitivity at lower levels source node modulation and similar sensitivity at higher levels of source node modulation. Application of BONITA pathway analysis to previously validated RNA-sequencing studies identifies additional relevant pathways in &lt;i&gt;in-vitro&lt;/i&gt; human cell line experiments and &lt;i&gt;in-vivo&lt;/i&gt; infant studies. Additionally, BONITA successfully detected modulation of disease specific pathways when comparing relevant RNA-sequencing data with healthy controls. Most interestingly, the two highest impact score nodes identified by BONITA included known drug targets. Thus, BONITA is a powerful approach to prioritize not only pathways but also specific mechanistic role of genes compared to existing methods. BONITA is available at: https://github.com/thakar-lab/BONITA.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yg-kaihACj0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Across diverse biological systems—ranging from neural networks to intracellular signaling and genetic regulatory networks—the information about changes in the environment is frequently encoded in the full temporal dynamics of the network nodes. A pressing data-analysis challenge has thus been to efficiently estimate the amount of information that these dynamics convey from experimental data. Here we develop and evaluate decoding-based estimation methods to lower bound the mutual information about a finite set of inputs, encoded in single-cell high-dimensional time series data. For biological reaction networks governed by the chemical Master equation, we derive model-based information approximations and analytical upper bounds, against which we benchmark our proposed model-free decoding estimators. In contrast to the frequently-used k-nearest-neighbor estimator, decoding-based estimators robustly extract a large fraction of the available information from high-dimensional trajectories with a realistic number of data samples. We apply these estimators to previously published data on Erk and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling in mammalian cells and to yeast stress-response, and find that substantial amount of information about environmental state can be encoded by non-trivial response statistics even in stationary signals. We argue that these single-cell, decoding-based information estimates, rather than the commonly-used tests for significant differences between selected population response statistics, provide a proper and unbiased measure for the performance of biological signaling networks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uyRYVgsS0ao&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

In-silico identification of potential target genes for disease is an essential aspect of drug target discovery. Recent studies suggest that successful targets can be found through by leveraging genetic, genomic and protein interaction information. Here, we systematically tested the ability of 12 varied algorithms, based on network propagation, to identify genes that have been targeted by any drug, on gene-disease data from 22 common non-cancerous diseases in OpenTargets. We considered two biological networks, six performance metrics and compared two types of input gene-disease association scores. The impact of the design factors in performance was quantified through additive explanatory models. Standard cross-validation led to over-optimistic performance estimates due to the presence of protein complexes. In order to obtain realistic estimates, we introduced two novel protein complex-aware cross-validation schemes. When seeding biological networks with known drug targets, machine learning and diffusion-based methods found around 2-4 true targets within the top 20 suggestions. Seeding the networks with genes associated to disease by genetics decreased performance below 1 true hit on average. The use of a larger network, although noisier, improved overall performance. We conclude that diffusion-based prioritisers and machine learning applied to diffusion-based features are suited for drug discovery in practice and improve over simpler neighbour-voting methods. We also demonstrate the large impact of choosing an adequate validation strategy and the definition of seed disease genes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/p0ejWP31Cw8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Proteases are multifunctional, promiscuous enzymes that degrade proteins as well as peptides and drive important processes in health and disease. Current technology has enabled the construction of libraries of peptide substrates that detect protease activity, which provides valuable biological information. An ideal library would be orthogonal, such that each protease only hydrolyzes one unique substrate, however this is impractical due to off-target promiscuity (i.e., one protease targets multiple different substrates). Therefore, when a library of probes is exposed to a cocktail of proteases, each protease activates multiple probes, producing a convoluted signature. Computational methods for parsing these signatures to estimate individual protease activities primarily use an extensive collection of all possible protease-substrate combinations, which require impractical amounts of training data when expanding to search for more candidate substrates. Here we provide a computational method for estimating protease activities efficiently by reducing the number of substrates and clustering proteases with similar cleavage activities into families. We envision that this method will be used to extract meaningful diagnostic information from biological samples.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kofCOaGeb4I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0261-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Neural representation can be induced without external stimulation, such as in mental imagery. Our previous study found that imagined speaking and imagined hearing modulated perceptual neural responses in opposite directions, suggesting motor-to-sensory transformation and memory retrieval as two separate routes that induce auditory representation (Tian &amp;amp; Poeppel, J Cogn Neurosci. 2013 25:1020-36). We hypothesized that the precision of representation induced from different types of speech imagery led to different modulation effects. Specifically, we predicted that the one-to-one mapping between motor and sensory domains established during speech production would evoke a more precise auditory representation in imagined speaking than retrieving the same sounds from memory in imagined hearing. To test this hypothesis, we built the function of representational precision as the modulation of connection strength in a neural network model. The model fitted the MEG imagery repetition effects, and the best-fitting parameters showed sharper tuning after imagined speaking than imagined hearing, consistent with the representational precision hypothesis. Moreover, this model predicted that different types of speech imagery would affect perception differently. In an imagery-adaptation experiment, the categorization of/ba/-/da/continuum from male and female human participants showed more positive shifts towards the preceding imagined syllable after imagined speaking than imagined hearing. These consistent simulation and behavioral results support our hypothesis that distinct mechanisms of speech imagery construct auditory representation with varying degrees of precision and differentially influence auditory perception. This study provides a mechanistic connection between neural-level activity and psychophysics that reveals the neural computation of mental imagery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Our brain processes sensory information that we receive from the environment and mediates mental activity such as imagination. How do mental and perceptual processes interact to shape our cognition? We constructed a computational model that simulated how two types of imagery – imagined speaking and imagined hearing –differentially modulated perception via two distinct neural pathways. This model further predicted a choice shift in perceptual responses to ambiguous auditory stimuli, which was confirmed in a follow-up imagery-adaptation experiment. These results suggest that parallel neural pathways for mental imagery provide distinct functions to influence perception. These findings may implicate multiple strategies for constructing the brain-computer interface.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Transgenic mouse lines are instrumental in our attempt to understand brain function. Promoters driving transgenic expression of the gene encoding Cre recombinase are crucial to ensure selectivity in Cre-mediated targeting of floxed alleles using the Cre-Lox system. For the study of dopamine neurons, promoter sequences driving expression of the &lt;i&gt;Dopamine transporter&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Dat&lt;/i&gt;) gene are often implemented and several DAT-Cre transgenic mouse lines have been found to faithfully direct Cre activity to dopamine neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; DAT-Cre transgenic mouse lines have been particularly useful in resolving the diverse functions of the brain{acute}s dopamine systems. Here we report DAT-Cre-driven reporter gene expression in cell bodies of non-dopaminergic limbic brain areas, including the lateral septum, the amygdala and the lateral habenula. Co-labeling analysis identified that these DAT-Cre neurons were glutamatergic or GABAergic. Injection of viral-genetic constructs verified the activity of the DAT-Cre transgene in the adult brain, and also enabled identification of projection patterns. This study proposes a new angle by which available DAT-Cre transgenic mice can be implemented as tools for driving targeting to a restricted number of non-dopaminergic neurons of limbic neurocircuitry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Movement and VIP interneuron activation differentially modulate encoding in mouse auditory cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0164-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Information processing in sensory cortex is highly sensitive to non-sensory variables such as anesthetic state, arousal, and task engagement. Recent work in mouse visual cortex (VCtx) suggests that evoked firing rates, stimulus-response mutual information, and encoding efficiency increase when animals are engaged in movement. A disinhibitory circuit appears central this change: inhibitory neurons expressing vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) are activated during movement, and disinhibit pyramidal cells by suppressing other inhibitory interneurons. Paradoxically, although movement activates a similar disinhibitory circuit in auditory cortex (ACtx), most ACtx studies report reduced spiking during movement. It is unclear whether the resulting changes in spike rates result in corresponding changes in stimulus-response mutual information. We examined ACtx responses evoked by tone cloud stimuli, in awake mice of both sexes, during spontaneous movement and still conditions. VIP+ cells were optogenetically activated on half of trials, permitting independent analysis of the consequences of movement and VIP activation, as well as their intersection. Movement decreased stimulus-related spike rates as well as mutual information and encoding efficiency. VIP interneuron activation tended to increase stimulus-evoked spike rates but not stimulus-response mutual information, thus reducing encoding efficiency. The intersection of movement and VIP activation was largely consistent with a linear combination of these main effects: VIP activation recovered movement-induced reduction in spike rates, but not information transfer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The ability of the brain to represent information about the sensory environment is heavily influenced by the behavioral state of the animal. In visual cortex, it is well known that locomotor activity enhances visual stimulus processing. By contrast, the present study found that sound processing in auditory cortex is degraded during locomotor activity. Whereas enhanced stimulus processing in visual cortex is thought to depend on VIP+ interneuron activation, optogenetic activation of VIP+ interneurons in auditory cortex failed to improve stimulus processing. These findings imply that circuitry activated during movement has opposite influences on stimulus processing in visual and auditory cortices. Such differences could reflect a resource allocation shift during movement favoring spatial perception in service of the animal’s navigational needs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0026-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria are abundantly detected at the growth cone, the dynamic distal tip of developing axons that directs growth and guidance. It is however poorly understood how mitochondrial dynamics relate to growth cone behavior &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, and which mechanisms are responsible for anchoring mitochondria at the growth cone during axon pathfinding. Here, we show that in retinal axons elongating along the optic tract in zebrafish, mitochondria accumulate in the central area of the growth cone and are occasionally observed in filopodia extending from the growth cone periphery. Mitochondrial behavior at the growth cone &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; is dynamic, with mitochondrial positioning and anterograde transport strongly correlating with growth cone behavior and axon outgrowth. Using novel zebrafish mutant lines that lack the mitochondrial anchoring proteins Syntaphilin a and b, we further show that Syntaphilins contribute to mitochondrial immobilization at the growth cone. Syntaphilins are however not required for proper growth cone morphology and axon growth &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, indicating that Syntaphilin-mediated anchoring of mitochondria at the growth cone only plays a minor role in elongating axons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Proper axon elongation and pathfinding are essential for nervous system wiring. The growth cone, a dynamic structure at the distal end of axons, mediates axonal growth and guidance. Here, we describe for the first time &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; the behavior of mitochondria at the growth cone of elongating axons. We show that mitochondria accumulate in the growth cone central area and are also present in its periphery. We further provide evidence that Syntaphilin, which immobilizes mitochondria along mature axons, also docks mitochondria at the growth cone. However, loss of Syntaphilin did not cause a complete depletion of mitochondria from the growth cone and did not affect axon elongation, indicating that other mitochondria-docking factors regulate axon growth during development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: LSO:Ce Inorganic Scintillators Are Biocompatible With Neuronal and Circuit Function</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2019.00024</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Optogenetics is widely used in neuroscience to control neural circuits. However, non-invasive methods for light delivery in brain are needed to avoid physical damage caused by current methods. One potential strategy could employ x-ray activation of radioluminescent particles (RPLs), enabling localized light generation within the brain. RPLs composed of inorganic scintillators can emit light at various wavelengths depending upon composition. Cerium doped lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO:Ce), an inorganic scintillator that emits blue light in response to x-ray or ultraviolet (UV) stimulation, could potentially be used to control neural circuits through activation of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), a light-gated cation channel. Whether inorganic scintillators themselves negatively impact neuronal processes and synaptic function is unknown, and was investigated here using cellular, molecular, and electrophysiological approaches. As proof of principle, we applied UV stimulation to 4 μm LSO:Ce particles during whole-cell recording of CA1 pyramidal cells in acute hippocampal slices from mice that expressed ChR2 in glutamatergic neurons. We observed an increase in frequency and amplitude of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs), indicating activation of ChR2 and excitation of neurons. Importantly, LSO:Ce particles did not affect survival of primary mouse cortical neurons, even after 24 h of exposure. In extracellular dendritic field potential recordings, no change in the strength of basal glutamatergic transmission was observed during exposure to LSO:Ce microparticles. However, the amplitude of the fiber volley was slightly reduced with high stimulation. Additionally, there was a slight decrease in the frequency of sEPSCs in whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from CA1 pyramidal cells, with no change in current amplitudes. The amplitude and frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents were unchanged. Finally, long term potentiation (LTP), a synaptic modification believed to underlie learning and memory and a robust measure of synaptic integrity, was successfully induced, although the magnitude was slightly reduced. Together, these results show LSO:Ce particles are biocompatible even though there are modest effects on baseline synaptic function and long-term synaptic plasticity. Importantly, we show that light emitted from LSO:Ce particles is able to activate ChR2 and modify synaptic function. Therefore, LSO:Ce inorganic scintillators are potentially viable for use as a new light delivery system for optogenetics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00049</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability and is associated with increased risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), anxiety, ADHD, and epilepsy. While our understanding of FXS pathophysiology has improved, a lack of validated blood-based biomarkers of disease continues to impede bench-to-bedside efforts. To meet this demand, there is a growing effort to discover a reliable biomarker to inform treatment discovery and evaluate treatment target engagement. Such a marker, amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP), has shown potential dysregulation in the absence of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and may therefore be associated with FXS pathophysiology. While APP is best understood in the context of Alzheimer disease, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting the molecule and its derivatives play a broader role in regulating neuronal hyperexcitability, a well-characterized phenotype in FXS. To evaluate the viability of APP as a peripheral biological marker in FXS, we conducted an exploratory ELISA-based evaluation of plasma APP-related species involving 27 persons with FXS (mean age: 22.0 ± 11.5) and 25 age- and sex-matched persons with neurotypical development (mean age: 21.1 ± 10.7). Peripheral levels of both Aβ(1–40) and Aβ(1–42) were increased, while sAPPα was significantly decreased in persons with FXS as compared to control participants. These results suggest that dysregulated APP processing, with potential preferential β-secretase processing, may be a readily accessible marker of FXS pathophysiology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: IFNγ-Stimulated Dendritic Cell Exosomes for Treatment of Migraine Modeled Using Spreading Depression</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00942</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Migraine is a common headache disorder characterized by unilateral, intense headaches. In migraine with aura, the painful headache is preceded by focal neurological symptoms that can be visual, sensory, or motor in nature. Spreading depression (the most likely cause of migraine with aura and perhaps related headache pain) results in increased neuronal excitability and related increases in inflammation and production of reactive oxygen species. This in turn can promote the transformation of low-frequency, episodic migraine into higher-frequency and eventually chronic migraine. Though migraine affects 11% of adults worldwide, with 3% experiencing chronic headache, existing therapies offer only modest benefits. Here, we focus on the mechanisms by which environmental enrichment (i.e., volitionally increased intellectual, social, and physical activity) mitigates spreading depression. In prior work, we have shown that exposure to environmental enrichment reduces susceptibility to spreading depression in rats. This protective effect is at least in part due to environmental enrichment-mediated changes in the character of serum exosomes produced by circulating immune cells. We went on to show that environmental enrichment-mimetic exosomes can be produced by stimulating dendritic cells with low levels of interferon gamma (a cytokine that is phasically increased during environmental enrichment). Interferon gamma-stimulated dendritic cell exosomes (IFNγ-DC-Exos) significantly improve myelination and reduce oxidative stress when applied to hippocampal slice cultures. Here, we propose that they may also be effective against spreading depression. We found that administration of IFNγ-DC-Exos reduced susceptibility to spreading depression in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that IFNγ-DC-Exos may be a potential therapeutic for migraine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Moreover, although the brain has previously been regarded as an immune-privileged site, it is known to contain lymphatic vessels. Not only microglia but also lymphocytes regulate cognition and play a vital role in the formation of neuronal circuits. This review provides an overview of the function of immune cells and immune molecules in the CNS, with particular emphasis on their effect on neural developmental processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00914</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The enteric glia, a neural crest-derived cell type that composes the Enteric Nervous System, is involved in controlling gut functions, including motility, gut permeability, and neuronal communication. Moreover this glial cell could to give rise to new neurons. It is believed that enteric neurons are generated up to 21 days postnatally; however, adult gut cells with glial characteristics can give rise to new enteric neurons under certain conditions. The factors that activate this capability of enteric glia to differentiate into neurons remain unknown. Here, we followed the progress of this neuronal differentiation and investigated this ability by challenging enteric glial cells with different culture conditions. We found that, in vitro, enteric glial cells from the gut of adult and neonate mice have a high capability to acquire neuronal markers and undergoing morphological changes. In a co-culture system with 3T3 fibroblasts, the number of glial cells expressing βIIItubulin decreased after 7 days. The effect of 3T3-conditioned medium on adult cells was not significant, and fewer enteric glial cells from neonate mice began the neurogenic process in this medium. Laminin, an extracellular matrix protein that is highly expressed by the niche of the enteric ganglia, seemed to have a large role in inhibiting the differentiation of enteric glia, at least in cells from the adult gut. Our results suggest that, in an in vitro approach that provides conditions more similar to those of enteric glial cells in vivo, these cells could, to some extent, retain their morphology and marker expression, with their neurogenic potential inhibited. Importantly, laminin seemed to inhibit differentiation of adult enteric glial cells. It is possible that the differentiation of enteric glia into neurons is related to severe changes in the microenvironment, leading to disruption of the basement membrane. In summary, our data indicated that the interaction between the enteric glial cells and their microenvironment molecules significantly affects the control of their behavior and functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00060</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Multiple-Network Poroelastic Theory (MPET) is a numerical model to characterize the transport of multiple fluid networks in the brain, which overcomes the problem of conducting separate analyses on individual fluid compartments and losing the interactions between tissue and fluids, in addition to the interaction between the different fluids themselves. In this paper, the blood perfusion results from MPET modeling are partially validated using cerebral blood flow (CBF) data obtained from arterial spin labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which uses arterial blood water as an endogenous tracer to measure CBF. Two subjects—one healthy control and one patient with unilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) stenosis are included in the validation test. The comparison shows several similarities between CBF data from ASL and blood perfusion results from MPET modeling, such as higher blood perfusion in the gray matter than in the white matter, higher perfusion in the periventricular region for both the healthy control and the patient, and asymmetric distribution of blood perfusion for the patient. Although the partial validation is mainly conducted in a qualitative way, it is one important step toward the full validation of the MPET model, which has the potential to be used as a testing bed for hypotheses and new theories in neuroscience research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Berberine Protects C17.2 Neural Stem Cells From Oxidative Damage Followed by Inducing Neuronal Differentiation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00395</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegeneration is the loss of structure and/or function of neurons. Oxidative stress has been suggested as one of the common etiology in most of the neurodegenerative diseases. Previous studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of berberine in various neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. In this study, we hypothesized that berberine could protect C17.2 neural stem cells (NSCs) from 2,2′-Azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH)-induced oxidative damage then promote neuronal differentiation. AAPH was used to induce oxidative damage. After the damage, berberine protected C17.2 cells were kept cultured for another week in differentiation medium with/without berberine. Changes in cell morphology were detected by microscopy and cell viability was determined by MTT assay. Real-time PCR and western blot analysis were performed to confirm the associated pathways. Berberine was able to protect C17.2 NSCs from the oxidative damage. It lowered the cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in C17.2 cells via Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2-Related Factor 1/2 (NRF1/2) – NAD(P)H Quinone Dehydrogenase 1 (NQO-1) – Heme Oxygenase 1 (HO-1) pathway. It also down-regulated the apoptotic factors-Caspase 3 and Bcl2 Associated X (Bax) and upregulated the anti-apoptotic factor-Bcl2 to reduce cell apoptosis. Besides, berberine increased C17.2 cell viability via up-regulating Extracellular-signal-Related Kinase (ERK) and phosphor-Extracellular-signal-Related Kinase (pERK) expression. Then, berberine promoted C17.2 cell to differentiate into neurons and the differentiation mechanism involved the activation of WNT/β-catenin pathway as well as the upregulation of expression levels of pro-neural factors Achaete-Scute Complex-Like 1 (ASCL1), Neurogenin 1 (NeuroG1), Neuronal Differentiation 2 (NeuroD2) and Doublecortin (DCX). In conclusion, berberine protected C17.2 NSCs from oxidative damage then induced them to differentiate into neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Exosomes were applied to primary mouse cortical astrocyte or neuronal cultures prior to, and/or during, combined oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) injury. Cell death was assessed via lactate dehydrogenase (LHD) and propidium iodide staining 24 h after injury. NSC-derived exosomes afforded marked protection to astrocytes following OGD. A more modest (but significant) level of protection was observed with human iCM-derived exosomes applied to astrocytes, and with NSC-derived exosomes applied to primary neuronal cultures. In subsequent experiments, NSC-derived exosomes were injected intravenously into adult male mice 2 h after transient (1 h) middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Gross motor function was assessed 1 day after reperfusion and infarct volume was assessed 4 days after reperfusion. Mice treated post-stroke with intravenous NSC-derived exosomes exhibited significantly reduced infarct volumes. Together, these results suggest that exosomes isolated from mouse NSCs provide neuroprotection against experimental stroke possibly via preservation of astrocyte function. Intravenous NSC-derived exosome treatment may therefore provide a novel clinical adjuvant for stroke in the immediate post-injury period.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Effects of Acute Exercise Duration on the Inhibition Aspect of Executive Function in Late Middle-Aged Adults</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00227</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: This study investigated whether acute exercise duration affects inhibition in late middle-aged adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Over four separate days, 40 late middle-aged adults completed, in a counterbalanced order, three exercise sessions consisting of single bouts of moderate-to-vigorous intensity cycling, with the main acute exercise durations being 10, 20, and 45 min, and a control session consisting of 30 min of reading. Their inhibition performance was then evaluated by administration of the Stroop test following each session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The participants had shorter mean response times for both the congruent and neutral conditions of the Stroop following the acute exercise lasting 20 min than they did after the control session. The acute exercise lasting 20 min also resulted in shorter response times for both conditions of the Stroop than the acute exercise lasting only 10 min. Meanwhile, the acute exercise lasting 45 min resulted in a shorter mean response time for the neutral Stroop condition than did the control session. Finally, the acute exercise lasting 20 min resulted in the shortest mean response time of all four sessions for the Stroop incongruent condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The above findings suggest that the moderate-to-vigorous intensity acute exercise lasting 20 min facilitated multiple cognitive function domains in general, whereas the exercise sessions of shorter and longer duration had negligible effects on executive function in the late middle-aged adults. These results highlight the need to consider the duration of any moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise when developing acute exercise programs to facilitate executive function in aged populations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Age-Dependent Relationship Between Plasma Aβ40 and Aβ42 and Total Tau Levels in Cognitively Normal Subjects</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00222</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Both amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are pathological hallmarks in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the constituents of these hallmarks, amyloid beta (Aβ) 40, Aβ42, and total Tau (t-Tau), have been detected in the blood of cognitively normal subjects by using an immunomagnetic reduction (IMR) assay. Whether these levels are age-dependent is not known, and their interrelation remains undefined. We determined the levels of these biomarkers in cognitively normal subjects of different age groups. A total of 391 cognitively normal subjects aged 23–91 were enrolled from hospitals in Asia, Europe, and North America. Healthy cognition was evaluated by NIA-AA guidelines to exclude subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD and by cognitive assessment using the Mini Mental State Examination and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). We examined the effect of age on plasma levels of Aβ40, Aβ42, and t-Tau and the relationship between these biomarkers during aging. Additionally, we explored age-related reference intervals for each biomarker. Plasma t-Tau and Aβ42 levels had modest but significant correlations with chronological age (r = 0.127, p = 0.0120 for t-Tau; r = −0.126, p = 0.0128 for Aβ42), ranging from ages 23 to 91. Significant positive correlations were detected between Aβ42 and t-Tau in the groups aged 50 years and older, with Rho values ranging from 0.249 to 0.474. Significant negative correlations were detected between Aβ40 and t-Tau from age 40 to 91 (r ranged from −0.293 to −0.582) and between Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the age groups of 30–39 (r = −0.562, p = 0.0235), 50–59 (r = −0.261, p = 0.0142), 60–69 (r = −0.303, p = 0.0004), and 80–91 (r = 0.459, p = 0.0083). We also provided age-related reference intervals for each biomarker. In this multicenter study, age had weak but significant effects on the levels of Aβ42 and t-Tau in plasma. However, the age group defined by decade revealed the emergence of a relationship between Aβ40, Aβ42, and t-Tau in the 6th and 7th decades. Validation of our findings in a large-scale and longitudinal study is warranted.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Early olfactory pathway responses to the presentation of an odor exhibit
remarkably similar characteristics across phyla from insects to mammals, and
frequently involve transitions among quiescence, collective network
oscillations, and asynchronous firing. We investigate whether a robust
bifurcation structure can describe such transitions, and take the locust, which
appears to have one of the simpler early olfactory pathway architectures, as a
representative example. Using an integrate-and-fire (I\&amp;amp;F) model, we reproduce
relevant results of both experimental measurements and detailed models of early
olfaction dynamics and odor discrimination. By further idealizing the I\&amp;amp;F
description and finally reducing it to a firing-rate (FR) model, we find the
bifurcation structure underlying a transition typical of the early odor
response to be a slow passage through a saddle-node-on-an-invariant-circle
(SNIC) bifurcation, which arises due to the interaction among the fast-varying
excitation and fast and slowly-varying inhibition.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.11463</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Study Objective: Sleep is reflected not only in the electroencephalogram but
also in heart rhythms and breathing patterns. Therefore, we hypothesize that it
is possible to accurately stage sleep based on the electrocardiogram (ECG) and
respiratory signals. Methods: Using a dataset including 8,682 polysomnographs,
we develop deep neural networks to stage sleep from ECG and respiratory
signals. Five deep neural networks consisting of convolutional networks and
long short-term memory networks are trained to stage sleep using heart and
breathing, including the timing of R peaks from ECG, abdominal and chest
respiratory effort, and the combinations of these signals. Results: ECG in
combination with the abdominal respiratory effort achieve the best performance
for staging all five sleep stages with a Cohen's kappa of 0.600 (95% confidence
interval 0.599 -- 0.602); and 0.762 (0.760 -- 0.763) for discriminating awake
vs. rapid eye movement vs. non-rapid eye movement sleep. The performance is
better for young participants and for those with a low apnea-hypopnea index,
while it is robust for commonly used outpatient medications. Conclusions: Our
results validate that ECG and respiratory effort provide substantial
information about sleep stages in a large population. It opens new
possibilities in sleep research and applications where electroencephalography
is not readily available or may be infeasible, such as in critically ill
patients.

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00931</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The underlying pathomechanisms for glaucoma, one of the most common causes of blindness worldwide, are still not identified. In addition to increased intraocular pressure (IOP), oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and immunological processes seem to play a role. Several pharmacological or molecular/genetic methods are currently investigated as treatment options for this disease. Altered autoantibody levels were detected in serum, aqueous humor, and tissue sections of glaucoma patients. To further analyze the role of the immune system, an IOP-independent, experimental autoimmune glaucoma (EAG) animal model was developed. In this model, immunization with ocular antigens leads to antibody depositions, misdirected T-cells, retinal ganglion cell death and degeneration of the optic nerve, similar to glaucomatous degeneration in patients. Moreover, an activation of the complement system and microglia alterations were identified in the EAG as well as in ocular hypertension models. The inhibition of these factors can alleviate degeneration in glaucoma models with and without high IOP. Currently, several neuroprotective approaches are tested in distinct models. It is necessary to have systems that cover underlying pathomechanisms, but also allow for the screening of new drugs. In vitro models are commonly used, including single cell lines, mixed-cultures, and even organoids. In ex vivo organ cultures, pathomechanisms as well as therapeutics can be investigated in the whole retina. Furthermore, animal models reveal insights in the in vivo situation. With all these models, several possible new drugs and therapy strategies were tested in the last years. For example, hypothermia treatment, neurotrophic factors or the blockage of excitotoxity. However, further studies are required to reveal the pressure independent pathomechanisms behind glaucoma. There is still an open issue whether immune mechanisms directly or indirectly trigger cell death pathways. Hence, it might be an imbalance between protective and destructive immune mechanisms. Moreover, identified therapy options have to be evaluated in more detail, since deeper insights could lead to better treatment options for glaucoma patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The reason for this is that networks that conform to hyperbolic geometry are maximally responsive to external and internal perturbations. These networks also allow for efficient communication under conditions where nodes are added or removed. We will argue that one of the signatures of hyperbolic geometry is the celebrated Zipf’s law (also sometimes known as the Pareto distribution) that states that the probability to observe a given pattern is inversely related to its rank. Zipf’s law is observed in a variety of biological systems — from protein sequences, neural networks to economics. These observations provide further evidence for the ubiquity of networks with an underlying hyperbolic metric structure. Recent studies in neuroscience specifically point to the relevance of a three-dimensional hyperbolic space for neural signaling. The three-dimensional hyperbolic space may confer additional robustness compared to other dimensions. We illustrate how the use of hyperbolic coordinates revealed a novel topographic organization within the olfactory system. The use of such coordinates may facilitate representation of relevant signals elsewhere in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To longitudinally evaluate the role of depression in the development of impulse control disorders (ICDs) in Parkinson disease (PD) patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative, we included PD patients without ICDs at baseline according to the Questionnaire for Impulsive‐Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's Disease (QUIP). Patients were prospectively evaluated first quarterly and then biannually. Development of an ICD was defined as an increase in QUIP scores during follow‐up. Using survival proportional hazard models, we studied the effect of baseline depression on ICD risk. We also evaluated this effect controlling for dopamine agonist use as a time‐dependent variable and for other potential confounders.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among 354 patients, 68 were depressed at baseline. The median follow‐up was 4.08 years. Depression at baseline was associated with higher ICD risk (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.32–2.9, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). This risk remained significant after controlling for dopamine agonist use (HR = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.33–2.9, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), which was also independently linked to ICD development (HR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.3–2.7, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Therefore, depressed patients faced an even higher ICD risk when receiving dopamine agonists. Controlling for multiple potential confounders did not alter these results.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression predisposes to the development of ICDs in PD. This risk is magnified by dopamine agonists. Dopamine agonists should thus be used cautiously in depressed PD patients. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Toxin production spontaneously becomes regulated by local cell density in evolving bacterial populations</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/bdSt5cEKecc/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Hilje M. Doekes, Rob J. de Boer, Rutger Hermsen&lt;/p&gt;

The production of anticompetitor toxins is widespread among bacteria. Because production of such toxins is costly, it is typically regulated. In particular, many toxins are produced only when the local cell density is high. It is unclear which selection pressures shaped the evolution of density-dependent regulation of toxin production. Here, we study the evolution of toxin production, resistance and the response to a cell-density cue in a model of an evolving bacterial population with spatial structure. We present results for two growth regimes: (i) an undisturbed, fixed habitat in which only small fluctuations of cell density occur, and (ii) a serial-transfer regime with large fluctuations in cell density. We find that density-dependent toxin production can evolve under both regimes. However, the selection pressures driving the evolution of regulation differ. In the fixed habitat, regulation evolves because it allows cells to produce toxin only when opportunities for reproduction are highly limited (because of a high local cell density), and the effective fitness costs of toxin production are hence low. Under serial transfers, regulation evolves because it allows cells to switch from a fast-growing non-toxic phenotype when colonising a new habitat, to a slower-growing competitive toxic phenotype when the cell density increases. Colonies of such regulating cells rapidly expand into unoccupied space because their edges consist of fast-growing, non-toxin-producing cells, but are also combative because cells at the interfaces with competing colonies do produce toxin. Because under the two growth regimes different types of regulation evolve, our results underscore the importance of growth conditions in the evolution of social behaviour in bacteria.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bdSt5cEKecc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Dark-matter matters: Discriminating subtle blood cancers using the darkest DNA</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Laxmi Parida, Claudia Haferlach, Kahn Rhrissorrakrai, Filippo Utro, Chaya Levovitz, Wolfgang Kern, Niroshan Nadarajah, Sven Twardziok, Stephan Hutter, Manja Meggendorfer, Wencke Walter, Constance Baer, Torsten Haferlach&lt;/p&gt;

The confluence of deep sequencing and powerful machine learning is providing an unprecedented peek at the darkest of the dark genomic matter, the non-coding genomic regions lacking any functional annotation. While deep sequencing uncovers rare tumor variants, the heterogeneity of the disease confounds the best of machine learning (ML) algorithms. Here we set out to answer if the dark-matter of the genome encompass signals that can distinguish the fine subtypes of disease that are otherwise gnomically indistinguishable. We introduce a novel stochastic regularization, &lt;i&gt;ReVeaL&lt;/i&gt;, that empowers ML to discriminate subtle cancer subtypes even from the same ‘cell of origin’. Analogous to &lt;i&gt;heritability&lt;/i&gt;, implicitly defined on whole genome, we use &lt;i&gt;predictability (F&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;i&gt;score)&lt;/i&gt; definable on portions of the genome. In an effort to distinguish cancer subtypes using dark-matter DNA, we applied &lt;i&gt;ReVeaL&lt;/i&gt; to a new WGS dataset from 727 patient samples with seven forms of hematological cancers and assessed the predictivity over several genomic regions including genic, non-dark, non-coding, non-genic, and dark. ReVeaL enabled improved discrimination of cancer subtypes for all segments of the genome. The non-genic, non-coding and dark-matter had the highest F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; scores, with dark-matter having the highest level of predictability. Based on ReVeaL’s predictability of different genomic regions, dark-matter contains enough signal to significantly discriminate fine subtypes of disease. Hence, the agglomeration of rare variants, even in the hitherto unannotated and ill-understood regions of the genome, may play a substantial role in the disease etiology and deserve much more attention.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AWa3f49FujM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Mechanical properties of tubulin intra- and inter-dimer interfaces and their implications for microtubule dynamic instability</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/KXXAwMSsDkU/article</link>

Thirteen tubulin protofilaments, made of αβ-tubulin heterodimers, interact laterally to produce cytoskeletal microtubules. Microtubules exhibit the striking property of dynamic instability, manifested in their intermittent growth and shrinkage at both ends. This behavior is key to many cellular processes, such as cell division, migration, maintenance of cell shape, etc. Although assembly and disassembly of microtubules is known to be linked to hydrolysis of a guanosine triphosphate molecule in the pocket of β-tubulin, detailed mechanistic understanding of corresponding conformational changes is still lacking. Here we take advantage of the recent generation of in-microtubule structures of tubulin to examine the properties of protofilaments, which serve as important microtubule assembly and disassembly intermediates. We find that initially straight tubulin protofilaments, relax to similar non-radially curved and slightly twisted conformations. Our analysis further suggests that guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis primarily affects the flexibility and conformation of the inter-dimer interface, without a strong impact on the shape or flexibility of αβ-heterodimer. Inter-dimer interfaces are significantly more flexible compared to intra-dimer interfaces. We argue that such a difference in flexibility could be key for distinct stability of the plus and minus microtubule ends. The higher flexibility of the inter-dimer interface may have implications for development of pulling force by curving tubulin protofilaments during microtubule disassembly, a process of major importance for chromosome motions in mitosis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KXXAwMSsDkU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Fast uncertainty quantification for dynamic flux balance analysis using non-smooth polynomial chaos expansions</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/WoA4fVMQy_w/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Joel A. Paulson, Marc Martin-Casas, Ali Mesbah&lt;/p&gt;

We present a novel surrogate modeling method that can be used to accelerate the solution of uncertainty quantification (UQ) problems arising in nonlinear and non-smooth models of biological systems. In particular, we focus on dynamic flux balance analysis (DFBA) models that couple intracellular fluxes, found from the solution of a constrained metabolic network model of the cellular metabolism, to the time-varying nature of the extracellular substrate and product concentrations. DFBA models are generally computationally expensive and present unique challenges to UQ, as they entail dynamic simulations with discrete events that correspond to switches in the active set of the solution of the constrained intracellular model. The proposed non-smooth polynomial chaos expansion (nsPCE) method is an extension of traditional PCE that can effectively capture singularities in the DFBA model response due to the occurrence of these discrete events. The key idea in nsPCE is to use a model of the singularity time to partition the parameter space into two elements on which the model response behaves smoothly. Separate PCE models are then fit in both elements using a basis-adaptive sparse regression approach that is known to scale well with respect to the number of uncertain parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of nsPCE on a DFBA model of an &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; monoculture that consists of 1075 reactions and 761 metabolites. We first illustrate how traditional PCE is unable to handle problems of this level of complexity. We demonstrate that over 800-fold savings in computational cost of uncertainty propagation and Bayesian estimation of parameters in the substrate uptake kinetics can be achieved by using the nsPCE surrogates in place of the full DFBA model simulations. We then investigate the scalability of the nsPCE method by utilizing it for global sensitivity analysis and maximum a posteriori estimation in a synthetic metabolic network problem with a larger number of parameters related to both intracellular and extracellular quantities.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WoA4fVMQy_w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Capillaries are the prime location for oxygen and nutrient exchange in all tissues. Despite their fundamental role, our knowledge of perfusion and flow regulation in cortical capillary beds is still limited. Here, we use &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; measurements and blood flow simulations in anatomically accurate microvascular network to investigate the impact of red blood cells (RBCs) on microvascular flow. Based on these &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; experiments, we show that the impact of RBCs leads to a bias toward equation the values of the outflow velocities at divergent capillary bifurcations, for which we coin the term “&lt;i&gt;well-balanced bifurcations&lt;/i&gt;”. Our simulation results further reveal that hematocrit heterogeneity is directly caused by the RBC dynamics, i.e. by their unequal partitioning at bifurcations and their effect on vessel resistance. These results provide the first &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; evidence of the impact of RBC dynamics on the flow field in the cortical microvasculature. By structural and functional analyses of our blood flow simulations we show that capillary diameter changes locally alter flow and RBC distribution. A dilation of 10% along a vessel length of 100 μm increases the flow on average by 21% in the dilated vessel downstream a &lt;i&gt;well-balanced bifurcation&lt;/i&gt;. The number of RBCs rises on average by 27%. Importantly, RBC up-regulation proves to be more effective the more balanced the outflow velocities at the upstream bifurcation are. Taken together, we conclude that diameter changes at capillary level bear potential to locally change the flow field and the RBC distribution. Moreover, our results suggest that the balancing of outflow velocities contributes to the robustness of perfusion. Based on our &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; results, we anticipate that the bi-phasic nature of blood and small-scale regulations are essential for a well-adjusted oxygen and energy substrate supply.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/80S8CKzXATk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00043</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;One fundamental feature of consciousness is that the contents of consciousness depend on the state of consciousness. Here, we propose an answer to why this is so: both the state and the contents of consciousness depend on the activity of cortical layer 5 pyramidal (L5p) neurons. These neurons affect both cortical and thalamic processing, hence coupling the cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical loops with each other. Functionally this coupling corresponds to the coupling between the state and the contents of consciousness. Together the cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical loops form a thalamo-cortical broadcasting system, where the L5p cells are the central elements. This perspective makes one quite specific prediction: cortical processing that does not include L5p neurons will be unconscious. More generally, the present perspective suggests that L5p neurons have a central role in the mechanisms underlying consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Sensitivity of Single-Trial Mu-Suppression Detection for Motor Imagery Performance as Compared to Motor Execution and Motor Observation Performance</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00302</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Motor imagery (MI) has been widely used to operate brain-computer interface (BCI) systems for rehabilitation and some life assistive devices. However, the current performance of an MI-based BCI cannot fully meet the needs of its in-field applications. Most of the BCIs utilizing a generalized feature for all participants have been found to greatly hamper the efficacy of the BCI system. Hence, some attempts have made on the exploration of subject-dependent parameters, but it remains challenging to enhance BCI performance as expected. To this end, in this study, we used the independent component analysis (ICA), which has been proved capable of isolating the pure motor-related component from non-motor-related brain processes and artifacts and extracting the common motor-related component across MI, motor execution (ME), and motor observation (MO) conditions. Then, a sliding window approach was used to detect significant mu-suppression from the baseline using the electroencephalographic (EEG) alpha power time course and, thus, the success rate of the mu-suppression detection could be assessed on a single-trial basis. By comparing the success rates using different parameters, we further quantified the extent of the improvement in each motor condition to evaluate the effectiveness of both generalized and individualized parameters. The results showed that in ME condition, the success rate under individualized latency and that under generalized latency was 90.0% and 77.75%, respectively; in MI condition, the success rate was 74.14% for individual latency and 58.47% for generalized latency, and in MO condition, the success rate was 67.89% and 61.26% for individual and generalized latency, respectively. As can be seen, the success rate in each motor condition was significantly improved by utilizing an individualized latency compared to that using the generalized latency. Moreover, the comparison of the individualized window latencies for the mu-suppression detection across different runs of the same participant as well as across different participants showed that the window latency was significantly more consistent in the intra-subject than in the inter-subject settings. As a result, we proposed that individualizing the latency for detecting the mu-suppression feature for each participant might be a promising attempt to improve the MI-based BCI performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Neural Efficiency of Human–Robotic Feedback Modalities Under Stress Differs With Gender</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00287</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sensory feedback, which can be presented in different modalities – single and combined, aids task performance in human–robotic interaction (HRI). However, combining feedback modalities does not always lead to optimal performance. Indeed, it is not known how feedback modalities affect operator performance under stress. Furthermore, there is limited information on how feedback affects neural processes differently for males and females and under stress. This is a critical gap in the literature, particularly in the domain of surgical robotics, where surgeons are under challenging socio-technical environments that burden them physiologically. In the present study, we posited operator performance as the summation of task performance and neurophysiological cost of maintaining that performance. In a within-subject design, we used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to assess cerebral activations of 12 participants who underwent a 3D manipulation task within a virtual environment with concurrent feedback (visual and visual + haptic) in the presence and absence of a cognitive stressor. Cognitive stress was induced with the serial-7 subtraction test. We found that while task performance was higher with visual than visual + haptic feedback, it degraded under stress. The two feedback modalities were found to be associated with varying neural activities and neural efficiencies, and these were stress- and gender-dependent. Our findings engender further investigation into effectiveness of feedback modalities on males and females under stressful conditions in HRI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Reversal of Cognitive Impairment in gp120 Transgenic Mice by the Removal of the p75 Neurotrophin Receptor</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00398</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Activation of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), by the proneurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (proBDNF), triggers loss of synapses and promotes neuronal death. These pathological features are also caused by the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV) envelope protein gp120, which increases the levels of proBDNF. To establish whether p75NTR plays a role in gp120-mediated neurite pruning, we exposed primary cultures of cortical neurons from p75NTR&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice to gp120. We found that the lack of p75NTR expression significantly reduced gp120-mediated neuronal cell death. To determine whether knocking down p75NTR is neuroprotective in vivo, we intercrossed gp120 transgenic (tg) mice with p75NTR heterozygous mice to obtain gp120tg mice lacking one or two p75NTR alleles. The removal of p75NTR alleles inhibited gp120-mediated decrease of excitatory synapses in the hippocampus, as measured by the levels of PSD95 and subunits of the N-methyl-D-Aspartate receptor in synaptosomes. Moreover, the deletion of only one copy of the p75NTR gene was sufficient to restore the cognitive impairment observed in gp120tg mice. Our data suggest that activation of p75NTR is one of the mechanisms crucial for the neurotoxic effect of gp120. These data indicate that p75NTR antagonists could provide an adjunct therapy against synaptic simplification caused by HIV.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The brain is the most functionally organized structure of all organs. It manages behavior, perception and higher cognitive functions. The WWOX gene is non-classical tumor suppressor gene, which has been shown to have an impact on proliferation, apoptosis and migration processes. Moreover, genetic aberrations in WWOX induce severe neuropathological phenotypes in humans and rodents. The aim of the present study was to investigate in detail the impact of WWOX on human neural progenitor cell (hNPC) maintenance and how depletion of WWOX disturbs signaling pathways playing a pivotal role in neuronal differentiation and central nervous system (CNS) organogenesis. hNPC with a silenced WWOX gene exhibited lowered mitochondrial redox potential, enhanced adhesion to fibronectin and extracellular matrix protein mixture, downregulation of MMP2/9 expression and impaired 3D growth. Global transcriptome analysis using cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) found that WWOX downregulation significantly changes the expression of multiple genes engaged in cytoskeleton organization, adhesion, cell signaling and chromatin remodeling. The massive changes in gene expression caused by WWOX silencing may strongly affect the differentiation and migration of neurons in organogenesis, brain injury, cancerogenesis or neurodifferentiation. WWOX gene appears to be an important regulator of neural tissue architecture and function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00237</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Acupuncture therapy (AT) is a non-pharmacological method of treatment that has been applied to various neurological diseases. However, studies on its longitudinal effect on the neural mechanisms of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) for treatment purposes are still lacking in the literature. In this clinical study, we assess the longitudinal effects of ATs on MCI patients using two methods: (i) Montreal Cognitive Assessment test (MoCA-K, Korean version), and (ii) the hemodynamic response (HR) analyses using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). fNIRS signals of a working memory (WM) task were acquired from the prefrontal cortex. Twelve elderly MCI patients and 12 healthy people were recruited as target and healthy control (HC) groups, respectively. Each group went through an fNIRS scanning procedure three times: The initial data were obtained without any ATs, and subsequently a total of 24 AT sessions were conducted for MCI patients (i.e., MCI-0: the data prior to ATs, MCI-1: after 12 sessions of ATs for 6 weeks, MCI-2: another 12 sessions of ATs for 6 weeks). The mean HR responses of all MCI-0–2 cases were lower than those of HCs. To compare the effects of AT on MCI patients, MoCA-K results, temporal HR data, and spatial activation patterns (i.e., t-maps) were examined. In addition, analyses of functional connectivity (FC) and graph theory upon WM tasks were conducted. With ATs, (i) the averaged MoCA-K test scores were improved (MCI-1, p = 0.002; MCI-2, p = 2.9e&lt;sup&gt;–4&lt;/sup&gt;); (ii) the mean HR response of WM tasks was increased (p &amp;lt; 0.001); and (iii) the t-maps of MCI-1 and MCI-2 were enhanced. Furthermore, an increased FC in the prefrontal cortex in both MCI-1/MCI-2 cases in comparison to MCI-0 was obtained (p &amp;lt; 0.01), and an increasing trend in the graph theory parameters was observed. All these findings reveal that ATs have a positive impact on improving the cognitive function of MCI patients. In conclusion, ATs can be used as a therapeutic tool for MCI patients as a non-pharmacological method (Clinical trial registration number: KCT 0002451 https://cris.nih.go.kr/cris/en/).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Microglia in Alzheimer Disease: Well-Known Targets and New Opportunities</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00233</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microglia are the resident macrophages of the central nervous system. They play key roles in brain development, and physiology during life and aging. Equipped with a variety of molecular sensors and through the various functions they can fulfill, they are critically involved in maintaining the brain’s homeostasis. In Alzheimer disease (AD), microglia reaction was initially thought to be incidental and triggered by amyloid deposits and dystrophic neurites. However, recent genome-wide association studies have established that the majority of AD risk loci are found in or near genes that are highly and sometimes uniquely expressed in microglia. This leads to the concept of microglia being critically involved in the early steps of the disease and identified them as important potential therapeutic targets. Whether microglia reaction is beneficial, detrimental or both to AD progression is still unclear and the subject of intense debate. In this review, we are presenting a state-of-knowledge report intended to highlight the variety of microglial functions and pathways shown to be critically involved in AD progression. We first address both the acquisition of new functions and the alteration of their homeostatic roles by reactive microglia. Second, we propose a summary of new important parameters currently emerging in the field that need to be considered to identify relevant microglial targets. Finally, we discuss the many obstacles in designing efficient therapeutic strategies for AD and present innovative technologies that may foster our understanding of microglia roles in the pathology. Ultimately, this work aims to fly over various microglial functions to make a general and reliable report of the current knowledge regarding microglia’s involvement in AD and of the new research opportunities in the field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00231</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The analysis of global and comparative genomics between different diseases allows us to understand the key biological processes that explain the etiology of these pathologies. We have used this type of approach to evaluate the expression of several neurodegeneration-related genes on the development of tumors, particularly brain tumors of glial origin (gliomas), which are an aggressive and incurable type of cancer. We have observed that genes involved in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), as well as in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, correlate with better prognosis of gliomas. Within these genes, high Tau/MAPT expression shows the strongest correlation with several indicators of prolonged survival on glioma patients. Tau protein regulates microtubule stability and dynamics in neurons, although there have been reports of its expression in glial cells and also in gliomas. However, little is known about the regulation of Tau/MAPT transcription in tumors. Moreover, our in silico analysis indicates that this gene is also expressed in a variety of tumors, showing a general correlation with survival, although its function in cancer has not yet been addressed. Another remarkable aspect of Tau is its involvement in resistance to taxanes in various tumors types such as breast, ovarian and gastric carcinomas. This is due to the fact that taxanes have the same tubulin-binding site as Tau. In the present work we review the main knowledge about Tau function and expression in tumors, with a special focus on brain cancer. We will also speculate with the therapeutic implications of these findings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Despite much efforts in the last few decades, the mechanism of degeneration of dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) in Parkinson’s disease (PD) remains unclear. This represents a major knowledge gap in idiopathic and genetic forms of PD. Among various possible key factors postulated, iron metabolism has been widely suggested to be involved with fueling oxidative stress, a known factor in the pathogenesis of PD. However, the correlation between iron and DA neuron loss, specifically in the SN, has not been described in experimental animal models with great detail, with most studies utilizing rodents and, rarely, non-human primates. In the present study, aiming to gain further evidence of a pathological role of iron in PD, we have examined the correlation of iron with DA neuron loss in a non-human primate model of PD induced by MPTP. We report a significant iron accumulation accompanied by both DA degeneration in the SN and motor deficits in the monkey that displayed the most severe PD pathology and behavioral deficits. The other two monkeys subjected to MPTP displayed less severe PD pathologies and motor deficits, however, their SN iron levels were significantly lower than controls. These findings suggest that high iron may indicate and contribute to heightened MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced PD pathology in late or severe stages of PD, while depressed levels of iron may signal an early stage of disease. Similarly, using a cell culture preparation, we have found that high doses of ferric ammonium citrate (FAC), a factor known to enhance iron accumulation, increased MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced cell death in U251 and SH-SY5Y cells, and even in control cells. However, at low dose FAC restored or increased the viability of U251 and SH-SY5Y cells in the absence or presence of MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. These observations imply that high levels of iron likely contribute to or heighten MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; toxicity in the later stages of PD. While we report reduced iron levels in the earlier stages of MPTP induced PD, the significance of these changes remains to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: A Computational Model of Oxytocin Modulation of Olfactory Recognition Memory</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/4/ENEURO.0201-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Social recognition in mammals depends on complex interactions between sensory and other brain areas as well as modulatory inputs by specific neuropeptides such as oxytocin (OXT). Social recognition memory specifically has been shown to depend among others on olfactory processing, and can be probed using methods similar to those used when probing non-social odor memory. We here use a computational model of two interconnected olfactory networks in the mouse, the olfactory bulb (OB) and anterior olfactory nucleus, to propose a mechanism for olfactory short-term recognition memory and its modulation in social situations. Based on previous experiments, we propose one early locus for memory to be the OB. During social encounters in mice, pyramidal cells in the anterior olfactory nucleus, themselves driven by olfactory input, are rendered more excitable by OXT release, resulting in stronger feedback to OB local interneurons. This additional input to the OB creates stronger dynamics and improves signal-to-noise ratio of odor responses in the OB proper. As a consequence, mouse social olfactory memories are more strongly encoded and their duration is modulated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Postinjury Inhibition of miR-181a Promotes Restoration of Hippocampal CA1 Neurons after Transient Forebrain Ischemia in Rats</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/4/ENEURO.0002-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating postinjury neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus remain undefined. We have previously demonstrated that preinjury treatment with anti-microRNA (miR)-181a preserved neurons and prevented astrocyte dysfunction in the hippocampal cornu ammonis-1 (CA1) following transient forebrain ischemia. In the present study, we assessed postinjury treatment with anti-miR-181a on recovery of CA1 neurons following transient forebrain ischemia in rats. Stereotactic CA1 injection of miR-181a antagomir at either 2 h or 7 d postinjury resulted in improved restoration of CA1 measured at 28 d postinjury. Treatment with antagomir was associated with overexpression of the mir-181a target cell adhesion-associated, oncogene-related protein and enhanced expression of the neuroprogenitor cell marker doublecortin (DCX) in the CA1. Assessment of GFAP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cell fate by Cre/Lox-mediated deletion demonstrated that some GFAP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in CA1 exhibited &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; DCX expression in response to injury. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments using primary neuronal stem cells confirmed that miR-181a inhibition augmented the expression of DCX and directed cellular differentiation toward a neuronal fate. These results suggest that miR-181a inhibition plays a central role in the restoration of CA1 neurons via augmentation of early latent neurogenic gene activation in neural progenitor cells, including some reactive astrocytes. Therapeutic interventions targeting this restorative process may represent a novel postinjury approach to improve clinical outcomes in survivors of forebrain ischemia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine whether cerebrovascular risk factors are associated with subsequent diagnoses of Parkinson disease, and whether these associations are similar in magnitude to those with subsequent diagnoses of Alzheimer disease.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a retrospective cohort study using claims data from a 5% random sample of Medicare beneficiaries from 2008 to 2015. The exposures were stroke, atrial fibrillation, coronary disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, valvular heart disease, tobacco use, and alcohol abuse. The primary outcome was a new diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson disease. The secondary outcome was a new diagnosis of Alzheimer disease. Marginal structural Cox models adjusting for time‐dependent confounding were used to characterize the association between exposures and outcomes. We also evaluated the association between cerebrovascular risk factors and subsequent renal colic (negative control).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among 1,035,536 Medicare beneficiaries followed for a mean of 5.2 years, 15,531 (1.5%) participants were diagnosed with Parkinson disease and 81,974 (7.9%) were diagnosed with Alzheimer disease. Most evaluated cerebrovascular risk factors, including prior stroke (hazard ratio = 1.55; 95% confidence interval = 1.39–1.72), were associated with the subsequent diagnosis of Parkinson disease. The magnitudes of these associations were similar, but attenuated, to the associations between cerebrovascular risk factors and Alzheimer disease. Confirming the validity of our analytical model, most cerebrovascular risk factors were not associated with the subsequent diagnosis of renal colic.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cerebrovascular risk factors are associated with Parkinson disease, an effect comparable to their association with Alzheimer disease. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Depalmitoylation by Palmitoyl-Protein Thioesterase 1 in Neuronal Health and Degeneration</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2019.00025</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Protein palmitoylation is the post-translational, reversible addition of a 16-carbon fatty acid, palmitate, to proteins. Protein palmitoylation has recently garnered much attention, as it robustly modifies the localization and function of canonical signaling molecules and receptors. Protein depalmitoylation, on the other hand, is the process by which palmitic acid is removed from modified proteins and contributes, therefore, comparably to palmitoylated-protein dynamics. Palmitoylated proteins also require depalmitoylation prior to lysosomal degradation, demonstrating the significance of this process in protein sorting and turnover. Palmitoylation and depalmitoylation serve as particularly crucial regulators of protein function in neurons, where a specialized molecular architecture and cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains contribute to synaptic transmission. Three classes of depalmitoylating enzymes are currently recognized, the acyl protein thioesterases, α/β hydrolase domain-containing 17 proteins (ABHD17s), and the palmitoyl-protein thioesterases (PPTs). However, a clear picture of depalmitoylation has not yet emerged, in part because the enzyme-substrate relationships and specific functions of depalmitoylation are only beginning to be uncovered. Further, despite the finding that loss-of-function mutations affecting palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1) function cause a severe pediatric neurodegenerative disease, the role of PPT1 as a depalmitoylase has attracted relatively little attention. Understanding the role of depalmitoylation by PPT1 in neuronal function is a fertile area for ongoing basic science and translational research that may have broader therapeutic implications for neurodegeneration. Here, we will briefly introduce the rapidly growing field surrounding protein palmitoylation and depalmitoylation, then will focus on the role of PPT1 in development, health, and neurological disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Glucocorticoid-Driven NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation in Hippocampal Microglia Mediates Chronic Stress-Induced Depressive-Like Behaviors</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00210</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chronic stress is a key risk factor for depression, and microglia have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease. Recent studies show that the Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is expressed in microglia and may play a crucial role in depression. However, the mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in hippocampal microglia and its role in depressive-like behaviors remain poorly understood. In this study, rats were subjected to 6 h of restraint stress per day for 21 days to produce a model of stress-induced depression. Behavioral tests and serum corticosterone were used to assess the success of the model. Furthermore, HAPI cells were pretreated with dexamethasone (5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–7&lt;/sup&gt; M) to assess stress-induced changes in microglial cells in culture. The microglial marker Iba-1, reactive oxygen species (ROS), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and key components of the NLRP3 inflammasome and its downstream inflammatory effectors (IL-1β and IL-18) were measured. Chronic stress induced depressive-like behavior, increased serum corticosterone levels and produced hippocampal structural changes. Chronic stress and dexamethasone both increased Iba-1 expression and ROS formation and also elevated levels of NF-κB, NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1, IL-1β and IL-18. After use of the NF-κB inhibitor BAY 117082 and knocked out NLRP3 in vitro decreased ROS formation and the expression of Iba-1, NF-κB and NLRP3 as well as levels of cleaved caspase-1, IL-1β and IL-18. These findings suggest that activation of the glucocorticoid receptor-NF-κB-NLRP3 pathway in hippocampal microglia mediates chronic stress-induced hippocampal neuroinflammation and depression-like behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: EK7 Regulates NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation and Neuroinflammation Post-traumatic Brain Injury</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00202</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As one of the most common causes of mortality and disability, traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a huge psychological and economic burden to patients, families, and societies worldwide. Neuroinflammation reduction may be a favorable option to alleviate secondary brain injuries and ameliorate the outcome of TBI. The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, has been shown to be involved in TBI. NIMA-related kinase 7 (NEK7) has been verified as an essential mediator of NLRP3 inflammasome activation that is recruited upstream of the formation of inflammasomes in response to NLRP3 activators. However, the underlying mechanism by which NEK7 operates post-TBI remains undefined. In this study, we performed both in vivo and in vitro experiments. Using an in vivo mouse TBI model, mice were administered an intracerebroventricular injection of NEK7-shRNA virus. For the in vitro analysis, primary cortical neurons with NEK7-shRNA were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/ATP or potassium (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). We evaluated the effects of NEK7 knock-down on neurological deficits, NLRP3 inflammasomes, caspase-1 activation, and neuronal injury. During the 0–168 h post-TBI period in vivo, NEK7 and NLRP3 inflammasome activation increased in what appeared to be a time-dependent manner. As well as pyroptosis-related markers, caspase-1 activation (p20) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) activation (p17) were up-regulated. NEK7 down-regulation attenuated neurological deficits, NLRP3 inflammasomes, caspase-1 activation, and neuronal injury. The same phenomena were observed during the in vitro experiments. Furthermore, NEK7 knock-down suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pyroptosis, which were triggered by K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; efflux, and the LPS + ATP-triggered NEK7–NLRP3 complex was reversed in primary cortical neurons placed in 50 mM K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; medium. Collectively, the data demonstrated that NEK7, as a modulator, regulates NLRP3 inflammasomes and downstream neuroinflammation in response to K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; efflux, through NEK7–NLRP3 assembly, pro-caspase-1 recruitment, caspase-1 activation, and pyroptosis in nerve injuries, post-TBI. NEK7 may be a potential therapeutic target for attenuating neuroinflammation and nerve injury post-TBI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00912</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The excitatory neurons in the visual cortex are of great significance for us in understanding brain functions. However, the diverse neuron types and their morphological properties have not been fully deciphered. In this paper, we applied the brain-wide positioning system (BPS) to image the entire brain of two Thy1-eYFP H-line male mice at 0.2 μm × 0.2 μm × 1 μm voxel resolution. A total of 103 neurons were reconstructed in layers 5 and 6 of the visual cortex with single-axon-level resolution. Based on the complete topology of neurons and the inherent positioning function of the imaging method, we classified the observed neurons into six types according to their apical dendrites and somata location: star pyramidal cells in layer 5 (L5-sp), slender-tufted pyramidal cells in layer 5 (L5-st), tufted pyramidal cells in layer 5 (L5-tt), spiny stellate-like cells in layer 6 (L6-ss), star pyramidal cells in layer 6 (L6-sp), and slender-tufted pyramidal cells in layer 6 (L6-st). By examining the axonal projection patterns of individual neurons, they can be categorized into three modes: ipsilateral circuit connection neurons, callosal projection neurons and corticofugal projection neurons. Correlating the two types of classifications, we have found that there are at least two projection modes comprised in the former defined neuron types except for L5-tt. On the other hand, each projection mode may consist of four dendritic types defined in this study. The axon projection mode only partially correlates with the apical dendrite feature. This work has demonstrated a paradigm for resolving the visual cortex through single-neuron-level quantification and has shown potential to be extended to reveal the connectome of other defined sensory and motor systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00906</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There are increased risks for deglutition disorders in people with Down syndrome (DS). Although mouse models have been used to study the biological underpinnings of DS in other areas, relatively little is known about swallowing phenotypes in these models. We hypothesized that swallowing performance would be affected in adult mouse models of DS, relative to typical control mice. Videofluoroscopic swallow studies (VFSS) were conducted on adults of two mouse models of DS: Ts65Dn and Dp(16)1Yey, and evaluated in comparison with age-matched controls. Relative to other groups, adult Ts65Dn showed significantly slower swallow rates, longer inter-swallow intervals (ISI), and greater numbers of jaw excursion cycles preceding each swallow. In contrast, adult Dp(16)1Yey mice showed swallowing performance similar to control mice. Exploratory quantitative analyses of the intrinsic tongue (transverse muscle), and extrinsic tongue muscles [genioglossus (GG), styloglossus (SG), and hyoglossus (HG)] showed no significant differences between genotype groups in myosin heavy chain isoform profiles. Collectively, these findings suggest that while swallowing is typical in adult Dp(16)1Yey, swallowing in adult Ts65Dn is atypical due to unknown causes. The finding that adult Ts65Dn may have utility as a model of dysphagia provides new opportunities to elucidate biological underpinnings of dysphagia associated with DS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00905</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is a molecule associated with familial and sporadic Parkinson’s disease. It regulates many central neuronal functions, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy, and axonal extension. Recently, it has been revealed that LRRK2 is related to anxiety/depression-like behavior, implying an association between LRRK2 and stress. In the present study, we investigated for the first time the stress pathway and its relationship to gastrointestinal motility in LRRK2-knockout (KO) mice. The mice were subjected to acute restraint stress, and analyzed for activation of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) using an immunohistochemical approach. Phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) was assessed by Western blotting. The KO mice showed a lower number of c-Fos-positive cells and disruption of the ERK signaling pathway in the PVN in the presence of restraint stress. Stress responses in terms of both upper and lower gastrointestinal motility were alleviated in the mice, accompanied by lower c-Fos immunoreactivity in enteric excitatory neurons. Our present findings suggest that LRRK2 is a newly recognized molecule regulating the stress pathway in the PVN, playing a role in stress-related gastrointestinal dysmotility.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

In cases of ICAS, it is often observed that the infarct core caused by ICAS-related M1 segment middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) is located in deeper parts of the brain (basal ganglia or semiovoid region).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: To evaluate whether the location of the infarct core, identified using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), can be used to differentiate ICAS from intracranial embolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Thirty-one consecutive patients diagnosed with acute cerebral infarction caused by middle cerebral artery M1 segment occlusion were retrospectively included based on angiographic findings to distinguish ICAS from embolic occlusion. Patients were divided into two groups based on the location of the infarct core on DWI: in the deep part of the brain (basal ganglia or semiovoid region) or more superficially (i.e., cortex).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In 16 patients, the infarct core was mainly in the deep part of the brain on DWI [14 of 16 patients in the ICAS group and only 2 in the non-ICAS group (93.3 vs. 6.7%, respectively; P &amp;lt; 0.001)]. The diagnostic sensitivity of DWI for ICAS was 93.3%, with a specificity of 87.5%, a Positive predictive value (PPV) of 87.5%, and an Negative predictive value (NPV) of 93.3%, the accuracy was 88.5%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Intracranial atherosclerotic disease-related acute MCAO can be predicted using DWI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Distinct Mechanism of Audiovisual Integration With Informative and Uninformative Sound in a Visual Detection Task: A DCM Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00059</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown that task-irrelevant auditory information can provide temporal clues for the detection of visual targets and improve visual perception; such sounds are called informative sounds. The neural mechanism of the integration of informative sound and visual stimulus has been investigated extensively, using behavioral measurement or neuroimaging methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and event-related potential (ERP), but the dynamic processes of audiovisual integration cannot be characterized formally in terms of directed neuronal coupling. The present study adopts dynamic causal modeling (DCM) of fMRI data to identify changes in effective connectivity in the hierarchical brain networks that underwrite audiovisual integration and memory. This allows us to characterize context-sensitive changes in neuronal coupling and show how visual processing is contextualized by the processing of informative and uninformative sounds. Our results show that audiovisual integration with informative and uninformative sounds conforms to different optimal models in the two conditions, indicating distinct neural mechanisms of audiovisual integration. The findings also reveal that a sound is uninformative owing to low-level automatic audiovisual integration and informative owing to integration in high-level cognitive processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Cortical Plasticity Induced by Anodal Transcranial Pulsed Current Stimulation Investigated by Combining Two-Photon Imaging and Electrophysiological Recording</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00400</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Anodal-transcranial pulsed current stimulation (a-tPCS) has been used in human studies to modulate cortical excitability or improve behavioral performance in recent years. Multiple studies show crucial roles of astrocytes in cortical plasticity. The calcium activity in astrocytes could regulate synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity. Whether the astrocytic activity is involved in a-tPCS-induced cortical plasticity is presently unknown. The purpose of this study is to investigate the calcium responses in neurons and astrocytes evoked by a-tPCS with different current intensities, and thereby provides some indication of the mechanisms underlying a-tPCS-induced cortical plasticity. Two-photon calcium imaging was used to record the calcium responses of neurons and astrocytes in mouse somatosensory cortex. Local field potential (LFP) evoked by sensory stimulation was used to assess the effects of a-tPCS on plasticity. We found that long-duration a-tPCS with high-intensity current could evoke large-amplitude calcium responses in both neurons and astrocytes, whereas long-duration a-tPCS with low-intensity current evoked large-amplitude calcium responses only in astrocytes. The astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevations are driven by noradrenergic-dependent activation of the alpha-1 adrenergic receptors (A1ARs), while the intense Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; responses of neurons are driven by action potentials. LFP recordings demonstrated that low-intensity a-tPCS led to enhancement of cortical excitability while high-intensity a-tPCS resulted in diminution of cortical excitability. The results provide some evidence that the enhancement of a-tPCS-induced cortical excitability might be partly associated with calcium elevation in astrocytes, whereas the diminution of a-tPCS-induced cortical excitability might be caused by excessive calcium activity in neurons. These findings indicate that the appropriate current intensity should be used in the application of a-tPCS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00079</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this study, we aimed to provide a neuroanatomy atlas derived from cross-sectional and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the encephalon of the brown bear (Ursus arctos). A postmortem brain analysis using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI – 1,5T; a high-resolution submillimeter three-dimensional T1-3D FFE) and cross-sectional macroscopic anatomy methods revealed major embryological and anatomical subdivisions of the encephalon, including the ventricular system. Most of the internal structures were comparably identifiable in both methods. The tractus olfactorius medialis, corpus subthalamicum, brachium colliculi rostralis, fasciculus longitudinalis medialis, nuclei vestibulares, velum medullare rostrale, nucleus fastigii, fasciculi cuneatus et gracilis were identified entirely by cross-sectional macroscopic analysis. However, the glandula pinealis, lemniscus lateralis and nuclei rhaphe were visualized only with MRI. Gross neuroanatomic analysis provided information about sulci and gyri of the cerebral hemispheres, components of the vermis and cerebellar hemispheres, and relative size and morphology of constituents of the rhinencephalon and cerebellum constituents. Similarities and discrepancies in identification of structures provided by both methods, as well as hallmarks of the structures facilitating identification using these methods are discussed. Finally, we compare the brown bear encephalon with other carnivores and discuss most of the identified structures compared to those of the domestic dog, the domestic cat, Ursidae and Mustelidae families and Pinnipedia clade.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00238</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Numerous observational studies have shown that physical exercise promotes cognition in the elderly, however, the results from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are ambiguous. In addition, potential benefits of exercise in an elderly Chinese population have not been comprehensively addressed. In this study, an investigation was launched which focused on the relationship between physical exercise and cognitive function, blood lipid profiles and brain anatomy in a non-dementia aging Chinese population. A total of 2074 non-dementia elderly subjects were included (self-selected exercise n = 1372; self-selected non-exercise n = 702). Amongst the subjects, 689 volunteered to receive blood lipid tests, 141 undergo brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and 1399 receive a 1 year cognitive evaluation follow-up. The Beijing version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Mini-Mental States Examination (MMSE) were used to assess cognitive function. A significant difference in cognitive function was observed at the baseline and during the 1-year follow-up between the self-selected exercise and self-selected non-exercise groups, however, no significant differences in blood lipids and brain anatomy was evident. Physical exercise has a beneficial effect on cognition, particularly visuospatial function, and decreases the risk of dementia in a Chinese aging cohort.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00226</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;This study was aimed to explore the effects of dietary nutrients on cognitive function among the middle-aged and elderly populations.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A prospective cohort study of 1,385 middle-aged and elderly people was conducted from January 2014 to December 2017. Dietary nutrients were assessed according to the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and China Food Composition Database (CFCD). Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) was used to evaluate the participants’ global cognitive function. Six other neuropsychological measures [auditory verbal learning test-immediate recall (AVLT-IR), auditory verbal learning test-short recall (AVLT-SR), auditory verbal learning test-long recall (AVLT-LR), logical memory test (LMT), digit span forward (DST-F), and digit span backward (DST-B)] were used to assess the verbal memory domain and the attention domain by principal component analysis (PCA). Multiple linear regressions were conducted to explore associations between nutrients and cognition. Sensitivity analyses were performed to confirm the results.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Dietary riboflavin was protective for global cognitive function (β = 1.31, 95% CI: 0.26, 2.35) and the verbal memory domain (β = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.71). Unsaturated fatty acid (USFA) played a protective role in global cognitive function (β = 1.15, 95% CI: 0.16, 2.14). The protective effects of riboflavin and USFA on cognitive function were consistent and reliable when different confounders were adjusted during sensitivity analyses. During the follow-up, neuropsychological measure scores revealed a reduced decline in the high-riboflavin group (d-MoCA, P = 0.025; d-AVLT-IR, P = 0.001; d-DST-B, P = 0.004; and d-composite score, P = 0.004) and the high-USFA group (d-AVLT-IR, P = 0.007; d-LMT, P = 0.032; d-DST-B, P = 0.002; and d-composite score, P = 0.008).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Higher intake of riboflavin and USFA can improve multi-dimensional cognitive functioning in middle-aged and elderly people. These findings were consistent in different models of sensitivity analyses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Right Structural and Functional Reorganization in Four-Year-Old Children with Perinatal Arterial Ischemic Stroke Predict Language Production</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/4/ENEURO.0447-18.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Brain imaging methods have contributed to shed light on the mechanisms of recovery after early brain insult. The assumption that the unaffected right hemisphere can take over language functions after left perinatal stroke is still under debate. Here, we report how patterns of brain structural and functional reorganization were associated with language outcomes in a group of four-year-old children with left perinatal arterial ischemic stroke (PAIS). Specifically, we gathered specific fine-grained developmental measures of receptive and productive aspects of language as well as standardized measures of cognitive development. We also collected structural neuroimaging data as well as functional activations during a passive listening story-telling fMRI task and a resting state session (rs-fMRI). Children with a left perinatal stroke showed larger lateralization indices of both structural and functional connectivity of the dorsal language pathway towards the right hemisphere that, in turn, were associated with better language outcomes. Importantly, the pattern of structural asymmetry was significantly more right-lateralized in children with a left perinatal brain insult than in a group of matched healthy controls. These results strongly suggest that early lesions of the left dorsal pathway and the associated perisylvian regions can induce the interhemispheric transfer of language functions to right homolog regions. This study provides combined evidence of structural and functional brain reorganization of language networks after early stroke with strong implications for neurobiological models of language development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Targeting Seizure-Induced Neurogenesis in a Clinically Relevant Time Period Leads to Transient But Not Persistent Seizure Reduction</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/35/7019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE), the most common form of medically refractory epilepsy in adults, is usually associated with hippocampal pathophysiology. Using rodent models of mTLE, many studies including work from our laboratory have shown that new neurons born around the onset of severe acute seizures known as status epilepticus (SE) are crucial for the process of epileptogenesis and targeting seizure-induced neurogenesis either genetically or pharmacologically can impact the frequency of chronic seizures. However, these studies are limited in their clinical relevance as none of them determines the potential of blocking new neurons generated after the epileptogenic insult to alleviate the development of chronic seizures. Therefore, using a pilocarpine-induced SE model of mTLE in mice of either sex, we show that &amp;gt;4 weeks of continuous and concurrent ablation of seizure-induced neurogenesis after SE can reduce the formation of spontaneous recurrent seizures by 65%. We also found that blocking post-SE neurogenesis does not lead to long-term seizure reduction as the effect was observed only transiently for 10 d with &amp;gt;4 weeks of continuous and concurrent ablation of seizure-induced neurogenesis. Thus, these findings provide evidence that seizure-induced neurogenesis when adequately reduced in a clinically relevant time period has the potential to transiently suppress recurrent seizures, but additional mechanisms need to be targeted to permanently prevent epilepsy development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Consistent with morphological and electrophysiological studies suggesting aberrant adult-generated neurons contribute to epilepsy development, ablation of seizure-induced new neurons at the time of the initial insult reduces the frequency of recurrent seizures. In this study, we show that continuous targeting of post-insult new neurons in a therapeutically relevant time period reduces chronic seizures; however, this effect does not persist suggesting possible additional mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Chronic dengue virus encephalitis in a patient with progressive dementia with extrapyramidal features</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25588?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the underlying etiology in a patient with progressive dementia with extrapyramidal signs and chronic inflammation referred to the National Institutes of Health Undiagnosed Diseases Program.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extensive investigations included metabolic profile, autoantibody panel, infectious etiologies, genetic screening, whole exome sequencing and the phage‐display assay, VirScan, for viral immune responses. An etiological diagnosis was established post‐mortem.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using VirScan, enrichment of dengue viral antibodies were detected in cerebrospinal fluid as compared to serum. No virus was detected in serum or cerebrospinal fluid, but post‐mortem analysis confirmed dengue virus in the brain by immunohistochemistry, &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. Dengue virus was also detectable by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing from brain biopsy tissue collected 33 months ante‐mortem, confirming a chronic infection despite a robust immune response directed against the virus. Immunoprofiling and whole exome sequencing of the patient did not reveal any immunodeficiency and sequencing of the virus demonstrated wild‐type dengue virus in the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dengue virus is the most common arbovirus worldwide and represents a significant public health concern. Infections with dengue virus are usually self‐limiting and chronic dengue infections have not been previously reported. Our findings suggest that dengue virus infections may persist in the central nervous system and should be considered in patients with progressive dementia with extrapyramidal features in endemic regions or with relevant travel history. Further, this work highlights the utility of comprehensive antibody profiling assays to aid in the diagnosis of encephalitis of unknown etiologies.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Exogenous Galactosylceramide as Potential Treatment for CLN3 Disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25573?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CLN3 disease is the commonest of the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, a group of pediatric neurodegenerative disorders. Functions of the CLN3 protein include antiapoptotic properties and facilitating anterograde transport of galactosylceramide from Golgi to lipid rafts. This study confirms the beneficial effects of long‐term exogenous galactosylceramide supplementation on longevity, neurobehavioral parameters, neuronal cell counts, astrogliosis, and diminution in brain and serum ceramide levels in &lt;i&gt;Cln3&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;Δex7/8&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; knock‐in mice. Additionally, the impact of galactosylceramide on ceramide synthesis enzymes is documented.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of 72 mice received galactosylceramide or vehicle for 40 weeks. The effect of galactosylceramide supplementation on &lt;i&gt;Cln3&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;Δex7/8&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; mice was determined by performing behavioral tests, measuring ceramide in brains and serum, and assessing impact on longevity, subunit C storage, astrogliosis, and neuronal cell counts.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galactosylceramide resulted in enhanced grip strength of forelimbs in male and female mice, better balance on the accelerating rotarod in females, and improved motor coordination during pole climbing in male mice. Brain and serum ceramide levels as well as apoptosis rates were lower in galactosylceramide‐treated &lt;i&gt;Cln3&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;Δex7/8&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Galactosylceramide also increased neuronal cell counts significantly in male and female mice and tended to decrease subunit C storage in specific brain regions. Astrogliosis dropped in females compared to a slight increase in males after galactosylceramide. Galactosylceramide increased the lifespan of affected mice.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galactosylceramide improved behavioral, neuropathological, and biochemical parameters in &lt;i&gt;Cln3&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;Δex7/8&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; mice, paving the way for effective therapy for CLN3 disease and use of serum ceramide as a potential biomarker to track impact of therapies. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Using a Multiplex Nucleic Acid in situ Hybridization Technique to Determine HCN4 mRNA Expression in the Adult Rodent Brain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00211</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels carry a non-selective cationic conductance, I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;, which is important for modulating neuron excitability. Four genes (HCN1-4) encode HCN channels, with each gene having distinct expression and biophysical profiles. Here we use multiplex nucleic acid in situ hybridization to determine HCN4 mRNA expression within the adult mouse brain. We take advantage of this approach to detect HCN4 mRNA simultaneously with either HCN1 or HCN2 mRNA and markers of excitatory (VGlut-positive) and inhibitory (VGat-positive) neurons, which was not previously reported. We have developed a Fiji-based analysis code that enables quantification of mRNA expression within identified cell bodies. The highest HCN4 mRNA expression was found in the habenula (medial and lateral) and the thalamus. HCN4 mRNA was particularly high in the medial habenula with essentially no co-expression of HCN1 or HCN2 mRNA. An absence of I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated “sag” in neurons recorded from the medial habenula of knockout mice confirmed that HCN4 channels are the predominant subtype in this region. Analysis in the thalamus revealed HCN4 mRNA in VGlut2-positive excitatory neurons that was always co-expressed with HCN2 mRNA. In contrast, HCN4 mRNA was undetectable in the nucleus reticularis. HCN4 mRNA expression was high in a subset of VGat-positive cells in the globus pallidus external. The majority of these neurons co-expressed HCN2 mRNA while a smaller subset also co-expressed HCN1 mRNA. In the striatum, a small subset of large cells which are likely to be giant cholinergic interneurons co-expressed high levels of HCN4 and HCN2 mRNA. The amygdala, cortex and hippocampus expressed low levels of HCN4 mRNA. This study highlights the heterogeneity of HCN4 mRNA expression in the brain and provides a morphological framework on which to better investigate the functional roles of HCN4 channels.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal gap junctions formed by connexin36 (Cx36) and chemical synapses share striking similarities in terms of plasticity. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), an enzyme known to induce memory formation at chemical synapses, has recently been described to potentiate electrical coupling in the retina and several other brain areas via phosphorylation of Cx36. The contribution of individual CaMKII isoforms to this process, however, remains unknown. We recently identified CaMKII-β at electrical synapses in the mouse retina. Now, we set out to identify cell types containing Cx36 gap junctions that also express CaMKII-β. To ensure precise description, we first tested the specificity of two commercially available antibodies on CaMKII-β-deficient retinas. We found that a polyclonal antibody was highly specific for CaMKII-β. However, a monoclonal antibody (CB-β-1) recognized CaMKII-β but also cross-reacted with the C-terminal tail of Cx36, making localization analyses with this antibody inaccurate. Using the polyclonal antibody, we identified strong CaMKII-β expression in bipolar cell terminals that were secretagogin- and HCN1-positive and thus represent terminals of type 5 bipolar cells. In these terminals, a small fraction of CaMKII-β also colocalized with Cx36. A similar pattern was observed in putative type 6 bipolar cells although there, CaMKII expression seemed less pronounced. Next, we tested whether CaMKII-β influenced the Cx36 expression in bipolar cell terminals by quantifying the number and size of Cx36-immunoreactive puncta in CaMKII-β-deficient retinas. However, we found no significant differences between the genotypes, indicating that CaMKII-β is not necessary for the formation and maintenance of Cx36-containing gap junctions in the retina. In addition, in wild-type retinas, we observed frequent association of Cx36 and CaMKII-β with synaptic ribbons, i.e., chemical synapses, in bipolar cell terminals. This arrangement resembled the composition of mixed synapses found for example in Mauthner cells, in which electrical coupling is regulated by glutamatergic activity. Taken together, our data imply that CaMKII-β may fulfill several functions in bipolar cell terminals, regulating both Cx36-containing gap junctions and ribbon synapses and potentially also mediating cross-talk between these two types of bipolar cell outputs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Inhibition of nSMase2 Reduces the Transfer of Oligomeric α-Synuclein Irrespective of Hypoxia</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00200</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recently, extracellular vesicles (EVs), such as exosomes, have been proposed to play an influential role in the cell-to-cell spread of neurodegenerative diseases, including the intercellular transmission of α-synuclein (α-syn). However, the regulation of EV biogenesis and its relation to Parkinson’s disease (PD) is only partially understood. The generation of EVs through the ESCRT-independent pathway depends on the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin by neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2) to produce ceramide, which causes the membrane of endosomal multivesicular bodies to bud inward. nSMase2 is sensitive to oxidative stress, a common process in PD brains; however, little is known about the role of sphingomyelin metabolism in the pathogenesis of PD. This is the first study to show that inhibiting nSMase2 decreases the transfer of oligomeric aggregates of α-syn between neuron-like cells. Furthermore, it reduced the accumulation and aggregation of high-molecular-weight α-syn. Hypoxia, as a model of oxidative stress, reduced the levels of nSMase2, but not its enzymatic activity, and significantly altered the lipid composition of cells without affecting EV abundance or the transfer of α-syn. These data show that altering sphingolipids can mitigate the spread of α-syn, even under hypoxic conditions, potentially suppressing PD progression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Modeling Interval Timing by Recurrent Neural Nets</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00046</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to take a new approach in showing how the central nervous system might encode time at the supra-second level using recurrent neural nets (RNNs). This approach utilizes units with a delayed feedback, whose feedback weight determines the temporal properties of specific neurons in the network architecture. When these feedback neurons are coupled, they form a multilayered dynamical system that can be used to model temporal responses to steps of input in multidimensional systems. The timing network was implemented using separate recurrent “Go” and “No-Go” neural processing units to process an individual stimulus indicating the time of reward availability. Outputs from these distinct units on each time step are converted to a pulse reflecting a weighted sum of the separate Go and No-Go signals. This output pulse then drives an integrator unit, whose feedback weight and input weights shape the pulse distribution. This system was used to model empirical data from rodents performing in an instrumental “peak interval timing” task for two stimuli, Tone and Flash. For each of these stimuli, reward availability was signaled after different times from stimulus onset during training. Rodent performance was assessed on non-rewarded trials, following training, with each stimulus tested individually and simultaneously in a stimulus compound. The associated weights in the Go/No-Go network were trained using experimental data showing the mean distribution of bar press rates across an 80 s period in which a tone stimulus signaled reward after 5 s and a flash stimulus after 30 s from stimulus onset. Different Go/No-Go systems were used for each stimulus, but the weighted output of each fed into a final recurrent integrator unit, whose weights were unmodifiable. The recurrent neural net (RNN) model was implemented using Matlab and Matlab’s machine learning tools were utilized to train the network using the data from non-rewarded trials. The neural net output accurately fit the temporal distribution of tone and flash-initiated bar press data. Furthermore, a “Temporal Averaging” effect was also obtained when the flash and tone stimuli were combined. These results indicated that the system combining tone and flash responses were not superposed as in a linear system, but that there was a non-linearity, which interacted between tone and flash. In order to achieve an accurate fit to the empirical averaging data it was necessary to implement non-linear “saliency functions” that limited the output signal of each stimulus to the final integrator when the other was co-present. The model suggests that the central nervous system encodes timing generation as a dynamical system whose timing properties are embedded in the connection weights of the system. In this way, event timing is coded similar to the way other sensory-motor systems, such as the vestibulo-ocular and optokinetic systems, which combine sensory inputs from the vestibular and visual systems to generate the temporal aspects of compensatory eye movements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Type-2-Diabetes Alters CSF but Not Plasma Metabolomic and AD Risk Profiles in Vervet Monkeys</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00843</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Epidemiological studies suggest that individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) have a twofold to fourfold increased risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD), however, the exact mechanisms linking the two diseases are unknown. In both conditions, the majority of pathophysiological changes, including glucose and insulin dysregulation, insulin resistance, and AD-related changes in Aβ and tau, occur decades before the onset of clinical symptoms and diagnosis. In this study, we investigated the relationship between metabolic biomarkers associated with T2D and amyloid pathology including Aβ levels, from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and fasting plasma of healthy, pre-diabetic (PreD), and T2D vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops sabaeus). Consistent with the human disease, T2D monkeys have increased plasma and CSF glucose levels as they transition from normoglycemia to PreD and diabetic states. Although plasma levels of acylcarnitines and amino acids remained largely unchanged, peripheral hyperglycemia correlated with decreased CSF acylcarnitines and CSF amino acids, including branched chain amino acid (BCAA) concentrations, suggesting profound changes in cerebral metabolism coincident with systemic glucose dysregulation. Moreover, CSF Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; and CSF Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; levels decreased in T2D monkeys, a phenomenon observed in the human course of AD which coincides with increased amyloid deposition within the brain. In agreement with previous studies in mice, CSF Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; and CSF Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; were highly correlated with CSF glucose levels, suggesting that glucose levels in the brain are associated with changes in Aβ metabolism. Interestingly, CSF Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; and CSF Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; levels were also highly correlated with plasma but not CSF lactate levels, suggesting that plasma lactate might serve as a potential biomarker of disease progression in AD. Moreover, CSF glucose and plasma lactate levels were correlated with CSF amino acid and acylcarnitine levels, demonstrating alterations in cerebral metabolism occurring with the onset of T2D. Together, these data suggest that peripheral metabolic changes associated with the development of T2D produce alterations in brain metabolism that lead to early changes in the amyloid cascade, similar to those observed in pre-symptomatic AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00060</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Quantifying, controlling, and monitoring image quality is an essential prerequisite for ensuring the validity and reproducibility of many types of neuroimaging data analyses. Implementation of quality control (QC) procedures is the key to ensuring that neuroimaging data are of high-quality and their validity in the subsequent analyses. We introduce the QC system of the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging (LONI): a web-based system featuring a workflow for the assessment of various modality and contrast brain imaging data. The design allows users to anonymously upload imaging data to the LONI-QC system. It then computes an exhaustive set of QC metrics which aids users to perform a standardized QC by generating a range of scalar and vector statistics. These procedures are performed in parallel using a large compute cluster. Finally, the system offers an automated QC procedure for structural MRI, which can flag each QC metric as being ‘good’ or ‘bad.’ Validation using various sets of data acquired from a single scanner and from multiple sites demonstrated the reproducibility of our QC metrics, and the sensitivity and specificity of the proposed Auto QC to ‘bad’ quality images in comparison to visual inspection. To the best of our knowledge, LONI-QC is the first online QC system that uniquely supports the variety of functionality where we compute numerous QC metrics and perform visual/automated image QC of multi-contrast and multi-modal brain imaging data. The LONI-QC system has been used to assess the quality of large neuroimaging datasets acquired as part of various multi-site studies such as the Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) Study and the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). LONI-QC’s functionality is freely available to users worldwide and its adoption by imaging researchers is likely to contribute substantially to upholding high standards of brain image data quality and to implementing these standards across the neuroimaging community.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Head Anticipation During Locomotion With Auditory Instruction in the Presence and Absence of Visual Input</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00293</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Head direction has been identified to anticipate trajectory direction during human locomotion. Head anticipation has also been shown to persist in darkness. Arguably, the purpose for this anticipatory behavior is related to motor control and trajectory planning, independently of the visual condition. This implies that anticipation remains in the absence of visual input. However, experiments so far have only explored this phenomenon with visual instructions which intrinsically primes a visual representation to follow. The primary objective of this study is to describe head anticipation in auditory instructed locomotion, in the presence and absence of visual input. Auditory instructed locomotion trajectories were performed in two visual conditions: eyes open and eyes closed. First, 10 sighted participants localized static sound sources to ensure they could understand the sound cues provided. Afterwards, they listened to a moving sound source while actively following it. Later, participants were asked to reproduce the trajectory of the moving sound source without sound. Anticipatory head behavior was observed during trajectory reproduction in both eyes open and closed conditions. The results suggest that head anticipation is related to motor anticipation rather than mental simulation of the trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Downstream Behavioral and Electrophysiological Consequences of Word Prediction on Recognition Memory</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00291</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When people process language, they can use context to predict upcoming information, influencing processing and comprehension as seen in both behavioral and neural measures. Although numerous studies have shown immediate facilitative effects of confirmed predictions, the downstream consequences of prediction have been less explored. In the current study, we examined those consequences by probing participants’ recognition memory for words after they read sets of sentences. Participants read strongly and weakly constraining sentences with expected or unexpected endings (“I added my name to the list/basket”), and later were tested on their memory for the sentence endings while EEG was recorded. Critically, the memory test contained words that were predictable (“list”) but were never read (participants saw “basket”). Behaviorally, participants showed successful discrimination between old and new items, but false alarmed to the expected-item lures more often than to new items, showing that predicted words or concepts can linger, even when predictions are disconfirmed. Although false alarm rates did not differ by constraint, event-related potentials (ERPs) differed between false alarms to strongly and weakly predictable words. Additionally, previously unexpected (compared to previously expected) endings that appeared on the memory test elicited larger N1 and LPC amplitudes, suggesting greater attention and episodic recollection. In contrast, highly predictable sentence endings that had been read elicited reduced LPC amplitudes during the memory test. Thus, prediction can facilitate processing in the moment, but can also lead to false memory and reduced recollection for predictable information.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Brain Activity Associated With Expected Task Difficulty</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00286</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Previous research shows that people can use a cue to mentally prepare for a cognitive challenge. The response to a cue has been defined as phasic alertness which is reflected in faster responses and increased activity in frontal, parietal, thalamic, and visual brain regions. We examine if and how phasic alertness can be tuned to the expected difficulty of an upcoming challenge. If people in general are able to tune their level of alertness, then an inability to tune may be linked to disease. Twenty-two healthy volunteers performed a cued visual perception task with two levels of task difficulty. Performance and brain activity were compared between these two levels. Performance was lower for difficult stimuli than for easy stimuli. For both cue types, participants showed activation in a network associated with central executive function and deactivation in regions of the default mode network (DMN) and visual cortex. Deactivation was significantly stronger for cues signaling difficult stimuli than for cues signaling easy stimuli. This effect was most prominent in medial prefrontal gyrus, visual, and temporal cortices. Activation did not differ between the cues. Our study shows that phasic alertness is represented by activated as well as deactivated brain regions. However only deactivated brain regions tuned their level of activity to the expected task difficulty. These results suggest that people, in general, are able to tune their level of alertness to an upcoming task. Cognition may be facilitated by a brain-state coupled to expectations about an upcoming cognitive challenge. Unique identifier = 842003004&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Microglia Regulate Pruning of Specialized Synapses in the Auditory Brainstem</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00055</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The assembly of uniquely organized sound localization circuits in the brainstem requires precise developmental mechanisms. Glial cells have been shown to shape synaptic connections in the retinogeniculate system during development, but their contributions to specialized auditory synapses have not been identified. Here we investigated the role of microglia in auditory brainstem circuit assembly, focusing on the formation and pruning of the calyx of Held in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). Microglia were pharmacologically depleted in mice early in development using subcutaneous injections of an inhibitor of colony stimulating factor 1 receptor, which is essential for microglia survival. Brainstems were examined prior to and just after hearing onset, at postnatal days (P) 8 and P13, respectively. We found that at P13 there were significantly more polyinnervated MNTB neurons when microglia were depleted, consistent with a defect in pruning. Expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a mature astrocyte marker that normally appears in the MNTB late in development, was significantly decreased in microglia-depleted mice at P13, suggesting a delay in astrocyte maturation. Our results demonstrate that monoinnervation of MNTB neurons by the calyx of Held is significantly disrupted or delayed in the absence of microglia. This finding may reflect a direct role for microglia in synaptic pruning. A secondary role for microglia may be in the maturation of astrocytes in MNTB. These findings highlight the significant function of glia in pruning during calyx of Held development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While there are murine and rat choroid plexus epithelial cell cultures, a translationally relevant model for choroid plexus activation and function is still lacking. The rhesus macaque is the gold standard for modeling viral infection and activation of CNS, including HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders. We have developed a rhesus macaque choroid plexus epithelial cell culture model which we believe to be suitable for studies of inflammation associated with viral infection of the CNS. Epithelial morphology and function were assessed using vimentin, phalloidin, the tight junction protein zonula-occludens-1 (ZO-1), and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Choroid plexus epithelial cell type was confirmed using immunofluorescence with two proteins highly expressed in the choroid plexus: transthyretin and α-klotho. Finally, barrier properties of the model were monitored using pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, the TLR2 agonist PamCys3K, and dexamethasone). When pro-inflammatory TNF-α was added to the xCelligence wells, there was a decrease in barrier function, which decreased in a step-wise fashion with each additional administration. This barrier function was repaired upon addition of the steroid dexamethasone. The TLR2 agonist PAM3CysK increased barrier functions in TNF-α treated wells. We have presented a model of the blood-CSF barrier that will allow study into pro- and anti-inflammatory conditions in the brain, while simultaneously measuring real time changes to epithelial cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Exosome Determinants of Physiological Aging and Age-Related Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00232</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aging is consistently reported as the most important independent risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases. As life expectancy has significantly increased during the last decades, neurodegenerative diseases became one of the most critical public health problem in our society. The most investigated neurodegenerative diseases during aging are Alzheimer disease (AD), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) and Parkinson disease (PD). The search for biomarkers has been focused so far on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood. Recently, exosomes emerged as novel biological source with increasing interest for age-related neurodegenerative disease biomarkers. Exosomes are tiny Extracellular vesicles (EVs; 30–100 nm in size) released by all cell types which originate from the endosomal compartment. They constitute important vesicles for the release and transfer of multiple (signaling, toxic, and regulatory) molecules among cells. Initially considered with merely waste disposal function, instead exosomes have been recently recognized as fundamental mediators of intercellular communication. They can move from the site of release by diffusion and be retrieved in several body fluids, where they may dynamically reflect pathological changes of cells present in inaccessible sites such as the brain. Multiple evidence has implicated exosomes in age-associated neurodegenerative processes, which lead to cognitive impairment in later life. Critically, consolidated evidence indicates that pathological protein aggregates, including Aβ, tau, and α-synuclein are released from brain cells in association with exosomes. Importantly, exosomes act as vehicles between cells not only of proteins but also of nucleic acids [DNA, mRNA transcripts, miRNA, and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs)] thus potentially influencing gene expression in target cells. In this framework, exosomes could contribute to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underneath neurodegenerative diseases and could represent a promising source of biomarkers. Despite the involvement of exosomes in age-associated neurodegeneration, the study of exosomes and their genetic cargo in physiological aging and in neurodegenerative diseases is still in its infancy. Here, we review, the current knowledge on protein and ncRNAs cargo of exosomes in normal aging and in age-related neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Gami–Chunggan Formula Prevents Motor Dysfunction in MPTP/p-Induced and A53T α-Synuclein Overexpressed Parkinson’s Disease Mouse Model Though DJ-1 and BDNF Expression</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00230</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Gami–Chunggan formula (GCF) is a modification of the Chunggan (CG) decoction, which has been used to treat movement disorders such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) in Traditional East Asian Medicine. To evaluate the neuroprotective effects of GCF in chronic PD animal models, we used either a 5-week treatment of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine with probenecid (MPTP/p) or the α-synuclein A53T overexpressed PD mouse model. C57BL/6 mice were treated with MPTP, in combination with probenecid, for 5 weeks. GCF was administered simultaneously with MPTP injection for 38 days. The A53T α-synuclein overexpressed mice were also fed with GCF for 60 days. Using behavioral readouts and western blot analyses, it was observed that GCF prevents motor dysfunction in the MPTP/p-induced and A53T α-synuclein overexpressed mice. Moreover, GCF inhibited the reduction of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and fibers in the striatum (ST) against MPTP/p challenge. The expression of DJ-1 was increased but that of α-synuclein was decreased in the SN of PD-like brains by GCF administration. In vitro experiments also showed that GCF inhibited 6-OHDA-induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell lines and that it did so to a greater degree than CG. Furthermore, GCF induced BDNF expression through phosphorylation of Akt, ERK, CREB, and AMPK in the SN of PD-like brains. Therefore, use of the herbal medicine GCF offers a potential remedy for neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Effects of orthostatic hypotension on cognition in type 2 diabetes mellitus</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25578?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To evaluate the effect of a decrease in blood pressure (BP) fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for orthostatic hypotension (OH) on performance in each domain of cognitive function in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using a cross‐sectional and within‐group design.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subjects were individuals without dementia and with type 2 diabetes mellitus, including 107 individuals without OH and 94 with OH (DMOH); 95 control participants were also included. BP was assessed in both the supine and standing positions. A detailed neuropsychological assessment was made in each posture for all subjects.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were statistically significant differences between the patients without OH and the DMOH group with regard to some cognitive measures while supine. Standing posture exacerbated and broadened cognitive deficits in the DMOH group for all measures in the different domains of cognition including executive functioning, memory, visuospatial skills, information processing speed, and attention. When group‐specific supine scores were used as baseline anchors, both the patients without OH and the DMOH group showed cognitive changes when transitioning from a supine to a standing, upright position, with the DMOH group exhibiting a wider range of neuropsychological deficits in memory, visuospatial skills, executive function, and sustained attention, as well as significant changes in information processing speed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These data demonstrate that type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with OH had transient, posture‐mediated cognitive deficits in excess of those found in diabetes mellitus without OH. Understanding the effects of OH on cognition due to autonomic failure is important, particularly as clinical assessments and neuroimaging collect data only in the seated or supine positions.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Paradoxical effects of optogenetic stimulation in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25572?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To establish the effects induced by long‐term, unilateral stimulation of parvalbumin (PV)‐positive interneurons on seizures, interictal spikes, and high‐frequency oscillations (80–500Hz) occurring after pilocarpine‐induced status epilepticus (SE)—a proven model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE)—in transgenic mice expressing or not expressing ChR2.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PV‐ChR2 (n = 6) and PV‐Cre (n = 6) mice were treated with pilocarpine to induce SE. Three hours after SE onset, unilateral optogenetic stimulation (450nm, 25mW, 20‐millisecond pulses delivered at 8Hz for 30 seconds every 2 minutes) of CA3 PV‐positive interneurons was implemented for 14 continuous days in both groups.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rates of seizures (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01), interictal spikes (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), and interictal spikes with fast ripples (250–500Hz) (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) were lower in PV‐ChR2 than in PV‐Cre mice. Ripples (80–200Hz) occurring outside of interictal spikes had higher rates in the PV‐ChR2 group (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01), whereas isolated fast ripples had lower rates (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). However, seizure probability was higher during optogenetic stimulation in PV‐ChR2 compared to PV‐Cre animals (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings show that the unilateral activation of CA3 PV‐positive interneurons exerts anti‐ictogenic effects associated with decreased rates of interictal spikes and fast ripples in this MTLE model. However, PV‐positive interneuron stimulation can paradoxically trigger seizures in epileptic animals, supporting the notion that γ‐aminobutyric acid type A signaling can also initiate ictogenesis.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Connectomic Profiling Identifies Responders to Vagus Nerve Stimulation</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25574?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a common treatment for medically intractable epilepsy, but response rates are highly variable, with no preoperative means of identifying good candidates. This study aimed to predict VNS response using structural and functional connectomic profiling.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifty‐six children, comprising discovery (n = 38) and validation (n = 18) cohorts, were recruited from 3 separate institutions. Diffusion tensor imaging was used to identify group differences in white matter microstructure, which in turn informed beamforming of resting‐state magnetoencephalography recordings. The results were used to generate a support vector machine learning classifier, which was independently validated. This algorithm was compared to a second classifier generated using 31 clinical covariates.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treatment responders demonstrated greater fractional anisotropy in left thalamocortical, limbic, and association fibers, as well as greater connectivity in a functional network encompassing left thalamic, insular, and temporal nodes (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). The resulting classifier demonstrated 89.5% accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.93 on 10‐fold cross‐validation. In the external validation cohort, this model demonstrated an accuracy of 83.3%, with a sensitivity of 85.7% and specificity of 75.0%. This was significantly superior to predictions using clinical covariates alone, which exhibited an area under the ROC curve of 0.57 (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.008).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study provides the first multi‐institutional, multimodal connectomic prediction algorithm for VNS, and provides new insights into its mechanism of action. Reliable identification of VNS responders is critical to mitigate surgical risks for children who may not benefit, and to ensure cost‐effective allocation of health care resources.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microglial cells, which are highly plastic, immediately respond to any change in the microenvironment by becoming activated and shifting the phenotype toward neurotoxicity or neuroprotection. The polarization of microglia/macrophages after spinal cord injury (SCI) seems to be a dynamic process and can change depending on the microenvironment, stage, course, and severity of the posttraumatic process. Effective methods to modulate microglia toward a neuroprotective phenotype in order to stimulate neuroregeneration are actively sought for. In this context, available approaches that can selectively impact the polarization of microglia/macrophages regulate synthesis of trophic factors and cytokines/chemokines in them, and their phagocytic function and effects on the course and outcome of SCI are discussed in this review.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: TrkB Agonist LM22A-4 Increases Oligodendroglial Populations During Myelin Repair in the Corpus Callosum</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00205</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The neurotrophin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) promotes central nervous system (CNS) myelination during development and after injury. This is achieved via activation of oligodendrocyte-expressed tropomyosin-related kinase (Trk) B receptors. However, while administration of BDNF has shown beneficial effects, BDNF itself has a poor pharmacokinetic profile. Here, we compare two TrkB-targeted BDNF-mimetics, the structural-mimetic, tricyclic dimeric peptide-6 (TDP6) and the non-peptide small molecule TrkB agonist LM22A-4 in a cuprizone model of central demyelination in female mice. Both mimetics promoted remyelination, increasing myelin sheath thickness and oligodendrocyte densities after 1-week recovery. Importantly, LM22A-4 exerts these effects in an oligodendroglial TrkB-dependent manner. However, analysis of TrkB signaling by LM22A-4 suggests rather than direct activation of TrkB, LM22A-4 exerts its effects via indirect transactivation of Trk receptors. Overall, these studies support the therapeutic strategy to selectively targeting TrkB activation to promote remyelination in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00204</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cholinergic neurons comprise a small population of cells in the striatum but have fundamental roles in fine tuning brain function, and in the etiology of neurological and psychiatric disorders such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) or schizophrenia. The process of developmental cell specification underlying neuronal identity and function is an area of great current interest. There has been significant progress in identifying the developmental origins, commonalities in molecular markers, and physiological properties of the cholinergic neurons. Currently, we are aware of a number of key factors that promote cholinergic fate during development. However, the extent of cholinergic cell diversity is still largely underestimated. New insights into the biological basis of their specification indicate that cholinergic neurons may be far more diverse than previously thought. This review article, highlights the physiological features and the synaptic properties that segregate cholinergic cell subtypes. It provides an accurate picture of cholinergic cell diversity underlying their organization and function in neuronal networks. This review article, also discusses current challenges in deciphering the logic of the cholinergic cell heterogeneity that plays a fundamental role in the control of neural processes in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Transcript Analysis of Zebrafish GLUT3 Genes, slc2a3a and slc2a3b, Define Overlapping as Well as Distinct Expression Domains in the Zebrafish (Danio rerio) Central Nervous System</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00199</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The transport of glucose across the cell plasma membrane is vital to most mammalian cells. The glucose transporter (GLUT; also called SLC2A) family of transmembrane solute carriers is responsible for this function in vivo. GLUT proteins encompass 14 different isoforms in humans with different cell type-specific expression patterns and activities. Central to glucose utilization and delivery in the brain is the neuronally expressed GLUT3. Recent research has shown an involvement of GLUT3 genetic variation or altered expression in several different brain disorders, including Huntington’s and Alzheimer’s diseases. Furthermore, GLUT3 was identified as a potential risk gene for multiple psychiatric disorders. To study the role of GLUT3 in brain function and disease a more detailed knowledge of its expression in model organisms is needed. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) has in recent years gained popularity as a model organism for brain research and is now well-established for modeling psychiatric disorders. Here, we have analyzed the sequence of GLUT3 orthologs and identified two paralogous genes in the zebrafish, slc2a3a and slc2a3b. Interestingly, the Glut3b protein sequence contains a unique stretch of amino acids, which may be important for functional regulation. The slc2a3a transcript is detectable in the central nervous system including distinct cellular populations in telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon and rhombencephalon at embryonic and larval stages. Conversely, the slc2a3b transcript shows a rather diffuse expression pattern at different embryonic stages and brain regions. Expression of slc2a3a is maintained in the adult brain and is found in the telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, cerebellum and medulla oblongata. The slc2a3b transcripts are present in overlapping as well as distinct regions compared to slc2a3a. Double in situ hybridizations were used to demonstrate that slc2a3a is expressed by some GABAergic neurons at embryonic stages. This detailed description of zebrafish slc2a3a and slc2a3b expression at developmental and adult stages paves the way for further investigations of normal GLUT3 function and its role in brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Mucosal Administration of E-selectin Limits Disability in Models of Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00190</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;E-selectin plays an important role in mediating the rolling of leukocytes along and thus, the subsequent extravasation across activated endothelial cells comprising the microvasculature of the blood brain barrier (BBB). In multiple sclerosis (MS) and other inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system (CNS), the microvasculature is altered and immune cells infiltrate the brain and spinal cord contributing to damage, demyelination and ultimately disability. While mucosal administration is typically used to affect lymphocyte hyporesponsiveness or tolerance to suspect autoantigens, intranasal administration to E-selectin has previously been shown to protect against CNS inflammatory insults. We characterized the potential for mucosal administration of E-selectin to modulate CNS autoimmunity in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS. Intranasally administered E-selectin reduced swelling by as much as 50% in delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions compared to ovalbumin-tolerized controls. Intranasal E-selectin delivery prior to disease induction with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)&lt;sub&gt;35–55&lt;/sub&gt; reduced disease severity and total disease burden by more than 50% compared to PBS-tolerized animals; this protection was not associated with differences in the magnitude of the autoimmune response. Examination after the onset of disease showed that protection was associated with significant reductions in inflammatory infiltrates throughout the spinal cord. Tolerization to E-selectin did not influence encephalitogenic characteristics of autoreactive T cells such as IFN-gamma or IL-17 production. Clinical disease was also significantly reduced when E-selectin was first delivered after the onset of clinical symptoms. Splenic and lymph node (LN) populations from E-selectin-tolerized animals showed E-selectin-specific T cell responses and production of the immunomodulatory cytokine IL-10. Transfer of enriched CD4+ T cells from E-selectin tolerized mice limited disability in the passive SJL model of relapsing remitting MS. These results suggest a role for influencing E-selectin specific responses to limit neuroinflammation that warrants further exploration and characterization to better understand its potential to mitigate neurodegeneration in disorders such as MS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Comparing the Effects of Rhythm-Based Music Training and Pitch-Based Music Training on Executive Functions in Preschoolers</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00041</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Previous research has indicated the beneficial effects of music training on executive functions (EFs) in children. However, researchers have not clearly determined which component of music training produces these beneficial effects or whether different components exert different effects on EFs. In the present study, we examined the impact of rhythm-based music training compared to pitch-based music training and sports training as a control on EFs in preschoolers. Children aged between 5 and 6 years (N = 76) were randomly assigned to one of the three training groups and received training in small groups three times a week for 20 min in German kindergartens. Before and after training, children completed tests designed to assess inhibition, set-shifting, and visuospatial working memory. Parental education, family income, personality, and IQ served as control variables. We observed a significant training group × time interaction for the measure of inhibition. Children from the rhythm group exhibited significant improvements in inhibition from pre- to post-tests (d&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.56), whereas children from the other groups did not. Furthermore, children from the rhythm group significantly differed from the sports control group at post-test (d&lt;sub&gt;corr&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.82). Concerning the measures of set-shifting and visuospatial working memory, the descriptive data revealed similar results; however, we did not observe significant training group × time interactions. Based on our findings, rhythm-based music training specifically enhances inhibition in preschoolers and might affect other EFs, such as set-shifting and visuospatial working memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00895</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Non-invasive neuromodulatory interventions have the potential to influence neural plasticity and augment motor rehabilitation in people with stroke. Paired associative stimulation (PAS) involves the repeated pairing of single pulses of electrical stimulation to a peripheral nerve and single pulses of transcranial magnetic stimulation over the contralateral primary motor cortex. Efficacy of PAS in the lower limb of healthy and stroke populations has not been systematically appraised. Optimal protocols including stimulation parameter settings have yet to be determined. This systematic review (a) examines the efficacy of PAS on lower limb corticomotor excitability in healthy and stroke populations and (b) evaluates the stimulation parameters employed. Five databases were searched for randomized, non-randomized, and pre-post experimental studies evaluating lower limb PAS in healthy and stroke populations. Two independent reviewers identified eligible studies and assessed methodological quality using a modified Downs and Blacks Tool and the TMS Checklist. Intervention stimulation parameters and TMS measurement details were also extracted and compared. Twelve articles, comprising 24 experiments, met the inclusion criteria. Four articles evaluated PAS in people with stroke. Following a single session of PAS, 21 experiments reported modulation of corticomotor excitability, lasting up to 60 min; however, the research lacked methodological rigor. Intervention stimulation parameters were highly variable across experiments, and whilst these appeared to influence efficacy, variations in the intervention and outcome assessment methods hindered the ability to draw conclusions about optimal parameters. Lower limb PAS research requires further investigation before considering its translation into clinical practice. Eight key recommendations serve as guide for enhancing future research in the field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A certain degree of age-related cognitive decline is normal; however, some people retain more cognitive function than others. Cognitive impairment is associated with an increased risk of dementia. Thus, understanding the factors that contribute to cognitive reserve is crucial, so effective strategies for the prevention of dementia can be developed. Engaging in physical activity can delay cognitive decline and reduce the risk of dementia and a number of early life conditions have been shown to have long-lasting effects on cognition. This mini-review combines these two observations to evaluate the evidence from both animal models and epidemiological studies for physical activity in early life (≤30 years) delaying cognitive decline in later life (cognition tested ≥60 years). Three epidemiological studies were found; two showed a positive association and one found none. The latter was deemed to have an unreliable method. A review of animal studies found none that analyzed the effect of physical activity in early life on cognition in later life. However, in rodent models that analyzed mid-life cognition, runners showed improved cognition and enhanced adult hippocampal neurogenesis, changes which were preserved across the life span. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to conclude whether physical activity in early life may delay cognitive decline in later life, but these results indicate that further studies are warranted. Future human research should be in the form of longitudinal studies that begin below ≤15 years and assess sex differences. Crucially, the physical activity data must define type, quantity and intensity of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00877</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural reflexes regulate inflammation and electrical activation of the vagus nerve reduces inflammation in models of inflammatory disease. These discoveries have generated an increasing interest in targeted neurostimulation as treatment for chronic inflammatory diseases. Data from the first clinical trials that use vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease suggest that there is a therapeutic potential of electrical VNS in diseases characterized by excessive inflammation. Accordingly, there is an interest to further explore the molecular mechanisms and therapeutic potential of electrical VNS in a range of experimental settings and available genetic mouse models of disease. Here, we describe a method for electrical VNS in experimental inflammation in mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: The Impact of Self-Reported Hearing Difficulties on Memory Collaboration in Older Adults</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00870</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive scientists and philosophers recently have highlighted the value of thinking about people at risk of or living with dementia as intertwined parts of broader cognitive systems that involve their spouse, family, friends, or carers. By this view, we rely on people and things around us to “scaffold” mental processes such as memory. In the current study, we identified 39 long-married, older adult couples who are part of the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) Study of Ageing; all were cognitively healthy but half were subjective memory complainers. During two visits to their homes 1 week apart, we assessed husbands’ and wives’ cognitive performance across a range of everyday memory tasks working alone (Week 1) versus together (Week 2), including a Friends Task where they provided first and last names of their friends and acquaintances. As reported elsewhere, elderly couples recalled many more friends’ names working together compared to alone. Couples who remembered successfully together used well-developed, rich, sensitive, and dynamic communication strategies to boost each other’s recall. However, if one or both spouses self-reported mild-to-moderate or severe hearing difficulties (56% of husbands, 31% of wives), couples received less benefit from collaboration. Our findings imply that hearing loss may disrupt collaborative support structures that couples (and other intimate communicative partners) hone over decades together. We discuss the possibility that, cut off from the social world that scaffolds them, hearing loss may place older adults at greater risk of cognitive decline and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Adiposity Related Brain Plasticity Induced by Bariatric Surgery</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00290</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies revealed structural-functional brain reorganization 12 months after gastric-bypass surgery, encompassing cortical and subcortical regions of all brain lobes as well as the cerebellum. Changes in the mean of cluster-wise gray/white matter density (GMD/WMD) were correlated with the individual loss of body mass index (BMI), rendering the BMI a potential marker of widespread surgery-induced brain plasticity. Here, we investigated voxel-by-voxel associations between surgery-induced changes in adiposity, metabolism and inflammation and markers of functional and structural neural plasticity. We re-visited the data of patients who underwent functional and structural MRI, 6 months (n = 27) and 12 months after surgery (n = 22), and computed voxel-wise regression analyses. Only the surgery-induced weight loss was significantly associated with brain plasticity, and this only for GMD changes. After 6 months, weight loss overlapped with altered GMD in the hypothalamus, the brain’s homeostatic control site, the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, assumed to host reward and gustatory processes, as well as abdominal representations in somatosensory cortex. After 12 months, weight loss scaled with GMD changes in right cerebellar lobule VII, involved in language-related/cognitive processes, and, by trend, with the striatum, assumed to underpin (food) reward. These findings suggest time-dependent and weight-loss related gray matter plasticity in brain regions involved in the control of eating, sensory processing and cognitive functioning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Predicting Ventral Striatal Activation During Reward Anticipation From Functional Connectivity at Rest</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00289</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reward anticipation is essential for directing behavior toward positively valenced stimuli, creating motivational salience. Task-related activation of the ventral striatum (VS) has long been used as a target for understanding reward function. However, some subjects may not be able to perform the respective tasks because of their complexity or subjects’ physical or mental disabilities. Moreover, task implementations may differ, which results in limited comparability. Hence, developing a task-free method for evaluating neural gain circuits is essential. Research has shown that fluctuations in neuronal activity at rest denoted individual differences in the brain functional networks. Here, we proposed novel models to predict the activation of the VS during gain anticipation, using the functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 45 healthy subjects acquired during a monetary incentive delay task and under rest. In-sample validation and held-out data were used to estimate the generalizability of the models. It was possible to predict three measures of reward activation (sensitivity, average, maximum) from resting-state functional connectivity (Pearson’s r = 0.38–0.54 in validation data). Especially high contributions to the models were observed from the default mode network. These findings highlight the potential of using functional connectivity at rest as a task-free alternative for predicting activation in the VS, offering a possibility to estimate reward response in the broader sampling of subject populations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Beyond the Low Frequency Fluctuations: Morning and Evening Differences in Human Brain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00288</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human performance, alertness, and most biological functions express rhythmic fluctuations across a 24-h-period. This phenomenon is believed to originate from differences in both circadian and homeostatic sleep-wake regulatory processes. Interactions between these processes result in time-of-day modulations of behavioral performance as well as brain activity patterns. Although the basic mechanism of the 24-h clock is conserved across evolution, there are interindividual differences in the timing of sleep-wake cycles, subjective alertness and functioning throughout the day. The study of circadian typology differences has increased during the last few years, especially research on extreme chronotypes, which provide a unique way to investigate the effects of sleep-wake regulation on cerebral mechanisms. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we assessed the influence of chronotype and time-of-day on resting-state functional connectivity. Twenty-nine extreme morning- and 34 evening-type participants underwent two fMRI sessions: about 1 h after wake-up time (morning) and about 10 h after wake-up time (evening), scheduled according to their declared habitual sleep-wake pattern on a regular working day. Analysis of obtained neuroimaging data disclosed only an effect of time of day on resting-state functional connectivity; there were different patterns of functional connectivity between morning (MS) and evening (ES) sessions. The results of our study showed no differences between extreme morning-type and evening-type individuals. We demonstrate that circadian and homeostatic influences on the resting-state functional connectivity have a universal character, unaffected by circadian typology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Speed-Accuracy Tradeoffs in Brain and Behavior: Testing the Independence of P300 and N400 Related Processes in Behavioral Responses to Sentence Categorization</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00285</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Although the N400 was originally discovered in a paradigm designed to elicit a P300 (Kutas and Hillyard, 1980), its relationship with the P300 and how both overlapping event-related potentials (ERPs) determine behavioral profiles is still elusive. Here we conducted an ERP (N = 20) and a multiple-response speed-accuracy tradeoff (SAT) experiment (N = 16) on distinct participant samples using an antonym paradigm (The opposite of black is white/nice/yellow with acceptability judgment). We hypothesized that SAT profiles incorporate processes of task-related decision-making (P300) and stimulus-related expectation violation (N400). We replicated previous ERP results (Roehm et al., 2007): in the correct condition (white), the expected target elicits a P300, while both expectation violations engender an N400 [reduced for related (yellow) vs. unrelated targets (nice)]. Using multivariate Bayesian mixed-effects models, we modeled the P300 and N400 responses simultaneously and found that correlation between residuals and subject-level random effects of each response window was minimal, suggesting that the components are largely independent. For the SAT data, we found that antonyms and unrelated targets had a similar slope (rate of increase in accuracy over time) and an asymptote at ceiling, while related targets showed both a lower slope and a lower asymptote, reaching only approximately 80% accuracy. Using a GLMM-based approach (Davidson and Martin, 2013), we modeled these dynamics using response time and condition as predictors. Replacing the predictor for condition with the averaged P300 and N400 amplitudes from the ERP experiment, we achieved identical model performance. We then examined the piecewise contribution of the P300 and N400 amplitudes with partial effects (see Hohenstein and Kliegl, 2015). Unsurprisingly, the P300 amplitude was the strongest contributor to the SAT-curve in the antonym condition and the N400 was the strongest contributor in the unrelated condition. In brief, this is the first demonstration of how overlapping ERP responses in one sample of participants predict behavioral SAT profiles of another sample. The P300 and N400 reflect two independent but interacting processes and the competition between these processes is reflected differently in behavioral parameters of speed and accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Multi-parametric MRI-Based Radiomics Signature and a Practical ML Model for Stratifying Glioblastoma Patients Based on Survival Toward Precision Oncology</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00058</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Purpose: Predicting patients' survival outcomes is recognized of key importance to clinicians in oncology toward determining an ideal course of treatment and patient management. This study applies radiomics analysis on pre-operative multi-parametric MRI of patients with glioblastoma from multiple institutions to identify a signature and a practical machine learning model for stratifying patients into groups based on overall survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: This study included 163 patients' data with glioblastoma, collected by BRATS 2018 Challenge from multiple institutions. In this proposed method, a set of 147 radiomics image features were extracted locally from three tumor sub-regions on standardized pre-operative multi-parametric MR images. LASSO regression was applied for identifying an informative subset of chosen features whereas a Cox model used to obtain the coefficients of those selected features. Then, a radiomics signature model of 9 features was constructed on the discovery set and it performance was evaluated for patients stratification into short- (&amp;lt;10 months), medium- (10–15 months), and long-survivors (&amp;gt;15 months) groups. Eight ML classification models, trained and then cross-validated, were tested to assess a range of survival prediction performance as a function of the choice of features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The proposed mpMRI radiomics signature model had a statistically significant association with survival (P &amp;lt; 0.001) in the training set, but was not confirmed (P = 0.110) in the validation cohort. Its performance in the validation set had a sensitivity of 0.476 (short-), 0.231 (medium-), and 0.600 (long-survivors), and specificity of 0.667 (short-), 0.732 (medium-), and 0.794 (long-survivors). Among the tested ML classifiers, the ensemble learning model's results showed superior performance in predicting the survival classes, with an overall accuracy of 57.8% and AUC of 0.81 for short-, 0.47 for medium-, and 0.72 for long-survivors using the LASSO selected features combined with clinical factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: A derived GLCM feature, representing intra-tumoral inhomogeneity, was found to have a high association with survival. Clinical factors, when added to the radiomics image features, boosted the performance of the ML classification model in predicting individual glioblastoma patient's survival prognosis, which can improve prognostic quality a further step toward precision oncology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Cellular and Network Mechanisms for Temporal Signal Propagation in a Cortical Network Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00057</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms underlying an effective propagation of high intensity information over a background of irregular firing and response latency in cognitive processes remain unclear. Here we propose a SSCCPI circuit to address this issue. We hypothesize that when a high-intensity thalamic input triggers synchronous spike events (SSEs), dense spikes are scattered to many receiving neurons within a cortical column in layer IV, many sparse spike trains are propagated in parallel along minicolumns at a substantially high speed and finally integrated into an output spike train toward or in layer Va. We derive the sufficient conditions for an effective (fast, reliable, and precise) SSCCPI circuit: (i) SSEs are asynchronous (near synchronous); (ii) cortical columns prevent both repeatedly triggering SSEs and incorrectly synaptic connections between adjacent columns; and (iii) the propagator in interneurons is temporally complete fidelity and reliable. We encode the membrane potential responses to stimuli using the non-linear autoregressive integrated process derived by applying Newton's second law to stochastic resilience systems. We introduce a multithreshold decoder to correct encoding errors. Evidence supporting an effective SSCCPI circuit includes that for the condition, (i) time delay enhances SSEs, suggesting that response latency induces SSEs in high-intensity stimuli; irregular firing causes asynchronous SSEs; asynchronous SSEs relate to healthy neurons; and rigorous SSEs relate to brain disorders. For the condition (ii) neurons within a given minicolumn are stereotypically interconnected in the vertical dimension, which prevents repeated triggering SSEs and ensures signal parallel propagation; columnar segregation avoids incorrect synaptic connections between adjacent columns; and signal propagation across layers overwhelmingly prefers columnar direction. For the condition (iii), accumulating experimental evidence supports temporal transfer precision with millisecond fidelity and reliability in interneurons; homeostasis supports a stable fixed-point encoder by regulating changes to synaptic size, synaptic strength, and ion channel function in the membrane; together all-or-none modulation, active backpropagation, additive effects of graded potentials, and response variability functionally support the multithreshold decoder; our simulations demonstrate that the encoder-decoder is temporally complete fidelity and reliable in special intervals contained within the stable fixed-point range. Hence, the SSCCPI circuit provides a possible mechanism of effective signal propagation in cortical networks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: The Concept of Transmission Coefficient Among Different Cerebellar Layers: A Computational Tool for Analyzing Motor Learning</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00054</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;High-fidelity regulation of information transmission among cerebellar layers is mainly provided by synaptic plasticity. Therefore, determining the regulatory foundations of synaptic plasticity in the cerebellum and translating them to behavioral output are of great importance. To date, many experimental studies have been carried out in order to clarify the effect of synaptic defects, while targeting a specific signaling pathway in the cerebellar function. However, the contradictory results of these studies at the behavioral level further add to the ambiguity of the problem. Information transmission through firing rate changes in populations of interconnected neurons is one of the most widely accepted principles of neural coding. In this study, while considering the efficacy of synaptic interactions among the cerebellar layers, we propose a firing rate model to realize the concept of transmission coefficient. Thereafter, using a computational approach, we test the effect of different values of transmission coefficient on the gain adaptation of a cerebellar-dependent motor learning task. In conformity with the behavioral data, the proposed model can accurately predict that disruption in different forms of synaptic plasticity does not have the same effect on motor learning. Specifically, impairment in training mechanisms, like in the train-induced LTD in parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses, has a significant negative impact on all aspects of learning, including memory formation, transfer, and consolidation, although it does not disrupt basic motor performance. In this regard, the overinduction of parallel fiber-molecular layer interneuron LTP could not prevent motor learning impairment, despite its vital role in preserving the robustness of basic motor performance. In contrast, impairment in plasticity induced by interneurons and background activity of climbing fibers is partly compensable through overinduction of train-induced parallel fiber-Purkinje cell LTD. Additionally, blockade of climbing fiber signaling to the cerebellar cortex, referred to as olivary system lesion, shows the most destructive effect on both motor learning and basic motor performance. Overall, the obtained results from the proposed computational framework are used to provide a map from procedural motor memory formation in the cerebellum. Certainly, the generalization of this concept to other multi-layered networks of the brain requires more physiological and computational researches.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Zika Virus-Mediated Death of Hippocampal Neurons Is Independent From Maturation State</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00389</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Zika virus (ZIKV) infection of pregnant women and diaplazental transmission to the fetus is linked to the congenital syndrome of microcephaly in newborns. This neuropathology is believed to result from significant death of neuronal progenitor cells (NPC). Here, we examined the fate of neurons in the developing hippocampus, a brain structure which houses neuronal populations of different maturation states. For this purpose, we infected hippocampal slice cultures from immunocompetent newborn mice with ZIKV and monitored changes in hippocampal architecture. In neurons of all hippocampal subfields ZIKV was detected by immunofluorescence labeling and electron microscopy. This includes pyramidal neurons that maturate during the embryonic phase. In the dentate gyrus, ZIKV could be found in the Cajal–Retzius (CR) cells which belong to the earliest born cortical neurons, but also in granule cells that are predominantly generated postnatally. Intriguingly, virus particles were also present in the correctly outgrowing mossy fiber axons of juvenile granule cells, suggesting that viral infection does not impair region- and layer-specific formation of this projection. ZIKV infection of hippocampal tissue was accompanied by both a profound astrocyte reaction indicating tissue injury and a microglia response suggesting phagocytotic activity. Furthermore, depending on the viral load and incubation time, we observed extensive overall neuronal loss in the cultured hippocampal slice cultures. Thus, we conclude ZIKV can replicate in various neuronal populations and trigger neuronal death independent of the maturation state of infected cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Detrimental Effects of HMGB-1 Require Microglial-Astroglial Interaction: Implications for the Status Epilepticus -Induced Neuroinflammation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00380</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of human epilepsy and available treatments with antiepileptic drugs are not disease-modifying therapies. The neuroinflammation, neuronal death and exacerbated plasticity that occur during the silent period, following the initial precipitating event (IPE), seem to be crucial for epileptogenesis. Damage Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMP) such as HMGB-1, are released early during this period concomitantly with a phenomenon of reactive gliosis and neurodegeneration. Here, using a combination of primary neuronal and glial cell cultures, we show that exposure to HMGB-1 induces dendrite loss and neurodegeneration in a glial-dependent manner. In glial cells, loss of function studies showed that HMGB-1 exposure induces NF-κB activation by engaging a signaling pathway that involves TLR2, TLR4, and RAGE. In the absence of glial cells, HMGB-1 failed to induce neurodegeneration of primary cultured cortical neurons. Moreover, purified astrocytes were unable to fully respond to HMGB-1 with NF-κB activation and required microglial cooperation. In agreement, in vivo HMGB-1 blockage with glycyrrhizin, immediately after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE), reduced neuronal degeneration, reactive astrogliosis and microgliosis in the long term. We conclude that microglial-astroglial cooperation is required for astrocytes to respond to HMGB-1 and to induce neurodegeneration. Disruption of this HMGB-1 mediated signaling pathway shows beneficial effects by reducing neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration after SE. Thus, early treatment strategies during the latency period aimed at blocking downstream signaling pathways activated by HMGB-1 are likely to have a significant effect in the neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration that are proposed as key factors in epileptogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: New Perspective for Non-invasive Brain Stimulation Site Selection in Mild Cognitive Impairment: Based on Meta- and Functional Connectivity Analyses</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00228</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has been widely used to treat mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, there exists no consensus on the best stimulation sites.

Objective: To explore potential stimulation locations for NIBS treatment in patients with MCI, combining meta- and resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) analyses. 

Methods: The meta-analysis was conducted to identify brain regions associated with MCI. Regions of interest (ROIs) were extracted based on this meta-analysis. The rsFC analysis was applied to 45 MCI patients to determine brain surface regions that are functionally connected with the above ROIs. 

Results: We found that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and inferior frontal gyrus were the overlapping brain regions between our results and those of previous studies. In addition, we recommend that the temporoparietal junction (including the angular gyrus), which was found in both the meta- and rsFC analysis, should be considered in NIBS treatment of MCI. Furthermore, the bilateral orbital prefrontal gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, medial superior frontal gyrus, and right inferior occipital gyrus may be potential brain stimulation sites for NIBS treatment of MCI.

Conclusion: Our results provide several potential sites for NIBS, such as the DLFPC and inferior frontal gyrus, and may shed light on the locations of NIBS sites in the treatment of patients with MCI.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/4/ENEURO.0448-18.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microglia are specialized brain-resident macrophages with important functions in health and disease. To improve our understanding of these cells, the research community needs genetic tools to identify and control them in a manner that distinguishes them from closely related cell types. We have targeted the recently discovered microglia-specific &lt;i&gt;Tmem119&lt;/i&gt; gene to generate knock-in mice expressing EGFP (JAX#031823) or CreERT2 (JAX#031820) for the identification and manipulation of microglia, respectively. Genetic characterization of the locus and qPCR-based analysis demonstrate correct positioning of the transgenes and intact expression of endogenous &lt;i&gt;Tmem119&lt;/i&gt; in the knock-in mouse models. Immunofluorescence analysis further shows that parenchymal microglia, but not other brain macrophages, are completely and faithfully labeled in the EGFP-line at different time points of development. Flow cytometry indicates highly selective expression of EGFP in CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD45lo microglia. Similarly, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry analyses using a Cre-dependent reporter mouse line demonstrate activity of CreERT2 primarily in microglia upon tamoxifen administration with the caveat of activity in leptomeningeal cells. Finally, flow cytometric analyses reveal absence of EGFP expression and minimal activity of CreERT2 in blood monocytes of the &lt;i&gt;Tmem119-EGFP&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Tmem119-CreERT2&lt;/i&gt; lines, respectively. These new transgenic lines extend the microglia toolbox by providing the currently most specific genetic labeling and control over these cells in the myeloid compartment of mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Encoding of the Intent to Drink Alcohol by the Prefrontal Cortex Is Blunted in Rats with a Family History of Excessive Drinking</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/4/ENEURO.0489-18.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a central role in guiding decision making, and its function is altered by alcohol use and an individual’s innate risk for excessive alcohol drinking. The primary goal of this work was to determine how neural activity in the PFC guides the decision to drink. Towards this goal, the within-session changes in neural activity were measured from medial PFC (mPFC) of rats performing a drinking procedure that allowed them to consume or abstain from alcohol in a self-paced manner. Recordings were obtained from rats that either lacked or expressed an innate risk for excessive alcohol intake, Wistar or alcohol-preferring (P) rats, respectively. Wistar rats exhibited patterns of neural activity consistent with the intention to drink or abstain from drinking, whereas these patterns were blunted or absent in P rats. Collectively, these data indicate that neural activity patterns in mPFC associated with the intention to drink alcohol are influenced by innate risk for excessive alcohol drinking. This observation may indicate a lack of control over the decision to drink by this otherwise well-validated supervisory brain region.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Transcriptomic Signatures of Postnatal and Adult Intrinsically Photosensitive Ganglion Cells</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/4/ENEURO.0022-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) are rare mammalian photoreceptors essential for non-image-forming vision functions, such as circadian photoentrainment and the pupillary light reflex. They comprise multiple subtypes distinguishable by morphology, physiology, projections, and levels of expression of melanopsin (Opn4), their photopigment. The molecular programs that distinguish ipRGCs from other ganglion cells and ipRGC subtypes from one another remain elusive. Here, we present comprehensive gene expression profiles of early postnatal and adult mouse ipRGCs purified from two lines of reporter mice that mark different sets of ipRGC subtypes. We find dozens of novel genes highly enriched in ipRGCs. We reveal that &lt;i&gt;Rasgrp1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Tbx20&lt;/i&gt; are selectively expressed in subsets of ipRGCs, though these molecularly defined groups imperfectly match established ipRGC subtypes. We demonstrate that the ipRGCs regulating circadian photoentrainment are diverse at the molecular level. Our findings reveal unexpected complexity in gene expression patterns across mammalian ipRGC subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Interaction of Cortical and Amygdalar Synaptic Input Modulates the Window of Opportunity for Information Processing in the Rhinal Cortices</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/4/ENEURO.0020-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The perirhinal (PER) and lateral entorhinal (LEC) cortex function as a gateway for information transmission between (sub)cortical areas and the hippocampus. It is hypothesized that the amygdala, a key structure in emotion processing, can modulate PER-LEC neuronal activity before information enters the hippocampal memory pathway. This study determined the integration of synaptic activity evoked by simultaneous neocortical and amygdala electrical stimulation in PER-LEC deep layer principal neurons and parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in mouse brain slices. The data revealed that both deep layer PER-LEC principal neurons and PV interneurons receive synaptic input from the neocortical agranular insular cortex (AiP) and the lateral amygdala (LA). Furthermore, simultaneous stimulation of the AiP and LA never reached the firing threshold in principal neurons of the PER-LEC deep layers. PV interneurons however, mainly showed linear summation of simultaneous AiP and LA inputs and reached their firing threshold earlier. This early PV firing was reflected in the forward shift of the evoked inhibitory conductance in principal neurons, thereby creating a more precise temporal window for coincidence detection, which likely plays a crucial role in information processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Significant hematoma expansion (HE) affects one‐fifth of people within 24 hours after acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and its prevention is an appealing treatment target. Although the computed tomography (CT)‐angiography spot sign predicts HE, only a minority of ICH patients receive contrast injection. Conversely, noncontrast CT (NCCT) is used to diagnose nearly all ICH, so NCCT markers represent a widely available alternative for prediction of HE. However, different NCCT signs describe similar features, with lack of consensus on the optimal image acquisition protocol, assessment, terminology, and diagnostic criteria. In this review, we propose practical guidelines for detecting, interpreting, and reporting NCCT predictors of HE. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Imaging gradual neurodegeneration in a basal ganglia model disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25566?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X‐linked dystonia‐parkinsonism (XDP) is a neurodegenerative disease with adult onset dystonia and subsequent parkinsonism. Postmortem and imaging studies revealed remarkable striatal pathology, with a predominant involvement of the striosomal compartment in the early phase. Here, we aimed to disentangle sequential neurodegeneration in the striatum of XDP patients, provide evidence for preferential loss of distinct striatal areas in the early phase, and investigate whether iron accumulation is present.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used multimodal structural magnetic resonance imaging (voxel‐based morphometry and relaxometry) in 18 male XDP patients carrying a &lt;i&gt;TAF1&lt;/i&gt; mutation and 19 age‐matched male controls.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voxel‐based relaxometry and morphometry revealed (1) a cluster in the anteromedial putamen showing high iron content and severe atrophy (−55%) and (2) a cluster with reduced relaxation rates as a marker for increased water levels and a lower degree of atrophy (−20%) in the dorsolateral putamen. Iron deposition correlated with the degree of atrophy (ρ = −0.585, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.011) and disease duration (ρ = 0.632, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.005) in the anteromedial putamen. In the dorsolateral putamen, sensorimotor putamen atrophy correlated with disease severity (ρ = −0.649, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.004).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This multimodal approach identified a patchy pattern of atrophy within the putamen. Atrophy is advanced and associated with iron accumulation in rostral regions of the striatum, whereas neurodegeneration is moderate and still ongoing in dorsolateral areas. Given the short disease duration and predominant dystonic phenotype, these results are well in line with early and preferential degeneration of striosome‐rich striatal areas in XDP.

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2019.00023</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synaptic transmission has been studied for decades, as a fundamental step in brain function. The structure of the synapse, and its changes during activity, turned out to be key aspects not only in the transfer of information between neurons, but also in cognitive processes such as learning and memory. The overall synaptic morphology has traditionally been studied by electron microscopy, which enables the visualization of synaptic structure in great detail. The changes in the organization of easily identified structures, such as the presynaptic active zone, or the postsynaptic density, are optimally studied via electron microscopy. However, few reliable methods are available for labeling individual organelles or protein complexes in electron microscopy. For such targets one typically relies either on combination of electron and fluorescence microscopy, or on super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. This review focuses on approaches and techniques used to specifically reveal synaptic organelles and protein complexes, such as cytoskeletal assemblies. We place the strongest emphasis on methods detecting the targets of interest by affinity binding, and we discuss the advantages and limitations of each method.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00208</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Phosphoinositides, the seven phosphorylated derivatives of phosphatidylinositol have emerged as regulators of key sub-cellular processes such as membrane transport, cytoskeletal function and plasma membrane signaling in eukaryotic cells. All of these processes are also present in the cells that constitute the nervous system of animals and in this setting too, these are likely to tune key aspects of cell biology in relation to the unique structure and function of neurons. Phosphoinositides metabolism and function are mediated by enzymes and proteins that are conserved in evolution, and analysis of knockouts of these in animal models implicate this signaling system in neural function. Most recently, with the advent of human genome analysis, mutations in genes encoding components of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway have been implicated in human diseases although the cell biological basis of disease phenotypes in many cases remains unclear. In this review we evaluate existing evidence for the involvement of phosphoinositide signaling in human nervous system diseases and discuss ways of enhancing our understanding of the role of this pathway in the human nervous system’s function in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This research is expected to expedite the discovery of medications for opioid overdose and opioid use disorders, leading toward a safer and more effective treatment of pain. Here, we review mechanistic insights from recent all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of a specific subset of GPCRs for which high-resolution experimental structures are available, including opioid, cannabinoid, orexin, metabotropic glutamate, and dopamine receptor subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Early exposure to nociceptive events may cause brain structural alterations in preterm neonates, with long-lasting consequences on neurodevelopmental outcome. Little is known on the extent to which early pain may affect brain connectivity. We aim to evaluate brain functional connectivity changes in preterm neonate that underwent multiple invasive procedures during the postnatal period, and to correlate them with the neurodevelopmental outcome at 24 months.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;In this prospective case-control study, we collected information about exposure to painful events during the early postnatal period and resting-state BOLD-fMRI data at term equivalent age from two groups of preterm neonate: 33 subjected to painful procedures during the neonatal intensive care (mean gestational age 27.9 ± 1.8 weeks) and 13 who did not require invasive procedures (average gestational age 31.2 ± 2.1 weeks). A data-driven principal-component-based multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) was used to investigate the effect of early pain exposure on brain functional connectivity, and the relationship between connectivity changes and neurodevelopmental outcome at 24 months, assessed with Griffiths, Developmental Scale-Revised: 0–2.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Early pain was associated with decreased functional connectivity between thalami and bilateral somatosensory cortex, and between the right insular cortex and ipsilateral amygdala and hippocampal regions, with a more evident effect in preterm neonate undergoing more invasive procedures.

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00875</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) is a white matter tract that connects the occipital and the temporal lobes. ILF abnormalities have been associated with deficits in visual processing and language comprehension in dementia patients, thus suggesting that its integrity is important for semantic processing. However, it remains elusive whether ILF microstructural organization per se impacts the visual semantic processing efficiency in the healthy brain. The present study aims to investigate whether there is an association between ILF’s microstructural organization and visual semantic processing at the individual level. We hypothesized that the efficiency of visual semantic processing positively correlates with the degree of anisotropy of the ILF. We studied 10 healthy right-handed subjects. We determined fractional anisotropy (FA) of the ILF using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We extracted N400m latency and amplitude from magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals during a visual semantic decision task. N400m and mean FA of the ILF were left lateralized with the higher FA value in the left hemisphere. Inter-individual analysis showed that FA of the ILF negatively correlated with the N400m latency and amplitude, which suggests that high ILF anisotropy is associated with more efficient semantic processing. In summary, our findings provide supporting evidence for a role of the ILF in language comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a prevalent long-term neurodegenerative disease. Though the criteria of PD diagnosis are relatively well defined, current diagnostic procedures using medical images are labor-intensive and expertise-demanding. Hence, highly integrated automatic diagnostic algorithms are desirable.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;In this work, we propose an end-to-end multi-modality diagnostic framework, including segmentation, registration, feature extraction and machine learning, to analyze the features of striatum for PD diagnosis. Multi-modality images, including T1-weighted MRI and &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C-CFT PET, are integrated into the proposed framework. The reliability of this method is validated on a dataset with the paired images from 49 PD subjects and 18 Normal (NL) subjects.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We obtained a promising diagnostic accuracy in the PD/NL classification task. Meanwhile, several comparative experiments were conducted to validate the performance of the proposed framework.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;We demonstrated that (1) the automatic segmentation provides accurate results for the diagnostic framework, (2) the method combining multi-modality images generates a better prediction accuracy than the method with single-modality PET images, and (3) the volume of the striatum is proved to be irrelevant to PD diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00803</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain functioning relies on various segregated/specialized neural regions functioning as an integrated-interconnected network (i.e., metastability). Various psychiatric and neurologic disorders are associated with aberrant functioning of these brain networks. In this study, we present a novel framework integrating the strength and temporal variability of metastability in brain networks. We demonstrate that this approach provides novel mechanistic insights which enables better imaging-based predictions. Using whole-brain resting-state fMRI and a graph-theoretic framework, we integrated strength and temporal-variability of complex-network properties derived from effective connectivity networks, obtained from 87 U.S. Army soldiers consisting of healthy combat controls (n = 28), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; n = 17), and PTSD with comorbid mild-traumatic brain injury (mTBI; n = 42). We identified prefrontal dysregulation of key subcortical and visual regions in PTSD/mTBI, with all network properties exhibiting lower variability over time, indicative of poorer flexibility. Larger impairment in the prefrontal-subcortical pathway but not prefrontal-visual pathway differentiated comorbid PTSD/mTBI from the PTSD group. Network properties of the prefrontal-subcortical pathway also had significant association (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.56) with symptom severity and neurocognitive performance; and were also found to possess high predictive ability (81.4% accuracy in classifying the disorders, explaining 66–72% variance in symptoms), identified through machine learning. Our framework explained 13% more variance in behaviors compared to the conventional framework. These novel insights and better predictions were made possible by our novel framework using static and time-varying network properties in our three-group scenario, advancing the mechanistic understanding of PTSD and comorbid mTBI. Our contribution has wide-ranging applications for network-level characterization of healthy brains as well as mental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Somatostatin-Expressing Interneurons Form Axonal Projections to the Contralateral Hippocampus</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00056</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Conscious memories are critically dependent upon bilateral hippocampal formation, and interhemispheric commissural projections made by mossy cells and CA3 pyramidal cells. GABAergic interneurons also make long-range axonal projections, but little is known regarding their commissural, inter-hippocampal connections. We used retrograde and adeno-associated viral tracing, immunofluorescence and electron microscopy, and in vitro optogenetics to assess contralateral projections of neurochemically defined interneuron classes. We found that contralateral-projecting interneurons were 24-fold less common compared to hilar mossy cells, and mostly consisted of somatostatin- and parvalbumin-expressing types. Somatostatin-expressing cells made denser contralateral axonal projections than parvalbumin-expressing cells, although this was typically 10-fold less than the ipsilateral projection density. Somatostatin-expressing cells displayed a topographic-like innervation according to the location of their somata, whereas parvalbumin-expressing cells mostly innervated CA1. In the dentate gyrus molecular layer, commissural interneuron post-synaptic targets were predominantly putative granule cell apical dendrites. In the hilus, varicosities in close vicinity to various interneuron subtypes, as well as mossy cells, were observed, but most contralateral axon varicosities had no adjacent immunolabeled structure. Due to the relative sparsity of the connection and the likely distal dendritic location of their synapses, commissural projections made by interneurons were found to be weak. We postulate that these projections may become functionally active upon intense network activity during tasks requiring increased memory processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Temporal Control of Axonal Transport: The Extreme Case of Organismal Ageing</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00393</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A fundamental question in cell biology is how cellular components are delivered to their destination with spatial and temporal precision within the crowded cytoplasmic environment. The long processes of neurons represent a significant spatial challenge and make these cells particularly dependent on mechanisms for long-range cytoskeletal transport of proteins, RNA and organelles. Although many studies have substantiated a role for defective transport of axonal cargoes in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, remarkably little is known about how transport is regulated throughout ageing. The scale of the challenge posed by ageing is considerable because, in this case, the temporal regulation of transport is ultimately dictated by the length of organismal lifespan, which can extend to days, years or decades. Recent methodological advances to study live axonal transport during ageing in situ have provided new tools to scratch beneath the surface of this complex problem and revealed that age-dependent decline in the transport of mitochondria is a common feature across different neuronal populations of several model organisms. In certain instances, the molecular pathways that affect transport in ageing animals have begun to emerge. However, the functional implications of these observations are still not fully understood. Whether transport decline is a significant determinant of neuronal ageing or a mere consequence of decreased cellular fitness remains an open question. In this review, we discuss the latest developments in axonal trafficking in the ageing nervous system, along with the early studies that inaugurated this new area of research. We explore the possibility that the interplay between mitochondrial function and motility represents a crucial driver of ageing in neurons and put forward the hypothesis that declining axonal transport may be legitimately considered a hallmark of neuronal ageing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: RAD6B Plays a Critical Role in Neuronal DNA Damage Response to Resist Neurodegeneration</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00392</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;RAD6 participates in DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) repair by ubiquitinating histone H2B in mitotic cells. In terminally differentiated cells, however, the mechanisms of DNA damage repair are less well known. In this study, we investigate whether RAD6B is involved in DSBs repair in neurons and effects of RAD6B deficiency on neuronal survival. We compared neurons of RAD6B-deficient mice with those of littermate wild type (WT) mice and induced DNA damage by X-ray irradiation. We provide evidence that RAD6B is essential for neural DDR and RAD6B deficiency results in increased genomic instability and neurodegeneration. Moreover, higher levels of p53 and p21 are present in the brains of RAD6B-deficient mice, which may be responsible for neuronal senescence, and degeneration. In addition, behavioral experiments show that RAD6B-deficient mice exhibit marked learning and memory deficits. In conclusion, these findings suggest that RAD6B is critical for neural integrity and that the absence of RAD6B accelerates neurodegeneration in mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Secretin Regulates Excitatory GABAergic Neurotransmission to GnRH Neurons via Retrograde NO Signaling Pathway in Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00371</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In mammals, reproduction is regulated by a wide range of metabolic hormones that maintain the proper energy balance. In addition to regulating feeding and energy expenditure, these metabolic messengers also modulate the functional performance of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Secretin, a member of the secretin-glucagon-vasoactive intestinal peptide hormone family, has been shown to alter reproduction centrally, although the underlying mechanisms have not been explored yet. In order to elucidate its central action in the neuroendocrine regulation of reproduction, in vitro electrophysiological slice experiments were carried out on GnRH-GFP neurons in male mice. Bath application of secretin (100 nM) significantly increased the frequency of the spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sPSCs) to 118.0 ± 2.64% compared to the control, and that of the GABAergic miniature postsynaptic currents (mPSCs) to 147.6 ± 19.19%. Resting membrane potential became depolarized by 12.74 ± 4.539 mV after secretin treatment. Frequency of evoked action potentials (APs) also increased to 144.3 ± 10.8%. The secretin-triggered elevation of the frequency of mPSCs was prevented by using either a secretin receptor antagonist (3 μM) or intracellularly applied G-protein-coupled receptor blocker (GDP-β-S; 2 mM) supporting the involvement of secretin receptor in the process. Regarding the actions downstream to secretin receptor, intracellular blockade of protein kinase A (PKA) with KT-5720 (2 μM) or intracellular inhibition of the neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) by NPLA (1 μM) abolished the stimulatory effect of secretin on mPSCs. These data suggest that secretin acts on GnRH neurons via secretin receptors whose activation triggers the cAMP/PKA/nNOS signaling pathway resulting in nitric oxide release and in the presynaptic terminals this retrograde NO machinery regulates the GABAergic input to GnRH neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Longitudinal spinal cord atrophy in multiple sclerosis using the generalized boundary shift integral</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25571?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spinal cord atrophy is a clinically relevant feature of multiple sclerosis (MS), but longitudinal assessments on magnetic resonance imaging using segmentation‐based methods suffer from measurement variability, especially in multicenter studies. We compared the generalized boundary shift integral (GBSI), a registration‐based method, with a standard segmentation‐based method.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baseline and 1‐year spinal cord 3‐dimensional T1‐weighted images (1mm isotropic) were obtained from 282 patients (52 clinically isolated syndrome [CIS], 196 relapsing–remitting MS [RRMS], 34 progressive MS [PMS]), and 82 controls from 8 MAGNIMS (Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Multiple Sclerosis) sites on multimanufacturer and multi–field‐strength scans. Spinal Cord Toolbox was used for C2‐5 segmentation and cross‐sectional area (CSA) calculation. After cord straightening and registration, GBSI measured atrophy based on the probabilistic boundary‐shift region of interest. CSA and GBSI percentage annual volume change was calculated.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GBSI provided similar rates of atrophy, but reduced measurement variability compared to CSA in all MS subtypes (CIS: −0.95 ± 2.11% vs −1.19 ± 3.67%; RRMS: −1.74 ± 2.57% vs −1.74 ± 4.02%; PMS: −2.29 ± 2.40% vs −1.29 ± 3.20%) and healthy controls (0.02 ± 2.39% vs −0.56 ± 3.77%). GBSI performed better than CSA in differentiating healthy controls from CIS (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.66 vs 0.53; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03), RRMS (AUC = 0.73 vs 0.59; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), PMS (AUC = 0.77 vs 0.53; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), and patients with disability progression from patients without progression (AUC = 0.59 vs 0.50; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04). Sample size to detect 60% treatment effect on spinal cord atrophy over 1 year was lower for GBSI than CSA (CIS: 106 vs 830; RRMS: 95 vs 335; PMS: 44 vs 215; power = 80%; alpha = 5%).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The registration‐based method (GBSI) allowed better separation between MS patients and healthy controls and improved statistical power, when compared with a conventional segmentation‐based method (CSA), although it is still far from perfect. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00203</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia which characterized by a progressive loss of memory and cognitive function due to degeneration of synapses and axons. Currently, there is no cure for AD. Deposition of extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and intracellular tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are two hallmark pathologic changes in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients. Autophagy is the major mechanism in cells responsible for removing protein aggregates. Accumulation of immature autophagic vacuoles (AVs) in dystrophic neurites of Alzheimer patients’ brains suggests that autophagy process is disrupted. Till now, it is far from clear what role autophagy plays in AD, a causative role, a protective role, or just a consequence of the disease process itself. To design more effective therapeutic strategies towards this devastating disorder, it is essential to understand the exact role of autophagy played during different stages of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00892</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The human brain is thought to be an extremely complex but efficient computing engine, processing vast amounts of information from a changing world. The decline in the synaptic density of neuronal networks is one of the most important characteristics of brain development, which is closely related to synaptic pruning, synaptic growth, synaptic plasticity, and energy metabolism. However, because of technical limitations in observing large-scale neuronal networks dynamically connected through synapses, how neuronal networks are organized and evolve as their synaptic density declines remains unclear. Here, by establishing a biologically reasonable neuronal network model, we show that despite a decline in the synaptic density, the connectivity, and efficiency of neuronal networks can be improved. Importantly, by analyzing the degree distribution, we also find that both the scale-free characteristic of neuronal networks and the emergence of hub neurons rely on the spatial distance between neurons. These findings may promote our understanding of neuronal networks in the brain and have guiding significance for the design of neuronal network models.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Accumulation and aggregation of misfolded alpha-synuclein is believed to be a cause of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein at S129 is known to be associated with the pathological misfolding process, but efforts to investigate the relevance of this post-translational modification for pathology have been frustrated by difficulties in detecting and quantifying it in relevant samples. We report novel, ultrasensitive immunoassays based on single-molecule counting technology, useful for detecting alpha-synuclein and its S129 phosphorylated form in clinical samples in the low pg/ml range. Using human CSF and plasma samples, we find levels of alpha-synuclein comparable to those previously reported. However, while alpha-synuclein phosphorylated on S129 could easily be detected in human plasma, where its detection is extremely sensitive to protein phosphatases, its levels in CSF were undetectable, with a possible influence of a matrix effect. In plasma samples from a small test cohort comprising 5 PD individuals and five age-matched control individuals we find that pS129 alpha-synuclein levels are increased in PD plasma samples, in line with previous reports. We conclude that pS129 alpha-synuclein is not detectable in CSF and recommend the addition of phosphatase inhibitors to plasma samples at the time of collection. Moreover, the findings obtained on the small cohort of clinical plasma samples point to plasma pS129 alpha-synuclein levels as a candidate diagnostic biomarker in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Decreased Cross-Domain Mutual Information in Schizophrenia From Dynamic Connectivity States</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00873</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The study of dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) has been important to understand the healthy and diseased brain. Recent developments model groups of functionally related brain structures (defined as functional domains) as entities that can send and receive information. A domain analysis starts by detecting a finite set of connectivity patterns known as domain states within each functional domain. Dynamic functional domain connectivity (DFDC) is a novel information theoretic framework for studying the temporal sequence of the domain states and the amount of information shared among domains. In this setting, the information flow among functional domains can be compared to the flow of bits among entities in a digital network. Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric disorder which is associated with how the brain processes information. Here, we employed the DFDC framework to analyze a dataset containing resting-state fMRI scans from 163 healthy controls (HCs) and 151 schizophrenia patients (SZs). As in other information theory methods, this study measured domain state probabilities, entropy within each DFDC and the cross-domain mutual information (CDMI) between pairs of DFDC. Results indicate that SZs show significantly higher (transformed) entropy than HCs in subcortical (SC)-SC; default mode network (DMN)-visual (VIS) and frontoparietal (FRN)-VIS DFDCs. SZs also show lower (transformed) CDMI between SC-VIS vs. SC-sensorimotor (SM), attention (ATTN)-VIS vs. ATTN-SM and ATTN-SM vs. ATTN-ATTN DFDC pairs after correcting for multiple comparisons. These results imply that different DFDC pairs function in a more independent manner in SZs compared to HCs. Our findings present evidence of higher uncertainty and randomness in SZ brain function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25585?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes have gained attention as important players in neurological disease. In line with their heterogeneous character, defects in specific astrocyte subtypes have been identified. Leukodystrophy Vanishing White Matter shows selective vulnerability in white matter astrocytes, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Induced pluripotent stem cell technology is extensively being explored in studies of pathophysiology and regenerative medicine. However, models for distinct astrocyte subtypes for VWM are lacking, thereby hampering identification of disease‐specific pathways.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we characterize human and mouse pluripotent stem cell‐derived grey and white matter astrocyte subtypes to generate an in vitro Vanishing White Matter model. We examined morphology and functionality, and used co‐culture methods, high‐content microscopy and RNA sequencing to study Vanishing White Matter cultures.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found intrinsic vulnerability in specific astrocyte subpopulations in Vanishing White Matter. When comparing Vanishing White Matter and control cultures, white matter‐like astrocytes inhibited oligodendrocyte maturation, and showed affected pathways in both human and mouse cultures, involving the immune system and extracellular matrix. Interestingly, human white matter‐like astrocytes presented additional, human‐specific disease mechanisms, such as neuronal and mitochondrial functioning.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astrocyte subtype cultures revealed disease‐specific pathways in Vanishing White Matter. Cross‐validation of human and mouse‐derived protocols identified human‐specific disease aspects. This study provides new insights into VWM disease mechanisms which helps the development of &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; regenerative applications, and we further present strategies to study astrocyte subtype vulnerability in neurological disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leukoencephalopathies comprise a broad spectrum of disorders, but the genetic background of adult leukoencephalopathies has rarely been assessed.

We found 12 patients with GGC expansion in &lt;i&gt;NOTCH2NLC&lt;/i&gt; as the most frequent cause of adult leukoencephalopathy followed by &lt;i&gt;NOTCH3&lt;/i&gt; variants in our cohort. Further, we found one case with &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; GGC expansion, which might explain the underlying pathogenesis of sporadic cases.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Reduction of skin innervation is associated with a severe fibromyalgia phenotype</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25565?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess patterns and impact of small nerve fiber dysfunction and pathology in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One hundred seventeen women with FMS underwent neurological examination, questionnaire assessment, neurophysiology assessment, and small fiber tests: skin punch biopsy, corneal confocal microscopy, microneurography, quantitative sensory testing including C‐tactile afferents, and pain‐related evoked potentials. Data were compared with those of women with major depressive disorder and chronic widespread pain (MD‐P) and healthy women.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) was reduced at different biopsy sites in 63% of FMS patients (MD‐P: 10%, controls: 18%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001 for each). We found 4 patterns of skin innervation in FMS: normal, distally reduced, proximally reduced, and both distally and proximally reduced (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01 for each compared to controls). Microneurography revealed initial activity‐dependent acceleration of conduction velocity upon low frequencies of stimulation in 1A fibers, besides 1B fiber spontaneous activity and mechanical sensitization in FMS patients.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Exploring the Phase-Locking Mechanisms Yielding Delayed and Anticipated Synchronization in Neuronal Circuits</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00041</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synchronization is one of the brain mechanisms allowing the coordination of neuronal activity required in many cognitive tasks. Anticipated Synchronization (AS) is a specific type of out-of-phase synchronization that occurs when two systems are unidirectionally coupled and, consequently, the information is transmitted from the sender to the receiver, but the receiver leads the sender in time. It has been shown that the primate cortex could operate in a regime of AS as part of normal neurocognitive function. However it is still unclear what is the mechanism that gives rise to anticipated synchronization in neuronal motifs. Here, we investigate the synchronization properties of cortical motifs on multiple scales and show that the internal dynamics of the receiver, which is related to its free running frequency in the uncoupled situation, is the main ingredient for AS to occur. For biologically plausible parameters, including excitation/inhibition balance, we found that the phase difference between the sender and the receiver decreases when the free running frequency of the receiver increases. As a consequence, the system switches from the usual delayed synchronization (DS) regime to an AS regime. We show that at three different scales, neuronal microcircuits, spiking neuronal populations and neural mass models, both the inhibitory loop and the external current acting on the receiver mediate the DS-AS transition for the sender-receiver configuration by changing the free running frequency of the receiver. Therefore, we propose that a faster internal dynamics of the receiver system is the main mechanism underlying anticipated synchronization in brain circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Whisker-Mediated Touch System in Rodents: From Neuron to Behavior</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00040</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A key question in systems neuroscience is to identify how sensory stimuli are represented in neuronal activity, and how the activity of sensory neurons in turn is “read out” by downstream neurons and give rise to behavior. The choice of a proper model system to address these questions, is therefore a crucial step. Over the past decade, the increasingly powerful array of experimental approaches that has become available in non-primate models (e.g., optogenetics and two-photon imaging) has spurred a renewed interest for the use of rodent models in systems neuroscience research. Here, I introduce the rodent whisker-mediated touch system as a structurally well-established and well-organized model system which, despite its simplicity, gives rise to complex behaviors. This system serves as a behaviorally efficient model system; known as nocturnal animals, along with their olfaction, rodents rely on their whisker-mediated touch system to collect information about their surrounding environment. Moreover, this system represents a well-studied circuitry with a somatotopic organization. At every stage of processing, one can identify anatomical and functional topographic maps of whiskers; “barrelettes” in the brainstem nuclei, “barreloids” in the sensory thalamus, and “barrels” in the cortex. This article provides a brief review on the basic anatomy and function of the whisker system in rodents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Corticofugal Augmentation of the Auditory Brainstem Response With Respect to Cortical Preference</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00039</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Physiological studies documented highly specific corticofugal modulations making subcortical centers focus processing on sounds that the auditory cortex (AC) has experienced to be important. Here, we show the effects of focal conditioning (FC) of the primary auditory cortex (FC&lt;sub&gt;AI&lt;/sub&gt;) on auditory brainstem response (ABR) amplitudes and latencies in house mice. FC&lt;sub&gt;AI&lt;/sub&gt; significantly increased ABR peak amplitudes (peaks I–V), decreased thresholds, and shortened peak latencies in responses to the frequency tuned by conditioned cortical neurons. The amounts of peak amplitude increases and latency decreases were specific for each processing level up to the auditory midbrain. The data provide new insights into possible corticofugal modulation of inner hair cell synapses and new corticofugal effects as neuronal enhancement of processing in the superior olivary complex (SOC) and lateral lemniscus (LL). Thus, our comprehensive ABR approach confirms the role of the AC as instructor of lower auditory levels and extends this role specifically to the cochlea, SOC, and LL. The whole pathway from the cochlea to the inferior colliculus appears, in a common mode, instructed in a very similar way.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00038</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent investigations of the rat posterior parietal cortex (PPC) suggest that this region plays a central role in action control together with the frontal cortical areas. Posterior parietal-frontal cortical connections have been described in rats, but little is known about whether these connections are topographically organized as in the primate. Here, we injected retrograde and anterograde tracers into subdivisions of PPC as well as the frontal midline and orbital cortical areas to explore possible topographies within their connections. We found that PPC projects to several frontal cortical areas, largely reciprocating the densest input received from the same areas. All PPC subdivisions are strongly connected with the secondary motor cortex (M2) in a topographically organized manner. The medial subdivision (medial posterior parietal cortex, mPPC) has a dense reciprocal connection with the most caudal portion of M2 (cM2), whereas the lateral subdivision (lateral posterior parietal cortex, lPPC) and the caudolateral subdivision (PtP) are reciprocally connected with the intermediate rostrocaudal portion of M2 (iM2). Sparser reciprocal connections were seen with anterior cingulate area 24b. mPPC connects with rostral, and lPPC and PtP connect with caudal parts of 24b, respectively. There are virtually no connections with area 24a, nor with prelimbic or infralimbic cortex. PPC and orbitofrontal cortices are also connected, showing a gradient such that mPPC entertains reciprocal connections mainly with the ventral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), whereas lPPC and PtP are preferentially connected with medial and central portions of ventrolateral OFC, respectively. Our results thus indicate that the connections of PPC with frontal cortices are organized in a topographical fashion, supporting functional heterogeneity within PPC and frontal cortices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Here, we discuss conceptual/definitional issues related to biomarker development, discuss practical implementation issues, and suggest preliminary guidelines for validating EEG approaches as biomarkers with a context of use in neurodevelopmental disorder drug development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Involvement of Descending Pain Inhibitory System in Electroacupuncture-Induced Analgesia</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00038</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chronic pain is a major health problem, which can impair quality of life and reduce productivity. Electroacupuncture (EA), a modality of medicine based on the theories of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), presents great therapeutic effects on chronic pain. Its clinical application has gained increasing popularity, and in parallel, more research has been performed on the mechanisms of EA-induced analgesia. The past decades have seen enormous advances both in neuronal circuitry of needle-insertion and in its molecular mechanism. EA may block pain by activating the descending pain inhibitory system, which originates in the brainstem and terminates at the spinal cord. This review article synthesizes corresponding studies to elucidate how EA alleviate pain via the mediation of this descending system. Much emphasis has been put on the implication of descending serotonergic and noradrenergic pathways in the process of pain modulation. Also, other important transmitters and supraspinal regions related to analgesic effects of EA have been demonstrated. Finally, it should be noticed that there exist some shortcomings involved in the animal experimental designed for EA, which account for conflicting results obtained by different studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Serial Metabolic Evaluation of Perihematomal Tissues in the Intracerebral Hemorrhage Pig Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00888</link>
	<content:encoded>Purpose&lt;p&gt;Perihematomal edema (PHE) occurs in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and is often used as surrogate of secondary brain injury. PHE resolves over time, but little is known about the functional integrity of the tissues that recover from edema. In a pig ICH model, we aimed to assess metabolic integrity of perihematoma tissues by using non-invasive magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;Fourteen male Yorkshire pigs with an average age of 8 weeks were intracerebrally injected with autologous blood to produce ICH. Proton MRS data were obtained at 1, 7, and 14 days after ICH using a whole-body 3.0T MRI system. Point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS)-localized 2D chemical shift imaging (CSI) was acquired. The concentration of N-Acetylaspartate (NAA), Choline (Cho), and Creatine (Cr) were measured within the area of PHE, tissues adjacent to the injury with no or negligible edema (ATNE), and contralesional brain tissue. A linear mixed model was used to analyze the evolution of metabolites in perihematomal tissues, with p-value &amp;lt; 0.05 indicating statistical significance.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The perihematoma volume gradually decreased from 2.38 ± 1.23 ml to 0.41 ± 0.780 ml (p &amp;lt; 0.001) over 2 weeks. Significant (p &amp;lt; 0.001) reductions in NAA, Cr, and Cho concentrations were found in the PHE and ATNE regions compared to the contralesional hemisphere at day 1 and 7 after ICH. All three metabolites were significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.001) restored in the PHE tissue on day 14, but remained persistently low in the ATNE area, and unaltered in the contralesional voxel.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This study highlights the potential of MRS to probe salvageable tissues within the perihematoma in the sub-acute phase of ICH. Altered metabolites within the PHE and ATNE regions in addition to edema and hematoma volumes were explored as possible markers for tissue recovery. Perihematomal tissue with PHE demonstrated a more reversible injury compared to the tissue adjacent to the injury without edema, suggesting a potentially beneficial role of edema.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00871</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The profile of 122 metabolites in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients suffering from Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and controls was studied. Among the 122 metabolites analyzed, 61 could be detected. Statistically significant differences between the AD and control group were only detected for metabolites of the glycolysis. Thus, accurate quantification of 11 glycolytic metabolites was done. We detected a significant reduction of five of them, namely phosphoenolpyruvate, 2-phosphoglycerate, 3-phosphoglycerate, pyruvate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate in the AD CSF compared to controls. These results correlate with the known reduction of glucose metabolism in the brain of patients with AD and indicate that metabolic analysis of the central carbon metabolism can be a potential tool in AD diagnostic. Although the Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses of the metabolites do not reach the level of the diagnostic informativity of AD biomarkers, the combination of specific glycolysis metabolites with the established biomarkers may lead to an improvement in sensitivity and specificity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Development of Efficient AAV2/DJ-Based Viral Vectors to Selectively Downregulate the Expression of Neuronal or Astrocytic Target Proteins in the Rat Central Nervous System</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00201</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Viral vectors have become very popular to overexpress or downregulate proteins of interest in different cell types. They conveniently allow the precise targeting of well-defined tissue areas, which is particularly useful in complex organs like the brain. In theory, each vector should have its own cell specificity that can be obtained by using different strategies (e.g., using a cell-specific promoter). For the moment, there is few vectors that have been developed to alternatively target, using the same capsid, neurons and astrocytes in the central nervous system. There is even fewer examples of adeno-associated viral vectors able to efficiently transduce cells both in vitro and in vivo. The development of viral vectors allowing the cell-specific downregulation of a protein in cultured cells of the central nervous system as well as in vivo within a large brain area would be highly desirable to address several important questions in neurobiology. Here we report that the use of the AAV2/DJ viral vector associated to an hybrid CMV/chicken β-actin promoter (CBA) or to a modified form of the glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter (G1B3) allows a specific transduction of neurons or astrocytes in more than half of the barrel field within the rat somatosensory cortex. Moreover, the use of the miR30E-shRNA technology led to an efficient downregulation of two proteins of interest related to metabolism both in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to downregulate the expression of different protein isoforms in a cell-specific manner using a common serotype. It is proposed that such an approach could be extended to other cell types and used to target several proteins of interest within the same brain area.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00194</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hyperglycemia, a key characteristic and risk factor for diabetes mellitus (DM), causes neuronal senescence. Hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) is a novel neuroprotectant. The present work was to investigate the potential effect of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S on hyperglycemia-induced neuronal senescence and the underlying mechanisms. We found that NaHS, a donor of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, inhibited high glucose (HG)-induced cellular senescence in HT22 cells (an immortalized mouse hippocampal cell line), as evidenced by a decrease in the number of senescence associated-β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) positive cells, increase in the growth of cells, and down-regulations of senescence mark proteins, p16&lt;sup&gt;INK4a&lt;/sup&gt; and p21&lt;sup&gt;CIP1&lt;/sup&gt;. NaHS improved the autophagic flux, which is judged by a decrease in the amount of intracellular autophagosome as well as up-regulations of LC3II/I and P62 in HG-exposed HT22 cells. Furthermore, blocked autophagic flux by chloroquine (CQ) significantly abolished NaHS-exerted improvement in the autophagic flux and suppression in the cellular senescence of GH-exposed HT22 cells, which indicated that H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S antagonizes HG-induced neuronal senescence by promoting autophagic flux. We also found that NaHS up-regulated the expression of silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1), an important anti-aging protein, in HG-exposed HT22 cells. Furthermore, inhibition of SIRT1 by sirtinol reversed the protection of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S against HG-induced autophagic flux blockade and cellular senescence in HT22 cells. These data indicated that H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S protects HT22 cells against HG-induced neuronal senescence by improving autophagic flux via up-regulation of SIRT1, suggesting H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S as a potential treatment strategy for hyperglycemia-induced neuronal senescence and neurotoxicity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Sound of Scotoma: Audio Space Representation Reorganization in Individuals With Macular Degeneration</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00044</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Blindness is an ideal condition to study the role of visual input on the development of spatial representation, as studies have shown how audio space representation reorganizes in blindness. However, how spatial reorganization works is still unclear. A limitation of the study on blindness is that it is a “stable” system and it does not allow for studying the mechanisms that subtend the progress of this reorganization. To overcome this problem here we study, for the first time, audio spatial reorganization in 18 adults with macular degeneration (MD) for which the loss of vision due to scotoma is an ongoing progressive process. Our results show that the loss of vision produces immediate changes in the processing of spatial audio signals. In individuals with MD, the lateral sounds are “attracted” toward the central scotoma position resulting in a strong bias in the spatial auditory percept. This result suggests that the reorganization of audio space representation is a fast and plastic process occurring also later in life, after vision loss.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00043</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Learning and memorizing sequences of events is an important function of the human brain and the basis for forming expectations and making predictions. Learning is facilitated by repeating a sequence several times, causing rhythmic appearance of the individual sequence elements. This observation invites to consider the resulting multitude of rhythms as a spectral “fingerprint” which characterizes the respective sequence. Here we explore the implications of this perspective by developing a neurobiologically plausible computational model which captures this “fingerprint” by attuning an ensemble of neural oscillators. In our model, this attuning process is based on a number of oscillatory phenomena that have been observed in electrophysiological recordings of brain activity like synchronization, phase locking, and reset as well as cross-frequency coupling. We compare the learning properties of the model with behavioral results from a study in human participants and observe good agreement of the errors for different levels of complexity of the sequence to be memorized. Finally, we suggest an extension of the model for processing sequences that extend over several sensory modalities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00039</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Animal communication plays an essential role in triggering diverse behaviors. It is believed in this regard that signal production by a sender and its perception by a receiver is co-evolving in order to have beneficial effects such as to ensure that conspecifics remain sensitive to these signals. However, in order to give appropriate responses to a communication signal, the receiver has to first detect and interpret it in a meaningful way. The detection of communication signals can be limited under some circumstances, for example when the signal is masked by the background noise in which it occurs (e.g., the cocktail-party problem). Moreover, some signals are very alike despite having different meanings making it hard to discriminate between them. How the central nervous system copes with these tasks and problems is a central question in systems neuroscience. Gymnotiform weakly electric fish pose an interesting system to answer these questions for various reasons: (1) they use a variety of communication signals called “chirps” during different behavioral encounters; (2) the central physiology of the electrosensory system is well known; and (3) most importantly, these fish give reliable behavioral responses to artificial stimuli that resemble natural communication signals, making it possible to uncover the neural mechanisms that lead to the observed behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Humans and animals can learn to order a list of items without relying on explicit spatial or temporal cues. To do so, they appear to make use of transitivity, a property of all ordered sets. Here, we summarize relevant research on the transitive inference (TI) paradigm and its relationship to learning the underlying order of an arbitrary set of items. We compare six computational models of TI performance, three of which are model-free (Q-learning, Value Transfer, and REMERGE) and three of which are model-based (RL-Elo, Sequential Monte Carlo, and Betasort). Our goal is to assess the ability of these models to produce empirically observed features of TI behavior. Model-based approaches perform better under a wider range of scenarios, but no single model explains the full scope of behaviors reported in the TI literature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator that mainly exists in the nervous system. It plays a neuroprotective role in organisms and widely participates in the regulation of various physiological processes in vivo. Studies in both humans and animal models have been revealed that NPY levels are altered in some neurodegenerative and neuroimmune disorders. NPY plays various roles in these diseases, such as exerting a neuroprotective effect, increasing trophic support, decreasing excitotoxicity, regulating calcium homeostasis, and attenuating neuroinflammation. In this review, we will focus on the roles of NPY in the pathological mechanisms of neurodegenerative and neuroimmune diseases, highlighting NPY as a potential therapeutic target in these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00864</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cessation of blood flow leads to a complex cascade of pathophysiological events at the blood-vascular-parenchymal interface which evolves over time and space, and results in damage to neural cells and edema formation. Cerebral ischemic injury evokes a profound and deleterious upregulation in inflammation and triggers multiple cell death pathways, but it also induces a series of the events associated with regenerative responses, including vascular remodeling, angiogenesis, and neurogenesis. Emerging evidence suggests that epigenetic reprograming could play a pivotal role in ongoing post-stroke neurovascular unit (NVU) changes and recovery. This review summarizes current knowledge about post-stroke recovery processes at the NVU, as well as epigenetic mechanisms and modifiers (e.g., DNA methylation, histone modifying enzymes and microRNAs) associated with stroke injury, and NVU repair. It also discusses novel drug targets and therapeutic strategies for enhancing post-stroke recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00859</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is a main cause of vascular dementia and is also an etiological factor of neurological diseases and mental disorders. However, few treatments are available for CCH, and new medications are needed. In the present study, we employed a rat model of CCH that was based on bilateral common carotid artery occlusion and investigated the therapeutic effects of resveratrol and its detailed mechanism of action. We evaluated neurological deficit scores and performed the Morris water maze test, hematoxylin and eosin staining, TUNEL staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and Western blot. Resveratrol reduced neurological deficit scores in CCH rats and reduced pathological damage in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. Resveratrol activated autophagy and inhibited the expression of AKT/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway-related proteins. Treatment with a phosphoinositide-3 kinase inhibitor reversed the protective effect of resveratrol. These findings suggest that resveratrol improves cognitive function in a rat model of CCH and reduces oxidative stress-induced neuronal damage in the frontal cortex and hippocampus by activating autophagy and inhibiting neuronal apoptosis. These effects may be regulated by the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: The Benefit of Slice Timing Correction in Common fMRI Preprocessing Pipelines</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00821</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Due to the nature of fMRI acquisition protocols, slices cannot be acquired simultaneously, and as a result, are temporally misaligned from each other. To correct from this misalignment, preprocessing pipelines often incorporate slice timing correction (STC). However, evaluating the benefits of STC is challenging because it (1) is dependent on slice acquisition parameters, (2) interacts with head movement in a non-linear fashion, and (3) significantly changes with other preprocessing steps, fMRI experimental design, and fMRI acquisition parameters. Presently, the interaction of STC with various scan conditions has not been extensively examined. Here, we examine the effect of STC when it is applied with various other preprocessing steps such as motion correction (MC), motion parameter residualization (MPR), and spatial smoothing. Using 180 simulated and 30 real fMRI data, we quantitatively demonstrate that the optimal order in which STC should be applied depends on interleave parameters and motion level. We also demonstrate the benefit STC on sub-second-TR scans and for functional connectivity analysis. We conclude that STC is a critical part of the preprocessing pipeline that can be extremely beneficial for fMRI processing. However, its effectiveness interacts with other preprocessing steps and with other scan parameters and conditions which may obscure its significant importance in the fMRI processing pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has shown great promise as a medical treatment of depression. The effectiveness of TMS treatment at high frequency has been well investigated; however, low-frequency TMS in depression treatment has rarely been investigated in depression-induced cognitive deficits. Herein, this study was carried out to assess the possible modulatory role of low-frequency pulsed magnetic field (LFPMF) on reversing cognitive impairment in a model of depression induced by chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). Wistar rats were randomly allocated into four groups as follows: a control group (CON), a control applied with LFPMF (CON + LFPMF), a CUS group, and a CUS treated with LFPMF (CUS + LFPMF) group. During 8 weeks of CUS, compared to those in the CON group, animals not only gained less weight but also exhibited anhedonia, anxiety, and cognitive decline in behavioral tests. After 2-week treatment of LFPMF, a 20 mT, 1 Hz magnetic stimulation, it reversed the impairment of spatial cognition as well as hippocampal synaptic function including long-term potentiation and related protein expression. Thus, LFPMF has shown effectively improvements on depressant behavior and cognitive dysfunction in CUS rats, possibly via regulating synaptic function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Closed-loop or intelligent neuromodulation allows adjustable, personalized neuromodulation which usually incorporates the recording of a biomarker, followed by implementation of an algorithm which decides the timing (when?) and strength (how much?) of stimulation. Closed-loop neuromodulation has been shown to have greater benefits compared to open-loop neuromodulation, particularly for therapeutic applications such as pharmacoresistant epilepsy, movement disorders and potentially for psychological disorders such as depression or drug addiction. However, an important aspect of the technique is selection of an appropriate, preferably neural biomarker. Neurochemical sensing can provide high resolution biomarker monitoring for various neurological disorders as well as offer deeper insight into neurological mechanisms. The chemicals of interest being measured, could be ions such as potassium (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), sodium (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), chloride (Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), hydrogen (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) or neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin and glutamate. This review focusses on the different building blocks necessary for a neurochemical, closed-loop neuromodulation system including biomarkers, sensors and data processing algorithms. Furthermore, it also highlights the merits and drawbacks of using this biomarker modality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is associated with the processing of negative emotions. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) metabolism plays an important role in the pathogenesis of mental disorders. We aimed to determine the changes in GABA levels in the ACC of perimenopausal women with depression.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We recruited 120 perimenopausal women, who were followed up for 18–24 months. After reaching menopause, the participants were divided into a control group (n = 71), an anxiety group (n = 30), and a depression group (n = 19). The participants were examined using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). TARQUIN software was used to calculate the GABA concentrations in the ACC before and after menopause. The relationship of the GABA levels with the patients’ scores on the 14-item Hamilton Anxiety Scale and 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale was determined.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;GABA decreased with time. The postmenopausal GABA levels were significantly lower in the depression group than in the anxiety group and were significantly lower in both these groups than in the normal group. The postmenopausal GABA levels were significantly lower than the premenopausal levels in the normal, anxiety, and depression groups (P = 0.014, &amp;lt;0.001, and &amp;lt;0.001, respectively). The premenopausal GABA levels did not significantly differ between the normal vs. anxiety group (P = 0.907), normal vs. depression group (P = 0.495), and anxiety vs. depression group. The postmenopausal GABA levels were significantly lower in the depression group than in the anxiety group and were significantly lower in both these groups than in the normal group, normal vs. anxiety group (P = 0.022), normal vs. depression group (P &amp;lt; 0.001), and anxiety vs. depression group (P = 0.047).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Changes in GABA concentrations in the anterior cingulate cortex are related with the pathophysiological mechanism and symptoms of perimenopausal depression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00053</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Emotion recognition using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals has attracted significant research attention. However, it is difficult to improve the emotional recognition effect across subjects. In response to this difficulty, in this study, multiple features were extracted for the formation of high-dimensional features. Based on the high-dimensional features, an effective method for cross-subject emotion recognition was then developed, which integrated the significance test/sequential backward selection and the support vector machine (ST-SBSSVM). The effectiveness of the ST-SBSSVM was validated on a dataset for emotion analysis using physiological signals (DEAP) and the SJTU Emotion EEG Dataset (SEED). With respect to high-dimensional features, the ST-SBSSVM average improved the accuracy of cross-subject emotion recognition by 12.4% on the DEAP and 26.5% on the SEED when compared with common emotion recognition methods. The recognition accuracy obtained using ST-SBSSVM was as high as that obtained using sequential backward selection (SBS) on the DEAP dataset. However, on the SEED dataset, the recognition accuracy increased by ~6% using ST-SBSSVM from that using the SBS. Using the ST-SBSSVM, ~97% (DEAP) and 91% (SEED) of the program runtime was eliminated when compared with the SBS. Compared with recent similar works, the method developed in this study for emotion recognition across all subjects was found to be effective, and its accuracy was 72% (DEAP) and 89% (SEED).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00081</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The detailed architectural examination of the neuronal nuclei in any brain region, using confocal microscopy, requires quantification of fluorescent signals in three-dimensional stacks of confocal images. An essential prerequisite to any quantification is the segmentation of the nuclei which are typically tightly packed in the tissue, the extreme being the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), in which nuclei frequently appear to overlap due to limitations in microscope resolution. Segmentation in DG is a challenging task due to the presence of a significant amount of image artifacts and densely packed nuclei. Accordingly, we established an algorithm based on continuous boundary tracing criterion aiming to reconstruct the nucleus surface and to separate the adjacent nuclei. The presented algorithm neither uses a pre-built nucleus model, nor performs image thresholding, which makes it robust against variations in image intensity and poor contrast. Further, the reconstructed surface is used to study morphology and spatial arrangement of the nuclear interior. The presented method is generally dedicated to segmentation of crowded, overlapping objects in 3D space. In particular, it allows us to study quantitatively the architecture of the neuronal nucleus using confocal-microscopic approach.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: Fast 3-D Imaging of Brain Organoids With a New Single-Objective Planar-Illumination Two-Photon Microscope</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00077</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human inducible pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) hold a large potential for disease modeling. hiPSC-derived human astrocyte and neuronal cultures permit investigations of neural signaling pathways with subcellular resolution. Combinatorial cultures, and three-dimensional (3-D) embryonic bodies (EBs) enlarge the scope of investigations to multi-cellular phenomena. The highest level of complexity, brain organoids that—in many aspects—recapitulate anatomical and functional features of the developing brain permit the study of developmental and morphological aspects of human disease. An ideal microscope for 3-D tissue imaging at these different scales would combine features from both confocal laser-scanning and light-sheet microscopes: a micrometric optical sectioning capacity and sub-micrometric spatial resolution, a large field of view and high frame rate, and a low degree of invasiveness, i.e., ideally, a better photon efficiency than that of a confocal microscope. In the present work, we describe such an instrument that uses planar two-photon (2P) excitation. Its particularity is that—unlike two- or three-lens light-sheet microscopes—it uses a single, low-magnification, high-numerical aperture objective for the generation and scanning of a virtual light sheet. The microscope builds on a modified Nipkow-Petráň spinning-disk scheme for achieving wide-field excitation. However, unlike the Yokogawa design that uses a tandem disk, our concept combines micro lenses, dichroic mirrors and detection pinholes on a single disk. This new design, advantageous for 2P excitation, circumvents problems arising with the tandem disk from the large wavelength difference between the infrared excitation light and visible fluorescence. 2P fluorescence excited by the light sheet is collected with the same objective and imaged onto a fast sCMOS camera. We demonstrate 3-D imaging of TO-PRO3-stained EBs and of brain organoids, uncleared and after rapid partial transparisation with triethanolamine formamide (RTF) and we compare the performance of our instrument to that of a confocal laser-scanning microscope (CLSM) having a similar numerical aperture. Our large-field 2P-spinning disk microscope permits one order of magnitude faster imaging, affords less photobleaching and permits better depth penetration than a confocal microscope with similar spatial resolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, and although its etiology remains unclear, it seems that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and other prediabetic states of insulin resistance could contribute to the appearance of sporadic AD. As such, we have assessed whether tau and β‐amyloid (Aβ) deposits might be present in pancreatic tissue of subjects with AD, and whether amylin, an amyloidogenic protein deposited in the pancreas of T2DM patients, might accumulate in the brain of AD patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We studied pancreatic and brain tissue from 48 individuals with no neuropathological alterations and from 87 subjects diagnosed with AD. We examined Aβ and tau accumulation in the pancreas as well as that of amylin in the brain. Moreover, we performed proximity ligation assays to ascertain whether tau and/or Aβ interact with amylin in either the pancreas or brain of these subjects.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cytoplasmic tau and Aβ protein deposits were detected in pancreatic β cells of subjects with AD as well as in subjects with a normal neuropathological examination but with a history of T2DM and in a small cohort of control subjects without T2DM. Furthermore, we found amylin deposits in the brain of these subjects, providing histological evidence that amylin can interact with Aβ and tau in both the pancreas and hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of both tau and Aβ inclusions in pancreatic β cells, and of amylin deposits in the brain, provides new evidence of a potential overlap in the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of T2DM and AD. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Early Aβ reduction prevents progression of cerebral amyloid angiopathy</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25562?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical trials targeting β‐amyloid peptides (Aβ) for Alzheimer disease (AD) failed for arguable reasons that include selecting the wrong stages of AD pathophysiology or Aβ being the wrong target. Targeting Aβ to prevent cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) has not been rigorously followed, although the causal role of Aβ for CAA and related hemorrhages is undisputed. CAA occurs with normal aging and to various degrees in AD, where its impact and treatment is confounded by the presence of parenchymal Aβ deposition.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;APPDutch mice develop CAA in the absence of parenchymal amyloid, mimicking hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis Dutch type (HCHWA‐D). Mice were treated with a β‐site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) inhibitor. We used 3‐dimensional ultramicroscopy and immunoassays for visualizing CAA and assessing Aβ in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAA onset in mice was at 22 to 24 months, first in frontal leptomeningeal and superficial cortical vessels followed by vessels penetrating the cortical layers. CSF Aβ increased with aging followed by a decrease of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 upon CAA onset, supporting the idea that combined reduction of CSF Aβ40 and Aβ42 is a specific biomarker for vascular amyloid. BACE1 inhibitor treatment starting at CAA onset and continuing for 4 months revealed a 90% Aβ reduction in CSF and largely prevented CAA progression and associated pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first study showing that Aβ reduction at early disease time points largely prevents CAA in the absence of parenchymal amyloid. Our observation provides a preclinical basis for Aβ‐reducing treatments in patients at risk of CAA and in presymptomatic HCHWA‐D. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: To assist clinicians to operate repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) precisely based on the coil magnetic field spatial distribution with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Navigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A fast method for calculating electromagnetic fields in layered brain structures in frequency domain was proposed. By approaching Bessel function in different intervals, the integral with a highly oscillatory kernel was transformed into two parts: a definite integral and a weakened oscillatory one. The distribution of induced current density and magnetic field intensity of rTMS stimulation effect on brain was quantitatively calculated, so that clinicians could intuitively grasp the safe range of coil stimulation on the brain. Then, the crucial factor of the stimulation effect of rTMS was determined, and an accurate coil positioning of the rTMS efficiently was completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Result: The maximal attenuation of induced electric field and magnetic induction intensity was 72.20 and 86.867% at 3 cm away from the skin in the brain layered model. The clinical examination results of electric field intensity distribution, magnetic field intensity distribution, current density distribution, layered brain modeling, and coil location speed in the brain model teaching group were significantly higher than those in the traditional teaching group (P &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: It is suitable for clinicians to quickly complete the precise positioning of rTMS, master the adjustment of coil stimulation therapeutic parameters, and realize the precise positioning operation of rTMS with MRI navigation in intracranial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR1800018616); Registered on 30th September 2018&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Preparing for the Worst: Evidence that Older Adults Proactively Downregulate Negative Affect</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz166/5550872?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Previous studies have only investigated age-related differences in emotional processing and encoding in response to, not in anticipation of, emotional stimuli. In the current study, we investigated age-related differences in the impact of emotional anticipation on affective responses and episodic memory for emotional images. Young and older adults were scanned while encoding negative and neutral images preceded by cues that were either valid or invalid predictors of image valence. Participants were asked to rate the emotional intensity of the images and to complete a recognition task. Using multivariate behavioral partial least squares (PLS) analysis, we found that greater anticipatory recruitment of the amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and hippocampus in older adults predicted reduced memory for negative than neutral images and the opposite for young adults. Seed PLS analysis further showed that following negative cues older adults, but not young adults, exhibited greater activation of vmPFC, reduced activation of amygdala, and worse memory for negative compared with neutral images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide evidence that the “positivity effect” seen in older adults’ memory performance may be related to the spontaneous emotional suppression of negative affect in anticipation of, not just in response to, negative stimuli.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Understanding the molecular function of MeCP2 will not only provide insights into the pathogenesis of MeCP2-related disorders, but will also shed light on the epigenetic regulation of neuronal function. In the past few years, a number of studies have provided mechanistic evidence that MeCP2 recruits co-repressor complexes to particular sequences of methylated DNA. Additionally, innovative design and high-throughput sequencing technologies have provided opportunities to study the effects of MeCP2 on the neuronal transcriptome at an unprecedented level of detail, demonstrating that MeCP2 modulates gene expression in a context-specific manner. These findings have raised new questions and challenged current models of MeCP2 function. In this review, we describe several recent developments, highlight future challenges, and articulate a model by which MeCP2 functions as an organizer of chromatin architecture to modulate global gene expression in the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

Recent developments in neural recording technologies are providing unprecedented access to the activity of such populations during increasingly complex experimental contexts; however, extracting scientific insights from such recordings requires the concurrent development of analytical tools that relate this population activity to system-level function. This is a primary motivation for latent variable models, which seek to provide a low-dimensional description of population activity that can be related to experimentally controlled variables, as well as uncontrolled variables such as internal states (e.g. attention and arousal) and elements of behavior. While deriving an understanding of function from traditional latent variable methods relies on low-dimensional visualizations, new approaches are targeting more interpretable descriptions of the components underlying system-level function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Cystatin B Involvement in Synapse Physiology of Rodent Brains and Human Cerebral Organoids</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00195</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cystatin B (CSTB) is a ubiquitous protein belonging to a superfamily of protease inhibitors. CSTB may play a critical role in brain physiology because its mutations cause progressive myoclonic epilepsy-1A (EPM1A), the most common form of progressive myoclonic epilepsy. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of CSTB in the central nervous system (CNS) are largely unknown. To investigate the possible involvement of CSTB in the synaptic plasticity, we analyzed its expression in synaptosomes as a model system in studying the physiology of the synaptic regions of the CNS. We found that CSTB is not only present in the synaptosomes isolated from rat and mouse brain cortex, but also secreted into the medium in a depolarization-controlled manner. In addition, using biorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) procedure, we demonstrated, for the first time, that CSTB is locally synthesized in the synaptosomes. The synaptic localization of CSTB was confirmed in a human 3D model of cortical development, namely cerebral organoids. Altogether, these results suggest that CSTB may play a role in the brain plasticity and open a new perspective in studying the involvement of CSTB deregulation in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00192</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recently, we reported that ALWPs, which we developed by combining Liuwei Dihuang pills (LWPs) with antler, regulate the LPS-induced neuroinflammatory response and rescue LPS-induced short- and long-term memory impairment in wild-type (WT) mice. In the present study, we examined the effects of ALWPs on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology and cognitive function in WT mice as well as 5x FAD mice (a mouse model of AD). We found that administration of ALWPs significantly reduced amyloid plaque levels in 5x FAD mice and significantly decreased amyloid β (Aβ) levels in amyloid precursor protein (APP)-overexpressing H4 cells. In addition, ALWPs administration significantly suppressed tau hyperphosphorylation in 5x FAD mice. Oral administration of ALWPs significantly improved long-term memory in scopolamine (SCO)-injected WT mice and 5x FAD mice by altering dendritic spine density. Importantly, ALWPs promoted spinogenesis in primary hippocampal neurons and WT mice and modulated the dendritic spine number in an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent manner. Taken together, our results suggest that ALWPs are a candidate therapeutic drug for AD that can modulate amyloid plaque load, tau phosphorylation, and synaptic/cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00868</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The advances in medicine, together with lifestyle modifications, led to a rising life expectancy. Unfortunately, however, aging is accompanied by an alarming boost of age-associated chronic pathologies, including neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases. Interestingly, a non-negligible interplay between alterations of glucose homeostasis and brain dysfunction has clearly emerged. In particular, epidemiological studies have pointed out a possible association between Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Insulin resistance, one of the major hallmark for etiology of T2D, has a detrimental influence on PD, negatively affecting PD phenotype, accelerating its progression and worsening cognitive impairment. This review aims to provide an exhaustive analysis of the most recent evidences supporting the key role of insulin resistance in PD pathogenesis. It will focus on the relevance of insulin in the brain, working as pro-survival neurotrophic factor and as a master regulator of neuronal mitochondrial function and oxidative stress. Insulin action as a modulator of dopamine signaling and of alpha-synuclein degradation will be described in details, too. The intriguing idea that shared deregulated pathogenic pathways represent a link between PD and insulin resistance has clinical and therapeutic implications. Thus, ongoing studies about the promising healing potential of common antidiabetic drugs such as metformin, exenatide, DPP IV inhibitors, thiazolidinediones and bromocriptine, will be summarized and the rationale for their use to decelerate neurodegeneration will be critically assessed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: MRS Reveals Chronic Inflammation in T2w MRI-Negative Perilesional Cortex – A 6-Months Multimodal Imaging Follow-Up Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00863</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sustained inflammation in the injured cortex is a promising therapeutic target for disease-modification after traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, its extent and dynamics of expansion are incompletely understood which challenges the timing and placement of therapeutics to lesioned area. Our aim was to characterize the evolution of chronic inflammation during lesion expansion in lateral fluid-percussion injury (FPI) rat model with focus on the MRI-negative perilesional cortex. T2-weighted MR imaging (T2w MRI) and localized magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) were performed at 1, 3, and 6 months post-injury. End-point histology, including Nissl for neuronal death, GFAP for astrogliosis, and Prussian Blue for iron were used to assess perilesional histopathology. An additional animal cohort was imaged with a positron emission tomography (PET) using translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) radiotracer [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]-FEPPA. T2w MRI assessed lesion growth and detected chronic inflammation along the lesion border while rest of the ipsilateral cortex was MRI-negative (MRI-). Instead, myo-inositol that is an inflammatory MRS marker for gliosis, glutathione for oxidative stress, and choline for membrane turnover were elevated throughout the 6-months follow-up in the MRI- perilesional cortex (all p &amp;lt; 0.05). MRS markers revealed chronically sustained inflammation across the ipsilateral cortex but did not indicate the upcoming lesion expansion. Instead, the rostral expansion of the cortical lesion was systematically preceded by a hyperintense band in T2w images months earlier. Histologic analysis of the hyperintensity indicated scattered astrocytes, incomplete glial scar, and intracellularly packed and free iron. Yet, the band was negative in [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]-FEPPA-PET. [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]-FEPPA also showed no cortical TSPO expression within the MRS voxel in MRI- perilesional cortex or anywhere along glial scar when assessed at 2 months post-injury. However, [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]-FEPPA showed a robust signal increase, indicating reactive microgliosis in the ipsilateral thalamus at 2 months post-TBI. We present evidence that MRS reveals chronic posttraumatic inflammation in MRI-negative perilesional cortex. The mismatch in MRS, MRI, and PET measures may allow non-invasive endophenotyping of beneficial and detrimental inflammatory processes to aid targeting and timing of anti-inflammatory therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00810</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Gliomas are the most common primary brain malignancies. Accurate and robust tumor segmentation and prediction of patients' overall survival are important for diagnosis, treatment planning and risk factor identification. Here we present a deep learning-based framework for brain tumor segmentation and survival prediction in glioma, using multimodal MRI scans. For tumor segmentation, we use ensembles of three different 3D CNN architectures for robust performance through a majority rule. This approach can effectively reduce model bias and boost performance. For survival prediction, we extract 4,524 radiomic features from segmented tumor regions, then, a decision tree and cross validation are used to select potent features. Finally, a random forest model is trained to predict the overall survival of patients. The 2018 MICCAI Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTS), ranks our method at 2nd and 5th place out of 60+ participating teams for survival prediction tasks and segmentation tasks respectively, achieving a promising 61.0% accuracy on the classification of short-survivors, mid-survivors and long-survivors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Mounting experimental evidence and decades of computational work have decisively shown that dendrites leverage a host of nonlinear biophysical phenomena and actively participate in sophisticated computations, at the level of the single neuron and at the level of the network. However, a coherent view of their processing power is still lacking and dendrites are largely neglected in neural network models. Here, we describe four classes of dendritic information processing and delineate their implications at the algorithmic level. We propose that beyond the well-known spatiotemporal filtering of their inputs, dendrites are capable of selecting, routing and multiplexing information. By separating dendritic processing from axonal outputs, neuron networks gain a degree of freedom with implications for perception and learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: General Anesthesia: A Probe to Explore Consciousness</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00036</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;General anesthesia reversibly alters consciousness, without shutting down the brain globally. Depending on the anesthetic agent and dose, it may produce different consciousness states including a complete absence of subjective experience (unconsciousness), a conscious experience without perception of the environment (disconnected consciousness, like during dreaming), or episodes of oriented consciousness with awareness of the environment (connected consciousness). Each consciousness state may potentially be followed by explicit or implicit memories after the procedure. In this respect, anesthesia can be considered as a proxy to explore consciousness. During the recent years, progress in the exploration of brain function has allowed a better understanding of the neural correlates of consciousness, and of their alterations during anesthesia. Several changes in functional and effective between-region brain connectivity, consciousness network topology, and spatio-temporal dynamics of between-region interactions have been evidenced during anesthesia. Despite a set of effects that are common to many anesthetic agents, it is still uneasy to draw a comprehensive picture of the precise cascades during general anesthesia. Several questions remain unsolved, including the exact identification of the neural substrate of consciousness and its components, the detection of specific consciousness states in unresponsive patients and their associated memory processes, the processing of sensory information during anesthesia, the pharmacodynamic interactions between anesthetic agents, the direction-dependent hysteresis phenomenon during the transitions between consciousness states, the mechanisms of cognitive alterations that follow an anesthetic procedure, the identification of an eventual unitary mechanism of anesthesia-induced alteration of consciousness, the relationship between network effects and the biochemical or sleep-wake cycle targets of anesthetic agents, as well as the vast between-studies variations in dose and administration mode, leading to difficulties in between-studies comparisons. In this narrative review, we draw the picture of the current state of knowledge in anesthesia-induced unconsciousness, from insights gathered on propofol, halogenated vapors, ketamine, dexmedetomidine, benzodiazepines and xenon. We also describe how anesthesia can help understanding consciousness, we develop the above-mentioned unresolved questions, and propose tracks for future research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2019.00022</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Properties of synaptic release dictates the core of information transfer in neural circuits. Despite decades of technical and theoretical advances, distinguishing bona fide information content from the multiple sources of synaptic variability remains a challenging problem. Here, we employed a combination of computational approaches with cellular electrophysiology, two-photon uncaging of MNI-Glutamate and imaging at single synapses. We describe and calibrate the use of the fluorescent glutamate sensor iGluSnFR and found that its kinetic profile is close to that of AMPA receptors, therefore providing several distinct advantages over slower methods relying on NMDA receptor activation (i.e., chemical or genetically encoded calcium indicators). Using an array of statistical methods, we further developed, and validated on surrogate data, an expectation-maximization algorithm that, by biophysically constraining release variability, extracts the quantal parameters n (maximum number of released vesicles) and p (unitary probability of release) from single-synapse iGluSnFR-mediated transients. Together, we present a generalizable mathematical formalism which, when applied to optical recordings, paves the way to an increasingly precise investigation of information transfer at central synapses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Secreted Amyloid Precursor Protein-Alpha Promotes Arc Protein Synthesis in Hippocampal Neurons</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00198</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Secreted amyloid precursor protein-α (sAPPα) is a neuroprotective and memory-enhancing molecule, however, the mechanisms through which sAPPα promotes these effects are not well understood. Recently, we have shown that sAPPα enhances cell-surface expression of glutamate receptors. Activity-related cytoskeletal-associated protein Arc (Arg3.1) is an immediate early gene capable of modulating long-term potentiation, long-term depression and homeostatic plasticity through regulation of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor localization. Accordingly, we hypothesized that sAPPα may enhance synaptic plasticity, in part, by the de novo synthesis of Arc. Using primary cortical and hippocampal neuronal cultures we found that sAPPα (1 nM, 2 h) enhances levels of Arc mRNA and protein. Arc protein levels were increased in both the neuronal somata and dendrites in a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-dependent manner. Additionally, dendritic Arc expression was dependent upon activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and protein kinase G. The enhancement of dendritic Arc protein was significantly reduced by antagonism of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and nicotinic acetylcholine (α7nACh) receptors, and fully eliminated by dual application of these antagonists. This effect was further corroborated in area CA1 of acute hippocampal slices. These data suggest sAPPα-regulated plasticity within hippocampal neurons is mediated by cooperation of NMDA and α7nACh receptors to engage a cascade of signal transduction molecules to enhance the transcription and translation of Arc.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Risk Factors and Neuropsychological Assessments of Subjective Cognitive Decline (plus) in Chinese Memory Clinic</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00846</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Since subjective cognitive decline (SCD) was standardized in 2014, there have been few studies reporting the risk factors and neuropsychological assessment characteristics of SCD (plus) in memory clinic.
Objective: To characterize SCD (plus) by comparing it with normal control (NC), amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and Alzheimer Disease (AD) regarding their demographics, lifestyle, family history of dementia, multimorbidity and the neuropsychological assessments.
Methods: A total of 135 participants were recruited, including 23 NC, 30 SCD (plus), 45 aMCI and 37 AD. Descriptive statistics were provided. A logistic regression model was used to analyze the affecting factors of SCD (plus), and finally the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was applied to distinguish between SCD (plus) and NC.
Results: (1) SCD (plus) group was younger than both the aMCI group and AD group. It consisted of more participants with mental work and higher body mass index (BMI) than the AD group. (2) Scores of Auditory Verbal Learning Test - Immediate recall (AVLT-IR) and AVLT-Long delayed recall (AVLT-LR) decreased in the following order: NC→SCD (plus)→aMCI→AD. (3) The Area Under Curve (AUC) for discriminating SCD (plus) and NC group was from 0.673 to 0.838.
Conclusions: Ageing is an important risk factor of both NC progressing to SCD (plus), and SCD (plus) progressing to aMCI or AD. In addition to ageing, lower education level and lower BMI were significantly associated with greater odds of SCD (plus) progressing to aMCI or AD patients, whereas mental work was a protective factor of SCD (plus) progressing to AD. Finally, AVLT is a sensitive indicator of the cognitive decline and impairment in SCD (plus) in relative to normal controls.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Determinants of Inter-Individual Variability in Corticomotor Excitability Induced by Paired Associative Stimulation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00841</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a well-established tool in probing cortical plasticity in vivo. Changes in corticomotor excitability can be induced using paired associative stimulation (PAS) protocol, in which TMS over the primary motor cortex is conditioned with an electrical peripheral nerve stimulation of the contralateral hand. PAS with an inter-stimulus interval of 25 ms induces long-term potentiation (LTP)-like effects in cortical excitability. However, the response to a PAS protocol tends to vary substantially across individuals. In this study, we used univariate and multivariate data-driven methods to investigate various previously proposed determinants of inter-individual variability in PAS efficacy, such as demographic, cognitive, clinical, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging measures. Forty-one right-handed participants, comprising 22 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 19 healthy controls (HC), underwent the PAS protocol. Prior to stimulation, demographic, genetic, clinical, as well as structural and resting-state functional MRI data were acquired. The two groups did not differ in any of the variables, except by global cognitive status. Univariate analysis showed that only 61% of all participants were classified as PAS responders, irrespective of group membership. Higher PAS response was associated with lower TMS intensity and with higher resting-state connectivity within the sensorimotor network, but only in responders, as opposed to non-responders. We also found an overall positive correlation between PAS response and structural connectivity within the corticospinal tract, which did not differ between groups. A multivariate random forest (RF) model identified age, gender, education, IQ, global cognitive status, sleep quality, alertness, TMS intensity, genetic factors, and neuroimaging measures (functional and structural connectivity, gray matter (GM) volume, and cortical thickness as poor predictors of PAS response. The model resulted in low accuracy of the RF classifier (58%; 95% CI: 42 − 74%), with a higher relative importance of brain connectivity measures compared to the other variables. We conclude that PAS variability in our sample was not well explained by factors known to influence PAS efficacy, emphasizing the need for future replication studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Low Frequency Systemic Hemodynamic “Noise” in Resting State BOLD fMRI: Characteristics, Causes, Implications, Mitigation Strategies, and Applications</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00787</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Advances in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) acquisition have improved signal to noise to the point where the physiology of the subject is the dominant noise source in resting state fMRI data (rsfMRI). Among these systemic, non-neuronal physiological signals, respiration and to some degree cardiac fluctuations can be removed through modeling, or in the case of newer, faster acquisitions such as simultaneous multislice acquisition, simple spectral filtering. However, significant low frequency physiological oscillation (∼0.01–0.15 Hz) remains in the signal. This is problematic, as it is the precise frequency band occupied by the neuronally modulated hemodynamic responses used to study brain connectivity, precluding its removal by spectral filtering. The source of this signal, and its method of production and propagation in the body, have not been conclusively determined. Here, we summarize the defining characteristics of the systemic low frequency noise signal, and review some current theories about the signal source and the evidence supporting them. The strength and distribution of the systemic LFO signal make characterizing and removing it essential for accurate quantification, especially for resting state connectivity, when no stimulation can be compared with the signal. Widespread correlated non-neuronal signals obscure and distort the more localized patterns of neuronal correlations between interacting brain regions; they may even cause apparent connectivity between regions with no neuronal interaction. Here, we discuss a simple method we have developed to parse the global, moving, blood-borne signal from the stationary, neuronal connectivity signals, substantially reducing the negative correlations that result from global signal regression. Finally, we will discuss some of the uses to which the moving systemic low frequency oscillation can be put if we consider it a “signal” carrying information, rather than simply “noise” complicating the interpretation of resting state connectivity. Properly utilizing this signal may offer insights into subtle hemodynamic alterations that can be used as early indicators of circulatory dysfunction in a number of neuropsychiatric conditions, such as prodromal stroke, moyamoya, and Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00053</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spexin (SPX) is an evolutionarily conserved neuropeptide that is expressed in the mammalian brain and peripheral tissue. Two orthologs are present in the teleost, SPX1 and SPX2. SPX1 is involved in reproduction and food intake. Recently, SPX1 neurons have been found to be located in the specific nuclei of dorsal habenula (dHb) and to project into the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN), in which galanin receptor 2a/2b (GALR2a/2b) expression was also observed. This indicates that habenula SPX1 neurons may interact with GALR2a/2b in the IPN; however, the function of SPX1 in the dHb-IPN neuronal circuit remains unknown. To determine the role of SPX1 in the dHb-IPN neural circuit, we generated transgenic zebrafish overexpressing SPX1 specifically in the dHb. We found that transgenic zebrafish overexpressing SPX1 in the dHb had anxiolytic behaviors compared with their wildtype siblings. Furthermore, quantitative PCR revealed that mRNA expression of galr2a and galr2b in the IPN and serotonin-related genes in the raphe was upregulated in the brains of transgenic zebrafish. Taken together, our data suggest that SPX1 function in the dHb-IPN neural circuits is implicated in the regulation of anxiety behaviors via modulation of the serotoninergic system in zebrafish.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Corticostriatal Oscillations Predict High vs. Low Drinkers in a Rat Model of Limited Access Alcohol Consumption</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00035</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Individuals differ in their vulnerability to develop alcohol dependence, which is determined by innate and environmental factors. The corticostriatal circuit is heavily involved in the development of alcohol dependence and may contain neural information regarding vulnerability to drink excessively. In the current experiment, we hypothesized that we could characterize high and low alcohol-drinking rats (HD and LD, respectively) based on corticostriatal oscillations and that these subgroups would differentially respond to corticostriatal brain stimulation. Male Sprague–Dawley rats (n = 13) were trained to drink 10% alcohol in a limited access paradigm. In separate sessions, local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded from the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Based on training alcohol consumption levels, we classified rats using a median split as HD or LD. Then, using machine-learning, we built predictive models to classify rats as HD or LD by corticostriatal LFPs and compared the model performance from real data to the performance of models built on data permutations. Additionally, we explored the impact of NAcSh or mPFC stimulation on alcohol consumption in HD vs. LD. Corticostriatal LFPs were able to predict HD vs. LD group classification with greater accuracy than expected by chance (&amp;gt;80% accuracy). Moreover, NAcSh stimulation significantly reduced alcohol consumption in HD, but not LD (p &amp;lt; 0.05), while mPFC stimulation did not alter drinking behavior in either HD or LD (p &amp;gt; 0.05). These data collectively show that the corticostriatal circuit is differentially involved in regulating alcohol intake in HD vs. LD rats, and suggests that corticostriatal activity may have the potential to predict a vulnerability to develop alcohol dependence in a clinical population.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00197</link>
	<content:encoded>Despite recent extensive genomic and genetic studies on behavioral responses to ethanol, relatively few new therapeutic targets for the treatment of alcohol use disorder have been validated. Here we describe a cross-species genomic approach focused on identifying gene networks associated with chronic ethanol consumption. To identify brain mechanisms underlying a chronic ethanol consumption phenotype highly relevant to human alcohol use disorder, and to elucidate potential future therapeutic targets, we conducted a genomic study in a nonhuman primate model of chronic open-access ethanol consumption. Microarray analysis of RNA expression in anterior cingulate and subgenual cortices from rhesus macaques was performed across multiple cohorts of animals. Gene networks correlating with ethanol consumption or showing enrichment for ethanol-regulated genes were identified, as were major ethanol-related hub genes within these networks.  A subsequent consensus module analysis was used to co-analyze monkey data with expression data from a chronic intermittent ethanol vapor-exposure and consumption model in C57BL/6J mice. Ethanol-related gene networks conserved between primates and rodents were enriched for genes involved discrete biological functions, including; myelination, synaptic transmission, chromatin modification, Golgi apparatus function, translation, cellular respiration, and RNA processing.  The myelin-related network, in particular, showed strong correlations with ethanol consumption behavior and displayed marked network reorganization between control and ethanol-drinking animals. Further bioinformatics analysis revealed that these networks also showed highly significant overlap with other ethanol-regulated gene sets. Altogether, these studies provide robust primate and rodent cross-species validation of gene networks associated with chronic ethanol consumption. Our results also suggest potential novel focal points for future therapeutic interventions in alcohol use disorder.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Preoptic Area Activation and Vasotocin Involvement in the Reproductive Behavior of a Weakly Pulse-Type Electric Fish, Brachyhypopomus gauderio</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00037</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Social behavior exhibits a wide diversity among vertebrates though it is controlled by a conserved neural network, the social behavior network (SBN). The activity of the SBN is shaped by hypothalamic nonapeptides of the vasopressin-oxytocin family. The weakly electric fish Brachyhypopomus gauderio emits social electrical signals during courtship. Three types of vasotocin (AVT) cells occur in the preoptic area (POA), one of the SBN nodes. In this study, we aimed to test if POA neurons of the nucleus preopticus ventricularis anterior (PPa) and posterior (PPp), and in particular AVT+ cells, were activated by social stimuli using a 2-day behavioral protocol. During the first night, male-female dyads were recorded to identify courting males. During the second night, these males were divided in two experimental conditions: isolated and social (male with a female). Both AVT cells and the cellular activation of the POA neurons (measured by FOS) were identified. We found that the PPa of social males showed more FOS+ cells than the PPa of isolated males, and that the PPa had more AVT+ cells in social males than in isolated males. The double-immunolabeling for AVT and FOS indicated the activation of AVT+ neurons. No significant differences in the activation of AVT+ cells were found between conditions, but a clear association was observed between the number of AVT+ cells and certain behavioral traits. In addition, a different activation of AVT+ cell-types was observed for social vs. isolated males. We conclude that the POA of B. gauderio exhibits changes induced by social stimuli in reproductive context, involving an increase in AVT production and a different profile activation among AVT+ cell populations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Resting State fMRI: Going Through the Motions</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has become an indispensable tool in neuroscience research. Despite this, rs-fMRI signals are easily contaminated by artifacts arising from movement of the head during data collection. The artifacts can be problematic even for motions on the millimeter scale, with complex spatiotemporal properties that can lead to substantial errors in functional connectivity estimates. Effective correction methods must be employed, therefore, to distinguish true functional networks from motion-related noise. Research over the last three decades has produced numerous correction methods, many of which must be applied in combination to achieve satisfactory data quality. Subject instruction, training, and mild restraints are helpful at the outset, but usually insufficient. Improvements come from applying multiple motion correction algorithms retrospectively after rs-fMRI data are collected, although residual artifacts can still remain in cases of elevated motion, which are especially prevalent in patient populations. Although not commonly adopted at present, “real-time” correction methods are emerging that can be combined with retrospective methods and that promise better correction and increased rs-fMRI signal sensitivity. While the search for the ideal motion correction protocol continues, rs-fMRI research will benefit from good disclosure practices, such as: (1) reporting motion-related quality control metrics to provide better comparison between studies; and (2) including motion covariates in group-level analyses to limit the extent of motion-related confounds when studying group differences.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: Novel Technological Solutions for Assessment, Treatment, and Assistance in Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00058</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease, and dementia, represent a common cause of disability and one of the most relevant challenges in the health world. In addition, these conditions do not have, at moment, a pharmacological treatment that can stop the pathological progress. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), defined as the borderline between normal aging and early dementia, represents a meaningful field of study because, in the transition to dementia, clinicians have defined a useful therapeutic window. Additionally, due to the lack of effective pharmacological interventions, recent years have seen an increase in research into new technological solutions to assess, stimulate, and assist patients afflicted with Alzheimer's disease. This review aims to outline the use of information and communication technologies in the field studying MCI. Particularly, the goal is to depict the framework and describe the most worthwhile research efforts, in order to display the current technologies available, describe the research objectives, and delineate prospective future researches. Regarding data sources, the research was conducted within three databases, PubMed Central, Web of Science, and Scopus, between January 2009 and December 2017. A total of 646 articles were found in the initial search. Accurate definition of the exclusion criteria and selection strategy allowed identification of the most relevant papers to use for the study. Finally, 56 papers were fully evaluated and included in this review. Three major clinical application areas have been portrayed, namely “Cognitive Assessment,” “Treatment,” and “Assistance.” These have been combined with three main technological solutions, specifically “Sensors,” “Personal Devices,” and “Robots.” Furthermore, the study of the publications time series illustrates a steadily increasing trend, characterized by the enrollment of small groups of subjects, and particularly oriented to the subjects assistance using robots companion. In conclusion, despite the new technological solutions for people with MCI have received much interest, particularly regarding robots for assistance, nowadays it still owns vast room for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Automatic Brain Tumor Segmentation Based on Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks With Uncertainty Estimation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00056</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Automatic segmentation of brain tumors from medical images is important for clinical assessment and treatment planning of brain tumors. Recent years have seen an increasing use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for this task, but most of them use either 2D networks with relatively low memory requirement while ignoring 3D context, or 3D networks exploiting 3D features while with large memory consumption. In addition, existing methods rarely provide uncertainty information associated with the segmentation result. We propose a cascade of CNNs to segment brain tumors with hierarchical subregions from multi-modal Magnetic Resonance images (MRI), and introduce a 2.5D network that is a trade-off between memory consumption, model complexity and receptive field. In addition, we employ test-time augmentation to achieve improved segmentation accuracy, which also provides voxel-wise and structure-wise uncertainty information of the segmentation result. Experiments with BraTS 2017 dataset showed that our cascaded framework with 2.5D CNNs was one of the top performing methods (second-rank) for the BraTS challenge. We also validated our method with BraTS 2018 dataset and found that test-time augmentation improves brain tumor segmentation accuracy and that the resulting uncertainty information can indicate potential mis-segmentations and help to improve segmentation accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Back-Propagation Learning in Deep Spike-By-Spike Networks</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00055</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are important building blocks in technical applications. They rely on noiseless continuous signals in stark contrast to the discrete action potentials stochastically exchanged among the neurons in real brains. We propose to bridge this gap with Spike-by-Spike (SbS) networks which represent a compromise between non-spiking and spiking versions of generative models. What is missing, however, are algorithms for finding weight sets that would optimize the output performances of deep SbS networks with many layers. Here, a learning rule for feed-forward SbS networks is derived. The properties of this approach are investigated and its functionality is demonstrated by simulations. In particular, a Deep Convolutional SbS network for classifying handwritten digits achieves a classification performance of roughly 99.3% on the MNIST test data when the learning rule is applied together with an optimizer. Thereby it approaches the benchmark results of ANNs without extensive parameter optimization. We envision this learning rule for SBS networks to provide a new basis for research in neuroscience and for technical applications, especially when they become implemented on specialized computational hardware.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
