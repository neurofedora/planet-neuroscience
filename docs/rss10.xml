	<content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A raster display of repeated motor cortical evoked potentials with single pulses of deep brain stimulation in the globus pallidus, pars interna in a patient with cervical dystonia. Each line represents a single trial, with stimulation beginning at the left margin, and the length of each line equivalent to 50 msec of recording. Dark blue = 0 mV, lighter blue-green colors = negative voltage, purple-red colors = positive voltage. Note that the evoked potential is negative at about 10 msec, positive at about 25 msec, and then near zero again at 50 msec. See Ni et al., pp 352–362, this issue.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Pallidal deep brain stimulation modulates cortical excitability and plasticity</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25156</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25156-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internal globus pallidus (GPi) deep brain stimulation (DBS) relieves symptoms in dystonia patients. However, the physiological effects produced by GPi DBS are not fully understood. In particular, how a single-pulse GPi DBS changes cortical circuits has never been investigated. We studied the modulation of motor cortical excitability and plasticity with single-pulse GPi DBS in dystonia patients with bilateral implantation of GPi DBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25156-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cortical evoked potentials from DBS were recorded with electroencephalography. Transcranial magnetic stimulation with a conditioning test paired-pulse paradigm was used to investigate the effect of GPi DBS on the primary motor cortex. How GPi DBS might modulate the motor cortical plasticity was tested using a paired associative stimulation paradigm with repetitive pairs of GPi DBS and motor cortical stimulation at specific time intervals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25156-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;GPi stimulation produced 2 peaks of cortical evoked potentials with latencies of ∼10 and ∼25 milliseconds in the motor cortical area. Cortical facilitation was observed at ∼10 milliseconds after single-pulse GPi DBS, and cortical inhibition was observed after a ∼25-millisecond interval. Repetitive pairs of GPi stimulation with cortical stimulation at these 2 time intervals produced long-term potentiation-like effects in the motor cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25156-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Single-pulse DBS modulates cortical excitability and plasticity at specific time intervals. These effects may be related to the mechanism of action of DBS. Combination of DBS with cortical stimulation with appropriate timing has therapeutic potential and could be explored in the future as a method to enhance the effects of neuromodulation for neurological and psychiatric diseases.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Neutrophil hyperactivation correlates with Alzheimer's disease progression</title>

Neutrophils are key components of early innate immunity and contribute to uncontrolled systemic inflammation if not tightly regulated. The aim of our study was to fully characterize human circulating neutrophils at different disease stages in AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25159-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analyzed neutrophil phenotypes and functions in 42 patients with AD (16 with mild cognitive impairment and 26 with dementia), and compared them to 22 age-matched healthy subjects. This study was performed directly in whole blood to avoid issues with data interpretation related to cell isolation procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25159-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood samples from AD patients with dementia revealed neutrophil hyperactivation associated with increased reactive oxygen species production and increased levels of intravascular neutrophil extravascular traps. The homeostasis of circulating neutrophils in these patients also changed: The ratio between the harmful hyperreactive CXCR4&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt;/CD62L&lt;sup&gt;low&lt;/sup&gt; senescent and the CD16&lt;sup&gt;bright&lt;/sup&gt;/CD62L&lt;sup&gt;dim&lt;/sup&gt; immunosuppressive neutrophil subsets rose in the later stage of the disease. These abnormalities were greater in fast-decliner than in slow-decliner patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25159-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results indicate that the inflammatory properties of circulating neutrophils shift as the percentage of aged neutrophils expands in patients with AD—changes that may play an instrumental role in establishing systemic chronic inflammation. Most important, our data strongly suggest that the neutrophil phenotype may be associated with the rate of cognitive decline and may thus constitute an innovative and prognostic blood biomarker in patients with AD.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the study of neurons, morphology influences function. The complexity in
the structure of neurons poses a challenge in the identification and analysis
of similar and dissimilar neuronal cells. Existing methodologies carry out
structural and geometrical simplifications, which substantially change the
morphological statistics. Using digitally-reconstructed neurons, we extend the
work of Path2Path as ElasticPath2Path, which seamlessly integrates the
graph-theoretic and differential-geometric frameworks. By decomposing a neuron
into a set of paths, we derive graph metrics, which are path concurrence and
path hierarchy. Next, we model each path as an elastic string to compute the
geodesic distance between the paths of a pair of neurons. Later, we formulate
the problem of finding the distance between two neurons as a path assignment
problem with a cost function combining the graph metrics and the geodesic
deformation of paths. ElasticPath2Path is shown to have superior performance
over the state of the art.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06772</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this thesis, we present robust and fully-automated methods for the
subdivision of the entire human cerebral cortex based on connectivity
information. Our contributions are four-fold: First, we propose a clustering
approach to delineate a cortical parcellation that provides a reliable
abstraction of the brain's functional organisation. Second, we cast the
parcellation problem as a feature reduction problem and make use of manifold
learning and image segmentation techniques to identify cortical regions with
distinct structural connectivity patterns. Third, we present a multi-layer
graphical model that combines within- and between-subject connectivity, which
is then decomposed into a cortical parcellation that can represent the whole
population, while accounting for the variability across subjects. Finally, we
conduct a large-scale, systematic comparison of existing parcellation methods,
with a focus on providing some insight into the reliability of brain
parcellations in terms of reflecting the underlying connectivity, as well as,
revealing their impact on network analysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We evaluate the proposed parcellation methods on publicly available data from
the Human Connectome Project and a plethora of quantitative and qualitative
evaluation techniques investigated in the literature. Experiments across
multiple resolutions demonstrate the accuracy of the presented methods at both
subject and group levels with regards to reproducibility and fidelity to the
data. The neuro-biological interpretation of the proposed parcellations is also
investigated by comparing parcel boundaries with well-structured properties of
the cerebral cortex. Results show the advantage of connectivity-driven
parcellations over traditional approaches in terms of better fitting the
underlying connectivity.

Throwing is a uniquely human skill that requires a high degree of coordination to successfully hit a target. Timing of ball release appears crucial as previous studies report required timing accuracies as short as 1-2ms, which however appear physiologically challenging. This study mathematically and experimentally demonstrates that humans can overcome these seemingly stringent timing requirements by shaping their hand trajectories to create extended timing windows, where ball releases achieve target hits despite temporal imprecision. Subjects practiced four task variations in a virtual environment, each with a distinct geometry of the solution space. Model-based analyses of arm trajectories revealed that subjects first decreased timing error, followed by lengthening timing windows in their hand trajectories. This pattern was invariant across solution spaces, except a control case. Hence, the exquisite skill that humans evolved for throwing is achieved by developing strategies that are less sensitive to temporal variability arising from neuromotor noise. This analysis also provides an explanation why coaches emphasize the “follow-through” in many ball sports.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mMkLuA7cjXs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Many cell functions rely on the ability of microtubules to self-organize as complex networks. In plants, cortical microtubules are essential to determine cell shape as they guide the deposition of cellulose microfibrils, and thus control mechanical anisotropy of the cell wall. Here we analyze how, in turn, cell shape may influence microtubule behavior. Buidling upon previous models that confined microtubules to the cell surface, we introduce an agent model of microtubules enclosed in a three-dimensional volume. We show that the microtubule network has spontaneous aligned configurations that could explain many experimental observations without resorting to specific regulation. In particular, we find that the preferred cortical localization of microtubules emerges from directional persistence of the microtubules, and their interactions with each other and with the stiff wall. We also identify microtubule parameters that seem relatively insensitive to cell shape, such as length or number. In contrast, microtubule array anisotropy depends on local curvature of the cell surface and global orientation follows robustly the longest axis of the cell. Lastly, we find that geometric cues may be overcome, as network is capable of reorienting toward weak external directional cues. Altogether our simulations show that the microtubule network is a good transducer of weak external polarity, while at the same time, easily reaching stable global configurations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8WlSYkzzWV0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Prediction of infectious disease epidemics via weighted density ensembles</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/JbP-DeXrCH0/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Evan L. Ray, Nicholas G. Reich&lt;/p&gt;

Accurate and reliable predictions of infectious disease dynamics can be valuable to public health organizations that plan interventions to decrease or prevent disease transmission. A great variety of models have been developed for this task, using different model structures, covariates, and targets for prediction. Experience has shown that the performance of these models varies; some tend to do better or worse in different seasons or at different points within a season. Ensemble methods combine multiple models to obtain a single prediction that leverages the strengths of each model. We considered a range of ensemble methods that each form a predictive density for a target of interest as a weighted sum of the predictive densities from component models. In the simplest case, equal weight is assigned to each component model; in the most complex case, the weights vary with the region, prediction target, week of the season when the predictions are made, a measure of component model uncertainty, and recent observations of disease incidence. We applied these methods to predict measures of influenza season timing and severity in the United States, both at the national and regional levels, using three component models. We trained the models on retrospective predictions from 14 seasons (1997/1998–2010/2011) and evaluated each model’s prospective, out-of-sample performance in the five subsequent influenza seasons. In this test phase, the ensemble methods showed average performance that was similar to the best of the component models, but offered more consistent performance across seasons than the component models. Ensemble methods offer the potential to deliver more reliable predictions to public health decision makers.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JbP-DeXrCH0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Clinical and animal model studies have shown that changes in PFC excitation and inhibition are important for cognitive functions as well as related disorders. Here, we discuss recent findings revealing the roles of the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic proteins neuroligin 1 (NLGN1) and NLGN2 in the PFC in memory formation and modulation of memory strength. We propose that shifts in NLGN1 and NLGN2 expression in specific excitatory and inhibitory neuronal subpopulations in response to experience regulate the dynamic processes of memory consolidation and strengthening. Because excitatory/inhibitory imbalances accompany neuropsychiatric disorders in which strength and flexibility of representations play important roles, understanding these mechanisms may suggest novel therapies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to ‘look and behave’ like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

During development, individual gene activity can dynamically engage different signaling networks; thus genetic mutations can lead to different functional changes at different times. Interpretation of phenotypes can be further complicated if initial functional changes trigger compensatory mechanisms. Examining genetic mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders reveals cellular phenotypes that change over the course of development and exist long before behavioral deficits are assessed. Correspondingly, earlier genetic interventions in these disorder models have often been more effective at improving behavioral deficits than late interventions. The restricted period of effective intervention demonstrates that identifying a target window is an essential component of treatment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

By probing how activity patterns in different types of neurons and circuits contribute to behavior, these tools can help inform mechanistic models of brain function and explain the roles of distinct circuit elements. However, in systems where functions are distributed over large networks, interpreting causality experiments can be challenging. Here we review common assumptions underlying circuit manipulations in behaving animals and discuss the strengths and limitations of different approaches. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

This neural activity reflects internal processes by which the brain plans and executes volitional movements. The study of motor planning offers an opportunity to understand how the structure and dynamics of neural circuits support persistent internal states and how these states influence behavior. Recent advances in large-scale neural recordings are beginning to decipher the relationship of the dynamics of populations of neurons during motor planning and movements. New behavioral tasks in rodents, together with quantified perturbations, link dynamics in specific nodes of neural circuits to behavior. These studies reveal a neural network distributed across multiple brain regions that collectively supports motor planning. We review recent advances and highlight areas where further work is needed to achieve a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying motor planning and related cognitive processes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

To be effective, these systems must be able to simultaneously record and stimulate neural activity, a task made difficult by persistent stimulation artifacts that distort and obscure underlying biomarkers. To enable simultaneous stimulation and recording, several techniques have been proposed. These techniques involve artifact-preventing system configurations, resilient recording front-ends, and back-end signal processing for removing recorded artifacts. Co-designing and integrating these artifact cancellation techniques will be key to enabling neuromodulation systems to stimulate and record at the same time. Here, we review the state-of-the-art for these techniques and their role in achieving artifact-free neuromodulation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Microelectrode arrays based on complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, such as Neuropixels probes, look set to transform these methods. Neuropixels probes provide ∼1000 recording sites on an extremely narrow shank, with on-board amplification, digitization, and multiplexing. They deliver low-noise recordings from hundreds of neurons, providing a step change in the type of data available to neuroscientists. Here we discuss the opportunities afforded by these probes for large-scale electrophysiology, the challenges associated with data processing and anatomical localization, and avenues for further improvements of the technology. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Studies have found that sensory, prefrontal, hippocampal, cerebellar, and striatal regions, as well as the circuits that connect them, are perturbed in mouse models of ASD and ID. Dissecting the disruptions in morphology and activity in these neural circuits might help us to understand the shared risk between the two disorders as well as their clinical heterogeneity. Treatments that target the balance between excitation and inhibition in these regions are able to reverse pathological phenotypes, elucidating this deficit as a commonality across models and opening new avenues for intervention. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Understanding the mechanisms underlying neuronal structural changes is central to our knowledge of how the nervous system is shaped for complex behaviors and how it further adapts to developmental and environmental demands. Caenorhabditis elegans provides a powerful model for examining developmental processes and for discovering mechanisms controlling neural plasticity. Recent findings have identified conserved themes underlying neural plasticity in development and under environmental stress. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Designing behavioral paradigms that provide a solid foundation to ask questions about decision-making computations and mechanisms is a difficult and often underestimated challenge. Here, we propose three dimensions on which we can consider rodent decision-making tasks: ethological validity, task complexity, and stimulus-response compatibility. We review recent research through this lens, and provide practical guidance for researchers in the decision-making field. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

These platforms leverage basic advances in biocompatible materials, semiconductor device designs and systems engineering concepts to afford modes of operation that are qualitatively distinct from those of conventional approaches that tether animals to external hardware by means of optical fibers, electrical cables and/or fluidic tubing. Neuroscience studies that exploit the unique features of these technologies enable insights into neural function through targeted stimulation, inhibition and recording, with spatially and genetically precise manipulation of neural circuit activity. Experimental possibilities include studies in naturalistic, three dimensional environments, investigations of pair-wise or group related social interactions and many other scenarios of interest that cannot be addressed using traditional hardware. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Individual network components in the mushroom bodies of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster represent cues, learning signals and behavioral outcomes of learned experience. Recent findings have highlighted the importance of dopamine-driven plasticity and activity in feedback and feedforward connections, between various elements of the mushroom body neural network. These computational motifs have been shown to be crucial for long term olfactory memory consolidation, integration of internal states, re-evaluation and updating of learned information. The often recurrent circuit anatomy and a prolonged requirement for activity in parts of these underlying networks, suggest that self-sustained and precisely timed activity is a fundamental feature of network computations in the insect brain. Together these processes allow flies to continuously adjust the content of their learned knowledge and direct their behavior in a way that best represents learned expectations and serves their most pressing current needs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Numerous genes in the endo-lysosomal pathways have been found to associate with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations of these genes lead to dysfunction in multiple steps of the endo-lysosomal network: autophagy, endocytic trafficking and lysosomal degradation, resulting in accumulation of pathogenic proteins. Although the exact pathogenic mechanism varies for different disease-associated genes, dysfunction of the endo-lysosomal pathways represents a converging mechanism shared by these diseases. Therefore, strategies that correct or compensate for endo-lysosomal dysfunction may be promising therapeutic approaches to treat neurodegenerative diseases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

These devices, usually sensing cell activity via microelectrodes, should be characterized by safe working conditions in the biological milieu together with a well-controlled operation-life. The stable device/neuronal electrical coupling at the interface requires tight interactions between the electrode surface and the cell membrane. This neuro-electrode hybrid represents the hyphen between the soft nature of neural tissue, generating electrical signals via ion motions, and the rigid realm of microelectronics and medical devices, dealing with electrons in motion. Efficient integration of these entities is essential for monitoring, analyzing and controlling neuronal signaling but poses significant technological challenges. Improving the cell/electrode interaction and thus the interface performance requires novel engineering of (nano)materials: tuning at the nanoscale electrode's properties may lead to engineer interfacing probes that better camouflaged with their biological target. In this brief review, we highlight the most recent concepts in nanotechnologies and nanomaterials that might help reducing the mismatch between tissue and electrode, focusing on the device's mechanical properties and its biological integration with the tissue. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

The development of sophisticated genetic tools to manipulate its genome accelerates the discovery of the genetic basis of undiagnosed human diseases and the elucidation of molecular pathogenic events of known and novel diseases. Here, we discuss various approaches used in flies to assess the function of the fly homologues of disease-associated genes. We highlight how systematic and combinatorial approaches based on recently established methods provide us with integrated tool sets that can be applied to the study of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Dysregulation of NEUROG2 plays a key role in focal cortical dysplasia</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25187</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs) are an important cause of drug-resistant epilepsy. In this work we aimed to investigate whether abnormal gene regulation, mediated by microRNA, could be involved in FCD type II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We used total RNA from the brain tissue of 16 patients with FCD type II and 28 controls. MicroRNA expression was initially assessed by microarray. Quantitative PCR (qPCR), &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt; hybridization, luciferase reporter assays and deep sequencing for genes in the mTOR pathway were performed to validate and further explore our initial study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: hsa-let-7f (p=0.039), hsa-miR-31 (p=0.0078) and hsa-miR34a (p=0.021) were downregulated in FCD type II, whereas a transcription factor involved in neuronal and glial fate specification, &lt;em&gt;NEUROG2&lt;/em&gt; (p&amp;lt;0.05), was upregulated. We also found that the &lt;em&gt;RND2&lt;/em&gt; gene, a &lt;em&gt;NEUROG2-&lt;/em&gt;target, is upregulated (p&amp;lt;0.001). &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; experiments showed that hsa-miR-34a downregulates &lt;em&gt;NEUROG2&lt;/em&gt; by binding to its 5'-untranslated region. Moreover, we observed strong nuclear expression of &lt;em&gt;NEUROG2&lt;/em&gt; in balloon cells and dysmorphic neurons and found that 28.5% of our patients presented brain somatic mutations in genes of the mTOR pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Our findings suggest a new molecular mechanism, in which &lt;em&gt;NEUROG2&lt;/em&gt; has a pivotal and central role in the pathogenesis of FCD type II. In this way, we found that the downregulation of hsa-miR-34a leads to upregulation of &lt;em&gt;NEUROG2,&lt;/em&gt; and consequently to overexpression of the &lt;em&gt;RND2&lt;/em&gt; gene. These findings indicate that a faulty coupling in neuronal differentiation and migration mechanisms may explain the presence of aberrant cells and complete dyslamination in FCD type II.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06700</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Small inhibitory neuronal circuits have long been identified as key neuronal
motifs to generate and modulate the coexisting rhythms of various motor
functions. Our paper highlights the role of a cellular switching mechanism to
orchestrate such circuits. The cellular switch makes the circuits
reconfigurable, robust, adaptable, and externally controllable. Without this
cellular mechanism, the circuits rhythms entirely rely on specific tunings of
the synaptic connectivity, which makes them rigid, fragile, and difficult to
control externally. We illustrate those properties on the much studied
architecture of a small network controlling both the pyloric and gastric
rhythms of crabs. The cellular switch is provided by a slow negative
conductance often neglected in mathematical modeling of central pattern
generators. We propose that this conductance is simple to model and key to
computational studies of rhythmic circuit neuromodulation.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06591</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When the brain receives input from multiple sensory systems, it is faced with
the question of whether it is appropriate to process the inputs in combination,
as if they originated from the same event, or separately, as if they originated
from distinct events. Furthermore, it must also have a mechanism through which
it can keep sensory inputs calibrated to maintain the accuracy of its internal
representations. We have developed a neural network architecture capable of i)
approximating optimal multisensory spatial integration, based on Bayesian
causal inference, and ii) recalibrating the spatial encoding of sensory
systems. The architecture is based on features of the dorsal processing
hierarchy, including the spatial tuning properties of unisensory neurons and
the convergence of different sensory inputs onto multisensory neurons.
Furthermore, we propose that these unisensory and multisensory neurons play
dual roles in i) encoding spatial location as separate or integrated estimates
and ii) accumulating evidence for the independence or relatedness of
multisensory stimuli. We further propose that top-down feedback connections
spanning the dorsal pathway play key a role in recalibrating spatial encoding
at the level of early unisensory cortices. Our proposed architecture provides
possible explanations for a number of human electrophysiological and
neuroimaging results and generates testable predictions linking neurophysiology
with behaviour.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The synchronous dynamics of an array of excitable oscillators, coupled via a

(partially) averaged analog. This result if formally obtained by proving an
extended version of the averaging theorem, which allows for partial averages to
be carried out. Oscillation death are reported to follow the onset of the

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06507</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Communication processes within the human brain at different cognitive states
are neither well understood nor completely characterized. We assess
communication processes in the human connectome using ant colony-inspired
cooperative learning algorithm, starting from a source with no a priori
information about the network topology, and cooperatively searching for the
target through a pheromone-inspired model. This framework relies on two
parameters, namely pheromone perception and edge perception, to define the
cognizance and subsequent behaviour of the ants on the network and, overall,
the communication processes happening between source and target nodes.
Simulations obtained through different configurations allow the identification
of path-ensembles that are involved in the communication between node pairs.
These path-ensembles may contain different number of paths depending on the
perception parameters and the node pair. In order to assess the different
communication regimes displayed on the simulations and their associations with
functional connectivity, we introduce two network measurements, effective
path-length and arrival rate. These communication features are tested as
individual as well as combined predictors of functional connectivity during
different tasks. Finally, different communication regimes are found in
different specialized functional networks. Overall, this framework may be used
as a test-bed for different communication regimes on top of an underlaying
topology.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06456</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In natural perception, different items (objects) in a scene are rarely
equally relevant to the observer. The brain improves performance by directing
attention to the most relevant items, for example the ones most likely to be
probed. For a general set of probing probabilities, it is not known how
attentional resources should be allocated to maximize performance. Here, we
investigate the optimal strategy for allocating a fixed resource budget E among
N items when on each trial, only one item gets probed. We develop an efficient
algorithm that, for any concave utility function, reduces the N-dimensional
problem to a set of N one-dimensional problems that the brain could plausibly
solve. We find that the intuitive strategy of allocating resource in proportion
to the probing probabilities is in general not optimal. In particular, in some
tasks, if resource is low, the optimal strategy involves allocating zero
resource to items with a nonzero probability of being probed. Our work opens
the door to normatively guided studies of attentional allocation.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06426</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Natural learners must compute an estimate of future outcomes that follow from
a stimulus in continuous time. Critically, the learner cannot in general know a
priori the relevant time scale over which meaningful relationships will be
observed. Widely used reinforcement learning algorithms discretize continuous
time and use the Bellman equation to estimate exponentially-discounted future
reward. However, exponential discounting introduces a time scale to the
computation of value. Scaling is a serious problem in continuous time:
efficient learning with scaled algorithms requires prior knowledge of the
relevant scale. That is, with scaled algorithms one must know at least part of
the solution to a problem prior to attempting a solution. We present a
computational mechanism, developed based on work in psychology and
neuroscience, for computing a scale-invariant timeline of future events. This
mechanism efficiently computes a model for future time on a
logarithmically-compressed scale, and can be used to generate a scale-invariant
power-law-discounted estimate of expected future reward. Moreover, the
representation of future time retains information about what will happen when,
enabling flexible decision making based on future events. The entire timeline
can be constructed in a single parallel operation.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06164</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding information processing in the brain requires the ability to
determine the functional connectivity between the different regions of the
brain. We present a method using transfer entropy to extract this flow of
information between brain regions from spike-train data commonly taken in
neurological experiments. Transfer entropy is a statistical measure based in
information theory that attempts to quantify the information flow from one
process to another, and has been applied to find connectivity in simulated
spike train data. Due to statistical error in the estimator, inferring
functional connectivity requires a method for determining significance in the
transfer entropy values. We discuss the issues with numerical estimation of
transfer entropy and resulting challenges in determining significance before
presenting the trial-shuffle method as a viable option. The trial-shuffle
method, for spike train data that is split into multiple trials, determines
significant transfer entropy values independently for each individual pair of
neurons, rather than globally comparing all neuron transfer entropy values. We
establish the viability of this method by showing that it performs comparably
or better to a previous approach in the literature based on the false positive
detection rate. We then investigate the performance of the trial-shuffle method
in terms of information flow within a network as we vary model parameters.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In order to understand the formation of social conventions we need to know
the specific role of control and learning in multi-agent systems. To advance in
this direction, we propose, within the framework of the Distributed Adaptive
Control (DAC) theory, a novel Control-based Reinforcement Learning architecture
(CRL) that can account for the acquisition of social conventions in multi-agent
populations that are solving a benchmark social decision-making problem. Our
new CRL architecture, as a concrete realization of DAC multi-agent theory,
implements a low-level sensorimotor control loop handling the agent's reactive
behaviors (pre-wired reflexes), along with a layer based on model-free
reinforcement learning that maximizes long-term reward. We apply CRL in a
multi-agent game-theoretic task in which coordination must be achieved in order
to find an optimal solution. We show that our CRL architecture is able to both
find optimal solutions in discrete and continuous time and reproduce human
experimental data on standard game-theoretic metrics such as efficiency in
acquiring rewards, fairness in reward distribution and stability of convention
formation.

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/268698v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction: The so called Davson's equation relates baseline intracranial pressure (ICP) to resistance to cerebrospinal fluid outflow (Rout), formation of cerebrospinal fluid (If) and sagittal sinus pressure (PSS) There is a controversy over whether this fundamental equation is applicable in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). We investigated the relationship between Rout and ICP and also other compensatory, clinical and demographic parameters in NPH patients. Methods: We carried out a retrospective study of 229 patients with primary NPH who had undergone constant-rate infusion studies in our hospital. Data was recorded and processed using ICM+ software. Relationships between variables were sought by calculating Pearson product correlation coefficients and p values. Results: We found a significant, albeit weak, relationship between ICP and Rout (R=0.17, p=0.0049), Rout and peak-to-peak amplitude of ICP (AMP) (R=0.27, p=3.577e-05) and Rout and age (R=0.16, p=0.01306). Conclusions: The relationship found between ICP and Rout provides indirect evidence to support disturbed Cerebrospinal fluid circulation as a key factor in disturbed CSF dynamics in NPH. Weak correlation may indicate that other factors: variable Pss and formation of CSF outflow contribute heavily to linear model expressed by Davson's equation.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Active Learning of Cortical Connectivity from Two-Photon Imaging Data</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/268599v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Understanding how groups of neurons interact within a network is a fundamental question in system neuroscience. Instead of passively observing the ongoing activity of a network, we can typically perturb its activity, either by external sensory stimulation or directly via techniques such as two-photon optogenetics. A natural question is how to use such perturbations to identify the connectivity of the network efficiently. Here we introduce a method to infer sparse connectivity graphs from in-vivo, two-photon imaging of population activity in response to external stimuli. A novel aspect of the work is the introduction of an oracle which, at any point in time, can recommend a distribution of external stimuli that will optimally refine the inferred network. Unlike existing system identification techniques, this active learning method automatically focuses its attention on key undiscovered areas of the network, instead of targeting global uncertainty indicators like parameter variance. We show how active learning leads to faster inference while, at the same time, provides confidence intervals for the network parameters. We present simulations on artificial small-world networks to validate the methods and apply the method to real data. Analysis of frequency of motifs recovered show that cortical networks are consistent with a small-world topology model.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>At any time, we are processing thousands of stimuli, but only few of them will be remembered hours or days later. Is there any way to predict which ones? Here, we show that the pupil response to ongoing stimuli, an indicator of physiological arousal, is a reliable predictor of long-term memory for these stimuli, over at least one day. Pupil dilation was tracked while participants performed visual and auditory encoding tasks. Memory was tested immediately after encoding and 24 hours later. Irrespective of the encoding modality, trial-by-trial variations in pupil dilation predicted which stimuli were recalled in the immediate and 24 hours-delayed tests. These results show that our eyes may provide a window into the formation of long-term memories. Furthermore, our findings underline the important role of central arousal systems in the rapid formation of memories in the brain, possibly by gating synaptic plasticity mechanisms.</content:encoded>

Here, we investigate differences in slow oscillations (SO) and sleep spindles (SP) and their coupling across the adult human lifespan and ask whether observed alterations relate to the ability to retain associative memories across sleep. We demonstrate that the fine-tuned SO-SP coupling that is present in younger adults diffuses with advanced age and shifts both in time and frequency. Crucially, we show that a 'youth-like' precision of SO-SP coupling promotes memory consolidation across the entire adult lifespan, and that brain integrity in source regions for the generation of SOs and SPs reinforces this beneficial SO-SP coupling in old age. Our results reveal age-related differences in SO-SP coupling in healthy elderly individuals. Furthermore, they broaden our understanding of the conditions and the functional significance of SO-SP coupling across the entire adult lifespan.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/268383v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The functional equivalence between mental images and perception or motion has been proposed on the basis of neuroimaging evidence of large spatially overlapping activations between real and imagined sensori-motor conditions. However, similar local activation patterns do not imply that the mesoscopic integration of brain regions active during imagery and perception or action. Here we present the first EEG evidence of topological equivalence between functional network organization at intermediate and global scales during tasks. We show that the degree of functional equivalence varies in the population and is associated with different magnitudes in the restructuring of the functional connectivity between imagery and real tasks. In particular, changes observed during imagery with respect to basal conditions account for the cognitive effort experienced during imagery, and subjects characterized by stronger functional equivalence exhibit smaller topological deviations in the imagination tasks performed after real tasks, thus showing learning effects. Altogether, our findings point to different sensori-cognitive information processing in the subjects showing different functional equivalence. We anticipate our results to be a starting point for a novel dynamical description of functional equivalence, which will be relevant for socio-cognitive theories of embodiment and cognitive formulations of how different selves emerge from neurophysiological assets.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The capacity to learn abstract concepts such as 'sameness' and 'difference' is considered a higher-order cognitive function, typically thought to be dependent on top-down neocortical processing. It is therefore surprising that honey bees apparantly have this capacity.

Our model is constrained by the known connections and properties of the mushroom body, including the protocerebral tract, and provides a good fit to the learning rates and performances of real bees in all tasks, including learning sameness and difference. The model proposes a novel mechanism for learning the abstract concepts of 'sameness' and 'difference' that is compatible with the insect brain, and is not dependent on top-down or executive control processing.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/268300v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Methods to promote myelin regeneration in response to central myelin loss are essential to prevent the progression of clinical disability in demyelinating diseases. The neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is known to promote myelination during development via oligodendrocyte expressed TrkB receptors. Here, we use a structural mimetic of BDNF to promote myelin regeneration in a preclinical mouse model of central demyelination. We show that selective targeting of TrkB with the BDNF-mimetic enhances remyelination, increasing oligodendrocyte differentiation, the frequency of myelinated axons, and myelin sheath thickness after a demyelinating insult. Treatment with exogenous BDNF exerted an attenuated effect, increasing myelin sheath thickness only. Further, following conditional deletion of TrkB from pre-myelinating oligodendrocytes, we show the effects of the BDNF-mimetic on oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination are lost, indicating these are dependent on oligodendrocyte expression of TrkB. Overall, these studies demonstrate that targeting oligodendrocyte TrkB promotes in vivo remyelination in the brain.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Objective: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is present in 19% of cocaine dependence (CD) cases; however, this dual pathology (DP) is poorly understood. We assessed impulsivity, emotional dysregulation (ED) and amygdala functional connectivity in this DP. Methods: We recruited 69 participants divided into 4 groups: DP (n = 20), CD without BPD (n = 19), BPD without CD (n = 10) and healthy controls (HC, n = 20). We used self-reported instruments to measure impulsivity and ED. We acquired resting state fMRI and performed seed-based analyses of functional connectivity (FC) of bilateral amygdalas. Results: BPD and CD factors had opposing effects in impulsivity and ED, as well as on FC between left amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex. For the FC between right amygdala and left insula, the effect of having both disorders was additive, reducing FC strength. Significant FC clusters were correlated with impulsivity and ED. Conclusions: In this preliminary study, we found that clinical scores of DP patients were closer to those of BPD without CD than to those of CD without BPD, while amygdala to medial prefrontal cortex FC patterns in DP patients were closer to HC than expected.</content:encoded>

Here we present functional MRI data measured while participants freely viewed brief naturalistic video clips of behaving animals in two different task contexts. Participants performed a 1-back category repetition detection task requiring them to attend to either animal taxonomy or animal behavior. The data and analysis code are freely available, and have been curated according to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) standard. We thoroughly describe the data, provide quality control metrics, and perform a searchlight classification analysis to demonstrate the potential utility of the data. These data are intended to provide a test bed for investigating how task demands alter the neural representation of complex stimuli and their semantic qualities.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The Effect of Acute Pharmacological Inhibition of Urokinase Plasminogen Activator and Neuropsin Extracellular Proteases on Neuronal Networks in vitro</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/263616v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Neuronal networks are surrounded by the extracellular matrix (ECM), which functions both as a scaffold and as a regulator of neuronal function. The ECM is in turn dynamically altered through the action of serine proteases, breaking down its constituents. This pathway has been implicated in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and of intrinsic excitability. Here, we aimed to study the effect of acutely inhibiting two important regulators of the ECM, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator and Neuropsin, selectively and potently with the inhibitor UAMC-01162. Spontaneous electrophysiological activity was recorded from in vitro primary rat cortical cultures via microelectrode arrays. While inhibition at a low dosage had no significant effect, at elevated concentrations network bursting dynamics and functional connectivity were drastically altered. These results indicate that the serine protease inhibition affects neuronal and synaptic properties, likely through their action on the ECM. We propose that in the acute phase, a transient increase of excitatory synaptic efficacy is compensated by a downregulation of single-cell excitability.</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Neural Determinants of Task Performance during Feature-Based Attention in Human Cortex</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0375-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Studies of feature-based attention have associated activity in a dorsal frontoparietal network with putative attentional priority signals. Yet, how this neural activity mediates attentional selection and whether it guides behavior are fundamental questions that require investigation. We reasoned that endogenous fluctuations in the quality of attentional priority should influence task performance. Human subjects detected a speed increment while viewing clockwise or counter-clockwise motion (baseline task) or while attending to either direction amid distracters (attention task). In an fMRI experiment, direction-specific neural pattern similarity between the baseline task and the attention task revealed a higher level of similarity for correct than incorrect trials in frontoparietal regions. Using TMS, we disrupted posterior parietal cortex and found a selective deficit in the attention task, but not in the baseline task, demonstrating the necessity of this cortical area during feature-based attention. These results reveal that frontoparietal areas maintain attentional priority that facilitates successful behavioral selection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; To cope with the computational limits of visual processing, the brain selectively prioritizes a subset of visual input. The selection for visual features, such as color and motion, has been associated with activity in a frontoparietal cortical network. Yet, the role this activity plays in mediating selection and influencing behavior is not clear. Using fMRI, we show that neural activity patterns in several frontoparietal areas correlated with task performance. Furthermore, neurodisruption of the posterior parietal cortex using transcranial magnetic stimulation selectively impaired feature selection. These results provide the first evidence that the neural representation of prioritized features in frontoparietal areas play a causal role in selecting visual features.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06017</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Emerging evidence shows that cognitive deficits in Alzheimer disease (AD) are
associated with disruptions in brain functional connectivity. Thus, the
identification of alterations in AD functional networks has become a topic of
increasing interest. However, to what extent AD induces disruption of the
balance of local and global information processing in the human brain remains
elusive. The main objective of this study is to explore the dynamic topological
changes of AD networks in terms of brain network segregation and integration.
We used electroencephalography (EEG) data recorded from 20 participants (10 AD
patients and 10 healthy controls) during resting state. Functional brain
networks were reconstructed using EEG source connectivity computed in different
frequency bands. Graph theoretical analyses were performed assess differences
between both groups. Results revealed that AD networks, compared to networks of
age matched healthy controls, are characterized by lower global information
processing (integration) and higher local information processing (segregation).
Results showed also significant correlation between the alterations in the AD
patients functional brain networks and their cognitive scores. These findings
may contribute to the development of EEG network-based test that could
strengthen results obtained from currently used neurophysiological tests in
neurodegenerative diseases.

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/268151v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>We propose a simple procedure based on permutation testing that provides a way of combining the results from many individual tests that refer to the same hypothesis. This is needed when testing a measure whose value is obtained from a noisy process, which can be repeated multiple times, referred to as replications. Examples of a noisy process can be: (i) computational, e.g. when using an approximate inference algorithm (e.g. ICA) for which different runs can produce different results or (ii) observational, if we have the capacity to acquire data multiple times, and the different acquired data sets can be considered noisy examples of the underlying data that we are attempting to estimate; that is, we are not interested in the individual replications but on the unobserved process behind. This method can also be used when we intend to test multiple hypotheses, each with access to various replications, while correcting for the familywise error rate. Using both simulations and real data, we show that the proposed approach compares favourably to more standard approaches to this problem.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/268136v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>How diverse adult stem and progenitor populations regenerate tissue following damage to the CNS remains unknown across most neurogenic domains. To understand the role of quiescent radial-glial (qRG) stem cells during regeneration, we tested the hypothesis that qRG could be induced to proliferate and produce newborn neurons. We designed a stab lesion assay in the midbrain tectum of the adult zebrafish to target an isolated population of qRG, and investigated their proliferative behaviour, differentiation potential, and requirement of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signalling for the regenerative response. EdU-labelling showed that a small proportion of qRG transit to a proliferative state (pRG), but that progeny of pRG are restricted to a radial-glial fate. Lesion promoted upregulation of proliferation and neurogenesis from neuro-epithelial-like amplifying progenitors (NE-Ap) of the tectal marginal zone (TMZ). Homeostatic levels of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signalling persisted under lesioned conditions in the qRG/pRG population, whereby increased {beta}-catenin staining and axin2 expression was present in the NE-Ap progenitor zone. Attenuation of Wnt signalling using Dickkopf-1, demonstrated that proliferative responses post-injury appeared to be Wnt-independent. Our results align with the emerging view that adult stem/progenitor phenotypes are characterized by discrete, rather than mutual, regenerative programs and that different stem cell domains employ different modes of regeneration.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/268110v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Navigation depends on the activity of head-direction (HD) cells. Computational models postulate that HD cells form a uniform population that reacts coherently to changes in landmarks. We tested whether this applied to HD cells of the medial entorhinal cortex and parasubiculum, areas where the HD signal contributes to the periodic firing of grid cells. Manipulations of the visual landmarks surrounding freely-moving mice altered the tuning of HD cells. Importantly, these tuning modifications were often non-coherent across cells, refuting the notion that HD cells form a uniform population constrained by attractor-like dynamics. Instead, examination of theta rhythmicity revealed two types of HD cells, theta rhythmic and non-rhythmic cells. Larger tuning alterations were observed predominantly in non-rhythmic HD cells. Moreover, only non-rhythmic HD cells reorganized their firing associations in response to visual landmark changes. These findings reveal a theta non-rhythmic HD signal whose malleable organization is controlled by visual landmarks.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/268045v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Humans typically make near-optimal sensorimotor judgements but show systematic biases when making more cognitive judgements. Here we test the hypothesis that, while humans are sensitive to the noise present during early sensory processing, the &quot;optimality gap&quot; arises because they are blind to noise introduced by later cognitive integration of variable or discordant information. In six psychophysical experiments, human observers judged the average orientation of an array of contrast gratings. We varied the stimulus contrast (encoding noise) and orientation variability (integration noise) of the array. Participants adapted optimally to changes in encoding noise, but, under increased integration noise, they displayed a range of suboptimal behaviours: they ignored stimulus base rates, reported excessive confidence in their choices, and refrained from opting out of objectively difficult trials. These overconfident behaviours were captured by a Bayesian model which is blind to integration noise. Our study provides a computationally grounded explanation of suboptimal cognitive inferences.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/267989v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In recent years, hemispheric lateralization of alpha power has emerged as a neural mechanism thought to underpin spatial attention across sensory modalities. Yet, how healthy aging, beginning in middle adulthood, impacts the modulation of lateralized alpha power supporting auditory attention remains poorly understood. In the current electroencephalography (EEG) study, middle-aged and older adults (N = 29; ~40-70 years) performed a dichotic listening task that simulates a challenging, multi-talker scenario. We examined the extent to which the modulation of 8-12 Hz alpha power would serve as neural marker of listening success across age. With respect to the increase in inter-individual variability with age, we examined an extensive battery of behavioral, perceptual, and neural measures. Similar to findings on younger adults, middle-aged and older listeners' auditory spatial attention induced robust lateralization of alpha power, which synchronized with the speech rate. Notably, the observed relationship between this alpha lateralization and task performance did not co-vary with age. Instead, task performance was strongly related to an individual's attentional and working memory capacity. Multivariate analyses revealed a separation of neural and behavioral variables independent of age. Our results suggest that in age-varying samples as the present one, the lateralization of alpha power is neither a sufficient nor necessary neural strategy for an individual's auditory spatial attention, as higher age might come with increased use of alternative, compensatory mechanisms. Our findings emphasize that explaining inter-individual variability will be key to understanding the role of alpha oscillations in auditory attention in the aging listener.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Human cortical pyramidal neurons: From spines to spikes via models</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/267898v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>We present the first-ever detailed models of pyramidal cells from human neocortex, including models on their excitatory synapses, dendritic spines, dendritic NMDA- and somatic/axonal- Na+ spikes that provided new insights into signal processing and computational capabilities of these principal cells. Six human layer 2 and layer 3 pyramidal cells (HL2/L3 PCs) were modeled, integrating detailed anatomical and physiological data from both fresh and post mortem tissues from human temporal cortex. The models predicted particularly large AMPA- and NMDA-conductances per synaptic contact (0.88 nS and 1.31nS, respectively) and a steep dependence of the NMDA-conductance on voltage. These estimates were based on intracellular recordings from synaptically-connected HL2/L3 pairs, combined with extra-cellular current injections and use of synaptic blockers. A large dataset of high-resolution reconstructed HL2/L3 dendritic spines provided estimates for the EPSPs at the spine head (12.7 {+/-} 4.6 mV), spine base (9.7 {+/-} 5.0 mV) and soma (0.3 {+/-} 0.1 mV), and for the spine neck resistance (50 - 80 M{Omega}). Matching the shape and firing pattern of experimental somatic Na+-spikes provided estimates for the density of the somatic/axonal excitable membrane ion channels, predicting that 134 {+/-} 28 simultaneously activated HL2/L3- HL2/L3 synapses are required for generating (with 50% probability) a somatic Na+ spike. Dendritic NMDA spikes were triggered in the model when 20 {+/-} 10 excitatory spinous synapses were simultaneously activated on individual dendritic branches. The particularly large number of basal dendrites in HL2/L3 PCs and the distinctive cable elongation of their terminals imply that ~25 NMDA- spikes could be generated independently and simultaneously in these cells, as compared to ~14 in L2/3 PCs from the rat temporal cortex. These multi-sites nonlinear signals, together with the large (~30,000) excitatory synapses/cell, equip human L2/L3 PCs with enhanced computational capabilities. Our study provides the most comprehensive model of any human neuron to-date demonstrating the biophysical and computational distinctiveness of human cortical neurons.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>We investigated in two experiments if handball and action video game players show improved implicit learning of repeated spatial configurations for efficient search guidance in comparison to a control group without sport or video game proficiency. To this end, we used both a sport-specific pseudo 3-D contextual cueing task and the original contextual cueing paradigm (Chun &amp;amp; Jiang, 1998). Contextual cueing was present in all groups. However, handball and action video game players did not differ in the strength of contextual cueing from the control group. Action video game players had shorter search times than controls in both experiments. In contrast, the handball players searched faster than controls in the sport-specific displays of Experiment 1 but not in the symbolic search task of Experiment 2. Thus, our findings provide no evidence that contextual cueing is a limiting factor for expert performance in the domain of team sports or action video game playing.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/267831v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction: This study tested the hypothesis that mid-life intellectual, physical and social activities contribute to cognitive reserve (CR). Methods: 205 individuals (196 with MRI) aged 66-88 from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (www.cam-can.com) were studied, with cognitive ability and structural brain health measured as fluid IQ and total grey matter volume, respectively. Mid-life activities were measured using the Lifetime of Experiences Questionnaire. Results: Multivariable linear regression found that mid-life activities (MA) made a unique contribution to late-life cognitive ability independent of education, occupation and late-life activities. Crucially, MA moderated the relationship between late-life cognitive ability and brain structure, with the cognitive ability of people with higher MA less dependent on their brain structure, consistent with the concept of CR. Conclusions: Mid-life intellectual, physical and social activities contribute uniquely to CR. The modifiability of these activities has implications for public health initiatives aimed at dementia prevention.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/267815v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>What makes predictable words easier to process than unpredictable words (e.g., 'bicycle' compared to 'elephant' in &quot;You never forget how to ride a bicycle/an elephant once you've learned&quot;)? Are predictable words genuinely predicted, or simply more plausible and therefore easier to integrate with sentence context? We addressed this persistent and fundamental question using data from a recent, large-scale (N = 334) replication study, by investigating the effects of word predictability and plausibility on the N400, the brain's electrophysiological index of semantic processing. A spatiotemporally fine-grained, mixed-effects multiple regression analysis revealed overlapping effects of predictability and plausibility on the N400, albeit with distinct spatiotemporal profiles. Our results challenge the view that semantic facilitation of predictable words reflects the effects of either prediction or integration, and suggest that facilitation arises from a cascade of processes that access and integrate word meaning with context into a sentence-level meaning.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Control fast or control smart: When should invading pathogens be controlled?</title>

The intuitive response to an invading pathogen is to start disease management as rapidly as possible, since this would be expected to minimise the future impacts of disease. However, since more spread data become available as an outbreak unfolds, processes underpinning pathogen transmission can almost always be characterised more precisely later in epidemics. This allows the future progression of any outbreak to be forecast more accurately, and so enables control interventions to be targeted more precisely. There is also the chance that the outbreak might die out without any intervention whatsoever, making prophylactic control unnecessary. Optimal decision-making involves continuously balancing these potential benefits of waiting against the possible costs of further spread. We introduce a generic, extensible data-driven algorithm based on parameter estimation and outbreak simulation for making decisions in real-time concerning when and how to control an invading pathogen. The Control Smart Algorithm (CSA) resolves the trade-off between the competing advantages of controlling as soon as possible and controlling later when more information has become available. We show–using a generic mathematical model representing the transmission of a pathogen of agricultural animals or plants through a population of farms or fields–how the CSA allows the timing and level of deployment of vaccination or chemical control to be optimised. In particular, the algorithm outperforms simpler strategies such as intervening when the outbreak size reaches a pre-specified threshold, or controlling when the outbreak has persisted for a threshold length of time. This remains the case even if the simpler methods are fully optimised in advance. Our work highlights the potential benefits of giving careful consideration to the question of when to start disease management during emerging outbreaks, and provides a concrete framework to allow policy-makers to make this decision.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eHGUKYlmuFA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Metabolic enzyme cost explains variable trade-offs between microbial growth rate and yield</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/PF2X5U7oHsI/article</link>

Microbes may maximize the number of daughter cells per time or per amount of nutrients consumed. These two strategies correspond, respectively, to the use of enzyme-efficient or substrate-efficient metabolic pathways. In reality, fast growth is often associated with wasteful, yield-inefficient metabolism, and a general thermodynamic trade-off between growth rate and biomass yield has been proposed to explain this. We studied growth rate/yield trade-offs by using a novel modeling framework, Enzyme-Flux Cost Minimization (EFCM) and by assuming that the growth rate depends directly on the enzyme investment per rate of biomass production. In a comprehensive mathematical model of core metabolism in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, we screened all elementary flux modes leading to cell synthesis, characterized them by the growth rates and yields they provide, and studied the shape of the resulting rate/yield Pareto front. By varying the model parameters, we found that the rate/yield trade-off is not universal, but depends on metabolic kinetics and environmental conditions. A prominent trade-off emerges under oxygen-limited growth, where yield-inefficient pathways support a 2-to-3 times higher growth rate than yield-efficient pathways. EFCM can be widely used to predict optimal metabolic states and growth rates under varying nutrient levels, perturbations of enzyme parameters, and single or multiple gene knockouts.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PF2X5U7oHsI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Trade-off between synergy and efficacy in combinations of HIV-1 latency-reversing agents</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/phsH7ykbW1M/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Vipul Gupta, Narendra M. Dixit&lt;/p&gt;

Eradicating HIV-1 infection is difficult because of the reservoir of latently infected cells that gets established soon after infection, remains hidden from antiretroviral drugs and host immune responses, and retains the capacity to reignite infection following the cessation of treatment. Drugs called latency-reversing agents (LRAs) are being developed to reactivate latently infected cells and render them susceptible to viral cytopathicity or immune killing. Whereas individual LRAs have failed to induce adequate reactivation, pairs of LRAs have been identified recently that act synergistically and hugely increase reactivation levels compared to individual LRAs. The maximum synergy achievable with LRA pairs is of clinical importance, as it would allow latency-reversal with minimal drug exposure. Here, we employed stochastic simulations of HIV-1 transcription and translation in latently infected cells to estimate this maximum synergy. We incorporated the predominant mechanisms of action of the two most promising classes of LRAs, namely, protein kinase C agonists and histone deacetylase inhibitors, and quantified the activity of individual LRAs in the two classes by mapping our simulations to corresponding &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments. Without any adjustable parameters, our simulations then quantitatively captured experimental observations of latency-reversal when the LRAs were used in pairs. Performing simulations representing a wide range of drug concentrations, we estimated the maximum synergy achievable with these LRA pairs. Importantly, we found with all the LRA pairs we considered that concentrations yielding the maximum synergy did not yield the maximum latency-reversal. Increasing concentrations to increase latency-reversal compromised synergy, unravelling a trade-off between synergy and efficacy in LRA combinations. The maximum synergy realizable with LRA pairs would thus be restricted by the desired level of latency-reversal, a constrained optimum we elucidated with our simulations. We expect this trade-off to be important in defining optimal LRA combinations that would maximize synergy while ensuring adequate latency-reversal.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/phsH7ykbW1M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

In this paper we study antibiotic-induced &lt;i&gt;C. difficile&lt;/i&gt; infection (CDI), caused by the toxin-producing &lt;i&gt;C. difficile&lt;/i&gt; (CD), and implement clinically-inspired simulated treatments in a computational framework that synthesizes a generalized Lotka-Volterra (gLV) model with SIR modeling techniques. The gLV model uses parameters derived from an experimental mouse model, in which the mice are administered antibiotics and subsequently dosed with CD. We numerically identify which of the experimentally measured initial conditions are vulnerable to CD colonization, then formalize the notion of &lt;i&gt;CD susceptibility&lt;/i&gt; analytically. We simulate fecal transplantation, a clinically successful treatment for CDI, and discover that both the transplant timing and transplant donor are relevant to the the efficacy of the treatment, a result which has clinical implications. We incorporate two nongeneric yet dangerous attributes of CD into the gLV model, sporulation and antibiotic-resistant mutation, and for each identify relevant SIR techniques that describe the desired attribute. Finally, we rely on the results of our framework to analyze an experimental study of fecal transplants in mice, and are able to explain observed experimental results, validate our simulated results, and suggest model-motivated experiments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qSm7F3mpZsc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A stochastic and dynamical view of pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells</title>

Pluripotent embryonic stem cells are of paramount importance for biomedical sciences because of their innate ability for self-renewal and differentiation into all major cell lines. The fateful decision to exit or remain in the pluripotent state is regulated by complex genetic regulatory networks. The rapid growth of single-cell sequencing data has greatly stimulated applications of statistical and machine learning methods for inferring topologies of pluripotency regulating genetic networks. The inferred network topologies, however, often only encode Boolean information while remaining silent about the roles of dynamics and molecular stochasticity inherent in gene expression. Herein we develop a framework for systematically extending Boolean-level network topologies into higher resolution models of networks which explicitly account for the promoter architectures and gene state switching dynamics. We show the framework to be useful for disentangling the various contributions that gene switching, external signaling, and network topology make to the global heterogeneity and dynamics of transcription factor populations. We find the pluripotent state of the network to be a steady state which is robust to global variations of gene switching rates which we argue are a good proxy for epigenetic states of individual promoters. The temporal dynamics of exiting the pluripotent state, on the other hand, is significantly influenced by the rates of genetic switching which makes cells more responsive to changes in extracellular signals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MLPDGaz5bYY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Computational protein design has been successful in modeling fixed backbone proteins in a single conformation. However, when modeling large ensembles of flexible proteins, current methods in protein design have been insufficient. Large barriers in the energy landscape are difficult to traverse while redesigning a protein sequence, and as a result current design methods only sample a fraction of available sequence space. We propose a new computational approach that combines traditional structure-based modeling using the Rosetta software suite with machine learning and integer linear programming to overcome limitations in the Rosetta sampling methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, which we call BROAD, by benchmarking the performance on increasing predicted breadth of anti-HIV antibodies. We use this novel method to increase predicted breadth of naturally-occurring antibody VRC23 against a panel of 180 divergent HIV viral strains and achieve 100% predicted binding against the panel. In addition, we compare the performance of this method to state-of-the-art multistate design in Rosetta and show that we can outperform the existing method significantly. We further demonstrate that sequences recovered by this method recover known binding motifs of broadly neutralizing anti-HIV antibodies. Finally, our approach is general and can be extended easily to other protein systems. Although our modeled antibodies were not tested &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, we predict that these variants would have greatly increased breadth compared to the wild-type antibody.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/B8PVMHDaU0E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Reliability-Weighted Integration of Audiovisual Signals Can Be Modulated by Top-down Control</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0315-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Behaviorally, it is well-established that human observers integrate signals near-optimally weighted in proportion to their reliabilities as predicted by maximum likelihood estimation. Yet, despite abundant behavioral evidence, it is unclear how the human brain accomplishes this feat. In a spatial ventriloquist paradigm, participants were presented with auditory, visual and audiovisual signals and reported the location of the auditory or the visual signal. Combining psychophysics, multivariate fMRI decoding and models of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), we characterized the computational operations underlying audiovisual integration at distinct cortical levels. We estimated observers’ behavioral weights by fitting psychometric functions to participants’ localization responses. Likewise, we estimated the neural weights by fitting ‘neurometric’ functions to spatial locations decoded from regional fMRI activation patterns. Our results demonstrate that low-level auditory and visual areas encode predominantly the spatial location of the signal component of a region’s preferred auditory (resp. visual) modality. By contrast, intraparietal sulcus forms spatial representations by integrating auditory and visual signals weighted by their reliabilities. Critically, the neural and behavioral weights and the variance of the spatial representations depended not only on the sensory reliabilities as predicted by the MLE model but also on participants’ modality-specific attention and report (i.e., visual vs. auditory). These results suggest that audiovisual integration is not exclusively determined by bottom-up sensory reliabilities. Instead, modality-specific attention and report can flexibly modulate how intraparietal sulcus integrates sensory signals into spatial representations to guide behavioral responses (e.g., localization and orienting).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; To obtain an accurate representation of the environment, the brain should integrate noisy sensory signals by weighting them in proportion to their relative reliabilities. This strategy is optimal by providing the most reliable, i.e., least variable percept. The extent to which the brain top-down controls the sensory weights in the integration process remains controversial. The current study shows that the parietal cortex weighs audiovisual signals by their reliabilities. Yet, the sensory weights and the variance of the multisensory representations were also influenced by modality-specific attention and report. These results suggest that audiovisual integration can be flexibly modulated by top-down control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: LTP or LTD? Modeling the Influence of Stress on Synaptic Plasticity</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0242-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;In cognitive memory, long-term potentiation (LTP) has been shown to occur when presynaptic and postsynaptic activities are highly correlated and glucocorticoid concentrations are in an optimal (i.e., low normal) range. In all other conditions, LTP is attenuated or even long-term depression (LTD) occurs. In this paper, we focus on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) dependent LTP and LTD, two processes involving various molecular mechanisms. To understand which of these mechanisms are indispensable for explaining the experimental evidence reported in the literature, we here propose a parsimonious model of NMDA-R dependent synaptic plasticity. Central to this model are two processes: first, AMPA-receptor-subunit trafficking and, second, glucocorticoid-dependent modifications of the brain-derived-neurotrophic-factor-receptor system. In 2008, we have published a core model, which contained the first process, while in the current paper we present an extended model, which also includes the second process. Using the extended model, we could show that stress attenuates LTP, while it enhances LTD. These simulation results are in agreement with experimental findings from other labs. In 2013, surprising experimental evidence showed that the GluA1 C-tail is unnecessary for LTP. When using our core model in its original form, our simulations already predicted that there would be no requirement for the GluA1 C-tail for LTP, allowing to eliminate a redundant mechanism from our model. In summary, we present a mathematical model that displays reduced complexity and is useful for explaining when and how LTP or LTD occurs at synapses during cognitive memory formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Synaptic plasticity is a complex process. For the description of biological processes, the best mathematical model is characterized by low complexity and high accuracy. Here we present a ‘low complexity’ model of synaptic plasticity that predicts the available experimental data with ‘high accuracy’. Among other things, one can use the model to explain how stress affects the occurrence of NMDA-R-dependent LTP and LTD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Predicting Recovery in Acute Post-stroke Aphasia</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25184</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Many stroke patients show remarkable recovery of language after initial severe impairment, but it is difficult to predict which patients will show good recovery. We aimed to identify patient and lesion characteristics that together predict the best naming outcome in four studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We report two longitudinal studies that identified two variables at onset that were strongly associated with good recovery of naming (the most common residual deficit in aphasia) in the first six months after stroke: damage to left posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG) and/or superior longitudinal fasciculus/arcuate fasciculus (SLF/AF) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use. We then tested these variables in two independent cohorts of chronic left hemisphere stroke patients, using chi squared tests and multivariable logistic regression for dichotomous outcomes and t-tests for continuous outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Lesion load in left pSTG and SLF/AF was associated with poorer naming outcome. Preservation of these areas and use of SSRIs were associated with naming recovery, independent of lesion volume, time since stroke, and depression. Patients with damage to these critical areas showed better naming outcome if they took SSRIs for three months after stroke. Those with preservation of these critical areas achieved good recovery of naming regardless of SSRI use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: Lesion load in left pSTG and SLF/AF at onset predicts later naming performance. Although based on a small number of patients, our preliminary results suggest outcome might be modulated by SSRIs, but these associations need to be confirmed in a larger randomized controlled trial.

&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objectives&lt;/b&gt;: To assess [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV-1451 tau-PET uptake patterns across the primary progressive aphasia (PPA) variants (logopenic, semantic and agrammatic), examine regional uptake patterns of [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV-1451 independent of clinical diagnosis, and compare the diagnostic utility of [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV-1451, [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]-fluorodeoxygluclose (FDG)-PET and MRI to differentiate the PPA variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We performed statistical parametric mapping of [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV-1451 across 40 PPA patients (logopenic-PPA=14, semantic-PPA=13 and agrammatic-PPA=13) compared to 80 cognitively normal, PiB-negative controls, age and gender matched 2:1. Principal component analysis of regional [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV-1451 tau-PET SUVR was performed to understand underlying patterns of [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV-1451 uptake independent of clinical diagnosis. Penalized multinomial regression analyses were utilized to assess diagnostic utility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Logopenic-PPA showed striking uptake throughout neocortex, particularly temporoparietal, compared to controls, semantic-PPA and agrammatic-PPA. Semantic-PPA and agrammatic-PPA showed milder patterns of focal [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV-1451 uptake. Semantic-PPA showed elevated uptake (left&amp;gt;right) in anteromedial temporal lobes, compared to controls and agrammatic-PPA. Agrammatic-PPA showed elevated uptake (left&amp;gt;right) throughout prefrontal white matter and in subcortical grey matter structures, compared to controls and semantic-PPA. The principal component analysis of regional [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV-1451 indicated two primary dimensions, a severity dimension that distinguished logopenic-PPA from agrammatic-PPA and semantic-PPA, and a frontal-versus-temporal contrast that distinguishes agrammatic-PPA and semantic-PPA cases.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05533</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Causal relations among neuronal populations of the brain are studied through
the so-called effective connectivity (EC) network. The latter is estimated from
EEG or fMRI measurements, by inverting a generative model of the corresponding
data. It is clear that the goodness of the estimated network heavily depends on
the underlying modeling assumptions. In this present paper we consider the EC
estimation problem using fMRI data in resting-state condition. Specifically, we
investigate on how to model endogenous fluctuations driving the neuronal
activity.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Putting a bug in ML: The moth olfactory network learns to read MNIST. (arXiv:1802.05405v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05405</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We seek to (i) characterize the learning architectures exploited in
biological neural networks for training on very few samples, and (ii) port
these algorithmic structures to a machine learning context. The Moth Olfactory
Network is among the simplest biological neural systems that can learn, and its
architecture includes key structural elements widespread in biological neural
nets, such as cascaded networks, competitive inhibition, high intrinsic noise,
sparsity, reward mechanisms, and Hebbian plasticity. The interactions of these
structural elements play a critical enabling role in rapid learning.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We assign a computational model of the Moth Olfactory Network the task of
learning to read the MNIST digits. This model, MothNet, is closely aligned with
the moth's known biophysics and with in vivo electrode data, including data
collected from moths learning new odors. We show that MothNet successfully
learns to read given very few training samples (1 to 20 samples per class). In
this few-samples regime, it substantially outperforms standard machine learning
methods such as nearest-neighbors, support-vector machines, and convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). The MothNet architecture illustrates how our proposed
algorithmic structures, derived from biological brains, can be used to build
alternative deep neural nets (DNNs) that may potentially avoid some of DNNs
current learning rate limitations. This novel, bio-inspired neural network
architecture offers a valuable complementary approach to DNN design.

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Reduction in parvalbumin-positive (PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) interneurons is observed in adult mice exposed to ethanol at postnatal day 7 (P7), a late gestation fetal alcohol spectrum disorder model. To evaluate whether PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells are lost, or PV expression is reduced, we quantified PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and associated perineuronal net (PNN)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cell densities in barrel cortex. While PNN&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cell density was not reduced by P7 ethanol, PV cell density decreased by 25% at P90 with no decrease at P14. PNN&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in controls were virtually all PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, whereas more than 20% lacked PV in ethanol-treated adult animals. P7 ethanol caused immediate apoptosis in 10% of GFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in G42 mice, which express GFP in a subset of PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells, and GFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cell density decreased by 60% at P90 without reduction at P14. The ethanol effect on PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cell density was attenuated by lithium treatment at P7 or at P14–28. Thus, reduced PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cell density may be caused by disrupted cell maturation, in addition to acute apoptosis. This effect may be regionally specific: in the dentate gyrus, P7 ethanol reduced PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cell density by 70% at P14 and both PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and PNN&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cell densities by 50% at P90, and delayed lithium did not alleviate ethanol’s effect.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Neural progenitor proliferation and cell fate decision from self-renewal to differentiation are crucial factors in determining brain size and morphology. The cytoskeletal dependent regulation of these processes is not entirely known. The actin-binding filamin A (FlnA) was shown to regulate proliferation of progenitors by directing changes in cell cycles proteins such as Cdk1 during G2/M phase. Here we report that functional loss of FlnA not only affects the rate of proliferation by altering cell cycle length but also causes a defect in early differentiation through changes in cell fate specification. FlnA interacts with Rho GTPase RhoA, and FlnA loss impairs RhoA activation. Disruption of either of these cytoskeletal associated proteins delays neurogenesis and promotes neural progenitors to remain in proliferative states. Aurora kinase B (Aurkb) has been implicated in cytokinesis, and peaks in expression during the G2/M phase. Inhibition of FlnA or RhoA impairs Aurkb degradation and alters its localization during mitosis. Overexpression of Aurkb replicates the same delay in neurogenesis seen with loss of FlnA or RhoA. Our findings suggest that shared cytoskeletal processes can direct neural progenitor proliferation by regulating the expression and localization of proteins that are implicated in the cell cycle progression and cell fate specification.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Excitation of Cortical nNOS/NK1R Neurons by Hypocretin 1 is Independent of Sleep Homeostasis</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy015/4864331?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;We have proposed that cortical nNOS/NK1R interneurons have a role in sleep homeostasis. The hypocretins (orexins) are wake-promoting neuropeptides and hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt) neurons project to the cortex. Hcrt peptides affect deep layer cortical neurons, and Hcrt receptor 1 (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Hcrtr1; Ox1r&lt;/span&gt;) mRNA is expressed in cortical nNOS/NK1R cells. Therefore, we investigated whether Hcrt neuron stimulation affects cingulate cortex nNOS/NK1R neurons. Bath application of HCRT1/orexin-A evoked an inward current and membrane depolarization in most nNOS/NK1R cells which persisted in tetrodotoxin; optogenetic stimulation of Hcrt terminals expressing channelrhodopsin-2 confirmed these results, and pharmacological studies determined that HCRTR1 mediated these responses. Single-cell RT-PCR found &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Hcrtr1&lt;/span&gt; mRNA in 31% of nNOS/NK1R cells without any &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Hcrtr2&lt;/span&gt; mRNA expression; immunohistochemical studies of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Hcrtr1-EGFP&lt;/span&gt; mice confirmed that a minority of nNOS/NK1R cells express HCRTR1. When Hcrt neurons degenerated in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;orexin-tTA;TetO DTA&lt;/span&gt; mice, the increased EEG delta power during NREM sleep produced in response to 4 h sleep deprivation and c-FOS expression in cortical nNOS/NK1R cells during recovery sleep were indistinguishable from that of controls. We conclude that Hcrt excitatory input to these deep layer cells is mediated through HCRTR1 but is unlikely to be involved in the putative role of cortical nNOS/NK1R neurons in sleep homeostasis.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

The capacity of the liver to convert the metabolic input received from the incoming portal and arterial blood into the metabolic output of the outgoing venous blood has three major determinants: The intra-hepatic blood flow, the transport of metabolites between blood vessels (sinusoids) and hepatocytes and the metabolic capacity of hepatocytes. These determinants are not constant across the organ: Even in the normal organ, but much more pronounced in the fibrotic and cirrhotic liver, regional variability of the capillary blood pressure, tissue architecture and the expression level of metabolic enzymes (zonation) have been reported. Understanding how this variability may affect the regional metabolic capacity of the liver is important for the interpretation of functional liver tests and planning of pharmacological and surgical interventions. Here we present a mathematical model of the sinusoidal tissue unit (STU) that is composed of a single sinusoid surrounded by the space of Disse and a monolayer of hepatocytes. The total metabolic output of the liver (arterio-venous glucose difference) is obtained by integration across the metabolic output of a representative number of STUs. Application of the model to the hepatic glucose metabolism provided the following insights: (i) At portal glucose concentrations between 6–8 mM, an intra-sinusoidal glucose cycle may occur which is constituted by glucose producing periportal hepatocytes and glucose consuming pericentral hepatocytes, (ii) Regional variability of hepatic blood flow is higher than the corresponding regional variability of the metabolic output, (iii) a spatially resolved metabolic functiogram of the liver is constructed. Variations of tissue parameters are equally important as variations of enzyme activities for the control of the arterio-venous glucose difference.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AgA-qivk3lY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Optimizing homeostatic cell renewal in hierarchical tissues</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/q-YEQltn26I/article</link>

In order to maintain homeostasis, mature cells removed from the top compartment of hierarchical tissues have to be replenished by means of differentiation and self-renewal events happening in the more primitive compartments. As each cell division is associated with a risk of mutation, cell division patterns have to be optimized, in order to minimize or delay the risk of malignancy generation. Here we study this optimization problem, focusing on the role of division tree length, that is, the number of layers of cells activated in response to the loss of terminally differentiated cells, which is related to the balance between differentiation and self-renewal events in the compartments. Using both analytical methods and stochastic simulations in a metapopulation-style model, we find that shorter division trees are advantageous if the objective is to minimize the total number of one-hit mutants in the cell population. Longer division trees on the other hand minimize the accumulation of two-hit mutants, which is a more likely evolutionary goal given the key role played by tumor suppressor genes in cancer initiation. While division tree length is the most important property determining mutant accumulation, we also find that increasing the size of primitive compartments helps to delay two-hit mutant generation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/q-YEQltn26I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Across academia and industry, text mining has become a popular strategy for keeping up with the rapid growth of the scientific literature. Text mining of the scientific literature has mostly been carried out on collections of abstracts, due to their availability. Here we present an analysis of 15 million English scientific full-text articles published during the period 1823–2016. We describe the development in article length and publication sub-topics during these nearly 250 years. We showcase the potential of text mining by extracting published protein–protein, disease–gene, and protein subcellular associations using a named entity recognition system, and quantitatively report on their accuracy using gold standard benchmark data sets. We subsequently compare the findings to corresponding results obtained on 16.5 million abstracts included in MEDLINE and show that text mining of full-text articles consistently outperforms using abstracts only.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aiRwNvO1kfc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Modeling the interactions of sense and antisense &lt;i&gt;Period&lt;/i&gt; transcripts in the mammalian circadian clock network</title>

In recent years, it has become increasingly apparent that antisense transcription plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression. The circadian clock is no exception: an antisense transcript of the mammalian core-clock gene &lt;i&gt;PERIOD2 (PER2)&lt;/i&gt;, which we shall refer to as &lt;i&gt;Per2AS&lt;/i&gt; RNA, oscillates with a circadian period and a nearly 12 h phase shift from the peak expression of &lt;i&gt;Per2&lt;/i&gt; mRNA. In this paper, we ask whether &lt;i&gt;Per2AS&lt;/i&gt; plays a regulatory role in the mammalian circadian clock by studying &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; the potential effects of interactions between &lt;i&gt;Per2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Per2AS&lt;/i&gt; RNAs on circadian rhythms. Based on the antiphasic expression pattern, we consider two hypotheses about how &lt;i&gt;Per2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Per2AS&lt;/i&gt; mutually interfere with each other's expression. In our &lt;i&gt;pre-transcriptional&lt;/i&gt; model, the transcription of &lt;i&gt;Per2AS&lt;/i&gt; RNA from the non-coding strand represses the transcription of &lt;i&gt;Per2&lt;/i&gt; mRNA from the coding strand and &lt;i&gt;vice versa&lt;/i&gt;. In our &lt;i&gt;post-transcriptional&lt;/i&gt; model, &lt;i&gt;Per2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Per2AS&lt;/i&gt; transcripts form a double-stranded RNA duplex, which is rapidly degraded. To study these two possible mechanisms, we have added terms describing our alternative hypotheses to a published mathematical model of the molecular regulatory network of the mammalian circadian clock. Our &lt;i&gt;pre-transcriptional&lt;/i&gt; model predicts that transcriptional interference between &lt;i&gt;Per2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Per2AS&lt;/i&gt; can generate alternative modes of circadian oscillations, which we characterize in terms of the amplitude and phase of oscillation of core clock genes. In our &lt;i&gt;post-transcriptional&lt;/i&gt; model, &lt;i&gt;Per2&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Per2AS&lt;/i&gt; duplex formation dampens the circadian rhythm. In a model that combines &lt;i&gt;pre-&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;post-transcriptional&lt;/i&gt; controls, the period, amplitude and phase of circadian proteins exhibit non-monotonic dependencies on the rate of expression of &lt;i&gt;Per2AS&lt;/i&gt;. All three models provide potential explanations of the observed antiphasic, circadian oscillations of &lt;i&gt;Per2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Per2AS&lt;/i&gt; RNAs. They make discordant predictions that can be tested experimentally in order to distinguish among these alternative hypotheses.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yhVxqYIrc3Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Life cycle synchronization is a viral drug resistance mechanism</title>

Viral infections are one of the major causes of death worldwide, with HIV infection alone resulting in over 1.2 million casualties per year. Antiviral drugs are now being administered for a variety of viral infections, including HIV, hepatitis B and C, and influenza. These therapies target a specific phase of the virus’s life cycle, yet their ultimate success depends on a variety of factors, such as adherence to a prescribed regimen and the emergence of viral drug resistance. The epidemiology and evolution of drug resistance have been extensively characterized, and it is generally assumed that drug resistance arises from mutations that alter the virus’s susceptibility to the direct action of the drug. In this paper, we consider the possibility that a virus population can evolve towards synchronizing its life cycle with the pattern of drug therapy. The periodicity of the drug treatment could then allow for a virus strain whose life cycle length is a multiple of the dosing interval to replicate only when the concentration of the drug is lowest. This process, referred to as “drug tolerance by synchronization”, could allow the virus population to maximize its overall fitness without having to alter drug binding or complete its life cycle in the drug’s presence. We use mathematical models and stochastic simulations to show that life cycle synchronization can indeed be a mechanism of viral drug tolerance. We show that this effect is more likely to occur when the variability in both viral life cycle and drug dose timing are low. More generally, we find that in the presence of periodic drug levels, time-averaged calculations of viral fitness do not accurately predict drug levels needed to eradicate infection, even if there is no synchronization. We derive an analytical expression for viral fitness that is sufficient to explain the drug-pattern-dependent survival of strains with any life cycle length. We discuss the implications of these findings for clinically relevant antiviral strategies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hW82FtIP5II&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Cooperation and competition between human players in repeated microeconomic games offer a window onto social phenomena such as the establishment, breakdown and repair of trust. However, although a suitable starting point for the quantitative analysis of such games exists, namely the Interactive Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (I-POMDP), computational considerations and structural limitations have limited its application, and left unmodelled critical features of behavior in a canonical trust task. Here, we provide the first analysis of two central phenomena: a form of social risk-aversion exhibited by the player who is in control of the interaction in the game; and irritation or anger, potentially exhibited by both players. Irritation arises when partners apparently defect, and it potentially causes a precipitate breakdown in cooperation. Failing to model one’s partner’s propensity for it leads to substantial economic inefficiency. We illustrate these behaviours using evidence drawn from the play of large cohorts of healthy volunteers and patients. We show that for both cohorts, a particular subtype of player is largely responsible for the breakdown of trust, a finding which sheds new light on borderline personality disorder.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ULf3Obv5ks8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract &lt;p&gt;Sepsis, a manifestation of the body’s inflammatory response to injury and infection, has a mortality rate of between 28%-50% and affects approximately 1 million patients annually in the United States. Currently, there are no therapies targeting the cellular/molecular processes driving sepsis that have demonstrated the ability to control this disease process in the clinical setting. We propose that this is in great part due to the considerable heterogeneity of the clinical trajectories that constitute clinical “sepsis,” and that determining how this system can be controlled back into a state of health requires the application of concepts drawn from the field of dynamical systems. In this work, we consider the human immune system to be a random dynamical system, and investigate its potential controllability using an agent-based model of the innate immune response (the Innate Immune Response ABM or IIRABM) as a surrogate, proxy system. Simulation experiments with the IIRABM provide an explanation as to why single/limited cytokine perturbations at a single, or small number of, time points is unlikely to significantly improve the mortality rate of sepsis. We then use genetic algorithms (GA) to explore and characterize multi-targeted control strategies for the random dynamical immune system that guide it from a persistent, non-recovering inflammatory state (functionally equivalent to the clinical states of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or sepsis) to a state of health. We train the GA on a single parameter set with multiple stochastic replicates, and show that while the calculated results show good generalizability, more advanced strategies are needed to achieve the goal of adaptive personalized medicine. This work evaluating the extent of interventions needed to control a simplified surrogate model of sepsis provides insight into the scope of the clinical challenge, and can serve as a guide on the path towards true “precision control” of sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mdevvWdmuMQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progresses insidiously over decades. Therefore, study of preclinical AD is critical to identify early pathophysiological changes as potential targets for prevention or treatment. The brain processes at the preclinical stage remain minimally understood. Aside from age, the E4 allele of APOE flags a group at particularly high risk of late onset AD (LOAD). Studies of these individuals could provide insights about the ontogenesis of AD offering clues for novel treatment strategies. To this end, cognitively-normal, &lt;i&gt;APOE*E4&lt;/i&gt; homozygotes from the Alzheimer’s Diseases Neuroimaging Research Initiative database (ADNI-LONI) provided fluorodeoxyglucose and amyloid (florbetapir) PET scans (N = 8 and 7, respectively; mean age 76 years). Their scans were compared to those of matched cognitively-normal elders who were not E4 carriers. There was dissociation in the distribution between glucose uptake and amyloid deposition in the homozygotes. Peak hypometabolism localized bilaterally along the medial temporal cortex. In contrast, peak amyloid deposition localized principally to the putamen–a finding also seen in preclinical carriers of autosomal dominant AD mutations and preclinical AD associated with Down’s syndrome. Additional regions of amyloid deposition in homozygotes were medial prefrontal cortices including the anterior cingulate, middle and inferior frontal cortices, and middle and inferior occipital cortices. These findings contrast with those reported for LOAD. These data begin to characterize elders with normal cognition despite high AD risk in comparison to the known phenotypes of patients with LOAD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;APOE*E4&lt;/i&gt; has the largest single effect size of any common variant for any human disease. &lt;i&gt;APOE*E4&lt;/i&gt; homozygotes increase the risk of late onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) fifteen-fold. Research indicates interventions for AD must occur decades before onset of symptoms. However, the phenotypic antecedents and pathophysiology of LOAD remain limited in characterization. &lt;i&gt;APOE*E4&lt;/i&gt; homozygotes offer a unique opportunity to characterize preclinical AD. Here, neuroimaging of cognitively-normal, elderly &lt;i&gt;APOE*E4&lt;/i&gt; homozygotes reveals decreased medial temporal metabolism and increased lenticular amyloid deposition in those at high risk for developing LOAD. In comparison to LOAD, an atypical pattern of change in metabolism and amyloid distribution as well as a dissociation between these two measures arose in homozygotes compared to non-carriers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Alpha-Tubulin Acetyltransferase Is a Novel Target Mediating Neurite Growth Inhibitory Effects of Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycans and Myelin Associated Glycoprotein.</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0240-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Damage to the central nervous system (CNS) results in neuronal and axonal degeneration, and subsequent neurological dysfunction. Endogenous repair in the CNS is impeded by inhibitory chemical and physical barriers, such as chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), which prevent axon regeneration. Previously, it has been demonstrated that the inhibition of axonal histone deacetylase-6 (HDAC6) can promote microtubule α-tubulin acetylation and restore the growth of CSPGs- and MAG-inhibited axons. Since the acetylation of α-tubulin is regulated by two opposing enzymes, HDAC6 (deacetylation) and αTAT1 (acetylation), we have investigated the regulation of these enzymes downstream of a growth inhibitory signal. Our findings show that exposure of primary mouse cortical neurons to soluble CSPGs and MAG substrates cause an acute and RhoA-kinase-dependent reduction in α-tubulin acetylation and αTAT1 protein levels, without changes to either HDAC6 levels or HDAC6 activity. The CSPGs- and MAG-induced reduction in αTAT1 occurs primarily in the distal and middle regions of neurites and reconstitution of αTAT1, either by ROCK inhibition or lentiviral-mediated αTAT1 overexpression, can restore neurite growth. Lastly, we demonstrate that CSPGs and MAG signaling decreases αTAT1 levels post-transcriptionally via a ROCK-dependent increase in αTAT1 protein turnover. Together, these findings define αTAT1 as a novel potential therapeutic target for ameliorating CNS injury characterized by growth inhibitory substrates that are prohibitive to axonal regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significant Statement&lt;/b&gt; Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) represent significant barriers to axon regeneration after central nervous system (CNS) injury. Inhibition of axonal histone deacetylase-6 (HDAC6), an enzyme that regulates α-tubulin deacetylation, has been shown to overcome the inhibitory effects of CSPGs and MAG to axon growth. In the present study, we report that αTAT1, the α-tubulin acetyltransferase that opposes HDAC6’s activity, is downregulated in neurites by CSPGs and MAG in cortical neurons, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. This reduction is associated with a loss of α-tubulin acetylation and occurs via a RhoA-kinase-dependent pathway. Restoring αTAT1 expression in CSPGs- or MAG-inhibited cortical neurons rescues neurite growth. Our results suggest that αTAT1 is a potential therapeutic target to promote axonal regeneration in the CNS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This potentially reversible, spreading wave typically starts 2 to 5 minutes after the onset of severe ischemia, marking the onset of a toxic intraneuronal change that eventually results in irreversible injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25147-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate this in the human brain, we performed recordings with either subdural electrode strips (n = 4) or intraparenchymal electrode arrays (n = 5) in patients with devastating brain injury that resulted in activation of a Do Not Resuscitate–Comfort Care order followed by terminal extubation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Silencing of spontaneous electrical activity developed simultaneously across regional electrode arrays in 8 patients. This silencing, termed “nonspreading depression,” developed during the steep falling phase of p&lt;sub&gt;ti&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (intraparenchymal sensor, n = 6) at 11 (interquartile range [IQR] = 7–14) mmHg. Terminal spreading depolarizations started to propagate between electrodes 3.9 (IQR = 2.6–6.3) minutes after onset of the final drop in perfusion and 13 to 266 seconds after nonspreading depression. In 1 patient, terminal spreading depolarization induced the initial electrocerebral silence in a spreading depression pattern; circulatory arrest developed thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Central nervous system (CNS) manifestations are present in roughly 50% of LSD patients and represent an unmet medical need for them. We explored the therapeutic potential of metallothioneins (MTs), a newly identified family of proteins with reported neuroprotective roles, in the murine models of two LSDs with CNS involvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25161-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;MT-1 overexpressing transgenic mice (MTtg) were crossed with the murine models of Batten and Krabbe diseases. Changes in the survival and manifestations of the disease in the MTtg setting were assessed. In addition, we analyzed the therapeutic effects of MT-1 CNS gene delivery in one of these LSD models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

MT-LSD mice showed a 5% to 10% increase in survival and slower disease progression as compared to not-transgenic LSD mice. Rescue of Purkinje cells from degeneration and apoptosis was also observed in the MT-LSD models. This phenotypic amelioration was accompanied by a modulation of the disease-associated activated inflammatory microglia phenotype, and by a reduction of oxidative stress. Importantly, for the clinical translation of our findings, the very same effects were obtained when MTs were delivered to brains by systemic AAV gene transfer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Here, human TLE specimens were investigated focusing on the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) and complex 2 (mTORC2) activities in the brain, given that both pathways may represent unique targets for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25149-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surgically resected hippocampal and temporal lobe samples from therapy-resistant TLE patients were analyzed by western blotting to quantify the expression of established mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity markers and upstream or downstream signaling pathways involving the two complexes. Histological and immunohistochemical techniques were used to assess hippocampal and neocortical structural abnormalities and cell-specific expression of individual biomarkers. Samples from patients with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type II served as positive controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Our work identified the phosphoinositide 3-kinase and Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathways as potential mTORC1 and mTORC2 upstream activators. In addition, we found that overactive mTORC2 signaling was accompanied by induction of two protein kinase B–dependent prosurvival pathways, as evidenced by increased inhibitory phosphorylation of forkhead box class O3a (Ser253) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (Ser9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Specifically, clinically available drugs that suppress mTORC1 without compromising mTOR2 signaling, such as rapamycin and its analogs, may represent a new group of antiepileptogenic agents in TLE patients.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Central vein sign differentiates Multiple Sclerosis from central nervous system inflammatory vasculopathies</title>

Detection of perivenular lesions in the brain (the “central vein sign”) improves the pathological specificity of MS diagnosis, but comprehensive evaluation of this MRI biomarker in MS-mimicking inflammatory and/or autoimmune diseases, such as central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory vasculopathies, is lacking. In a multicenter study, we assessed the frequency of perivenular lesions in MS versus systemic autoimmune diseases with CNS involvement and primary angiitis of the CNS (PACNS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25146-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 31 patients with inflammatory CNS vasculopathies and 52 with relapsing–remitting MS, 3-dimensional T2*-weighted and T2–fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images were obtained during a single MRI acquisition after gadolinium injection. For each lesion, the central vein sign was evaluated according to consensus guidelines. For each patient, lesion count, volume, and brain location, as well as fulfillment of dissemination in space MRI criteria, were assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25146-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;MS showed higher frequency of perivenular lesions (median = 88%) than did inflammatory CNS vasculopathies (14%), without overlap between groups or differences between 3T and 1.5T MRI. Among inflammatory vasculopathies, Behçet disease showed the highest median frequency of perivenular lesions (34%), followed by PACNS (14%), antiphospholipid syndromes (12%), Sjögren syndrome (11%), and systemic lupus erythematosus (0%). When a threshold of 50% perivenular lesions was applied, central vein sign discriminated MS from inflammatory vasculopathies with a diagnostic accuracy of 100%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<content:encoded>The ability of the retina to adapt to changes in mean light intensity and contrast is well known. Classically, however, adaptation is thought to affect gain but not to change the visual modality encoded by a given type of retinal neuron. Recent findings reveal unexpected dynamic properties in mouse retinal neurons that challenge this view. Specifically, certain cell types change the visual modality they encode with variations in ambient illumination or following repetitive visual stimulation. These discoveries demonstrate that computations performed by retinal circuits with defined architecture can change with visual input.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Self-crowding of AMPA receptors in the excitatory postsynaptic density can effectuate anomalous receptor sub-diffusion</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Rahul Gupta&lt;/p&gt;

AMPA receptors (AMPARs) and their associations with auxiliary transmembrane proteins are bulky structures with large steric-exclusion volumes. Hence, self-crowding of AMPARs, depending on the local density, may affect their lateral diffusion in the postsynaptic membrane as well as in the highly crowded postsynaptic density (PSD) at excitatory synapses. Earlier theoretical studies considered only the roles of transmembrane obstacles and the AMPAR-binding submembranous scaffold proteins in shaping receptor diffusion within PSD. Using lattice model of diffusion, the present study investigates the additional impacts of self-crowding on the anomalousity and effective diffusion coefficient (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;) of AMPAR diffusion. A recursive algorithm for avoiding false self-blocking during diffusion simulation is also proposed. The findings suggest that high density of AMPARs in the obstacle-free membrane itself engenders strongly anomalous diffusion and severe decline in &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;. Adding transmembrane obstacles to the membrane accentuates the anomalousity arising from self-crowding due to the reduced free diffusion space. Contrarily, enhanced AMPAR-scaffold binding, either through increase in binding strength or scaffold density or both, ameliorates the anomalousity resulting from self-crowding. However, binding has differential impacts on &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; depending on the receptor density. Increase in binding causes consistent decrease in &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; for low and moderate receptor density. For high density, binding increases &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; as long as it reduces anomalousity associated with intense self-crowding. Given a sufficiently strong binding condition when diffusion acquires normal behavior, further increase in binding causes decrease in &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;. Supporting earlier experimental observations are mentioned and implications of present findings to the experimental observations on AMPAR diffusion are also drawn.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8SAtqcqg8xg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Diabetic neuropathy differs between type 1 and type 2 diabetes Insights from magnetic resonance neurography</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25182</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: To visualize and quantify differences of microstructural nerve damage in distal symmetric diabetic neuropathy (DPN) between type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), and to detect correlations between neuropathic symptoms and serological risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: 3T magnetic resonance neurography of the sciatic nerve was performed in 120 patients (T1D n=35; T2D n=85) with either DPN (n=84) or no DPN (NDPN; n=36). Results were subsequently correlated with clinical, serological, and electrophysiological patient data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: T2-weighted (T2w) hyperintense lesions correlated negatively with tibial compound motor action potential (r=-0.58; p&amp;lt;0.0001) and peroneal nerve conduction (r=0.51; p=0.0002), and positively with neuropathy disability (NDS; r=-0.54; p&amp;lt;0.0001) and severity score (NSS; r=0.52; p&amp;lt;0.0001), and HbA1c levels (r=0.23; p=0.014). T2w-hypointense lesions correlated positively with NDS, NSS (r=0.28; p=0.002; r=0.36; p&amp;lt;0.0001), and serum triglycerides (r=0.34; p=0.0003), and negatively with serum HDL (r=-0.48; p&amp;lt;0.0001). For DPN in T1D, elevated values of T2w-hyperintense lesions (19.67%&lt;em&gt;±&lt;/em&gt;4.13 vs. 12.49%&lt;em&gt;±&lt;/em&gt;1.23; p=0.027) and HbA1c (8.74%±0.29 vs. 7.11%±0.16; p&amp;lt;0.0001) were found when compared to T2D. For DPN in T2D, elevated T2w-hypointense lesions (23.41mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;±&lt;/em&gt;2.69 vs. 11.43mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;±&lt;/em&gt;1.74; p=0.046), triglycerides (220.70mg/dl±23.70 vs. 106.60mg/dl±14.51; p&amp;lt;0.0001), and lower serum HDL (51.29mg/dl±3.02 vs. 70.79mg/dl±4.65; p&amp;lt;0.0001) were found when compared to T1D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: The predominant type of nerve lesions in DPN differs between T1D and T2D. Correlations found between lesion type and serological parameters indicate that predominant nerve lesions in T1D are associated with poor glycemic control and loss of nerve conduction, whereas predominant lesions in T2D are associated with changes in lipid metabolism. These findings may be helpful for future studies on the underlying pathophysiological pathways and possible treatments for DPN in T1D and T2D. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Protein O-Mannosyltransferases Affect Sensory Axon Wiring and Dynamic Chirality of Body Posture in the Drosophila Embryo</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/7/1850?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Genetic defects in protein O-mannosyltransferase 1 (POMT1) and POMT2 underlie severe muscular dystrophies. &lt;i&gt;POMT&lt;/i&gt; genes are evolutionarily conserved in metazoan organisms. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, both male and female &lt;i&gt;POMT&lt;/i&gt; mutants show a clockwise rotation of adult abdominal segments, suggesting a chirality of underlying pathogenic mechanisms. Here we described and analyzed a similar phenotype in &lt;i&gt;POMT&lt;/i&gt; mutant embryos that shows left-handed body torsion. Our experiments demonstrated that coordinated muscle contraction waves are associated with asymmetric embryo rolling, unveiling a new chirality marker in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; development. Using genetic and live-imaging approaches, we revealed that the torsion phenotype results from differential rolling and aberrant patterning of peristaltic waves of muscle contractions. Our results demonstrated that peripheral sensory neurons are required for normal contractions that prevent the accumulation of torsion. We found that &lt;i&gt;POMT&lt;/i&gt; mutants show abnormal axonal connections of sensory neurons. &lt;i&gt;POMT&lt;/i&gt; transgenic expression limited to sensory neurons significantly rescued the torsion phenotype, axonal connectivity defects, and abnormal contractions in &lt;i&gt;POMT&lt;/i&gt; mutant embryos. Together, our data suggested that protein O-mannosylation is required for normal sensory feedback to control coordinated muscle contractions and body posture. This mechanism may shed light on analogous functions of &lt;i&gt;POMT&lt;/i&gt; genes in mammals and help to elucidate the etiology of neurological defects in muscular dystrophies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Protein O-mannosyltransferases (POMTs) are evolutionarily conserved in metazoans. Mutations in &lt;i&gt;POMTs&lt;/i&gt; cause severe muscular dystrophies associated with pronounced neurological defects. However, neurological functions of POMTs remain poorly understood. We demonstrated that &lt;i&gt;POMT&lt;/i&gt; mutations in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; result in abnormal muscle contractions and cause embryo torsion. Our experiments uncovered a chirality of embryo movements and a unique &lt;i&gt;POMT&lt;/i&gt;-dependent mechanism that maintains symmetry of a developing system affected by chiral forces. Furthermore, &lt;i&gt;POMTs&lt;/i&gt; were found to be required for proper axon connectivity of sensory neurons, suggesting that O-mannosylation regulates the sensory feedback controlling muscle contractions. This novel POMT function in the peripheral nervous system may shed light on analogous functions in mammals and help to elucidate pathomechanisms of neurological abnormalities in muscular dystrophies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neural Mechanisms Underlying Cross-Modal Phonetic Encoding</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/7/1835?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Audiovisual (AV) integration is essential for speech comprehension, especially in adverse listening situations. Divergent, but not mutually exclusive, theories have been proposed to explain the neural mechanisms underlying AV integration. One theory advocates that this process occurs via interactions between the auditory and visual cortices, as opposed to fusion of AV percepts in a multisensory integrator. Building upon this idea, we proposed that AV integration in spoken language reflects visually induced weighting of phonetic representations at the auditory cortex. EEG was recorded while male and female human subjects watched and listened to videos of a speaker uttering consonant vowel (CV) syllables /ba/ and /fa/, presented in Auditory-only, AV congruent or incongruent contexts. Subjects reported whether they heard /ba/ or /fa/. We hypothesized that vision alters phonetic encoding by dynamically weighting which phonetic representation in the auditory cortex is strengthened or weakened. That is, when subjects are presented with visual /fa/ and acoustic /ba/ and hear /fa/ (&lt;i&gt;illusion-fa&lt;/i&gt;), the visual input strengthens the weighting of the phone /f/ representation. When subjects are presented with visual /ba/ and acoustic /fa/ and hear /ba/ (&lt;i&gt;illusion-ba&lt;/i&gt;), the visual input weakens the weighting of the phone /f/ representation. Indeed, we found an enlarged N1 auditory evoked potential when subjects perceived &lt;i&gt;illusion-ba&lt;/i&gt;, and a reduced N1 when they perceived &lt;i&gt;illusion-fa&lt;/i&gt;, mirroring the N1 behavior for /ba/ and /fa/ in Auditory-only settings. These effects were especially pronounced in individuals with more robust illusory perception. These findings provide evidence that visual speech modifies phonetic encoding at the auditory cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The current study presents evidence that audiovisual integration in spoken language occurs when one modality (vision) acts on representations of a second modality (audition). Using the McGurk illusion, we show that visual context primes phonetic representations at the auditory cortex, altering the auditory percept, evidenced by changes in the N1 auditory evoked potential. This finding reinforces the theory that audiovisual integration occurs via visual networks influencing phonetic representations in the auditory cortex. We believe that this will lead to the generation of new hypotheses regarding cross-modal mapping, particularly whether it occurs via direct or indirect routes (e.g., via a multisensory mediator).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Evidence for Long-Timescale Patterns of Synaptic Inputs in CA1 of Awake Behaving Mice</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/7/1821?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Repeated sequences of neural activity are a pervasive feature of neural networks &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. In the hippocampus, sequential firing of many neurons over periods of 100–300 ms reoccurs during behavior and during periods of quiescence. However, it is not known whether the hippocampus produces longer sequences of activity or whether such sequences are restricted to specific network states. Furthermore, whether long repeated patterns of activity are transmitted to single cells downstream is unclear. To answer these questions, we recorded intracellularly from hippocampal CA1 of awake, behaving male mice to examine both subthreshold activity and spiking output in single neurons. In eight of nine recordings, we discovered long (900 ms) reoccurring subthreshold fluctuations or &quot;repeats.&quot; Repeats generally were high-amplitude, nonoscillatory events reoccurring with 10 ms precision. Using statistical controls, we determined that repeats occurred more often than would be expected from unstructured network activity (e.g., by chance). Most spikes occurred during a repeat, and when a repeat contained a spike, the spike reoccurred with precision on the order of ≤20 ms, showing that long repeated patterns of subthreshold activity are strongly connected to spike output. Unexpectedly, we found that repeats occurred independently of classic hippocampal network states like theta oscillations or sharp-wave ripples. Together, these results reveal surprisingly long patterns of repeated activity in the hippocampal network that occur nonstochastically, are transmitted to single downstream neurons, and strongly shape their output. This suggests that the timescale of information transmission in the hippocampal network is much longer than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We found long (≥900 ms), repeated, subthreshold patterns of activity in CA1 of awake, behaving mice. These repeated patterns (&quot;repeats&quot;) occurred more often than expected by chance and with 10 ms precision. Most spikes occurred within repeats and reoccurred with a precision on the order of 20 ms. Surprisingly, there was no correlation between repeat occurrence and classical network states such as theta oscillations and sharp-wave ripples. These results provide strong evidence that long patterns of activity are repeated and transmitted to downstream neurons, suggesting that the hippocampus can generate longer sequences of repeated activity than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sox2 Is Essential for Oligodendroglial Proliferation and Differentiation during Postnatal Brain Myelination and CNS Remyelination</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/7/1802?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the CNS, myelination and remyelination depend on the successful progression and maturation of oligodendroglial lineage cells, including proliferation and differentiation of oligodendroglial progenitor cells (OPCs). Previous studies have reported that Sox2 transiently regulates oligodendrocyte (OL) differentiation in the embryonic and perinatal spinal cord and appears dispensable for myelination in the postnatal spinal cord. However, the role of Sox2 in OL development in the brain has yet to be defined. We now report that Sox2 is an essential positive regulator of developmental myelination in the postnatal murine brain of both sexes. Stage-specific paradigms of genetic disruption demonstrated that Sox2 regulated brain myelination by coordinating upstream OPC population supply and downstream OL differentiation. Transcriptomic analyses further supported a crucial role of Sox2 in brain developmental myelination. Consistently, oligodendroglial Sox2-deficient mice developed severe tremors and ataxia, typical phenotypes indicative of hypomyelination, and displayed severe impairment of motor function and prominent deficits of brain OL differentiation and myelination persisting into the later CNS developmental stages. We also found that Sox2 was required for efficient OPC proliferation and expansion and OL regeneration during remyelination in the adult brain and spinal cord. Together, our genetic evidence reveals an essential role of Sox2 in brain myelination and CNS remyelination, and suggests that manipulation of Sox2 and/or Sox2-mediated downstream pathways may be therapeutic in promoting CNS myelin repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Promoting myelin formation and repair has translational significance in treating myelin-related neurological disorders, such as periventricular leukomalacia and multiple sclerosis in which brain developmental myelin formation and myelin repair are severely affected, respectively. In this report, analyses of a series of genetic conditional knock-out systems targeting different oligodendrocyte stages reveal a previously unappreciated role of Sox2 in coordinating upstream proliferation and downstream differentiation of oligodendroglial lineage cells in the mouse brain during developmental myelination and CNS remyelination. Our study points to the potential of manipulating Sox2 and its downstream pathways to promote oligodendrocyte regeneration and CNS myelin repair.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Nonlinear Relationship Between Spike-Dependent Calcium Influx and TRPC Channel Activation Enables Robust Persistent Spiking in Neurons of the Anterior Cingulate Cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/7/1788?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Continuation of spiking after a stimulus ends (i.e. persistent spiking) is thought to support working memory. Muscarinic receptor activation enables persistent spiking among synaptically isolated pyramidal neurons in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), but a detailed characterization of that spiking is lacking and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that the rate of persistent spiking in ACC neurons is insensitive to the intensity and number of triggers, but can be modulated by injected current, and that persistent spiking can resume after several seconds of hyperpolarization-imposed quiescence. Using electrophysiology and calcium imaging in brain slices from male rats, we determined that canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channels are necessary for persistent spiking and that TRPC-activating calcium enters in a spike-dependent manner via voltage-gated calcium channels. Constrained by these biophysical details, we built a computational model that reproduced the observed pattern of persistent spiking. Nonlinear dynamical analysis of that model revealed that TRPC channels become fully activated by the small rise in intracellular calcium caused by evoked spikes. Calcium continues to rise during persistent spiking, but because TRPC channel activation saturates, firing rate stabilizes. By calcium rising higher than required for maximal TRPC channel activation, TRPC channels are able to remain active during periods of hyperpolarization-imposed quiescence (until calcium drops below saturating levels) such that persistent spiking can resume when hyperpolarization is discontinued. Our results thus reveal that the robust intrinsic bistability exhibited by ACC neurons emerges from the nonlinear positive feedback relationship between spike-dependent calcium influx and TRPC channel activation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neurons use action potentials, or spikes, to encode information. Some neurons can store information for short periods (seconds to minutes) by continuing to spike after a stimulus ends, thus enabling working memory. This so-called &quot;persistent&quot; spiking occurs in many brain areas and has been linked to activation of canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channels. However, TRPC activation alone is insufficient to explain many aspects of persistent spiking such as resumption of spiking after periods of imposed quiescence. Using experiments and simulations, we show that calcium influx caused by spiking is necessary and sufficient to activate TRPC channels and that the ensuing positive feedback interaction between intracellular calcium and TRPC channel activation can account for many hitherto unexplained aspects of persistent spiking.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Discrete Modules and Mesoscale Functional Circuits for Thermal Nociception within Primate S1 Cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/7/1774?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This study addresses one long-standing question of whether functional separations are preserved for somatosensory modalities of touch, heat, and cold nociception within primate primary somatosensory (S1) cortex. This information is critical for understanding how the nature of pain is represented in the primate brain. Using a combination of submillimeter-resolution fMRI and microelectrode local field potential (LFP) and spike recordings, we identified spatially segregated cortical zones for processing touch and nociceptive heat and cold stimuli in somatotopically appropriate areas 3a, 3b, 1, and 2 of S1 in male monkeys. The distances between zones were comparable (~3.4 mm) across stimulus modalities (heat, cold, and tactile), indicating the existence of uniform, modality-specific modules. Stimulus-evoked LFP maps validated the fMRI maps in areas 3b and 1. Isolation of heat and cold nociceptive neurons from the fMRI zones confirmed the validity of using fMRI to probe nociceptive regions and circuits. Resting-state fMRI analysis revealed distinct intrinsic functional circuits among functionally related zones. We discovered distinct modular structures and networks for thermal nociception within S1 cortex, a finding that has significant implications for studying chronic pain syndromes and guiding the selection of neuromodulation targets for chronic pain management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Primate S1 subregions contain discrete heat and cold nociceptive modules. Modules with the same properties exhibit strong functional connection. Nociceptive fMRI response coincides with LFP and spike activities of nociceptive neurons. Functional separation of heat and cold pain is retained within primate S1 cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: KChIP3 N-Terminal 31-50 Fragment Mediates Its Association with TRPV1 and Alleviates Inflammatory Hyperalgesia in Rats</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/7/1756?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Potassium voltage-gated channel interacting protein 3 (KChIP3), also termed downstream regulatory element antagonist modulator (DREAM) and calsenilin, is a multifunctional protein belonging to the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) family. Recent studies revealed the expression of KChIP3 in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, suggesting the potential role of KChIP3 in peripheral sensory processing. Herein, we show that KChIP3 colocalizes with transient receptor potential ion channel V1 (TRPV1), a critical molecule involved in peripheral sensitization during inflammatory pain. Furthermore, the N-terminal 31-50 fragment of KChIP3 is capable of binding both the intracellular N and C termini of TRPV1, which substantially decreases the surface localization of TRPV1 and the subsequent Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx through the channel. Importantly, intrathecal administration of the transmembrane peptide transactivator of transcription (TAT)-31-50 remarkably reduces Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx via TRPV1 in DRG neurons and alleviates thermal hyperalgesia and gait alterations in a complete Freund's adjuvant-induced inflammatory pain model in male rats. Moreover, intraplantar injection of TAT-31-50 attenuated the capsaicin-evoked spontaneous pain behavior and thermal hyperalgesia, which further strengthened the regulatory role of TAT-31-50 on TRPV1 channel. In addition, TAT-31-50 could also alleviate inflammatory thermal hyperalgesia in &lt;i&gt;kcnip3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; rats generated in our study, suggesting that the analgesic effect mediated by TAT-31-50 is independent of endogenous KChIP3. Our study reveals a novel peripheral mechanism for the analgesic function of KChIP3 and provides a potential analgesic agent, TAT-31-50, for the treatment of inflammatory pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Inflammatory pain arising from inflamed or injured tissues significantly compromises the quality of life in patients. This study aims to elucidate the role of peripheral potassium channel interacting protein 3 (KChIP3) in inflammatory pain. Direct interaction of the KChIP3 N-terminal 31-50 fragment with transient receptor potential ion channel V1 (TRPV1) was demonstrated. The KChIP3–TRPV1 interaction reduces the surface localization of TRPV1 and thus alleviates heat hyperalgesia and gait alterations induced by peripheral inflammation. Furthermore, the transmembrane transactivator of transcription (TAT)-31-50 peptide showed analgesic effects on inflammatory hyperalgesia independently of endogenous KChIP3. This work reveals a novel mechanism of peripheral KChIP3 in inflammatory hyperalgesia that is distinct from its classical role as a transcriptional repressor in pain modulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Signal Complexity of Human Intracranial EEG Tracks Successful Associative-Memory Formation across Individuals</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/7/1744?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Memory performance is highly variable among individuals. Most studies examining human memory, however, have largely focused on the neural correlates of successful memory formation within individuals, rather than the differences among them. As such, what gives rise to this variability is poorly understood. Here, we examined intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings captured from 43 participants (23 male) implanted with subdural electrodes for seizure monitoring as they performed a paired-associates verbal memory task. We identified three separate but related signatures of neural activity that tracked differences in successful memory formation across individuals. High-performing individuals consistently exhibited less broadband power, flatter power spectral density slopes, and greater complexity in their iEEG signals. Furthermore, within individuals across three separate time scales ranging from seconds to days, successful recall was positively associated with these same metrics. Our data therefore suggest that memory ability across individuals can be indexed by increased neural signal complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We show that participants whose intracranial EEG exhibits less low-frequency power, flatter power spectrums, and greater sample entropy overall are better able to memorize associations, and that the same metrics track fluctuations in memory performance across time within individuals. These metrics together signify greater neural signal complexity, which may index the brain's ability to flexibly engage with information and generate separable memory representations. Critically, the current set of results provides a unique window into the neural markers of individual differences in memory performance, which have hitherto been underexplored.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Primary Role of Flow Processing in the Identification of Scene-Relative Object Movement</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/7/1737?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Retinal image motion could be due to the movement of the observer through space or an object relative to the scene. Optic flow, form, and change of position cues all provide information that could be used to separate out retinal motion due to object movement from retinal motion due to observer movement. In Experiment 1, we used a minimal display to examine the contribution of optic flow and form cues. Human participants indicated the direction of movement of a probe object presented against a background of radially moving pairs of dots. By independently controlling the orientation of each dot pair, we were able to put flow cues to self-movement direction (the point from which all the motion radiated) and form cues to self-movement direction (the point toward which all the dot pairs were oriented) in conflict. We found that only flow cues influenced perceived probe movement. In Experiment 2, we switched to a rich stereo display composed of 3D objects to examine the contribution of flow and position cues. We moved the scene objects to simulate a lateral translation and counter-rotation of gaze. By changing the polarity of the scene objects (from light to dark and vice versa) between frames, we placed flow cues to self-movement direction in opposition to change of position cues. We found that again flow cues dominated the perceived probe movement relative to the scene. Together, these experiments indicate the neural network that processes optic flow has a primary role in the identification of scene-relative object movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Motion of an object in the retinal image indicates relative movement between the observer and the object, but it does not indicate its cause: movement of an object in the scene; movement of the observer; or both. To isolate retinal motion due to movement of a scene object, the brain must parse out the retinal motion due to movement of the eye (&quot;flow parsing&quot;). Optic flow, form, and position cues all have potential roles in this process. We pitted the cues against each other and assessed their influence. We found that flow parsing relies on optic flow alone. These results indicate the primary role of the neural network that processes optic flow in the identification of scene-relative object movement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Muscle Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors May Mediate Trans-Synaptic Signaling at the Mouse Neuromuscular Junction</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/7/1725?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Block of neurotransmitter receptors at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) has been shown to trigger upregulation of the number of synaptic vesicles released (quantal content, QC), a response termed homeostatic synaptic plasticity. The mechanism underlying this plasticity is not known. Here, we used selective toxins to demonstrate that block of α1-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) at the NMJ of male and female mice triggers the upregulation of QC. Reduction of current flow through nAChRs, induced by drugs with antagonist activity, demonstrated that reduction in synaptic current &lt;i&gt;per se&lt;/i&gt; does not trigger upregulation of QC. These data led to the remarkable conclusion that disruption of synaptic transmission is not sensed to trigger upregulation of QC. During studies of the effect of partial block of nAChRs on QC, we observed a small but reproducible increase in the decay kinetics of miniature synaptic currents. The change in kinetics was correlated with the increase in QC and raises the possibility that a change in postsynaptic nAChR conformation may be associated with the presynaptic increase in QC. We propose that, in addition to functioning in synaptic transmission, ionotropic muscle nicotonic nAChRs may serve as signaling molecules that participate in synaptic plasticity. Because nAChRs have been implicated in a number of disease states, the finding that nAChRs may be involved in triggering synaptic plasticity could have wide-reaching implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The signals that initiate synaptic plasticity of the nervous system are still incompletely understood. Using the mouse neuromuscular junction as a model synapse, we studied how block of neurotransmitter receptors is sensed to trigger synaptic plasticity. Our studies led to the surprising conclusion that neither changes in synaptic current nor spiking of the presynaptic or postsynaptic cell are sensed to initiate synaptic plasticity. Instead, postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), in addition to functioning in synaptic transmission, may serve as signaling molecules that trigger synaptic plasticity. Because nAChRs have been implicated in a number of disease states, the finding that they may mediate synaptic plasticity has broad implications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Single Bursts of Individual Granule Cells Functionally Rearrange Feedforward Inhibition</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/7/1711?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The sparse single-spike activity of dentate gyrus granule cells (DG GCs) is punctuated by occasional brief bursts of 3–7 action potentials. It is well-known that such presynaptic bursts in individual mossy fibers (MFs; axons of granule cells) are often able to discharge postsynaptic CA3 pyramidal cells due to powerful short-term facilitation. However, what happens in the CA3 network after the passage of a brief MF burst, before the arrival of the next burst or solitary spike, is not understood. Because MFs innervate significantly more CA3 interneurons than pyramidal cells, we focused on unitary MF responses in identified interneurons in the seconds-long postburst period, using paired recordings in rat hippocampal slices. Single bursts as short as 5 spikes in &amp;lt;30 ms in individual presynaptic MFs caused a sustained, large increase (tripling) in the amplitude of the unitary MF-EPSCs for several seconds in ivy, axo-axonic/chandelier and basket interneurons. The postburst unitary MF-EPSCs in these feedforward interneurons reached amplitudes that were even larger than the MF-EPSCs during the bursts in the same cells. In contrast, no comparable postburst enhancement of MF-EPSCs could be observed in pyramidal cells or nonfeedforward interneurons. The robust postburst increase in MF-EPSCs in feedforward interneurons was associated with significant shortening of the unitary synaptic delay and large downstream increases in disynaptic IPSCs in pyramidal cells. These results reveal a new cell type-specific plasticity that enables even solitary brief bursts in single GCs to powerfully enhance inhibition at the DG-CA3 interface in the seconds-long time-scales of interburst intervals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The hippocampal formation is a brain region that plays key roles in spatial navigation and learning and memory. The first stage of information processing occurs in the dentate gyrus, where principal cells are remarkably quiet, discharging low-frequency single action potentials interspersed with occasional brief bursts of spikes. Such bursts, in particular, have attracted a lot of attention because they appear to be critical for efficient coding, storage, and recall of information. We show that single bursts of a few spikes in individual granule cells result in seconds-long potentiation of excitatory inputs to downstream interneurons. Thus, while it has been known that bursts powerfully discharge (&quot;detonate&quot;) hippocampal excitatory cells, this study clarifies that they also regulate inhibition during the interburst intervals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Loss of Balance between Striatal Feedforward Inhibition and Corticostriatal Excitation Leads to Tremor</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/7/1699?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) exert powerful inhibitory control over the striatum and are hypothesized to balance the massive excitatory cortical and thalamic input to this structure. We recorded neuronal activity in the dorsolateral striatum and globus pallidus (GP) concurrently with the detailed movement kinematics of freely behaving female rats before and after selective inhibition of FSI activity using IEM-1460 microinjections. The inhibition led to the appearance of episodic rest tremor in the body part that depended on the somatotopic location of the injection within the striatum. The tremor was accompanied by coherent oscillations in the local field potential (LFP). Individual neuron activity patterns became oscillatory and coherent in the tremor frequency. Striatal neurons, but not GP neurons, displayed additional temporal, nonoscillatory correlations. The subsequent reduction in the corticostriatal input following muscimol injection to the corresponding somatotopic location in the primary motor cortex led to disruption of the tremor and a reduction of the LFP oscillations and individual neuron's phase-locked activity. The breakdown of the normal balance of excitation and inhibition in the striatum has been shown previously to be related to different motor abnormalities. Our results further indicate that the balance between excitatory corticostriatal input and feedforward FSI inhibition is sufficient to break down the striatal decorrelation process and generate oscillations resulting in rest tremor typical of multiple basal ganglia disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) play a key role in normal striatal processing by exerting powerful inhibitory control over the network. FSI malfunctions have been associated with abnormal processing of information within the striatum that leads to multiple movement disorders. Here, we study the changes in neuronal activity and movement kinematics following selective inhibition of these neurons. The injections led to the appearance of episodic rest tremor, accompanied by coherent oscillations in neuronal activity, which was reversed following corticostriatal inhibition. These results suggest that the balance between corticostriatal excitation and feedforward FSI inhibition is crucial for maintaining the striatal decorrelation process, and that its breakdown leads to the formation of oscillations resulting in rest tremor typical of multiple basal ganglia disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cortical Connections Position Primate Area 25 as a Keystone for Interoception, Emotion, and Memory</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/7/1677?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The structural and functional integrity of subgenual cingulate area 25 (A25) is crucial for emotional expression and equilibrium. A25 has a key role in affective networks, and its disruption has been linked to mood disorders, but its cortical connections have yet to be systematically or fully studied. Using neural tracers in rhesus monkeys, we found that A25 was densely connected with other ventromedial and posterior orbitofrontal areas associated with emotions and homeostasis. A moderate pathway linked A25 with frontopolar area 10, an area associated with complex cognition, which may regulate emotions and dampen negative affect. Beyond the frontal lobe, A25 was connected with auditory association areas and memory-related medial temporal cortices, and with the interoceptive-related anterior insula. A25 mostly targeted the superficial cortical layers of other areas, where broadly dispersed terminations comingled with modulatory inhibitory or disinhibitory microsystems, suggesting a dominant excitatory effect. The architecture and connections suggest that A25 is the consummate feedback system in the PFC. Conversely, in the entorhinal cortex, A25 pathways terminated in the middle-deep layers amid a strong local inhibitory microenvironment, suggesting gating of hippocampal output to other cortices and memory storage. The graded cortical architecture and associated laminar patterns of connections suggest how areas, layers, and functionally distinct classes of inhibitory neurons can be recruited dynamically to meet task demands. The complement of cortical connections of A25 with areas associated with memory, emotion, and somatic homeostasis provide the circuit basis to understand its vulnerability in psychiatric and neurologic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Integrity of the prefrontal subgenual cingulate cortex is crucial for healthy emotional function. Subgenual area 25 (A25) is mostly linked with other prefrontal areas associated with emotion in a dense network positioned to recruit large fields of cortex. In healthy states, A25 is associated with internal states, autonomic function, and transient negative affect. Constant hyperactivity in A25 is a biomarker for depression in humans and may trigger extensive activation in its dominant connections with areas associated with emotions and internal balance. A pathway between A25 and frontopolar area 10 may provide a critical link to regulate emotions and dampen persistent negative affect, which may be explored for therapeutic intervention in depression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: BMP/SMAD Pathway Promotes Neurogenesis of Midbrain Dopaminergic Neurons In Vivo and in Human Induced Pluripotent and Neural Stem Cells</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/7/1662?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The embryonic formation of midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; provides critical guidelines for the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; differentiation of mDA neurons from stem cells, which are currently being developed for Parkinson's disease cell replacement therapy. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/SMAD inhibition is routinely used during early steps of stem cell differentiation protocols, including for the generation of mDA neurons. However, the function of the BMP/SMAD pathway for &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; specification of mammalian mDA neurons is virtually unknown. Here, we report that BMP5/7-deficient mice (&lt;i&gt;Bmp5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;; &lt;i&gt;Bmp7&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;) lack mDA neurons due to reduced neurogenesis in the mDA progenitor domain. As molecular mechanisms accounting for these alterations in &lt;i&gt;Bmp5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;; &lt;i&gt;Bmp7&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mutants, we have identified expression changes of the BMP/SMAD target genes MSX1/2 (msh homeobox 1/2) and SHH (sonic hedgehog). Conditionally inactivating SMAD1 in neural stem cells of mice &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Smad1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Nes&lt;/sup&gt;) hampered the differentiation of progenitor cells into mDA neurons by preventing cell cycle exit, especially of TH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;SOX6&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (tyrosine hydroxylase, SRY-box 6) and TH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;GIRK2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily-J member-6) substantia nigra neurons. BMP5/7 robustly increased the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells and induced neural stem cells to mDA neurons by up to threefold. In conclusion, we have identified BMP/SMAD signaling as a novel critical pathway orchestrating essential steps of mammalian mDA neurogenesis &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; that balances progenitor proliferation and differentiation. Moreover, we demonstrate the potential of BMPs to improve the generation of stem-cell-derived mDA neurons &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, highlighting the importance of sequential BMP/SMAD inhibition and activation in this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We identify bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/SMAD signaling as a novel essential pathway regulating the development of mammalian midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of this process. BMP5/7 regulate MSX1/2 (msh homeobox 1/2) and SHH (sonic hedgehog) expression to direct mDA neurogenesis. Moreover, the BMP signaling component SMAD1 controls the differentiation of mDA progenitors, particularly to substantia nigra neurons, by directing their cell cycle exit. Importantly, BMP5/7 increase robustly the differentiation of human induced pluripotent and induced neural stem cells to mDA neurons. BMP/SMAD are routinely inhibited in initial stages of stem cell differentiation protocols currently being developed for Parkinson's disease cell replacement therapies. Therefore, our findings on opposing roles of the BMP/SMAD pathway during &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; mDA neurogenesis might improve these procedures significantly.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sensorimotor Functional and Structural Networks after Intracerebral Stem Cell Grafts in the Ischemic Mouse Brain</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/7/1648?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Past investigations on stem cell-mediated recovery after stroke have limited their focus on the extent and morphological development of the ischemic lesion itself over time or on the integration capacity of the stem cell graft &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt;. However, an assessment of the long-term functional and structural improvement &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; is essential to reliably quantify the regenerative capacity of cell implantation after stroke. We induced ischemic stroke in nude mice and implanted human neural stem cells (H9 derived) into the ipsilateral cortex in the acute phase. Functional and structural connectivity changes of the sensorimotor network were noninvasively monitored using magnetic resonance imaging for 3 months after stem cell implantation. A sharp decrease of the functional sensorimotor network extended even to the contralateral hemisphere, persisting for the whole 12 weeks of observation. In mice with stem cell implantation, functional networks were stabilized early on, pointing to a paracrine effect as an early supportive mechanism of the graft. This stabilization required the persistent vitality of the stem cells, monitored by bioluminescence imaging. Thus, we also observed deterioration of the early network stabilization upon vitality loss of the graft after a few weeks. Structural connectivity analysis showed fiber-density increases between the cortex and white matter regions occurring predominantly on the ischemic hemisphere. These fiber-density changes were nearly the same for both study groups. This motivated us to hypothesize that the stem cells can influence, via early paracrine effect, the functional networks, while observed structural changes are mainly stimulated by the ischemic event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In recent years, research on strokes has made a shift away from a focus on immediate ischemic effects and towards an emphasis on the long-range effects of the lesion on the whole brain. Outcome improvements in stem cell therapies also require the understanding of their influence on the whole-brain networks. Here, we have longitudinally and noninvasively monitored the structural and functional network alterations in the mouse model of focal cerebral ischemia. Structural changes of fiber-density increases are stimulated in the endogenous tissue without further modulation by the stem cells, while functional networks are stabilized by the stem cells via a paracrine effect. These results will help decipher the underlying networks of brain plasticity in response to cerebral lesions and offer clues to unravelling the mystery of how stem cells mediate regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Abdominal Vagal Afferents Modulate the Brain Transcriptome and Behaviors Relevant to Schizophrenia</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/7/1634?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reduced activity of vagal efferents has long been implicated in schizophrenia and appears to be responsible for diminished parasympathetic activity and associated peripheral symptoms such as low heart rate variability and cardiovascular complications in affected individuals. In contrast, only little attention has been paid to the possibility that impaired afferent vagal signaling may be relevant for the disorder's pathophysiology as well. The present study explored this hypothesis using a model of subdiaphragmatic vagal deafferentation (SDA) in male rats. SDA represents the most complete and selective vagal deafferentation method existing to date as it leads to complete disconnection of all abdominal vagal afferents while sparing half of the abdominal vagal efferents. Using next-generation mRNA sequencing, we show that SDA leads to brain transcriptional changes in functional networks annotating with schizophrenia. We further demonstrate that SDA induces a hyperdopaminergic state, which manifests itself as increased sensitivity to acute amphetamine treatment and elevated accumbal levels of dopamine and its major metabolite, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid. Our study also shows that SDA impairs sensorimotor gating and the attentional control of associative learning, which were assessed using the paradigms of prepulse inhibition and latent inhibition, respectively. These data provide converging evidence suggesting that the brain transcriptome, dopamine neurochemistry, and behavioral functions implicated in schizophrenia are subject to visceral modulation through abdominal vagal afferents. Our findings may encourage the further establishment and use of therapies for schizophrenia that are based on vagal interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The present work provides a better understanding of how disrupted vagal afferent signaling can contribute to schizophrenia-related brain and behavioral abnormalities. More specifically, it shows that subdiaphragmatic vagal deafferentation (SDA) in rats leads to (1) brain transcriptional changes in functional networks related to schizophrenia, (2) increased sensitivity to dopamine-stimulating drugs and elevated dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens, and (3) impairments in sensorimotor gating and the attentional control of associative learning. These findings may encourage the further establishment of novel therapies for schizophrenia that are based on vagal interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Diversity and Connectivity of Layer 5 Somatostatin-Expressing Interneurons in the Mouse Barrel Cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/7/1622?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Inhibitory interneurons represent 10–15% of the neurons in the somatosensory cortex, and their activity powerfully shapes sensory processing. Three major groups of GABAergic interneurons have been defined according to developmental, molecular, morphological, electrophysiological, and synaptic features. Dendritic-targeting somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SST-INs) have been shown to display diverse morphological, electrophysiological, and molecular properties and activity patterns &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. However, the correlation between these properties and SST-IN subtype is unclear. In this study, we aimed to correlate the morphological diversity of layer 5 (L5) SST-INs with their electrophysiological and molecular diversity in mice of either sex. Our morphological analysis demonstrated the existence of three subtypes of L5 SST-INs with distinct electrophysiological properties: T-shaped Martinotti cells innervate L1, and are low-threshold spiking; fanning-out Martinotti cells innervate L2/3 and the lower half of L1, and show adapting firing patterns; non-Martinotti cells innervate L4, and show a quasi-fast spiking firing pattern. We estimated the proportion of each subtype in L5 and found that T-shaped Martinotti, fanning-out Martinotti, and Non-Martinotti cells represent ~10, ~50, and ~40% of L5 SST-INs, respectively. Last, we examined the connectivity between the three SST-IN subtypes and L5 pyramidal cells (PCs). We found that L5 T-shaped Martinotti cells inhibit the L1 apical tuft of nearby PCs; L5 fanning-out Martinotti cells also inhibit nearby PCs but they target the dendrite mainly in L2/3. On the other hand, non-Martinotti cells inhibit the dendrites of L4 neurons while avoiding L5 PCs. Our data suggest that morphologically distinct SST-INs gate different excitatory inputs in the barrel cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Morphologically diverse layer 5 SST-INs show different patterns of activity in behaving animals. However, little is known about the abundance and connectivity of each morphological type and the correlation between morphological subtype and spiking properties. We demonstrate a correlation between the morphological and electrophysiological diversity of layer 5 SST-INs. Based on these findings we built a classifier to infer the abundance of each morphological subtype. Last, using paired recordings combined with morphological analysis, we investigated the connectivity of each morphological subtype. Our data suggest that, by targeting different cell types and cellular compartments, morphologically diverse SST-INs might gate different excitatory inputs in the mouse barrel cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: LRRK2 G2019S Induces Anxiety/Depression-like Behavior before the Onset of Motor Dysfunction with 5-HT1A Receptor Upregulation in Mice</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/7/1611?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mutations in the &lt;i&gt;leucine-rich repeat kinase 2&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;LRRK2&lt;/i&gt;) gene are the most common genetic cause of Parkinson's disease (PD). The neuropathology of &lt;i&gt;LRRK2&lt;/i&gt; mutation-related PD, including increased dopaminergic neurodegeneration and Lewy bodies, is indistinguishable from that of idiopathic PD. The subtle nonmotor phenotypes of &lt;i&gt;LRRK2&lt;/i&gt; mutation-related PD have not been fully evaluated. In the present study, we examined anxiety/depression-like behaviors and accompanying neurochemical changes in differently aged transgenic (Tg) mice expressing human mutant LRRK2 G2019S. Through multiple behavioral tests, including light–dark test, elevated plus maze, sucrose preference test, forced swimming test, and tail-suspension test, we found that anxiety/depression-like behavior appeared in middle-aged (43–52 weeks) Tg mice before the onset of PD-like motor dysfunction. These behavioral tests were performed using both male and female mice, and there were no sex-related differences in behavioral changes in the middle-aged Tg mice. Along with behavioral changes, serotonin levels also significantly declined in the hippocampus of Tg mice. Additionally, increases in the expression of the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor (5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt;R) grew more significant with aging and were detected in the hippocampus, amygdala, and dorsal raphe nucleus. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; study using the serotonergic RN46A and hippocampal HT22 cells showed that 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt;R upregulation was related to enhanced expression of LRRK2 G2019S and was attenuated by the LRRK2 inhibitor LRRK2-IN-1. Wild-type LRRK2 had no significant effect on 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt;R transcription. The present study provides the first &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; evidence demonstrating abnormal regulation of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt;R along with the manifestation of anxiety/depression-like, nonmotor symptom in PD related to LRRK2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, is clinically characterized by motor dysfunctions. In most cases, various nonmotor symptoms present several years before the onset of the classical motor features of PD and severely affect the quality of life of patients. Here, we demonstrate the causative role of &lt;i&gt;leucine-rich repeat kinase 2&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;LRRK2&lt;/i&gt;), a common PD-linked mutation, in the development of anxiety/depression-like behaviors. We found that age-dependent 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor upregulation in the hippocampus, amygdala, and dorsal raphe nucleus is accompanied by the expression of the &lt;i&gt;LRRK2&lt;/i&gt; mutant phenotype. Our findings demonstrating a potential mechanism for nonmotor psychiatric symptoms produced by &lt;i&gt;LRRK2&lt;/i&gt; mutation suggest that directly targeting the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor can improve the therapeutic efficacy of drugs for PD-associated depression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Gain control with A-type potassium current: IA as a switch between divisive and subtractive inhibition. (arXiv:1802.04794v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04794</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurons process information by transforming barrages of synaptic inputs into
spiking activity. Synaptic inhibition suppresses the output firing activity of
a neuron, and is commonly classified as having a subtractive or divisive effect
on a neuron's output firing activity. Subtractive inhibition can narrow the
range of inputs that evoke spiking activity by eliminating responses to
non-preferred inputs. Divisive inhibition is a form of gain control: it
modifies firing rates while preserving the range of inputs that evoke firing
activity. Since these two &quot;modes&quot; of inhibition have distinct impacts on neural
coding, it is important to understand the biophysical mechanisms that
distinguish these response profiles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use simulations and mathematical analysis of a neuron model to find the
specific conditions for which inhibitory inputs have subtractive or divisive
effects. We identify a novel role for the A-type Potassium current (IA). In our
model, this fast-activating, slowly- inactivating outward current acts as a
switch between subtractive and divisive inhibition. If IA is strong (large
maximal conductance) and fast (activates on a time-scale similar to spike
initiation), then inhibition has a subtractive effect on neural firing. In
contrast, if IA is weak or insufficiently fast-activating, then inhibition has
a divisive effect on neural firing. We explain these findings using dynamical
systems methods to define how a spike threshold condition depends on synaptic
inputs and IA.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that neurons can &quot;self-regulate&quot; the gain control
effects of inhibition via combinations of synaptic plasticity and/or modulation
of the conductance and kinetics of A-type Potassium channels. This novel role
for IA would add flexibility to neurons and networks, and may relate to recent
observations of divisive inhibitory effects on neurons in the nucleus of the
solitary tract.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A Data-Driven Approach to Extract Connectivity Structures from Diffusion Tensor Imaging Data. (arXiv:1802.04353v1 [cs.CE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04353</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is an effective tool for the analysis of
structural brain connectivity in normal development and in a broad range of
brain disorders. However efforts to derive inherent characteristics of
structural brain networks have been hampered by the very high dimensionality of
the data, relatively small sample sizes, and the lack of widely acceptable
connectivity-based regions of interests (ROIs). Typical approaches have focused
either on regions defined by standard anatomical atlases that do not
incorporate anatomical connectivity, or have been based on voxel-wise analysis,
which results in loss of statistical power relative to structure-wise
connectivity analysis. In this work, we propose a novel, computationally
efficient iterative clustering method to generate connectivity-based
whole-brain parcellations that converge to a stable parcellation in a few
iterations. Our algorithm is based on a sparse representation of the whole
brain connectivity matrix, which reduces the number of edges from around a half
billion to a few million while incorporating the necessary spatial constraints.
We show that the resulting regions in a sense capture the inherent connectivity
information present in the data, and are stable with respect to initialization
and the randomization scheme within the algorithm. These parcellations provide
consistent structural regions across the subjects of population samples that
are homogeneous with respect to anatomic connectivity. Our method also derives
connectivity structures that can be used to distinguish between population
samples with known different structural connectivity. In particular, new
results in structural differences for different population samples such as
Females vs Males, Normal Controls vs Schizophrenia, and different age groups in
Normal Controls are also shown.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04255</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Technology is increasingly shaping our social structures and is becoming a
driving force in altering human biology. Besides, human activities already
proved to have a significant impact on the Earth system which in turn generates
complex feedback loops between social and ecological systems. Furthermore,
since our species evolved relatively fast from small groups of hunter-gatherers
to large and technology-intensive urban agglomerations, it is not a surprise
that the major institutions of human society are no longer fit to cope with the
present complexity. In this note we draw foundational parallelisms between
neurophysiological systems and ICT-enabled social systems, discussing how
frameworks rooted in biology and physics could provide heuristic value in the
design of evolutionary systems relevant to politics and economics. In this
regard we highlight how the governance of emerging technology (i.e.
nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology, and cognitive science),
and the one of climate change both presently confront us with a number of
connected challenges. In particular: historically high level of inequality; the
co-existence of growing multipolar cultural systems in an unprecedentedly
connected world; the unlikely reaching of the institutional agreements required
to deviate abnormal trajectories of development. We argue that wise general
solutions to such interrelated issues should embed the deep understanding of
how to elicit mutual incentives in the socio-economic subsystems of Earth
system in order to jointly concur to a global utility function (e.g. avoiding
the reach of planetary boundaries and widespread social unrest). We leave some
open questions on how techno-social systems can effectively learn and adapt
with respect to our understanding of geopolitical complexity.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Raju Kalaivani, Raju Reema, Narayanaswamy Srinivasan&lt;/p&gt;

The conserved function of protein phosphorylation, catalysed by members of protein kinase superfamily, is regulated in different ways in different kinase families. Further, differences in activating triggers, cellular localisation, domain architecture and substrate specificity between kinase families are also well known. While the transfer of γ-phosphate from ATP to the hydroxyl group of Ser/Thr/Tyr is mediated by a conserved Asp, the characteristic functional and regulatory sites are specialized at the level of families or sub-families. Such family-specific sites of functional specialization are unknown for most families of kinases. In this work, we systematically identify the family-specific residue features by comparing the extent of conservation of physicochemical properties, Shannon entropy and statistical probability of residue distributions between families of kinases. An integrated discriminatory score, which combines these three features, is developed to demarcate the functionally specialized sites in a kinase family from other sites. We achieved an area under ROC curve of 0.992 for the discrimination of kinase families. Our approach was extensively tested on well-studied families CDK and MAPK, wherein specific protein interaction sites and substrate recognition sites were successfully detected (&lt;i&gt;p-value&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). We also find that the known family-specific oncogenic driver mutation sites were scored high by our method. The method was applied to all known kinases encompassing 107 families from diverse eukaryotic organisms leading to a comprehensive list of family-specific functional sites. Apart from other uses, our method facilitates identification of specific protein interaction sites and drug target sites in a kinase family.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KpZ8t2QWVnI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0347-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is thought to organize items in working memory and this organizational role may also influence long-term memory. To causally test this hypothesized role of DLPFC in long-term memory formation, we used -burst noninvasive stimulation (TBS) to modulate DLPFC involvement in a memory task that assessed the influence of active short-term retrieval on later memory. Human subjects viewed three objects on a grid and then either actively retrieved or passively restudied one object’s location after a brief delay. Long-term memory for the other objects was assessed after a delay to evaluate the beneficial role of active short-term retrieval on subsequent memory for the entire set of object locations. We found that DLPFC TBS had no significant effects on short-term memory. In contrast, DLPFC TBS impaired long-term memory selectively in the active-retrieval condition but not in the passive-restudy condition. These findings are consistent with the hypothesized contribution of DLPFC to the organizational processes operative during active short-term retrieval that influence long-term memory, although other regions that were not stimulated could provide similar contributions. Notably, active-retrieval and passive-restudy conditions were intermixed, and therefore nonspecific influences of stimulation were well controlled. These results suggest that DLPFC is causally involved in organizing event information during active retrieval to support coherent long-term memory formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Visual perception includes ventral and dorsal stream processes. However, it is still unclear whether the former is predominantly related to conscious and the latter to nonconscious visual perception as argued in the literature. In this study upright and inverted body postures were rendered either visible or invisible under continuous flash suppression (CFS), while brain activity of human participants was measured with functional MRI (fMRI). Activity in the ventral body-sensitive areas was higher during visible conditions. In comparison, activity in the posterior part of the bilateral intraparietal sulcus (IPS) showed a significant interaction of stimulus orientation and visibility. Our results provide evidence that dorsal stream areas are less associated with visual awareness.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Impact of NMDA Receptor Overexpression on Cerebellar Purkinje Cell Activity and Motor Learning</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0270-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;In many brain regions involved in learning NMDA receptors (NMDARs) act as coincidence detectors of pre- and postsynaptic activity, mediating Hebbian plasticity. Intriguingly, the parallel fiber (PF) to Purkinje cell (PC) input in the cerebellar cortex, which is critical for procedural learning, shows virtually no postsynaptic NMDARs. Why is this? Here, we address this question by generating and testing independent transgenic lines that overexpress NMDAR containing the type 2B subunit (NR2B) specifically in PCs. PCs of the mice that show larger NMDA-mediated currents than controls at their PF input suffer from a blockage of long-term potentiation (LTP) at their PF-PC synapses, while long-term depression (LTD) and baseline transmission are unaffected. Moreover, introducing NMDA-mediated currents affects cerebellar learning in that phase-reversal of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) is impaired. Our results suggest that under physiological circumstances PC spines lack NMDARs postsynaptically at their PF input so as to allow LTP to contribute to motor learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Identification of Neurotensin Receptor Expressing Cells in the Ventral Tegmental Area across the Lifespan</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0191-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Neurotensin (Nts) promotes activation of dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) via incompletely understood mechanisms. Nts can signal via the G protein-coupled Nts receptors 1 and 2 (NtsR1 and NtsR2), but the lack of methods to detect NtsR1- and NtsR2-expressing cells has limited mechanistic understanding of Nts action. To overcome this challenge, we generated dual recombinase mice that express FlpO-dependent Cre recombinase in NtsR1 or NtsR2 cells. This strategy permitted temporal control over recombination, such that we could identify NtsR1- or NtsR2-expressing cells and determine whether their distributions differed between the developing and adult brain. Using this system, we found that NtsR1 is transiently expressed in nearly all DA neurons and in many non-DA neurons in the VTA during development. However, NtsR1 expression is more restricted within the adult brain, where only two thirds of VTA DA neurons expressed NtsR1. By contrast, NtsR2 expression remains constant throughout lifespan, but it is predominantly expressed within glia. Anterograde tract tracing revealed that NtsR1 is expressed by mesolimbic, not mesocortical DA neurons, suggesting that VTA NtsR1 neurons may represent a functionally unique subset of VTA DA neurons. Collectively, this work reveals a cellular mechanism by which Nts can directly engage NtsR1-expressing DA neurons to modify DA signaling. Going forward, the dual recombinase strategy developed here will be useful to selectively modulate NtsR1- and NtsR2-expressing cells and to parse their contributions to Nts-mediated behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04118</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Consider a large number $n$ of neurons, each being connected to approximately
$N$ other ones, chosen at random. When a neuron spikes, which occurs randomly
at some rate depending on its electric potential, its potential is set to a
minimum value $v_{min}$, and this initiates, after a small delay, two fronts on
the (linear) dendrites of all the neurons to which it is connected. Fronts move
at constant speed. When two fronts (on the dendrite of the same neuron)
collide, they annihilate. When a front hits the soma of a neuron, its potential
is increased by a small value $w_n$. Between jumps, the potentials of the
neurons are assumed to drift in $[v_{min},\infty)$, according to some
well-posed ODE. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a heuristically
derived mean-field limit of the system when $n,N \to \infty$ with $w_n \simeq
N^{-1/2}$. We make use of some recent versions of the results of Deuschel and
Zeitouni \cite{dz} concerning the size of the longest increasing subsequence of
an i.i.d. collection of points in the plan. We also study, in a very particular
case, a slightly different model where the neurons spike when their potential
reach some maximum value $v_{max}$, and find an explicit formula for the
(heuristic) mean-field limit.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04069</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When searching a target in a natural scene, both the target's visual
properties and similarity to the background influence whether (and how fast)
humans are able to find it. However, thus far it has been unclear whether
searchers adjust the dynamics of their eye movements (e.g., fixation durations,
saccade amplitudes) to the target they search for. In our experiment
participants searched natural scenes for six artificial targets with different
spatial frequency throughout eight consecutive sessions. High-spatial frequency
targets led to smaller saccade amplitudes and shorter fixation durations than
low-spatial frequency targets if target identity was known before the trial. If
a saccade was programmed in the same direction as the previous saccade
(saccadic momentum), fixation durations and successive saccade amplitudes were
not influenced by target type. Visual saliency and empirical density at the
endpoints of saccadic momentum saccades were comparatively low, indicating that
these saccades were less selective. Our results demonstrate that searchers
adjust their eye movement dynamics to the search target in a sensible fashion,
since low-spatial frequencies are visible farther into the periphery than
high-spatial frequencies. Additionally, the saccade direction specificity of
our effects suggests a separation of saccades into a default scanning mechanism
and a selective, target-dependent mechanism.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The brain in conjunction with the body is able to adapt to new environments
and perform multiple behaviors through reuse of neural resources and transfer
of existing behavioral traits. Although mechanisms that underlie this ability
are not well known, they are largely attributed to neuromodulation. In this
work, we demonstrate that an agent can be multifunctional using the same
sensory and motor systems across behaviors, in the absence of modulatory
mechanisms. Further, we lay out the different levels at which neural reuse can
occur through a dynamical filtering of the brain-body-environment system's
operation - structural network, autonomous dynamics, and transient dynamics.
Notably, transient dynamics reuse can only be explained by studying the
brain-body-environment system as a whole and not just the brain. The
multifunctional agent we present here demonstrates neural reuse at all three
levels.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Time series produced by dynamical systems as frequently the case in
neuroscience are rarely stationary but often exhibit quite abrupt changes due
to bifurcations or other dynamical phenomena. A plethora of methods for
detecting such changes in time series statistics, commonly called change point
analysis, have been developed over the years, in addition to test criteria to
evaluate change point significance. Issues to consider when developing such
methods include computational demands, difficulties arising from either limited
amount of data or a large number of covariates, and arriving at statistical
tests with sufficient power to detect as many change points as contained in
potentially high-dimensional data sets. Here, a general method called Paired
Adaptive Regressors for Cumulative Sum (PARCS) is developed for detecting
multiple change points in multivariate time series. The method's flexibility to
incorporate useful features from other change point detection techniques is
highlighted. The advantages of PARCS over existing approaches are demonstrated
through a series of simulation experiments, followed by a real data application
to neural recordings from rat medial prefrontal cortex during learning.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Same but not alike: Structure, flexibility and energetics of domains in multi-domain proteins are influenced by the presence of other domains</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/_feLOM8p4JU/article</link>

The majority of the proteins encoded in the genomes of eukaryotes contain more than one domain. Reasons for high prevalence of multi-domain proteins in various organisms have been attributed to higher stability and functional and folding advantages over single-domain proteins. Despite these advantages, many proteins are composed of only one domain while their homologous domains are part of multi-domain proteins. In the study presented here, differences in the properties of protein domains in single-domain and multi-domain systems and their influence on functions are discussed. We studied 20 pairs of identical protein domains, which were crystallized in two forms (a) tethered to other proteins domains and (b) tethered to fewer protein domains than (a) or not tethered to any protein domain. Results suggest that tethering of domains in multi-domain proteins influences the structural, dynamic and energetic properties of the constituent protein domains. 50% of the protein domain pairs show significant structural deviations while 90% of the protein domain pairs show differences in dynamics and 12% of the residues show differences in the energetics. To gain further insights on the influence of tethering on the function of the domains, 4 pairs of homologous protein domains, where one of them is a full-length single-domain protein and the other protein domain is a part of a multi-domain protein, were studied. Analyses showed that identical and structurally equivalent functional residues show differential dynamics in homologous protein domains; though comparable dynamics between &lt;i&gt;in-silico&lt;/i&gt; generated chimera protein and multi-domain proteins were observed. From these observations, the differences observed in the functions of homologous proteins could be attributed to the presence of tethered domain. Overall, we conclude that tethered domains in multi-domain proteins not only provide stability or folding advantages but also influence pathways resulting in differences in function or regulatory properties.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_feLOM8p4JU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0194-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Rett Syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder usually caused by mutations in Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). RTT is typified by apparently normal development until 6-18 months of age, when motor and communicative skills regress and hand stereotypies, autonomic symptoms, and seizures present. Restoration of MeCP2 function selectively to astrocytes reversed several deficits in a murine model of RTT, but the mechanism of this rescue is unknown. Astrocytes carry out many essential functions required for normal brain functioning including extracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; buffering. Kir4.1, an inwardly rectifying K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel, is largely responsible for the channel-mediated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; regulation by astrocytes. Loss of function mutations in Kir4.1 in human patients results in a severe neurodevelopmental disorder termed EAST or SESAME syndrome. Here we evaluated astrocytic Kir4.1 expression in a murine model of Rett syndrome. We demonstrate by ChIP analysis that Kir4.1 is a direct molecular target of MeCP2. Astrocytes from &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt;-deficient mice express significantly less Kir4.1 mRNA and protein, which translates into a &amp;gt;50% deficiency in Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-sensitive Kir4.1-mediated currents, and impaired extracellular potassium dynamics. By examining astrocytes in isolation we demonstrate that loss of Kir4.1 is cell-autonomous. Assessment through postnatal development revealed that Kir4.1 expression in &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt;-deficient animals never reaches adult, wild-type levels, consistent with a neurodevelopmental disorder. These are the first data implicating a direct MeCP2 molecular target in astrocytes and provide novel mechanistic insight explaining a potential mechanism by which astrocytic dysfunction may contribute to RTT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Rett Syndrome (RTT) is a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 1 in 10 000-25 000 females. Mutations in Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), a transcriptional regulator, are responsible for over 95% of Rett cases. Recent work has shown that astrocytes contribute significantly to the disorder, although their contribution to this disease is not known. Here we demonstrate that the critical astrocyte K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel Kir4.1 is a novel molecular target of MeCP2. MeCP2 deficiency leads to decreased &lt;i&gt;Kcnj10&lt;/i&gt;/Kir4.1 mRNA levels, protein expression, and currents. These findings provide novel mechanistic insight and begin to elucidate the role of astrocytes in this disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Amygdala Adaptation and Temporal Dynamics of the Salience Network in Conditioned Fear: A Single-Trial fMRI Study</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0445-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Research in rodents has established the role of the amygdaloid complex in defensive responses to conditioned threat. In human imaging studies, however, activation of the amygdala by conditioned threat cues is often not observed. One hypothesis states that this finding reflects adaptation of amygdaloid responses over time. We tested this hypothesis by estimating single-trial neural responses over a large number of conditioning trials. Functional MRI was recorded from 18 participants during classical differential fear conditioning: Participants viewed oriented grayscale grating stimuli (45° or 135°) presented centrally in random order. In the acquisition block, one grating (the CS+) was paired with a noxious noise, the unconditioned stimulus (US), on 25% of trials. The other grating, denoted CS-, was never paired with the US. Consistent with previous reports, BOLD in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and insula, but not the amygdala, was heightened when viewing CS+ stimuli that were not paired with US compared to CS- stimuli. Trial-by-trial analysis showed that over the course of acquisition, activity in the amygdala attenuated. Interestingly, activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and insula also declined. Representational similarity analysis (RSA) corroborated these results, indicating that the voxel patterns evoked by CS+ and CS- in these brain regions became less distinguishable over time. Together, the present findings support the hypothesis that the lack of BOLD differences in the amygdaloid complex in many studies of classical conditioning is due to adaptation, and the adaptation effects may reflect changes in large-scale networks mediating aversive conditioning, particularly the salience network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; In neuroimaging studies of human fear conditioning, activation of the amygdala is often not observed. This problem is examined by applying single-trial fMRI analysis to a classical fear conditioning paradigm. In addition to confirming the amygdala adaptation hypothesis, we discovered that areas of the salience network, to which the amygdala belongs, co-adapted, supporting the hypothesis that the acquisition of defensive responses in humans is mediated by changes in a large-scale brain network.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Short-Term Depression of Axonal Spikes at the Mouse Hippocampal Mossy Fibers and Sodium Channel-Dependent Modulation</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0415-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Axonal spike is an important upstream process of transmitter release, which directly impacts on release probability from the presynaptic terminals. Despite the functional significance, possible activity-dependent modulation of axonal spikes has not been studied extensively, partly due to inaccessibility of the small structures of axons for electrophysiological recordings. In this study, we tested the possibility of use-dependent changes in axonal spikes at the hippocampal mossy fibers, where direct recordings from the axon terminals are readily feasible. Hippocampal slices were made from mice of either sex, and loose-patch clamp recordings were obtained from the visually identified giant mossy fiber boutons located in the stratum lucidum of the CA3 region. Stimulation of the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus elicited axonal spikes at the single bouton which occurred in all or none fashion. Unexpected from the digital nature of spike signaling, the peak amplitude of the second spikes in response to paired stimuli at 50 ms interval was slightly but reproducibly smaller than the first spikes. Repetitive stimuli at 20 Hz or 100 Hz also caused progressive use-dependent depression during the train. Notably, veratridine, an inhibitor of inactivation of sodium channels, significantly accelerated the depression with minimal effect on the initial spikes. These results suggest that sodium channels contribute to use-dependent depression of axonal spikes at the hippocampal mossy fibers, possibly by shaping the afterdepolarization (ADP) following axonal spikes. Prolonged depolarization during ADP may inactivate a fraction of sodium channels and thereby suppresses the subsequent spikes at the hippocampal mossy fibers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Spike signaling along axons is thought to highly reliable digital process. In this study, we tested the possibility of analog tuning of axonal spikes using direct recordings from single hippocampal mossy fiber terminals. We found that axonal spikes are subject to robust use-dependent short-term depression. Notably, the application of veratridine, an inhibitor of inactivation of sodium channels, selectively accelerates short-term depression with minimal effect on the initial axonal spikes. These results illustrate the novel form of short-term plasticity of axonal spikes in single axon terminal levels, and suggest that slow activating sodium channels of persistent-type (I&lt;sub&gt;NaP&lt;/sub&gt;) or resurgent types (I&lt;sub&gt;NaR&lt;/sub&gt;), different from the transient-type (I&lt;sub&gt;NaT&lt;/sub&gt;) responsible for spike generation, might be involved in modulation of paired-pulse depression of axonal spikes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Why Do Hearing Aids Fail to Restore Normal Auditory Perception?</title>
	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30032-8?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>Hearing loss is a widespread condition that is linked to declines in quality of life and mental health. Hearing aids remain the treatment of choice, but, unfortunately, even state-of-the-art devices provide only limited benefit for the perception of speech in noisy environments. While traditionally viewed primarily as a loss of sensitivity, hearing loss is also known to cause complex distortions of sound-evoked neural activity that cannot be corrected by amplification alone. This Opinion article describes the effects of hearing loss on neural activity to illustrate the reasons why current hearing aids are insufficient and to motivate the use of new technologies to explore directions for improving the next generation of devices.</content:encoded>

However, its role in stroke remains unknown. The aim of this study is to clarify the impact of GGT on stroke in a large-sized, national, standardized population cohort in Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25158-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Korea, the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) provides full-coverage health insurance service for all citizens. Using data from the NHIS, the NHIS–National Sample Cohort was designed by randomly selecting 2% of Koreans, carefully considering demographic characteristics. We analyzed eligible individuals from this standardized cohort. The Cox proportional hazards model was used for the study investigating the relationship between GGT and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

GGT was independently correlated with increased risk of stroke after adjustment for alcohol consumption and stroke risk factors (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.29–1.51). The risks of both ischemic stroke (HR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.32–1.58) and ICH (HR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.18–1.80) were significantly elevated with increasing GGT. Despite some effect modifications by sex, age, and alcohol, the risk of total stroke and ischemic stroke in association with GGT remained significant in all subgroups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

First, a case–control analysis was performed in 100 patients and the 50 controls to define the optimal cutoff values using receiver operating characteristic curves. Their sensitivity was then assessed in the other 60 patients with DOAs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The highest area under the curve (AUC) values were obtained for the SWS fragmentation and slow/mixed arousal indexes (AUC = 0.88 and 0.90, respectively). The SWS fragmentation index cutoff value of 6.8/h reached a sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 82%. The slow/mixed arousal index had a sensitivity of 94% for the 2.5/h cutoff, and 100% specificity for 6/h. Both parameters showed good interrater agreement, and their sensitivities were confirmed in the second group of patients. Combining electroencephalographic parameters and video-based behavioral analyses increased the correct classification rate up to 91.3%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Recently, we found that some parenchymal microglia in brain of HIV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; subjects without encephalitis (HIV/noE) but with varying degrees of neurocognitive impairment express CD16 and CD163, even in the absence of detectable virus production. To further our understanding of microglial activation in HIV, we investigated expression of specific genes by profiling parenchymal microglia from archival brain tissue of patients with HIVE and HIV/noE, and HIV&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25160-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Single-population microarray analyses were performed on ∼2,500 laser capture microdissected CD163&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, CD16&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, or CD68&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; MΦs/microglia per case, using terminal continuation RNA amplification and a custom-designed array platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Additionally, several neurotrophic factors were reduced in HIV infection, suggesting an additional mechanism of neuropathogenesis. The majority of transcripts altered in HIVE displayed intermediate changes in HIV/noE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Furthermore, they indicate the utility of profiling MΦs/microglia to increase our understanding of microglia function, as well as to ascertain alterations in specific pathways, genes, and potentially, encoded proteins that may be amenable to targeted treatment modalities in diseases affecting the brain.

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Auditory Brainstem Responses to Continuous Natural Speech in Human Listeners</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0441-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Speech is an ecologically essential signal, whose processing crucially involves the subcortical nuclei of the auditory brainstem, but there are few experimental options for studying these early responses in human listeners under natural conditions. While encoding of continuous natural speech has been successfully probed in the cortex with neurophysiological tools such as electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography, the rapidity of subcortical response components combined with unfavorable signal-to-noise ratios signal-to-noise ratio has prevented application of those methods to the brainstem. Instead, experiments have used thousands of repetitions of simple stimuli such as clicks, tone-bursts, or brief spoken syllables, with deviations from those paradigms leading to ambiguity in the neural origins of measured responses. In this study we developed and tested a new way to measure the auditory brainstem response (ABR) to ongoing, naturally uttered speech, using EEG to record from human listeners. We found a high degree of morphological similarity between the speech-derived ABRs and the standard click-evoked ABR, in particular, a preserved Wave V, the most prominent voltage peak in the standard click-evoked ABR. Because this method yields distinct peaks that recapitulate the canonical ABR, at latencies too short to originate from the cortex, the responses measured can be unambiguously determined to be subcortical in origin. The use of naturally uttered speech to measure the ABR allows the design of engaging behavioral tasks, facilitating new investigations of the potential effects of cognitive processes like language and attention on brainstem processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Transient Receptor Potential Channels TRPM4 and TRPC3 Critically Contribute to Respiratory Motor Pattern Formation but not Rhythmogenesis in Rodent Brainstem Circuits</title>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Transient receptor potential channel, TRPM4, the putative molecular substrate for Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated nonselective cation current (&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;CAN&lt;/sub&gt;), is hypothesized to generate bursting activity of pre-Bötzinger complex (pre-BötC) inspiratory neurons and critically contribute to respiratory rhythmogenesis. Another TRP channel, TRPC3, which mediates Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; fluxes, may be involved in regulating Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-related signaling, including affecting TRPM4/&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;CAN&lt;/sub&gt; in respiratory pre-BötC neurons. However, TRPM4 and TRPC3 expression in pre-BötC inspiratory neurons and functional roles of these channels remain to be determined. By single-cell multiplex RT-PCR, we show mRNA expression for these channels in pre-BötC inspiratory neurons in rhythmically active medullary &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; slices from neonatal rats and mice. Functional contributions were analyzed with pharmacological inhibitors of TRPM4 or TRPC3 &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; as well as in mature rodent arterially perfused &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; brainstem–spinal cord preparations. Perturbations of respiratory circuit activity were also compared with those by a blocker of &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;CAN&lt;/sub&gt;. Pharmacologically attenuating endogenous activation of TRPM4, TRPC3, or &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;CAN&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; similarly reduced the amplitude of inspiratory motoneuronal activity without significant perturbations of inspiratory frequency or variability of the rhythm. Amplitude perturbations were correlated with reduced inspiratory glutamatergic pre-BötC neuronal activity, monitored by multicellular dynamic calcium imaging &lt;i&gt;in vitro.&lt;/i&gt; In more intact circuits &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt;, the reduction of pre-BötC and motoneuronal inspiratory activity amplitude was accompanied by reduced post-inspiratory motoneuronal activity, without disruption of rhythm generation. We conclude that endogenously activated TRPM4, which likely mediates &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;CAN&lt;/sub&gt;, and TRPC3 channels in pre-BötC inspiratory neurons play fundamental roles in respiratory pattern formation but are not critically involved in respiratory rhythm generation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Fast and Slow Oscillations Recruit Molecularly-Distinct Subnetworks of Lateral Hypothalamic Neurons In Situ</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0012-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Electrical signals generated by molecularly-distinct classes of lateral hypothalamus (LH) neurons have distinct physiological consequences. For example, LH orexin neurons promote net body energy expenditure, while LH non-orexin neurons [VGAT, melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH)] drive net energy conservation. Appropriate switching between such physiologically-opposing LH outputs is traditionally thought to require cell-type-specific chemical modulation of LH firing. However, it was recently found that, &lt;i&gt;in vivo,&lt;/i&gt; the LH neurons are also physiologically exposed to electrical oscillations of different frequency bands. The role of the different physiological oscillation frequencies in firing of orexin vs non-orexin LH neurons remains unknown. Here, we used brain-slice whole-cell patch-clamp technology to target precisely-defined oscillation waveforms to individual molecularly-defined classes LH cells (orexin, VGAT, MCH, GAD65), while measuring the action potential output of the cells. By modulating the frequency of sinusoidal oscillatory input, we found that high-frequency oscillations (, 30–200 Hz) preferentially silenced the action potential output orexin&lt;sub&gt;LH&lt;/sub&gt; cells. In contrast, low frequencies (-, 0.5–7 Hz) similarly permitted outputs from different LH cell types. This differential control of orexin and non-orexin cells by oscillation frequency was mediated by cell-specific, impedance-unrelated resonance mechanisms. These results substantiate electrical oscillations as a novel input modality for cell-type-specific control of LH firing, which offers an unforeseen way to control specific cell ensembles within this highly heterogeneous neuronal cluster.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Sequences Flanking the Gephyrin-Binding Site of GlyR{beta} Tune Receptor Stabilization at Synapses</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0042-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The efficacy of synaptic transmission is determined by the number of neurotransmitter receptors at synapses. Their recruitment depends upon the availability of postsynaptic scaffolding molecules that interact with specific binding sequences of the receptor. At inhibitory synapses, gephyrin is the major scaffold protein that mediates the accumulation of heteromeric glycine receptors (GlyRs) via the cytoplasmic loop in the β-subunit (β-loop). This binding involves high- and low-affinity interactions, but the molecular mechanism of this bimodal binding and its implication in GlyR stabilization at synapses remain unknown. We have approached this question using a combination of quantitative biochemical tools and high-density single molecule tracking in cultured rat spinal cord neurons. The high-affinity binding site could be identified and was shown to rely on the formation of a 3&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;-helix C-terminal to the β-loop core gephyrin-binding motif. This site plays a structural role in shaping the core motif and represents the major contributor to the synaptic confinement of GlyRs by gephyrin. The N-terminal flanking sequence promotes lower affinity interactions by occupying newly identified binding sites on gephyrin. Despite its low affinity, this binding site plays a modulatory role in tuning the mobility of the receptor. Taken together, the GlyR β-loop sequences flanking the core-binding site differentially regulate the affinity of the receptor for gephyrin and its trapping at synapses. Our experimental approach thus bridges the gap between thermodynamic aspects of receptor-scaffold interactions and functional receptor stabilization at synapses in living cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The number of receptors at a synapse defines the strength of signal transmission and is directly dependent on the binding of the receptors to scaffold proteins beneath the synaptic membrane. In this study, we discovered the molecular basis for a dual-affinity interaction between GlyRs and gephyrin scaffolds. We identified GlyR sequences that are specifically required for high- and low-affinity binding. Using single-molecule tracking in cultured neurons both sites were shown to act as elements regulating the diffusion and trapping of GlyRs as a result of the altered receptor-scaffold binding. The novelty of our approach lies in the unique combination of biochemical data of purified proteins with single molecule diffusion analysis. It exemplifies that binding properties can be extracted by analyzing the diffusion behavior of molecules in living cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0362-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;GCaMP is an optogenetic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensor widely used for monitoring neuronal activities but the precise physiological implications of GCaMP signals remain to be further delineated among functionally distinct synapses. The &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; neuromuscular junction (NMJ), a powerful genetic system for studying synaptic function and plasticity, consists of tonic and phasic glutamatergic and modulatory aminergic motor terminals of distinct properties. We report a first simultaneous imaging and electric recording study to directly contrast the frequency characteristics of GCaMP signals of the three synapses for physiological implications. Different GCaMP variants were applied in genetic and pharmacological perturbation experiments to examine the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx and clearance processes underlying the GCaMP signal. Distinct mutational and drug effects on GCaMP signals indicate differential roles of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels, encoded by genes including &lt;i&gt;paralytic&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Shaker&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Shab&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;ether-a-go-go&lt;/i&gt;, in excitability control of different motor terminals. Moreover, the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; handling properties reflected by the characteristic frequency dependence of the synaptic GCaMP signals were determined to a large extent by differential capacity of mitochondria-powered Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; clearance mechanisms. Simultaneous focal recordings of synaptic activities further revealed that GCaMPs were ineffective in tracking the rapid dynamics of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx that triggers transmitter release, especially during low-frequency activities, but more adequately reflected cytosolic residual Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; accumulation, a major factor governing activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. These results highlight the vast range of GCaMP response patterns in functionally distinct synaptic types and provide relevant information for establishing basic guidelines for the physiological interpretations of pre-synaptic GCaMP signals from in situ imaging studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; GCaMPs are a family of genetically encoded Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; indicators widely employed in monitoring neuronal circuit activities. This study employed a genetic model system to enable simultaneous recording of presynaptic GCaMP signals in three functionally distinct types of synapses side by side. The results reveal how differential control by membrane excitability and mitochondria-powered Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; clearance mechanisms shape distinct residual Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics in different synaptic boutons during repetitive firing. Our results demonstrate a wide range of GCaMP response patterns in relation to different types of synaptic transmission and thereby provide background information for proper interpretations of GCaMP signals in a variety of synaptic activities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: A Neural Circuit Mechanism for the Involvements of Dopamine in Effort-Related Choices: Decay of Learned Values, Secondary Effects of Depletion, and Calculation of Temporal Difference Error</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0021-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Dopamine has been suggested to be crucially involved in effort-related choices. Key findings are that dopamine depletion (i) changed preference for a high-cost-large-reward option to a low-cost-small-reward option, (ii) but not when the large-reward option was also low-cost or the small-reward option gave no reward, (iii) while increasing the latency in all the cases but only transiently, and that (iv) antagonism of either dopamine D1 or D2 receptors also specifically impaired selection of the high-cost-large-reward option. The underlying neural circuit mechanisms remain unclear. Here we show that findings (i)-(iii) can be explained by the dopaminergic representation of temporal-difference-reward-prediction-error, whose mechanisms have now become clarified, if (1) the synaptic strengths storing the values of actions mildly decay in time and (2) the obtained-reward-representing excitatory input to dopamine neurons increases after dopamine depletion. The former is potentially caused by background neural activity-induced weak synaptic plasticity, and the latter is assumed to occur through post-depletion increase of neural activity in the pedunculopontine nucleus, where neurons representing obtained reward exist and presumably send excitatory projections to dopamine neurons. We further show that finding (iv), which is nontrivial given the suggested distinct functions of the D1 and D2 corticostriatal pathways, can also be explained if we additionally assume a proposed mechanism of temporal-difference-reward-prediction-error calculation, in which the D1 and D2 pathways encode the values of actions with a temporal difference. These results suggest a possible circuit mechanism for the involvements of dopamine in effort-related choices, and simultaneously, provide implications for the mechanisms of temporal-difference-reward-prediction-error calculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Depletion of dopamine (DA) or antagonism of either of the two major types of DA receptors was all shown to impair effortful actions to obtain large rewards while sparing reward-seeking or effort-exertion per se. DA has thus been proposed to play specific roles in reward-oriented effort exertion. However, underlying neural circuit mechanisms, and their relations with another popular role of DA, encoding of temporal-difference-reward-prediction-error (TD-RPE), remain unclear. We show that the experimental results suggesting DA's involvements in effort-related choices can be consistently explained by the DA's encoding of TD-RPE if assuming a mild decay of learned values, an increase of obtained-reward-representing input to DA neurons as a secondary effect of DA depletion, and a proposed circuit mechanism of TD-RPE calculation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Respiration-Entrained Brain Rhythms Are Global but Often Overlooked</title>
	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30031-6?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>We revisit recent evidence showing that nasal respiration entrains oscillations at the same frequency as breathing in several regions of the rodent brain. Moreover, respiration modulates the amplitude of a specific gamma sub-band (70–120Hz), most prominently in frontal regions. Since rodents often breathe at delta and theta frequencies, we caution that previous studies on delta and theta power and their cross-regional synchrony, as well as on delta–gamma and theta–gamma coupling, may have detected the respiration-entrained rhythm and respiration–gamma coupling.</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Cytosolic ATP Relieves Voltage-Dependent Inactivation of T-Type Calcium Channels and Facilitates Excitability of Neurons in the Rat Central Medial Thalamus</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0016-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The central medial nucleus (CeM) is a part of the intralaminar thalamus, which is involved in the control of arousal and sensory processing. However, ionic conductances and mechanisms that regulate the activity of the CeM are not well studied. Here, we used &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiology in acute brain slices from adolescent rats to demonstrate that T-type calcium currents (T-currents) are prominent in the majority of the studied CeM neurons and are critical determinants of low-threshold calcium spikes (LTS), which in turn regulate excitability of these neurons. Using an adenosine-three-phosphate (ATP)-free internal solution decreased T-current density and induced a profound hyperpolarizing shift in steady-state inactivation curves while voltage-dependent activation kinetics were spared. Furthermore, selective pharmacological blockade of T-channels or use of an ATP-free solution reduced both tonic action potential frequency and rebound burst firing in CeM neurons. Our results indicate that T-channels are critical regulators of a thalamocortical circuit output and suggest that cytosolic ATP could be an endogenous regulatory mechanism in which T-channels may functionally gate sensory transmission and arousal &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Recent studies have revealed the important impact of the central medial nucleus of thalamus (CeM) on control of arousal, yet the key ion channel that regulates its excitability has not been well studied. Here, we used patch-clamp recordings from acute brain slices to demonstrate for the first time that T-channels play an important supportive role in regulation of excitability of rat CeM neurons. Additionally, we found that T-channels not only play a major role in shaping the output of the CeM, but also that activity is strongly regulated by cytosolic adenosine-three-phosphate (ATP). Hence, ATP may be an endogenous regulatory mechanism in which T-channels can functionally gate sensory transmission and arousal &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Global White Matter Diffusion Characteristics Predict Longitudinal Cognitive Change Independently of Amyloid Status in Clinically Normal Older Adults</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy031/4841692?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;White matter degradation has been proposed as one possible explanation for age-related cognitive decline. In the present study, we examined 2 main questions: 1) Do diffusion characteristics predict longitudinal change in cognition independently or synergistically with amyloid status? 2) Are the effects of diffusion characteristics on longitudinal cognitive change tract-specific or global in nature? Cognitive domains of executive function, episodic memory, and processing speed were measured annually (mean follow-up = 3.93 ± 1.25 years). Diffusion tensor imaging and Pittsburgh Compound-B positron emission tomography were performed at baseline in 265 clinically normal older adults (aged 63–90). Tract-specific diffusion was measured as the mean fractional anisotropy (FA) for 9 major white matter tracts. Global diffusion was measured as the mean FA across the 9 white matter tracts. Linear mixed models demonstrated independent, rather than synergistic, effects of global FA and amyloid status on cognitive decline. After controlling for amyloid status, lower global FA was associated with worse longitudinal performance in episodic memory and processing speed, but not executive function. After accounting for global FA, none of the individual tracts predicted a significant change in cognitive performance. These findings suggest that global, rather than tract-specific, diffusion characteristics predict longitudinal cognitive decline independently of amyloid status.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;This study aimed to determine whether prenatal stress, measured by the number of stressful life events during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, might relate to mood dysregulation and altered brain structure in young adulthood. Participants included 93 young adults from a community-based birth cohort from the Czech Republic. Information on prenatal stress exposure was collected from their mothers in 1990−1992. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and mood-related data were collected from the young adults in 2015. MRI analyses focused on overall gray matter (GM) volume and GM volume of cortical regions previously associated with major depression. Higher prenatal stress predicted more mood dysregulation, lower overall GM volume, and lower GM volume in mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and precuneus in young adulthood. We observed no prenatal stress by sex interactions for any of the relations. We conclude that prenatal stress is an important risk factor that relates to worse mood states and altered brain structure in young adulthood irrespective of sex. Our results point to the importance and long-lasting effects of prenatal programming and suggest that offspring of mothers who went through substantial stress during pregnancy might benefit from early intervention that would reduce the odds of mental illness in later life.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Differential Dependence of GABAergic and Glutamatergic Neurons on Glia for the Establishment of Synaptic Transmission</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy029/4841690?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;In the mammalian cortex, GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons represent 2 major neuronal classes, which establish inhibitory and excitatory synapses, respectively. Despite differences in their anatomy, physiology and developmental origin, both cell types require support from glial cells, particularly astrocytes, for their growth and survival. Recent experiments indicate that glutamatergic neurons also depend on astrocytes for synapse formation. However, it is not clear if the same holds true for GABAergic neurons. By studying highly pure GABAergic cell cultures, established through fluorescent activated cell sorting, we find that purified GABAergic neurons are smaller and have reduced survival, nevertheless they establish robust synaptic transmission in the absence of glia. Support from glial cells reverses morphological and survival deficits, but does little to alter synaptic transmission. In contrast, in cultures of purified glutamatergic neurons, morphological development, survival and synaptic transmission are collectively dependent on glial support. Thus, our results demonstrate a fundamental difference in the way GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons depend on glia for the establishment of synaptic transmission, a finding that has important implications for our understanding of how neuronal networks develop.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: System-Specific Patterns of Thalamocortical Connectivity in Early Brain Development as Revealed by Structural and Functional MRI</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy028/4841689?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The normal development of thalamocortical connections plays a critical role in shaping brain connectivity in the prenatal and postnatal periods. Recent studies using advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques in neonates and infants have shown that abnormal thalamocortical connectivity is associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, all these studies have focused on a single neuroimaging modality, overlooking the dynamic relationship between structure and function at this early stage. Here, we study the relationship between structural and functional thalamocortical connectivity patterns derived from healthy full-term infants scanned with diffusion-weighted MRI and resting-state functional MRI within the first weeks of life (mean gestational age = 39.3 ± 1.2 weeks; age at scan = 24.2 ± 7.9 days). Our results show that while there is, in general, good spatial agreement between both MRI modalities, there are regional variations that are system-specific: regions involving primary-sensory cortices exhibit greater structural/functional overlap, whereas higher-order association areas such as temporal and posterior parietal cortices show divergence in spatial patterns of each modality. This variability illustrates the complementarity of both modalities and highlights the importance of multimodal approaches.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy021/4841687?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Cortical spreading depolarization (SD) is the electrophysiological event underlying migraine aura, and a critical contributor to secondary damage after brain injury. Experimental models of SD have been used for decades in migraine and brain injury research; however, they are highly invasive and often cause primary tissue injury, diminishing their translational value. Here we present a non-invasive method to trigger SDs using light-induced depolarization in transgenic mice expressing channelrhodopsin-2 in neurons (Thy1-ChR2-YFP). Focal illumination (470 nm, 1–10 mW) through intact skull using an optical fiber evokes power-dependent steady extracellular potential shifts and local elevations of extracellular [K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] that culminate in an SD when power exceeds a threshold. Using the model, we show that homozygous mice are significantly more susceptible to SD (i.e., lower light thresholds) than heterozygous ChR2 mice. Moreover, we show SD susceptibility differs significantly among cortical divisions (motor, whisker barrel, sensory, visual, in decreasing order of susceptibility), which correlates with relative channelrhodopsin-2 expression. Furthermore, the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 blocks the transition to SD without diminishing extracellular potential shifts. Altogether, our data show that the optogenetic SD model is highly suitable for examining physiological or pharmacological modulation of SD in acute and longitudinal studies.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Electrical Stimulation Modulates High {gamma} Activity and Human Memory Performance</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0369-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Direct electrical stimulation of the brain has emerged as a powerful treatment for multiple neurological diseases, and as a potential technique to enhance human cognition. Despite its application in a range of brain disorders, it remains unclear how stimulation of discrete brain areas affects memory performance and the underlying electrophysiological activities. Here, we investigated the effect of direct electrical stimulation in four brain regions known to support declarative memory: hippocampus (HP), parahippocampal region (PH) neocortex, prefrontal cortex (PF), and lateral temporal cortex (TC). Intracranial EEG recordings with stimulation were collected from 22 patients during performance of verbal memory tasks. We found that high  (62–118 Hz) activity induced by word presentation was modulated by electrical stimulation. This modulatory effect was greatest for trials with &quot;poor&quot; memory encoding. The high  modulation correlated with the behavioral effect of stimulation in a given brain region: it was negative, i.e., the induced high  activity was decreased, in the regions where stimulation decreased memory performance, and positive in the lateral TC where memory enhancement was observed. Our results suggest that the effect of electrical stimulation on high  activity induced by word presentation may be a useful biomarker for mapping memory networks and guiding therapeutic brain stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy027/4840635?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;We recently reported that right-side dominance of the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) in self-body recognition (proprioceptive illusion) task emerges during adolescence in typical human development. Here, we extend this finding by demonstrating that functional lateralization to the right IPL also develops during adolescence in another self-body (specifically a self-face) recognition task. We collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 60 right-handed healthy children (8–11 years), adolescents (12–15 years), and adults (18–23 years; 20 per group) while they judged whether a presented face was their own (Self) or that of somebody else (Other). We also analyzed fMRI data collected while they performed proprioceptive illusion task. All participants performed self-face recognition with high accuracy. Among brain regions where self-face-related activity (Self vs. Other) developed, only right IPL activity developed predominantly for self-face processing, with no substantial involvement in other-face processing. Adult-like right-dominant use of IPL emerged during adolescence, but was not yet present in childhood. Adult-like common activation between the tasks also emerged during adolescence. Adolescents showing stronger right-lateralized IPL activity during illusion also showed this during self-face recognition. Our results suggest the importance of the right IPL in neuronal processing of information associated with one’s own body in typically developing humans.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Unlike visual signals, sound can reach the ears from any direction, and the ability to localize sounds from all directions is essential for survival in a natural environment. Previous studies have largely focused on the space in front of a subject that is also covered by vision and were often limited to measuring spatial tuning along the horizontal (azimuth) plane. As a result, we know relatively little about how the auditory cortex responds to sounds coming from spatial locations outside the frontal space where visual information is unavailable. By mapping single-neuron responses to the full spatial field in awake marmoset (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Callithrix jacchus&lt;/span&gt;), an arboreal animal for which spatial processing is vital in its natural habitat, we show that spatial receptive fields in several auditory areas cover all spatial locations. Several complementary measures of spatial tuning showed that neurons were tuned to both frontal space and rear space (outside the coverage of vision), as well as the space above and below the horizontal plane. Together, these findings provide valuable new insights into the representation of all spatial locations by primate auditory cortex.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: PDK1 Deficit Impairs the Development of the Dentate Gyrus in Mice</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;3-Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) is crucial for the development of the dentate gyrus (DG), the first gateway receiving afferent inputs from the entorhinal cortex. However, the role of PDK1 in DG development is unclear. In the present study, by crossing &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Pdk1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;fl/fl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice with the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Emx1-cre&lt;/span&gt; line, we identified that the ablation of PDK1 disrupted the development of DG via decreasing the proliferation, and increasing the differentiation of dentate neural progenitor cells, downregulating AKT activity and upregulating GSK3β signaling. Moreover, PDK1 deletion disrupted the distribution of Reelin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells and decreased the level of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Reelin&lt;/span&gt; mRNA which may contribute to the defective migration of progenitor cells and the disrupted radial glial scaffolds. Furthermore, the inhibition of GSK3β activity partially restored the decreased proliferation of primary neural stem cells in vitro. Taken together, our data indicated that the ablation of PDK1 affected the proliferation and differentiation of dentate neural progenitor cells in mice.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Cerebellar Functional Connectivity in Term- and Very Preterm-Born Infants</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy023/4840632?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Cortical resting state networks have been consistently identified in infants using resting state-functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Comparable studies in adults have demonstrated cerebellar components of well-established cerebral networks. However, there has been limited investigation of early cerebellar functional connectivity. We acquired non-sedated rs-fMRI data in the first week of life in 57 healthy, term-born infants and at term-equivalent postmenstrual age in 20 very preterm infants (mean birth gestational age 27 ± 2 weeks) without significant cerebral or cerebellar injury. Seed correlation analyses were performed using regions of interests spanning the cortical and subcortical gray matter and cerebellum. Parallel analyses were performed using rs-fMRI data acquired in 100 healthy adults. Our results demonstrate that cortico-cerebellar functional connectivity is well-established by term. Intra- and cortico-cerebellar functional connectivity were largely similar in infants and adults. However, infants showed more functional connectivity structure within the cerebellum, including stronger homotopic correlations and more robust anterior–posterior anticorrelations. Prematurity was associated with reduced correlation magnitudes, but no alterations in intra- and cortico-cerebellar functional connectivity topography. These results add to the growing evidence that the cerebellum plays an important role in shaping early brain development during infancy.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Environmental Influences on Infant Cortical Thickness and Surface Area</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy020/4840631?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA) vary widely between individuals and are associated with intellectual ability and risk for various psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions. Factors influencing this variability remain poorly understood, but the radial unit hypothesis, as well as the more recent supragranular cortex expansion hypothesis, suggests that prenatal and perinatal influences may be particularly important. In this report, we examine the impact of 17 major demographic and obstetric history variables on interindividual variation in CT and SA in a unique sample of 805 neonates who received MRI scans of the brain around 2 weeks of age. Birth weight, postnatal age at MRI, gestational age at birth, and sex emerged as important predictors of SA. Postnatal age at MRI, paternal education, and maternal ethnicity emerged as important predictors of CT. These findings suggest that individual variation in infant CT and SA is explained by different sets of environmental factors with neonatal SA more strongly influenced by sex and obstetric history and CT more strongly influenced by socioeconomic and ethnic disparities. Findings raise the possibility that interventions aimed at reducing disparities and improving obstetric outcomes may alter prenatal/perinatal cortical development.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Rab23 Regulates Radial Migration of Projection Neurons via N-cadherin</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy018/4840630?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Radial migration of cortical projection neurons is a prerequisite for shaping a distinct multilayered cerebral cortex during mammalian corticogenesis. Members of Rab GTPases family were reported to regulate radial migration. Here, in vivo conditional knockout or in utero knockdown (KD) of Rab23 in mice neocortex causes aberrant polarity and halted migration of cortical projection neurons. Further investigation of the underlying mechanism reveals down-regulation of N-cadherin in the Rab23-deficient neurons, which is a cell adhesion protein previously known to modulate radial migration. (Shikanai M, Nakajima K, Kawauchi T. 2011. N-cadherin regulates radial glial fiber-dependent migration of cortical locomoting neurons. Commun Integr Biol. 4:326–330.) Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) also decreases the expression of N-cadherin, implicating an upstream effect of ERK1/2 on N-cadherin and also suggesting a link between Rab23 and ERK1/2. Further biochemical studies show that silencing of Rab23 impedes activation of ERK1/2 via perturbed platelet-derived growth factor-alpha (PDGFRα) signaling. Restoration of the expression of Rab23 or N-cadherin in Rab23-KD neurons could reverse neuron migration defects, indicating that Rab23 modulates migration through N-cadherin. These studies suggest that cortical neuron migration is mediated by a molecular hierarchy downstream of Rab23 via N-cadherin.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The biological basis of consciousness is one of the most challenging and fundamental questions in 21st century science. A related pursuit aims to identify the neural correlates and causes of unconsciousness. We review current trends in the investigation of physiological, pharmacological, and pathological states of unconsciousness at the level of large-scale functional brain networks. We focus on the roles of brain connectivity, repertoire, graph-theoretical techniques, and neural dynamics in understanding the functional brain disconnections and reduced complexity that appear to characterize these states.</content:encoded>

Genetic networks from post-mortem human brain revealed 84 partner genes co-expressed with &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;DRD2&lt;/span&gt;. Moreover, eight functional single nucleotide polymorphisms combined into a polygenic co-expression index (PCI) predicted co-expression of this &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;DRD2&lt;/span&gt; network and were associated with prefrontal function in humans. Here, we investigated the non-linear association of the PCI with behavioral and Working Memory (WM) related brain response to pharmacological D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Rs stimulation. Fifty healthy volunteers took part in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, functional MRI (fMRI) study with bromocriptine and performed the N-Back task. The PCI by drug interaction was significant on both WM behavioral scores (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; = 0.046) and related prefrontal activity (all corrected &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) using a polynomial PCI model. Non-linear responses under placebo were reversed by bromocriptine administration. fMRI results on placebo were replicated in an independent sample of 50 participants who did not receive drug administration (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; = 0.034). These results match earlier evidence in non-human primates and confirm the physiological relevance of this &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;DRD2&lt;/span&gt; co-expression network. Results show that in healthy subjects, different alleles evaluated as an ensemble are associated with non-linear prefrontal responses. Therefore, brain response to a dopaminergic drug may depend on a complex system of allelic patterns associated with &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;DRD2&lt;/span&gt; co-expression.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Distinct Neocortical Progenitor Lineages Fine-tune Neuronal Diversity in a Layer-specific Manner</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy019/4836788?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;How the variety of neurons that organize into neocortical layers and functional areas arises is a central question in the study of cortical development. While both intrinsic and extrinsic cues are known to influence this process, whether distinct neuronal progenitor groups contribute to neuron diversity and allocation is poorly understood. Using in vivo genetic fate-mapping combined with whole-cell patch clamp recording, we show that the firing pattern and apical dendritic morphology of excitatory neurons in layer 4 of the barrel cortex are specified in part by their neural precursor lineage. Further, we show that separate precursors contribute to unique features of barrel cortex topography including the intralaminar position and thalamic innervation of the neurons they generate. Importantly, many of these lineage-specified characteristics are different from those previously measured for pyramidal neurons in layers 2–3 of the frontal cortex. Collectively, our data elucidate a dynamic temporal program in neuronal precursors that fine-tunes the properties of their progeny according to the lamina of destination.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Distinct Beta-band Oscillatory Circuits Underlie Corticospinal Gain Modulation</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy016/4836787?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Rhythmic synchronization of neurons is known to affect neuronal interactions. In the motor system, oscillatory power fluctuations modulate corticospinal excitability. However, previous research addressing phase-specific gain modulation in the motor system has resulted in contradictory findings. It remains unclear how many time windows of increased responsiveness each oscillatory cycle provides. Moreover, we still lack conclusive evidence as to whether the motor cortex entails an intrinsic response modulation along the rhythm cycle, as shown for spinal neurons. We investigated this question with single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation over the primary motor cortex at rest. Application of near-motor threshold stimuli revealed a frequency- and phase-specific gain modulation at both cortical and spinal level, independent of the spontaneous oscillatory power fluctuations at each level. We detected bilateral sensorimotor circuits in the lower beta-band (14–17 Hz) and unilateral corticospinal circuits in the upper beta-band (20–24 Hz). These findings provide novel evidence that intrinsic activity in the human motor cortex modulates input gain along the beta oscillatory cycle within distinct circuits. In accordance with periodic alternations of synchronous hyper- and depolarization, increased neuronal responsiveness occurred once per oscillatory beta cycle. This information may lead to new brain state-dependent and circuit-specific interventions for targeted neuromodulation.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Eye Movement Reinstatement and Neural Reactivation During Mental Imagery</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy014/4836786?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Half a century ago, Donald Hebb posited that mental imagery is a constructive process that emulates perception. Specifically, Hebb claimed that visual imagery results from the reactivation of neural activity associated with viewing images. He also argued that neural reactivation and imagery benefit from the re-enactment of eye movement patterns that first occurred at viewing (fixation reinstatement). To investigate these claims, we applied multivariate pattern analyses to functional MRI (fMRI) and eye tracking data collected while healthy human participants repeatedly viewed and visualized complex images. We observed that the specificity of neural reactivation correlated positively with vivid imagery and with memory for stimulus image details. Moreover, neural reactivation correlated positively with fixation reinstatement, meaning that image-specific eye movements accompanied image-specific patterns of brain activity during visualization. These findings support the conception of mental imagery as a simulation of perception, and provide evidence consistent with the supportive role of eye movement in neural reactivation.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Frontoparietal Activity Interacts With Task-Evoked Changes in Functional Connectivity</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy011/4836785?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Flexible interactions between brain regions enable neural systems to adaptively transfer and process information. However, the neural substrates that regulate adaptive communications between brain regions are understudied. In this human fMRI study, we investigated this issue by tracking time-varying, task-evoked changes in functional connectivity between localized occipitotemporal regions while participants performed different tasks on the same visually presented stimuli. We found that functional connectivity between ventral temporal and the primary visual regions selectively increased during the processing of task-relevant information. Further, additional task demands selectively strengthen these targeted connectivity patterns. To identify candidate regions that contribute to this increase in inter-regional coupling, we regressed the task-specific time-varying connectivity strength between primary visual and occipitotemporal regions against voxel-wise activity patterns elsewhere in the brain. This allowed us to identify a set of frontal and parietal regions whose activity increased as a function of task-evoked functional connectivity. These results suggest that frontoparietal regions may provide top-down biasing signals to influence task-specific interactions between brain regions.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>
