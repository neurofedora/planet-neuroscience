	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Comparison of methods for rhythm analysis of complex animals’ acoustic signals</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/T27mpkMvTu4/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Lara S. Burchardt, Mirjam Knörnschild&lt;/p&gt;

Analyzing the rhythm of animals’ acoustic signals is of interest to a growing number of researchers: evolutionary biologists want to disentangle how these structures evolved and what patterns can be found, and ecologists and conservation biologists aim to discriminate cryptic species on the basis of parameters of acoustic signals such as temporal structures. Temporal structures are also relevant for research on vocal production learning, a part of which is for the animal to learn a temporal structure. These structures, in other words, these rhythms, are the topic of this paper. How can they be investigated in a meaningful, comparable and universal way? Several approaches exist. Here we used five methods to compare their suitability and interpretability for different questions and datasets and test how they support the reproducibility of results and bypass biases. Three very different datasets with regards to recording situation, length and context were analyzed: two social vocalizations of Neotropical bats (multisyllabic, medium long isolation calls of &lt;i&gt;Saccopteryx bilineata&lt;/i&gt;, and monosyllabic, very short isolation calls of &lt;i&gt;Carollia perspicillata)&lt;/i&gt; and click trains of sperm whales, &lt;i&gt;Physeter macrocephalus&lt;/i&gt;. Techniques to be compared included Fourier analysis with a newly developed goodness-of-fit value, a generate-and-test approach where data was overlaid with varying artificial beats, and the analysis of inter-onset-intervals and calculations of a normalized Pairwise Variability Index (nPVI). We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the methods and we also show suggestions on how to best visualize rhythm analysis results. Furthermore, we developed a decision tree that will enable researchers to select a suitable and comparable method on the basis of their data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/T27mpkMvTu4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: YTHDF2 promotes mitotic entry and is regulated by cell cycle mediators</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/IIrJs4b23Q8/article</link>

The &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-methyladenosine (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) modification regulates mRNA stability and translation. Here, we show that transcriptomic m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification can be dynamic and the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A reader protein YTH &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-methyladenosine RNA binding protein 2 (YTHDF2) promotes mRNA decay during cell cycle. Depletion of YTHDF2 in HeLa cells leads to the delay of mitotic entry due to overaccumulation of negative regulators of cell cycle such as Wee1-like protein kinase (WEE1). We demonstrate that WEE1 transcripts contain m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification, which promotes their decay through YTHDF2. Moreover, we found that YTHDF2 protein stability is dependent on cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) activity. Thus, CDK1, YTHDF2, and WEE1 form a feedforward regulatory loop to promote mitotic entry. We further identified Cullin 1 (CUL1), Cullin 4A (CUL4A), damaged DNA-binding protein 1 (DDB1), and S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2) as components of E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes that mediate YTHDF2 proteolysis. Our study provides insights into how cell cycle mediators modulate transcriptomic m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification, which in turn regulates the cell cycle.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/IIrJs4b23Q8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro: Neural Isolation of the Olfactory Bulbs Severely Impairs Taste-Guided Behavior to Normally Preferred, But Not Avoided, Stimuli</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/2/ENEURO.0026-20.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Here we systematically tested the hypothesis that motivated behavioral responsiveness to preferred and avoided taste compounds is relatively independent of the olfactory system in mice whose olfactory bulbs (main and accessory) were surgically disconnected from the rest of the brain [bulbotomy (BULBx)]. BULBx was confirmed histologically as well as functionally with the buried food test. In brief access taste tests, animals received 10-s trials of various concentrations of a taste compound delivered quasirandomly. BULBx C57BL/6 (B6) mice displayed severely blunted concentration-dependent licking for the disaccharide sucrose, the maltodextrin Maltrin, and the fat emulsion Intralipid relative to their sham-operated controls (SHAM B6). Licking for the noncaloric sweetener saccharin was also blunted by bulbotomy, but less so. As expected, mice lacking a functional &quot;sweet&quot; receptor [T1R2+T1R3 knockout (KO)] displayed concentration-dependent responsiveness to Maltrin and severely attenuated licking to sucrose. Like in B6 mice, responsiveness to both stimuli was exceptionally curtailed by bulbotomy. In contrast to these deficits in taste-guided behavior for unconditionally preferred stimuli, BULBx in B6 and KO mice did not alter concentration-dependent decreases for the representative avoided stimuli quinine and citric acid. Nor did it temper the intake of and preference for high concentrations of affectively positive stimuli when presented in long-term (23-h) two-bottle tests, demonstrating that the surgery does not lead to a generalized motivational deficit. Collectively, these behavioral results demonstrate that specific aspects of taste-guided ingestive motivation are profoundly disturbed by eliminating the anatomic connections between the main/accessory olfactory bulbs and the rest of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess real‐world effectiveness of initial treatment with newer compared to injectable disease‐modifying therapies (DMTs) on disease activity in pediatric MS and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a cohort study of children with MS/CIS followed at 12 clinics in the US Network of Pediatric MS Centers, who received initial therapy with newer (fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide, natalizumab, rituximab, ocrelizumab) or injectable (interferon‐β, glatiramer acetate) DMTs. Propensity scores (PS) were computed including pre‐identified confounders. Relapse rate while on initial DMT was modeled with negative binomial regression, adjusted for PS‐quintile. Time to new/enlarging T2 hyperintense and gadolinium‐enhancing lesions on MRI brain were modeled with midpoint survival analyses, adjusted for PS‐quintile.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;741 children began therapy before 18 years, 197 with newer and 544 with injectable DMTs. Those started on newer DMTs were older (15.2 vs. injectable 14.4 years, p=0.001) and less likely to have a monofocal presentation. In PS‐quintile adjusted analysis, those on newer DMTs had lower relapse rate than those on injectables (rate ratio 0.45, 95%CI 0.29‐0.70, p&amp;lt;0.001; rate difference 0.27, 0.14‐0.40, p=0.004). One would need to treat with newer over injectable DMTs for 3.7 person‐years to prevent one relapse. Those started on newer DMTs had lower rate of new/enlarging T2 (HR 0.51, 0.36‐0.72, p&amp;lt;0.001) and gadolinium‐enhancing lesions (HR 0.38, 0.23‐0.63, p&amp;lt;0.001) than those on injectables.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial treatment of pediatric MS/CIS with newer DMTs led to better disease activity control compared to injectables, supporting greater effectiveness of newer therapies. Long‐term safety data for newer DMTs are required.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Analogy is core to human cognition. It allows us to solve problems based on
prior experience, it governs the way we conceptualize new information, and it
even influences our visual perception. The importance of analogy to humans has
made it an active area of research in the broader field of artificial
intelligence, resulting in data-efficient models that learn and reason in
human-like ways. While analogy and deep learning have generally been considered
independently of one another, the integration of the two lines of research
seems like a promising step towards more robust and efficient learning
techniques. As part of the first steps towards such an integration, we
introduce the Analogical Matching Network; a neural architecture that learns to
produce analogies between structured, symbolic representations that are largely
consistent with the principles of Structure-Mapping Theory.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03541</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The search for a scientific theory of consciousness should result in theories
that are falsifiable. However, here we show that falsification is especially
problematic for theories of consciousness. We formally describe the standard
experimental setup for testing these theories. Based on a theory's application
to some physical system, such as the brain, testing requires comparing a
theory's predicted experience (given some internal observables of the system
like brain imaging data) with an inferred experience (using report or
behavior). If there is a mismatch between inference and prediction, a theory is
falsified. We show that if inference and prediction are independent, it follows
that any minimally informative theory of consciousness is automatically
falsified. This is deeply problematic since the field's reliance on report or
behavior to infer conscious experiences implies such independence, so this
fragility affects many contemporary theories of consciousness. Furthermore, we
show that if inference and prediction are strictly dependent, it follows that a
theory is unfalsifiable. This affects theories which claim consciousness to be
determined by report or behavior. Finally, we explore possible ways out of this
dilemma.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03438</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Customisation in food properties is a challenging task involving optimisation
of the production process with the demand to support computational creativity
which is geared towards ensuring the presence of alternatives. This paper
addresses the personalisation of beer properties in the specific case of craft
beers where the production process is more flexible. We investigate the problem
by using three swarm intelligence and evolutionary computation techniques that
enable brewers to map physico-chemical properties to target organoleptic
properties to design a specific brew. While there are several tools, using the
original mathematical and chemistry formulas, or machine learning models that
deal with the process of determining beer properties based on the
pre-determined quantities of ingredients, the next step is to investigate an
automated quantitative ingredient selection approach. The process is
illustrated by a number of experiments designing craft beers where the results
are investigated by &quot;cloning&quot; popular commercial brands based on their known
properties. Algorithms performance is evaluated using accuracy, efficiency,
reliability, population-diversity, iteration-based improvements and solution
diversity. The proposed approach allows for the discovery of new recipes,
personalisation and alternative high-fidelity reproduction of existing ones.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We study the attribution problem [28] for deep networks applied to perception
tasks. For vision tasks, attribution techniques attribute the prediction of a
network to the pixels of the input image. We propose a new technique called
\emph{Blur Integrated Gradients}. This technique has several advantages over
other methods. First, it can tell at what scale a network recognizes an object.
It produces scores in the scale/frequency dimension, that we find captures
interesting phenomena. Second, it satisfies the scale-space axioms [14], which
imply that it employs perturbations that are free of artifact. We therefore
produce explanations that are cleaner and consistent with the operation of deep
networks. Third, it eliminates the need for a 'baseline' parameter for
Integrated Gradients [31] for perception tasks. This is desirable because the
choice of baseline has a significant effect on the explanations. We compare the
proposed technique against previous techniques and demonstrate application on
three tasks: ImageNet object recognition, Diabetic Retinopathy prediction, and
AudioSet audio event identification.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Diagnosing problems in Internet-scale services remains particularly difficult
and costly for both content providers and ISPs. Because the Internet is
decentralized, the cause of such problems might lie anywhere between an
end-user's device and the service datacenters. Further, the set of possible
problems and causes is not known in advance, making it impossible in practice
to train a classifier with all combinations of problems, causes and locations.
In this paper, we explore how different machine learning techniques can be used
for Internet-scale root cause analysis using measurements taken from end-user
devices. We show how to build generic models that (i) are agnostic to the
underlying network topology, (ii) do not require to define the full set of
possible causes during training, and (iii) can be quickly adapted to diagnose
new services. Our solution, DiagNet, adapts concepts from image processing
research to handle network and system metrics. We evaluate DiagNet with a
multi-cloud deployment of online services with injected faults and emulated
clients with automated browsers. We demonstrate promising root cause analysis
capabilities, with a recall of 73.9% including causes only being introduced at
inference time.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The binary neural network, largely saving the storage and computation, serves
as a promising technique for deploying deep models on resource-limited devices.
However, the binarization inevitably causes severe information loss, and even
worse, its discontinuity brings difficulty to the optimization of the deep
network. To address these issues, a variety of algorithms have been proposed,
and achieved satisfying progress in recent years. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive survey of these algorithms, mainly categorized into the native
solutions directly conducting binarization, and the optimized ones using
techniques like minimizing the quantization error, improving the network loss
function, and reducing the gradient error. We also investigate other practical
aspects of binary neural networks such as the hardware-friendly design and the
training tricks. Then, we give the evaluation and discussions on different
tasks, including image classification, object detection and semantic

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Self-Adjusting Evolutionary Algorithms for Multimodal Optimization. (arXiv:2004.03266v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03266</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent theoretical research has shown that self-adjusting and self-adaptive
mechanisms can provably outperform static settings in evolutionary algorithms
for binary search spaces. However, the vast majority of these studies focuses
on unimodal functions which do not require the algorithm to flip several bits
simultaneously to make progress. In fact, existing self-adjusting algorithms
are not designed to detect local optima and do not have any obvious benefit to
cross large Hamming gaps.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We suggest a mechanism called stagnation detection that can be added as a
module to existing evolutionary algorithms (both with and without prior
self-adjusting algorithms). Added to a simple (1+1) EA, we prove an expected
runtime on the well-known Jump benchmark that corresponds to an asymptotically
optimal parameter setting and outperforms other mechanisms for multimodal
optimization like heavy-tailed mutation. We also investigate the module in the
context of a self-adjusting (1+$\lambda$) EA and show that it combines the
previous benefits of this algorithm on unimodal problems with more efficient
multimodal optimization.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore the limitations of the approach, we additionally present an
example where both self-adjusting mechanisms, including stagnation detection,
do not help to find a beneficial setting of the mutation rate. Finally, we
investigate our module for stagnation detection experimentally.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03237</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The demand for more transparency of decision-making processes of deep
reinforcement learning agents is greater than ever, due to their increased use
in safety critical and ethically challenging domains such as autonomous
driving. In this empirical study, we address this lack of transparency
following an idea that is inspired by research in the field of neuroscience. We
characterize the learned representations of an agent's policy network through
its activation space and perform partial network ablations to compare the
representations of the healthy and the intentionally damaged networks. We show
that the healthy agent's behavior is characterized by a distinct correlation
pattern between the network's layer activation and the performed actions during
an episode and that network ablations, which cause a strong change of this
pattern, lead to the agent failing its trained control task. Furthermore, the
learned representation of the healthy agent is characterized by a distinct
pattern in its activation space reflecting its different behavioral stages
during an episode, which again, when distorted by network ablations, leads to
the agent failing its trained control task. Concludingly, we argue in favor of
a new perspective on artificial neural networks as objects of empirical
investigations, just as biological neural systems in neuroscientific studies,
paving the way towards a new standard of scientific falsifiability with respect
to research on transparency and interpretability of artificial neural networks.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The chance-constrained knapsack problem is a variant of the classical
knapsack problem where each item has a weight distribution instead of a
deterministic weight. The objective is to maximize the total profit of the
selected items under the condition that the weight of the selected items only
exceeds the given weight bound with a small probability of $\alpha$. In this
paper, consider problem-specific single-objective and multi-objective
approaches for the problem. We examine the use of heavy-tail mutations and
introduce a problem-specific crossover operator to deal with the
chance-constrained knapsack problem. Empirical results for single-objective
evolutionary algorithms show the effectiveness of our operators compared to the
use of classical operators. Moreover, we introduce a new effective
multi-objective model for the chance-constrained knapsack problem. We use this
model in combination with the problem-specific crossover operator in
multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to solve the problem. Our experimental
results show that this leads to significant performance improvements when using
the approach in evolutionary multi-objective algorithms such as GSEMO and
NSGA-II.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03156</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Event-based cameras are novel, efficient sensors inspired by the human vision
system, generating an asynchronous, pixel-wise stream of data. Learning from
such data is generally performed through heavy preprocessing and event
integration into images. This requires buffering of possibly long sequences and
can limit the response time of the inference system. In this work, we instead
propose to directly use events from a DVS camera, a stream of intensity changes
and their spatial coordinates. This sequence is used as the input for a novel
\emph{asynchronous} RNN-like architecture, the Input-filtering Neural ODEs
(INODE). This is inspired by the dynamical systems and filtering literature.
INODE is an extension of Neural ODEs (NODE) that allows for input signals to be
continuously fed to the network, like in filtering. The approach naturally
handles batches of time series with irregular time-stamps by implementing a
batch forward Euler solver. INODE is trained like a standard RNN, it learns to
discriminate short event sequences and to perform event-by-event online
inference. We demonstrate our approach on a series of classification tasks,
comparing against a set of LSTM baselines. We show that, independently of the
camera resolution, INODE can outperform the baselines by a large margin on the
ASL task and it's on par with a much larger LSTM for the NCALTECH task.
Finally, we show that INODE is accurate even when provided with very few
events.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Over one third of the estimated 3 million people with epilepsy in the US are
medication resistant. Responsive neurostimulation from chronically implanted
electrodes provides a promising treatment option and alternative to resective
surgery. However, determining personalized optimal stimulation parameters,
including when and where to intervene to guarantee a positive patient outcome,
is a major open challenge. Network neuroscience and control theory offer useful
tools that may guide improvements in parameter selection for control of
anomalous neural activity. Here we use a novel method to characterize dynamic
controllability across consecutive effective connectivity (EC) networks based
on regularized partial correlations between implanted electrodes during the
onset, propagation, and termination phases of thirty-four seizures. We estimate
regularized partial correlation adjacency matrices from one-second time windows
of intracranial electrocorticography recordings using the Graphical Least
Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (GLASSO). Average and modal
controllability metrics calculated from each resulting EC network track the
time-varying controllability of the brain on an evolving landscape of
conditionally dependent network interactions. We show that average
controllability increases throughout a seizure and is negatively correlated
with modal controllability throughout. Furthermore, our results support the
hypothesis that the energy required to drive the brain to a seizure-free state
from an ictal state is smallest during seizure onset; yet, we find that
applying control energy at electrodes in the seizure onset zone may not always
be energetically favorable. Our work suggests that a low-complexity model of
time-evolving controllability may offer new insights for developing and
improving control strategies targeting seizure suppression.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The objective of the cover location models is covering demand by facilities

gradual cover models, the joint cover depends on the facilities' directions. In
order to calculate the joint cover, existing models apply the partial cover by
each facility disregarding their direction. We develop a genetic algorithm to
solve the facilities location problem and also solve the problem for facilities
that can be located anywhere in the plane. The proposed modifications were
extensively tested on a case study of covering Orange County, California.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03010</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In engineering practice, it is often necessary to increase the effectiveness
of existing protective constructions for ports and coasts (i. e. breakwaters)
by extending their configuration, because existing configurations don't provide
the appropriate environmental conditions. That extension task can be considered
as an optimisation problem. In the paper, the multi-objective evolutionary
approach for the breakwaters optimisation is proposed. Also, a greedy heuristic
is implemented and included to algorithm, that allows achieving the appropriate
solution faster. The task of the identification of the attached breakwaters
optimal variant that provides the safe ship parking and manoeuvring in large
Black Sea Port of Sochi has been used as a case study. The results of the
experiments demonstrated the possibility to apply the proposed multi-objective
evolutionary approach in real-world engineering problems. It allows identifying
the Pareto-optimal set of the possible configuration, which can be analysed by
decision makers and used for final construction

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Normalization layers and activation functions are critical components in deep
neural networks that frequently co-locate with each other. Instead of designing
them separately, we unify them into a single computation graph, and evolve its
structure starting from low-level primitives. Our layer search algorithm leads
to the discovery of EvoNorms, a set of new normalization-activation layers that
go beyond existing design patterns. Several of these layers enjoy the property
of being independent from the batch statistics. Our experiments show that
EvoNorms not only excel on a variety of image classification models including
ResNets, MobileNets and EfficientNets, but also transfer well to Mask R-CNN for
instance segmentation and BigGAN for image synthesis, outperforming BatchNorm
and GroupNorm based layers by a significant margin in many cases.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02881</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural nets have been used in an elusive number of scientific disciplines.
Nevertheless, their parameterization is largely unexplored. Dense nets are the
coordinate transformations of a manifold from which the data is sampled. After
processing through a layer, the representation of the original manifold may
change. This is crucial for the preservation of its topological structure and
should therefore be parameterized correctly. We discuss a method to determine
the smallest topology preserving layer considering the data domain as abelian
connected Lie group and observe that it is decomposable into $\mathbb{R}^p
\times \mathbb {T}^q$. Persistent homology allows us to count its $k$-th
homology groups. Using K\&quot;unneth's theorem, we count the $k$-th Betti numbers.
Since we know the embedding dimension of $\mathbb{R}^p$ and $\mathcal{S}^1$, we
parameterize the bottleneck layer with the smallest possible matrix group,
which can represent a manifold with those homology groups. Resnets guarantee
smaller embeddings due to the dimension of their state space representation.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02873</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We tracked the eye movements of seven young and seven older adults performing
a conjunctive visual search task similar to that performed by two highly
trained monkeys in an original influential study of Motter and Belky (1998a,
1998b). We obtained results consistent with theirs regarding elements of
perception, selection, attention and object recognition, but we found a much
greater role played by long-range memory. A design inadequacy in the original
Motter-Belky study is not sufficient to explain such discrepancy, nor is the
high level of training of their monkeys. Perhaps monkeys and humans do not use
mnemonic resources compatibly already in basic visual search tasks, contrary to
a common expectation, further supported by cortical representation studies. We
also found age-related differences in various measures of eye movements,
consistently indicating slightly reduced conspicuity areas for the older
adults, hence, correspondingly reduced processing and memory capacities.
However, because of sample size and age differential limitations, statistically
significant differences were found only for a few variables, most notably
overall reaction times. Results reported here provide the basis for
demonstrating the formation of spiraling or circulating patterns in the eye
movement trajectories and for developing corresponding computational models and
simulations.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13880</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Convolutional neural networks have witnessed remarkable improvements in
computational efficiency in recent years. A key driving force has been the idea
of trading-off model expressivity and efficiency through a combination of
$1\times 1$ and depth-wise separable convolutions in lieu of a standard
convolutional layer. The price of the efficiency, however, is the sub-optimal
flow of information across space and channels in the network. To overcome this
limitation, we present MUXConv, a layer that is designed to increase the flow
of information by progressively multiplexing channel and spatial information in
the network, while mitigating computational complexity. Furthermore, to
demonstrate the effectiveness of MUXConv, we integrate it within an efficient
multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to search for the optimal model
hyper-parameters while simultaneously optimizing accuracy, compactness, and
computational efficiency. On ImageNet, the resulting models, dubbed MUXNets,
match the performance (75.3% top-1 accuracy) and multiply-add operations (218M)
of MobileNetV3 while being 1.6$\times$ more compact, and outperform other
mobile models in all the three criteria. MUXNet also performs well under
transfer learning and when adapted to object detection. On the ChestX-Ray 14
benchmark, its accuracy is comparable to the state-of-the-art while being
$3.3\times$ more compact and $14\times$ more efficient. Similarly, detection on
PASCAL VOC 2007 is 1.2% more accurate, 28% faster and 6% more compact compared
to MobileNetV2. Code is available from

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08517</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Convolutional neural networks are based on a huge number of trained weights.
Consequently, they are often data-greedy, sensitive to overtraining, and learn
slowly. We follow the line of research in which filters of convolutional neural
layers are determined on the basis of a smaller number of trained parameters.
In this paper, the trained parameters define a frequency spectrum which is
transformed into convolutional filters with Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform
(IDCT, the same is applied in decompression from JPEG). We analyze how
switching off selected components of the spectra, thereby reducing the number
of trained weights of the network, affects its performance. Our experiments
show that coding the filters with trained DCT parameters leads to improvement
over traditional convolution. Also, the performance of the networks modified
this way decreases very slowly with the increasing extent of switching off
these parameters. In some experiments, a good performance is observed when even
99.9% of these parameters are switched off.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04027</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We propose a physics-informed machine learning method to predict the time
average of a chaotic attractor. The method is based on the hybrid echo state
network (hESN). We assume that the system is ergodic, so the time average is
equal to the ergodic average. Compared to conventional echo state networks
(ESN) (purely data-driven), the hESN uses additional information from an
incomplete, or imperfect, physical model. We evaluate the performance of the
hESN and compare it to that of an ESN. This approach is demonstrated on a
chaotic time-delayed thermoacoustic system, where the inclusion of a physical
model significantly improves the accuracy of the prediction, reducing the
relative error from 48% to 7%. This improvement is obtained at the low extra
cost of solving two ordinary differential equations. This framework shows the
potential of using machine learning techniques combined with prior physical
knowledge to improve the prediction of time-averaged quantities in chaotic
systems.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Thin-film solar cells are predominately designed similar to a stacked
structure. Optimizing the layer thicknesses in this stack structure is crucial
to extract the best efficiency of the solar cell. The commonplace method used
in optimization simulations, such as for optimizing the optical spacer layers'
thicknesses, is the parameter sweep. Our simulation study shows that the
implementation of a meta-heuristic method like the genetic algorithm results in
a significantly faster and accurate search method when compared to the
brute-force parameter sweep method in both single and multi-layer optimization.
While other sweep methods can also outperform the brute-force method, they do
not consistently exhibit $100\%$ accuracy in the optimized results like our
genetic algorithm. We have used a well-studied P3HT-based structure to test our
algorithm. Our best-case scenario was observed to use $60.84\%$ fewer
simulations than the brute-force method.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07034</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We present a computational simulation of evolving entities that includes
symbiosis with shifting levels of selection. Evolution by natural selection
shifts from the level of the original entities to the level of the new
symbiotic entity. In the simulation, the fitness of an entity is measured by a
series of one-on-one competitions in the Immigration Game, a two-player
variation of Conway's Game of Life. Mutation, reproduction, and symbiosis are
implemented as operations that are external to the Immigration Game. Because
these operations are external to the game, we are able to freely manipulate the
operations and observe the effects of the manipulations. The simulation is
composed of four layers, each layer building on the previous layer. The first
layer implements a simple form of asexual reproduction, the second layer
introduces a more sophisticated form of asexual reproduction, the third layer
adds sexual reproduction, and the fourth layer adds symbiosis. The experiments
show that a small amount of symbiosis, added to the other layers, significantly
increases the fitness of the population. We suggest that the model may provide
new insights into symbiosis in biological and cultural evolution.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04482</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recently, more and more works have proposed to drive evolutionary algorithms
using machine learning models.Usually, the performance of such model based
evolutionary algorithms is highly dependent on the training qualities of the
adopted models.Since it usually requires a certain amount of data (i.e. the
candidate solutions generated by the algorithms) for model training, the
performance deteriorates rapidly with the increase of the problem scales, due
to the curse of dimensionality.To address this issue, we propose a
multi-objective evolutionary algorithm driven by the generative adversarial
networks (GANs).At each generation of the proposed algorithm, the parent
solutions are first classified into \emph{real} and \emph{fake} samples to
train the GANs; then the offspring solutions are sampled by the trained
GANs.Thanks to the powerful generative ability of the GANs, our proposed
algorithm is capable of generating promising offspring solutions in
high-dimensional decision space with limited training data.The proposed
algorithm is tested on 10 benchmark problems with up to 200 decision
variables.Experimental results on these test problems demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Here the authors show that autophosphorylation at Ser166 is required for RIPK1-mediated cell death and inflammation in mouse models of inflammatory pathologies, making Ser166 phosphorylation a possible biomarker for RIPK1-mediated inflammatory diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/xKAXsg1575g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transcription factors regulate multiple processes during brain development and in the adult brain, from brain patterning to differentiation and maturation of highly specialized neurons as well as establishing and maintaining the functional neuronal connectivity. The members of the zinc-finger transcription factor family Bcl11 are mainly expressed in the hematopoietic and central nervous systems regulating the expression of numerous genes involved in a wide range of pathways. In the brain Bcl11 proteins are required to regulate progenitor cell proliferation as well as differentiation, migration, and functional integration of neural cells. Mutations of the human Bcl11 genes lead to anomalies in multiple systems including neurodevelopmental impairments like intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Analyzing the Quality and Challenges of Uncertainty Estimations for Brain Tumor Segmentation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00282</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Automatic segmentation of brain tumors has the potential to enable volumetric measures and high-throughput analysis in the clinical setting. Reaching this potential seems almost achieved, considering the steady increase in segmentation accuracy. However, despite segmentation accuracy, the current methods still do not meet the robustness levels required for patient-centered clinical use. In this regard, uncertainty estimates are a promising direction to improve the robustness of automated segmentation systems. Different uncertainty estimation methods have been proposed, but little is known about their usefulness and limitations for brain tumor segmentation. In this study, we present an analysis of the most commonly used uncertainty estimation methods in regards to benefits and challenges for brain tumor segmentation. We evaluated their quality in terms of calibration, segmentation error localization, and segmentation failure detection. Our results show that the uncertainty methods are typically well-calibrated when evaluated at the dataset level. Evaluated at the subject level, we found notable miscalibrations and limited segmentation error localization (e.g., for correcting segmentations), which hinder the direct use of the voxel-wise uncertainties. Nevertheless, voxel-wise uncertainty showed value to detect failed segmentations when uncertainty estimates are aggregated at the subject level. Therefore, we suggest a careful usage of voxel-wise uncertainty measures and highlight the importance of developing solutions that address the subject-level requirements on calibration and segmentation error localization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Microstructural Investigations of the Visual Pathways in Pediatric Epilepsy Neurosurgery: Insights From Multi-Shell Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00269</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Surgery is a key approach for achieving seizure freedom in children with focal onset epilepsy. However, the resection can affect or be in the vicinity of the optic radiations. Multi-shell diffusion MRI and tractography can better characterize tissue structure and provide guidance to help minimize surgical related deficits. Whilst in adults tractography has been used to demonstrate that damage to the optic radiations leads to postoperative visual field deficits, this approach has yet to be properly explored in children.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate the capabilities of multi-shell diffusion MRI and tractography in characterizing microstructural changes in children with epilepsy pre- and post-surgery affecting the occipital, parietal or temporal lobes.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Diffusion Tensor Imaging and the Spherical Mean Technique were used to investigate the microstructure of the optic radiations. Furthermore, tractography was used to evaluate whether pre-surgical reconstructions of the optic radiations overlap with the resection margin as measured using anatomical post-surgical T1-weighted MRI.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Increased diffusivity in patients compared to controls at baseline was observed with evidence of decreased diffusivity, anisotropy, and neurite orientation distribution in contralateral hemisphere after surgery. Pre-surgical optic radiation tractography overlapped with post-surgical resection margins in 20/43 (46%) children, and where visual data was available before and after surgery, the presence of overlap indicated a visual field deficit.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This is the first report in a pediatric series which highlights the relevance of tractography for future pre-surgical evaluation in children undergoing epilepsy surgery and the usefulness of multi-shell diffusion MRI to characterize brain microstructure in these patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Usability Issues of Clinical and Research Applications of Virtual Reality in Older People: A Systematic Review</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00093</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aging is a condition that may be characterized by a decline in physical, sensory, and mental capacities, while increased morbidity and multimorbidity may be associated with disability. A wide range of clinical conditions (e.g., frailty, mild cognitive impairment, metabolic syndrome) and age-related diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, cancer, sarcopenia, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases) affect older people. Virtual reality (VR) is a novel and promising tool for assessment and rehabilitation in older people. Usability is a crucial factor that must be considered when designing virtual systems for medicine. We conducted a systematic review with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines concerning the usability of VR clinical systems in aging and provided suggestions to structure usability piloting. Findings show that different populations of older people have been recruited to mainly assess usability of non-immersive VR, with particular attention paid to motor/physical rehabilitation. Mixed approach (qualitative and quantitative tools together) is the preferred methodology; technology acceptance models are the most applied theoretical frameworks, however senior adapted models are the best within this context. Despite minor interaction issues and bugs, virtual systems are rated as usable and feasible. We encourage usability and user experience pilot studies to ameliorate interaction and improve acceptance and use of VR clinical applications in older people with the aid of suggestions (VR-USOP) provided by our analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Relationship Between Socioeconomic Status and Brain Volume in Children and Adolescents With Prenatal Alcohol Exposure</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00085</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The positive relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and cognitive performance is mediated, in part, by differences in brain structure in typically developing youth. Associations between brain regions that relate to SES overlap with brain regions known to be sensitive to prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). Animal models demonstrate that PAE attenuates neural and cognitive benefits of early life enrichment. However, whether or not environmental factors related to SES are associated with brain development in youth affected by PAE remains unknown in humans.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained in participants with PAE and compared to age- and sex- matched Controls (n = 197, 48% with PAE, 44% girls, 6.5–17.7 years old). General linear modeling was utilized to examine associations between SES and subcortical brain volumes for youth with PAE compared to Controls.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Group by SES interactions were observed within the hippocampus (HPC), nucleus accumbens (NAc) and ventral diencephalon (vDC) (corrected p values &amp;lt;0.05), where positive associations (e.g., higher SES related to larger subcortical volumes) were observed within Controls, but not youth with PAE. Post hoc analyses examined associations between SES and brain volumes within each group independently, and revealed widespread positive associations among Controls (Amyg, HPC, NAc, Pallidum, Putamen, vDC), but not youth with PAE. Across both groups, larger subcortical volumes were related to higher cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Typically developing youth exhibit increased subcortical volumes with increased SES, and surprisingly, this relationship is absent in adolescents with PAE. Findings suggest that subcortical brain volumes are neurocognitively relevant in both groups. The present results expand our understanding of the impact of PAE on the developing human brain within varying environmental contexts, and may inform novel environmental interventions that aim to improve, in part, on-going disruptions in brain development among youth with PAE. Our study highlights novel complexities in the pursuit to understand SES-brain associations, as we provide evidence that SES matters for brain outcomes among typically developing youth, and possibly not as much on an already altered brain as a result of PAE.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Brain Tumor Segmentation Using an Ensemble of 3D U-Nets and Overall Survival Prediction Using Radiomic Features</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00025</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Accurate segmentation of different sub-regions of gliomas such as peritumoral edema, necrotic core, enhancing, and non-enhancing tumor core from multimodal MRI scans has important clinical relevance in diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of brain tumors. However, due to the highly heterogeneous appearance and shape of these tumors, segmentation of the sub-regions is challenging. Recent developments using deep learning models has proved its effectiveness in various semantic and medical image segmentation tasks, many of which are based on the U-Net network structure with symmetric encoding and decoding paths for end-to-end segmentation due to its high efficiency and good performance. In brain tumor segmentation, the 3D nature of multimodal MRI poses challenges such as memory and computation limitations and class imbalance when directly adopting the U-Net structure. In this study we aim to develop a deep learning model using a 3D U-Net with adaptations in the training and testing strategies, network structures, and model parameters for brain tumor segmentation. Furthermore, instead of picking one best model, an ensemble of multiple models trained with different hyper-parameters are used to reduce random errors from each model and yield improved performance. Preliminary results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method and achieved the 9th place in the very competitive 2018 Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge. In addition, to emphasize the clinical value of the developed segmentation method, a linear model based on the radiomics features extracted from segmentation and other clinical features are developed to predict patient overall survival. Evaluation of these innovations shows high prediction accuracy in both low-grade glioma and glioblastoma patients, which achieved the 1st place in the 2018 BraTS challenge.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Differences in the Structure and Protein Expression of Femoral Nerve Branches in Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00016</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Treatment for peripheral nerve injury remains limited. The inherent differences between motor and sensory nerve fibers in peripheral nerves should be considered to improve the effects of clinical treatment of peripheral nerve injury. In this study, we investigated the differences in protein expression and ultrastructure between the cutaneous and muscular branches of the femoral nerve in rats. Our results suggest that the cutaneous branch of the femoral nerve mainly contains sensory nerve fibers and few motor nerve fibers; Correspondingly, many motor nerve fibers and few sensory nerve fibers were observed in the muscular branch of the femoral nerve, which indicate that two branches of femoral nerve are mixed nerve. The mean thickness of the myelin sheath and basement membrane of the medullated fibers in the muscular branch of the femoral nerve was greater than that of the cutaneous branch of the femoral nerve. However, the cutaneous branch has a larger G-ratio. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis revealed that the cellular component term extracellular space was the most highly enriched, and more genes were upregulated in the muscular branch of the femoral nerve. Meanwhile, the expression of key proteins were validated by Western Blot, and immunofluorescence targets the expression of key proteins, which is consistent with the enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology. In conclusion, inherent differences in protein expression and ultrastructure were observed between the cutaneous and muscular branches of the femoral nerve in rats, which should be considered in future studies on the treatment of peripheral nerve injuries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Reduced Dynamic Complexity of BOLD Signals Differentiates Mild Cognitive Impairment From Normal Aging</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00090</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is characterized as a transitional phase between cognitive decline associated with normal aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measuring blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals provides complementary information considered essential for understanding disease progression. Previous studies suggested that multi-scale entropy (MSE) analysis quantifying the complexity of BOLD signals is a novel and promising method for investigating neurodegeneration associated with cognitive decline in different stages of MCI. Therefore, the current study used MSE to explore the changes in the complexity of resting-state brain BOLD signals in patients with early MCI (EMCI) and late MCI (LMCI). We recruited 345 participants’ data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, including 176 normal control (NC) subjects, 87 patients with EMCI and 82 patients with LMCI. We observed a significant reduction of brain signal complexity toward regularity in the left fusiform gyrus region in the EMCI group and in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex in the LMCI group. Our results extend prior work by revealing that significant reductions of brain BOLD signal complexity can be detected in different stages of MCI independent of age, sex and regional atrophy. Notably, the reduction of BOLD signal complexity in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex was significantly associated with greater risk of progression to AD. The present study thus identified MSE as a potential imaging biomarker for the early diagnosis of pre-clinical Alzheimer’s disease and provides further insights into the neuropathology of cognitive decline in prodromal AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Single-molecule functional anatomy of endogenous HER2-HER3 heterodimers</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53934</link>
	<content:encoded>Human epidermal growth factor receptors (HERs) are the primary targets of many directed cancer therapies. However, the reason a specific dimer of HERs generates a stronger proliferative signal than other permutations remains unclear. Here, we used single-molecule immunoprecipitation to develop a biochemical assay for endogenously-formed, entire HER2-HER3 heterodimers. We observed unexpected, large conformational fluctuations in juxta-membrane and kinase domains of the HER2-HER3 heterodimer. Nevertheless, the individual HER2-HER3 heterodimers catalyze tyrosine phosphorylation at an unusually high rate, while simultaneously interacting with multiple copies of downstream signaling effectors. Our results suggest that the high catalytic rate and multi-tasking capability make a concerted contribution to the strong signaling potency of the HER2-HER3 heterodimers.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53683</link>
	<content:encoded>The TMEM175 family constitutes recently discovered K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels that are important for autophagosome turnover and lysosomal pH regulation and are associated with the early onset of Parkinson Disease. TMEM175 channels lack a P-loop selectivity filter, a hallmark of all known K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels, raising the question how selectivity is achieved. Here, we report the X-ray structure of a closed bacterial TMEM175 channel in complex with a nanobody fusion-protein disclosing bound K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. Our analysis revealed that a highly conserved layer of threonine residues in the pore conveys a basal K&lt;sup&gt;+ &lt;/sup&gt;selectivity. An additional layer comprising two serines in human TMEM175 increases selectivity further and renders this channel sensitive to 4-aminopyridine and Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Our findings suggest that large hydrophobic side chains occlude the pore, forming a physical gate, and that channel opening by iris-like motions simultaneously relocates the gate and exposes the otherwise concealed selectivity filter to the pore lumen.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53357</link>
	<content:encoded>Single-molecule approaches provide enormous insight into the dynamics of biomolecules, but adequately sampling distributions of states and events often requires extensive sampling. Although emerging experimental techniques can generate such large datasets, existing analysis tools are not suitable to process the large volume of data obtained in high-throughput paradigms. Here, we present a new analysis platform (DISC) that accelerates unsupervised analysis of single-molecule trajectories. By merging model-free statistical learning with the Viterbi algorithm, DISC idealizes single-molecule trajectories up to three orders of magnitude faster with improved accuracy compared to other commonly used algorithms. Further, we demonstrate the utility of DISC algorithm to probe cooperativity between multiple binding events in the cyclic nucleotide binding domains of HCN pacemaker channel. Given the flexible and efficient nature of DISC, we anticipate it will be a powerful tool for unsupervised processing of high-throughput data across a range of single-molecule experiments.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/51787</link>
	<content:encoded>Hormonal signalling in animals often involves direct transcription factor-hormone interactions that modulate gene expression&lt;sup&gt;1,2&lt;/sup&gt;. In contrast, plant hormone signalling is most commonly based on de-repression via the degradation of transcriptional repressors&lt;sup&gt;3-5&lt;/sup&gt;. Recently, we uncovered a non-canonical signalling mechanism for the plant hormone auxin whereby auxin directly affects the activity of the atypical auxin response factor (ARF), ETTIN towards target genes without the requirement for protein degradation&lt;sup&gt;6,7&lt;/sup&gt;. Here we show that ETTIN directly binds auxin, leading to dissociation from co-repressor proteins of the TOPLESS/TOPLESS-RELATED family followed by histone acetylation and induction of gene expression. This mechanism is reminiscent of animal hormone signalling as it affects the activity towards regulation of target genes and provides the first example of a DNA-bound hormone receptor in plants. Whilst auxin affects canonical ARFs indirectly by facilitating degradation of Aux/IAA repressors, direct ETTIN-auxin interactions allow switching between repressive and de-repressive chromatin states in an instantly-reversible manner.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/51772</link>
	<content:encoded>Axons span extreme distances and are subjected to significant stretch deformations during limb movements or sudden head movements, especially during impacts. Yet, axon biomechanics, and its relation to the ultrastructure that allows axons to withstand mechanical stress, is poorly understood. Using a custom developed force apparatus, we demonstrate that chick dorsal root ganglion axons exhibit a tension buffering or strain-softening response, where its steady state elastic modulus decreases with increasing strain. We then explore the contributions from the various cytoskeletal components of the axon to show that the recently discovered membrane-associated actin-spectrin scaffold plays a prominent mechanical role. Finally, using a theoretical model, we argue that the actin-spectrin skeleton acts as an axonal tension buffer by reversibly unfolding repeat domains of the spectrin tetramers to release excess mechanical stress. Our results revise the current view point that microtubules and their associated proteins are the only significant load-bearing elements in axons.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.07.030015v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Brain controllability properties are normally derived from the white matter fiber tracts in which the neural substrate of the actual energy consumption, namely the gray matter, has been widely ignored. Here, we study the relationship between gray matter volume of regions across the whole cortex and their respective control property derived from the structural architecture of the white matter fiber tracts. The data suggests that the ability of white fiber tracts to exhibit control at specific nodes not only depends on the connection strength of the structural connectome but additionally strongly depends on gray matter volume at the host nodes. Our data indicates that connectivity strength and gray matter volume interact with respect to the brain control properties, such that gray matter exerts the great impact in regions with high structural connectivity. Disentangling effects of the regional gray matter volume and connectivity strength, we found that frontal and sensory areas play crucial roles in controllability. Together these results suggest that structural and regional properties of the white matter and gray matter provide complementary information in studying the control properties of the intrinsic structural and functional architectural of the brain.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Effects of Selective Dopamine D2 or D3 Receptor Antagonism on Morphine-Induced Locomotion in Mice</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.07.029918v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Rationale: The dopamine D3 receptor (D3R) has garnered interest as a pharmacotherapeutic target for the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD). Recent evidence suggests that D2R and D3R antagonism oppositely affect the locomotor-activating effects of cocaine, but whether this pattern extends to opioid-induced hyperactivity remains unresolved. Objective: This study compared the impact of selective D2R vs. D3R antagonists on the locomotor-activating effects of acute and repeated morphine administration in mice. Catalepsy following D2R vs. D3R antagonism alone or in combination with morphine was also assessed. Methods: C57Bl/6J mice were pretreated with either the highly-selective D3R antagonist PG01037 (vehicle, 10.0 mg/kg) or the selective D2R antagonist L-741,626 (vehicle, 10.0 mg/kg) and tested for 1) locomotor activity induced by acute morphine administration (10.0 - 56.0 mg/kg), 2) locomotor sensitization following repeated morphine administration (56.0 mg/kg), or 3) catalepsy after administration of either antagonist alone or in combination with morphine (10.0 - 56.0 mg/kg). Results: In locomotion studies, both PG01037 and L-741,626 shifted the acute morphine dose-response function rightward/downward, although the inhibitory effect of L-741,626 pretreatment was more robust. Likewise, PG01037 pretreatment partially attenuated, while L-741,626 pretreatment fully abolished, morphine-induced locomotor sensitization. L-741,626 produced catalepsy that was blunted by morphine, whereas PG01037 did not induce catalepsy under any conditions. Conclusions: D2R or D3R antagonism attenuates morphine-induced locomotor activity and sensitization. D2R antagonism produces a stronger suppression of these effects, but also induced modest cataleptic effects which were not observed following D3R antagonism. The results lend additional support to the investigation of selective D3R antagonists as treatments for OUD.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.07.029868v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Relapse into drug use is a significant problem for people recovering from addiction. The ability that conditioned cues have to reinstate and reinvigorate drug-seeking is potentiated over time (incubation of seeking), posing an additional difficulty for maintaining abstinence. While the prefrontal cortex has been involved in the incubation phenomenon and the extracellular matrix, perineuronal nets (PNN) in particular, may play a vital role in brain plasticity associated to drug relapse, there are no comparative analyses between different drug classes and natural reinforcers. Here, we compare the effects of early (1 day) and protracted (30 days) withdrawal from to cocaine, heroin and sucrose self-administration on the PNN content of different territories of the prefrontal cortex of male Lewis rats. Our results show that cocaine self-administration and protracted withdrawal decreased PNN content in the prelimbic cortex. Also, heroin self-administration increased PNN content in the infralimbic cortex, but this effect was lost after 30 days of withdrawal. Heroin self-administration also decreased PNNs in the insula, an effect that remained even after protracted withdrawal from the drug. Finally, the self-administration of sucrose-sweetened water decreased PNN content in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and increased PNNs in the insular cortex, which was still evident after protracted withdrawal. Our results show that three different rewards with specific pharmacological and physiological actions differentially modulate PNNs in specific areas of the rodent prefrontal cortex with potential implications for the incubation of seeking phenomenon.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.07.029850v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The hippocampus is implicated in numerous neurological disorders and the ability to detect subtle or focal hippocampal abnormalities earlier in disease progression could significantly improve the treatment of patients. Ex vivo studies with ultra-high field have revealed that diffusion MRI (dMRI) can reveal microstructural variations within the hippocampal subfields and lamina, and may also be sensitive to intra-hippocampal pathways. However, translation to lower resolution in vivo dMRI studies of the hippocampus is challenging due to its complicated geometry. One novel way to overcome some of these obstacles is by transforming the usual Cartesian coordinates in an MRI image to coordinates that are crafted to curve themselves according to the complicated geometry of the hippocampus. This procedure allows us to virtually unfold the hippocampus into a thin sheet. In this work, we introduce an algorithm to map diffusion MRI data to this sheet, allowing us to overcome the difficulties associated with the hippocampus' complicated geometry. We demonstrate how our method can be readily integrated into existing implementations of traditional tractography methods and how it leads to enhancements in the resulting tracts. Further, our results on high quality in vivo dMRI acquisitions show that unfolding the hippocampus leads to a more anatomically plausible modelling of the connectivity of the hippocampus as probed by probabilistic tractography, revealing key elements of the polysynaptic pathway and anterior-posterior connectivity gradients.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.07.029397v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In neuroimaging, voxel-wise encoding models are a popular tool to predict brain activity elicited by a stimulus. To evaluate the accuracy of these predictions across multiple voxels, one can choose between multiple quality metrics. However, each quality metric requires specifying auxilliary parameters such as the number and selection criteria of voxels, whose influence on model validation is unknown. In this study, we systematically vary these parameters and observe their effects on three common quality metrics of voxel-wise encoding models in two open datasets of 3- and 7-Tesla BOLD fMRI activity elicited by musical stimuli. We show that such auxilliary parameters not only exert substantial influence on model validation, but also differ in how they affect each quality metric. Finally, we give several recommendations for validating voxel-wise encoding models that may limit variability due to different numbers of voxels, voxel selection criteria, and magnetic field strengths.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.07.029249v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The communicability distance between pairs of regions in human brain is used as a quantitative proxy for studying Alzheimer disease. Using this distance we obtain the shortest communicability path lengths between different regions of brain networks from Alzheimer diseased (AD) patients and healthy cohorts (HC). We show that the shortest communicability path length is significantly better than the shortest topological path length in distinguishing AD patients from HC. Based on this approach we identify 399 pairs of brain regions for which there are very significant changes in the shortest communicability path length after AD appears. We find that 42% of these regions interconnect both brain hemispheres, 28% connect regions inside the left hemisphere only and 20% affects vermis connection with brain hemispheres. These findings clearly agree with the disconnection syndrome hypothesis of Alzheimer disease. Finally, we show that in 76.9% damaged brain regions the shortest communicability path length drops in AD in relation to HC. This counterintuitive finding indicates that AD transforms the brain network into a more efficient system from the perspective of the transmission of the disease, because it drops the circulability of the disease factor around the brain regions in relation to its transmissibility to other regions.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.07.028241v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>An array of phenotypes in animal models of neurodegenerative disease have been shown to be reversed by neuronal inhibition of PERK, an eIF2 kinase that modulates the unfolded protein response (UPR). This suggests that targeting PERK therapeutically could be beneficial for treatment of human disease. Herein, using multiple genetic approaches we show that selective deletion of the PERK in mouse midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons results in multiple cognitive and age-dependent motor phenotypes. Conditional expression of phospho-mutant eIF2 in DA neurons recapitulated the phenotypes caused by deletion of PERK, consistent with a causal role of decreased eIF2 phosphorylation. In addition, deletion of PERK in DA neurons resulted in altered de novo translation, as well as age-dependent changes in axonal DA release and uptake in the striatum that mirror the pattern of motor changes observed. Taken together, our findings show that proper regulation of PERK-eIF2 signaling in DA neurons is required for normal cognitive and motor function across lifespan, and also highlight the need for caution in the proposed use of sustained PERK inhibition in neurons as a therapeutic strategy in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.07.027292v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Type 2 diabetes (T2D) increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Even though these two diseases share common molecular pathways, the mechanisms remain elusive. To shed light into these mechanisms, mice with different AD- and/or tauopathy-linked genetic backgrounds were utilized; APPswe/PS1dE9 (A+Tw), Tau P301L (AwT+), and APPswe/PS1dE9/Tau P301L (A+T+). Feeding these mice with typical Western diet (TWD) led to obesity and diabetic phenotype as compared to respective mice with a standard diet. TWD also exacerbated memory and learning impairment in A+Tw and AwT+, but not in A+T+ mice. Furthermore, RNA sequencing of mouse hippocampal samples revealed altered responses to AD-related pathologies in A+Tw and A+T+ mice upon TWD, pointing specifically towards aberrant microglial functionality and PI3K-Akt signaling. Accordingly, fewer microglia alongside an increased number of dystrophic neurites around {beta}-amyloid plaques, and impaired PI3K-Akt signaling, were discovered in the hippocampus of TWD mice. Mechanistic elucidation revealed that disruption of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway by pharmacological or genetic approaches significantly decreased the phagocytic uptake and proinflammatory response as well as increased the activity of Syk-kinase upon ligand-induced activation of Trem2/Dap12 signaling in mouse microglia. Finally, characterization of microglial pathology in cortical biopsies of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) patients harboring {beta}-amyloid plaques revealed a significant decrease in the number of microglia per {beta}-amyloid plaque in obese iNPH patients with T2D as compared to both normal weight and obese iNPH patients without T2D. Collectively, these results suggest that the peripheral diabetic phenotype in mice and humans associates with reduced microglial response to {beta}-amyloid pathology.</content:encoded>

Biomedical research studies have generated large multi-omic datasets to study complex diseases like Alzheimer’s disease (AD). An important aim of these studies is the identification of candidate genes that demonstrate congruent disease-related alterations across the different data types measured by the study. We developed a new method to detect such candidate genes in large multi-omic case-control studies that measure multiple data types in the same set of samples. The method is based on a gene-centric integrative coefficient quantifying to what degree consistent differences are observed in the different data types. For statistical inference, a Bayesian hierarchical model is used to study the distribution of the integrative coefficient. The model employs a conditional autoregressive prior to integrate a functional gene network and to share information between genes known to be functionally related. We applied the method to an AD dataset consisting of histone acetylation, DNA methylation, and RNA transcription data from human cortical tissue samples of 233 subjects, and we detected 816 genes with consistent differences between persons with AD and controls. The findings were validated in protein data and in RNA transcription data from two independent AD studies. Finally, we found three subnetworks of jointly dysregulated genes within the functional gene network which capture three distinct biological processes: &lt;i&gt;myeloid cell differentiation&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;protein phosphorylation&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;synaptic signaling&lt;/i&gt;. Further investigation of the myeloid network indicated an upregulation of this network in early stages of AD prior to accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau and suggested that increased &lt;i&gt;CSF1&lt;/i&gt; transcription in astrocytes may contribute to microglial activation in AD. Thus, we developed a method that integrates multiple data types and external knowledge of gene function to detect candidate genes, applied the method to an AD dataset, and identified several disease-related genes and processes demonstrating the usefulness of the integrative approach.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v_jJDUF2TbI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Mechanistic models of PLC/PKC signaling implicate phosphatidic acid as a key amplifier of chemotactic gradient sensing</title>

Chemotaxis of fibroblasts and other mesenchymal cells is critical for embryonic development and wound healing. Fibroblast chemotaxis directed by a gradient of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) requires signaling through the phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. Diacylglycerol (DAG), the lipid product of PLC that activates conventional PKCs, is focally enriched at the up-gradient leading edge of fibroblasts responding to a shallow gradient of PDGF, signifying polarization. To explain the underlying mechanisms, we formulated reaction-diffusion models including as many as three putative feedback loops based on known biochemistry. These include the previously analyzed mechanism of substrate-buffering by myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) and two newly considered feedback loops involving the lipid, phosphatidic acid (PA). DAG kinases and phospholipase D, the enzymes that produce PA, are identified as key regulators in the models. Paradoxically, increasing DAG kinase activity can enhance the robustness of DAG/active PKC polarization with respect to chemoattractant concentration while decreasing their whole-cell levels. Finally, in simulations of wound invasion, efficient collective migration is achieved with thresholds for chemotaxis matching those of polarization in the reaction-diffusion models. This multi-scale modeling framework offers testable predictions to guide further study of signal transduction and cell behavior that affect mesenchymal chemotaxis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qkKouQvyIrw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Similarities in gene expression patterns prompted our speculations on the common developmental and evolutionary origin of the claustrum and the subplate. Here we systematically compare the currently available data on cytoarchitecture, evolutionary origin, gene expression, cell types, birthdates, neurogenesis, lineage and migration, circuit connectivity and cell death of the neurons that contribute to the claustrum and subplate. Almost all of the markers we examined that were expressed in the subplate/layer 6b were also expressed in the claustral complex, but not all claustrum specific or enriched genes were expressed in subplate/layer 6b, suggesting overall similarities, but also some differences. There are numerous similarities between the adult connectivity patters of layer 6b and claustrum. In particular, both have extensive cortical connections. However, there are differences in the relative strength of their reciprocal connectivity with various other structures in the adult. Based on their similarities and differences we propose a partially common early evolutionary origin of the cells that become claustrum and subplate, a likely scenario that is shared in these cell populations across all amniotes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human claustrum, a major hub of widespread neocortical connections, is a thin, bilateral sheet of grey matter located between the insular cortex and the striatum. The subplate is a largely transient cortical structure that contains some of the earliest generated neurons of the cerebral cortex and has important developmental functions to establish intra and extracortical connections. In human and macaque some subplate cells undergo regulated cell death, but some remain as interstitial white matter cells. In mouse and rat brains a compact layer is formed, layer 6b, and it remains underneath the cortex, adjacent to the white matter. Whether layer 6b in rodents is homologous to primate subplate or interstitial white matter cells is still debated. Gene expression patterns, such as those of &lt;i&gt;Nurr1/Nr4a2&lt;/i&gt;, have suggested that the rodent subplate and the persistent subplate cells in layer 6b and the claustrum might have similar origins. Moreover, the birthdates of the claustrum and layer 6b are similarly precocious in mice. These observations prompted our speculations on the common developmental and evolutionary origin of the claustrum and the subplate. Here we systematically compare the currently available data on cytoarchitecture, evolutionary origin, gene expression, cell types, birthdates, neurogenesis, lineage and migration, circuit connectivity and cell death of the neurons that contribute to the claustrum and subplate. Based on their similarities and differences we propose a partially common early evolutionary origin of the cells that become claustrum and subplate, a likely scenario that is shared in these cell populations across all amniotes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Synodontid catfishes use an Elastic Spring Apparatus, including protractor muscles, to produce electric discharges or sounds. Anatomical characterization, together with motoneuron patch clamp recordings and protractor muscle EMGs suggest that adaptive changes in peripheral and central characters underlie transition from an ancestral sound to a derived electric discharge producing system.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To what extent do modifications in the nervous system and peripheral effectors contribute to novel behaviors? Using a combination of morphometric analysis, neuroanatomical tract tracing and intracellular neuronal recording, we address this question in a sound producing and a weakly electric species of synodontid catfish, &lt;i&gt;Synodontis grandiops&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S. nigriventris&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. The same peripheral mechanism, a bilateral pair of protractor muscles associated with vertebral processes (elastic spring mechanism), is involved in both signaling systems. Although there were dramatic species differences in several morphometric measures, electromyograms provided strong evidence that simultaneous activation of paired protractor muscles accounts for individual sound and electric discharge pulses. While the general architecture of the neural network and the intrinsic properties of the motoneuron population driving each target were largely similar, differences could contribute to species‐specific patterns in electromyograms and the associated pulse repetition rate of sounds and electric discharges. Together, the results suggest that adaptive changes in both peripheral and central characters underlie the transition from an ancestral sound to a derived electric discharge producing system, and thus the evolution of a novel communication channel among synodontid catfish. Similarities with characters in other sonic and weakly electric teleost fish provide a striking example of convergent evolution in functional adaptations underlying the evolution of the two signaling systems among distantly related taxa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1882, the Italian morphologist Giuseppe Bellonci correctly observed that crustaceans possess mushroom bodies, a finding only recently becoming substantiated: here the title page of his paper and a lithograph in it.



&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1882, the Italian embryologist Giuseppe Bellonci introduced a nomenclature for structures in the stomatopod crustacean &lt;i&gt;Squilla mantis&lt;/i&gt; that he claimed correspond to insect mushroom bodies, today recognized as cardinal centers that in insects mediate associative memory. The use of Bellonci's terminology has, through a series of misunderstandings and entrenched opinions, led to contesting views regarding whether centers in crustacean and insect brains that occupy corresponding locations and receive comparable multisensory inputs are homologous or homoplasic. The following describes the fate of terms used to denote sensory association neuropils in crustacean species and relates how those terms were deployed in the 1920s and 30s by the Swedish neuroanatomist Bertil Hanström to claim homology in insects and crustaceans. Yet the same terminology has been repurposed by subsequent researchers to promote the very opposite view: that mushroom bodies are a derived trait of hexapods and that equivalent centers in crustaceans evolved independently.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>eNeuro: Deficit in Motor Skill Consolidation-Dependent Synaptic Plasticity at Motor Cortex to Dorsolateral Striatum Synapses in a Mouse Model of Huntingtons Disease</title>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Huntington’s disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease notably characterized by progressive motor symptoms. Although the loss of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the striatum has been associated with motor deficits, premanifest patients already present cognitive deficiencies and show early signs of motor disabilities. Here, in a YAC128 HD mouse model, we identified impairment in motor skill consolidation at the age of 11–14 weeks. Using optogenetic stimulation, we found that excitatory synaptic transmission from motor cortex to MSNs located in the dorsolateral part of the striatum (DLS) is altered. Using single pellet reaching task, we observed that while motor skill consolidation is accompanied by a dynamic change in AMPA/NMDA ratio in wild-type (WT) mice, this form of synaptic plasticity does not occur in YAC128 mice. This study not only proposes new meaningful insight in the synaptopathic mechanisms of HD, but also highlights that deficit in motor skill consolidation-dependent synaptic plasticity at motor cortex to DLS synapses represents an early biomarker for HD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;By combining intracortical electrical microstimulation (ICMS) with intrinsic optical imaging, we find that focal ICMS at single digit locations in monkey cortex (areas 3a, 3b, 1, 2, and M1) reveals known anatomical connections. This novel method of studying cortical connections is &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, rapid, targeted, and mesoscale.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To map &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; cortical circuitry at the mesoscale we applied a novel approach to map inter‐areal functional connectivity. Electrical intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) in conjunction with optical imaging of intrinsic signals (OIS) was used map functional connections in somatosensory cortical areas in anesthetized squirrel monkeys. ICMS produced activations that were focal and that displayed responses which were stimulation intensity dependent. ICMS in supragranular layers of Brodmann areas 3b, 1, 2, 3a, and M1 evoked inter‐areal activation patterns that were topographically appropriate and appeared consistent with known anatomical connectivity. Specifically, ICMS revealed area 3b connections with area 1; area 1 connections with areas 2 and 3a; area 2 connections with areas 1, 3a, and M1; area 3a connections with areas M1, 1, and 2; and M1 connections with areas 3a, 1, and 2. These somatosensory connectivity patterns were reminiscent of feedforward patterns observed anatomically, although feedback contributions are also likely present. Further consistent with anatomical connectivity, intra‐areal and intra‐areal patterns of activation were patchy with patch sizes of 200–300 μm. In summary, ICMS with OIS is a novel approach for mapping inter‐areal and intra‐areal connections &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Comparisons with feedforward and feedback anatomical connectivity is discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Therapeutic potentials of NOP and MOP receptor coactivation for the treatment of pain and opioid abuse</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the identification of the nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) peptide (NOP) as an endogenous ligand for the NOP receptor, ample evidence has revealed unique functional profiles of the N/OFQ‐NOP receptor system. NOP receptors are expressed in key neural substrates involved in pain and reward modulation. In nonhuman primates (NHPs), NOP receptor activation effectively exerts antinociception and anti‐hypersensitivity at the spinal and supraspinal levels. Moreover, NOP receptor activation inhibits dopaminergic transmission and synergistically enhances mu‐opioid peptide (MOP) receptor‐mediated analgesia. In this article, we have discussed the functional profiles of ligands with dual NOP and MOP receptor agonist activities and highlight their optimal functional efficacy for pain relief and drug abuse treatment. Through coactivation of NOP and MOP receptors, bifunctional NOP/MOP receptor “partial” agonists (e.g., AT‐121, BU08028, and BU10038) reveal a wider therapeutic window with fewer side effects. These newly developed ligands potently induce antinociception without MOP receptor agonist‐associated side effects such as abuse potential, respiratory depression, itching sensation, and physical dependence. In addition, in both rodent and NHP models, bifunctional NOP/MOP receptor agonists can attenuate reward processing and/or the reinforcing effects of opioids and other abused drugs. While a mixed NOP/opioid receptor “full” agonist cebranopadol is undergoing clinical trials, bifunctional NOP/MOP “partial” agonists exhibit promising therapeutic profiles in translational NHP models for the treatment of pain and opioid abuse. This class of drugs demonstrates the therapeutic advantage of NOP and MOP receptor coactivation, indicating a greater potential for future development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02555</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many important classification problems in real world consist of a large
number of categories. Hierarchical multi-label text classification (HMTC) with
higher accuracy over large sets of closely related categories organized in a
hierarchical structure or taxonomy has become a challenging problem. In this
paper, we present a hierarchical fine-tuning deep learning approach for HMTC. A
joint embedding approach of words and parent category are utilized by
leveraging the hierarchical relations in the hierarchical structure of
categories and the textual data. A fine tuning technique is applied to the
Ordered Neural LSTM (ONLSTM) neural network such that the text classification
results in the upper levels should contribute to the classification in the
lower ones. The extensive experiments were made over two benchmark datasets,
and the results show that the method proposed in this paper outperforms the
state-of-the-art hierarchical and flat multi-label text classification
approaches at significantly lower compu-tational cost while maintaining high
interpretability.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Introduction. Reservoir computing is a growing paradigm for simplified
training of recurrent neural networks, with a high potential for hardware
implementations. Numerous experiments in optics and electronics yield
comparable performance to digital state-of-the-art algorithms. Many of the most
recent works in the field focus on large-scale photonic systems, with tens of
thousands of physical nodes and arbitrary interconnections. While this trend
significantly expands the potential applications of photonic reservoir
computing, it also complicates the optimisation of the high number of
hyper-parameters of the system. Methods. In this work, we propose the use of
Bayesian optimisation for efficient exploration of the hyper-parameter space in
a minimum number of iteration. Results. We test this approach on a previously
reported large-scale experimental system, compare it to the commonly used grid
search, and report notable improvements in performance and the number of
experimental iterations required to optimise the hyper-parameters. Conclusion.
Bayesian optimisation thus has the potential to become the standard method for
tuning the hyper-parameters in photonic reservoir computing.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The reconstruction mechanisms built by the human auditory system during sound
reconstruction are still a matter of debate. The purpose of this study is to
propose a mathematical model of sound reconstruction based on the functional
architecture of the auditory cortex (A1). The model is inspired by the
geometrical modelling of vision, which has undergone a great development in the
last ten years. There are however fundamental dissimilarities, due to the
different role played by the time and the different group of symmetries. The
algorithm transforms the degraded sound in an 'image' in the time-frequency
domain via a short-time Fourier transform. Such an image is then lifted in the
Heisenberg group and it is reconstructed via a Wilson-Cowan differo-integral
equation. Preliminary numerical experiments are provided, showing the good
reconstruction properties of the algorithm on synthetic sounds concentrated
around two frequencies.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02203</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sharpness of error bounds for best non-linear multivariate approximation by
sums of logistic activation functions and piecewise polynomials is
investigated. The error bounds are given in terms of moduli of smoothness. They
describe approximation properties of single hidden layer feedforward neural
networks with multiple input nodes. Sharpness with respect to Lipschitz classes
is established by constructing counterexamples with a non-linear, quantitative
extension of the uniform boundedness principle.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Frequency-Aware Summarization of Resting-State fMRI Data</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00016</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many brain imaging modalities reveal interpretable patterns after the data dimensionality is reduced and summarized via data-driven approaches. In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, such summarization is often achieved through independent component analysis (ICA). ICA transforms the original data into a relatively small number of interpretable bases in voxel space (referred to as ICA spatial components, or spatial maps) and corresponding bases in the time domain (referred to as time-courses of corresponding spatial maps) In this work, we use the word “basis” to broadly refer to either of the two factors resulting from the transformation. A precise summarization for fMRI requires accurately detecting co-activation of voxels by measuring temporal dependence. Accurate measurement of dependence requires a proper understanding of the underlying temporal characteristics of the data. One way to understand such characteristics is to study the frequency spectrum of fMRI data. Researchers have argued that information regarding the underlying neuronal activity might be spread over a range of frequencies as a result of the heterogeneous temporal nature of the neuronal activity, which is reflected in its frequency spectrum. Many studies have accounted for heterogeneous characteristics of the frequency of the signal by either directly inspecting the contents of frequency domain-transformed data or augmenting their analyses with such information. For example, studies on fMRI data have investigated brain functional connectivity by leveraging frequency-adjusted measures of dependence (e.g., when a correlation is measured as a function of frequency, as with “coherence”). Although these studies measure dependence as a function of frequency, the formulation does not capture all characteristics of the frequency-based dependence. Incorporating frequency information into a summarization approach would enable the retention of important frequency-related information that exists in the original space but might be lost after performing a frequency-independent summarization. We propose a novel data-driven approach built upon ICA, which is based on measuring dependence as a generalized function of frequency. Applying this approach to fMRI data provides evidence of existing cross-frequency functional connectivity between different areas of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Efficacy of an Integrative Treatment for Tinnitus Combining Music and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy—Assessed With Behavioral and EEG Data</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00012</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chronic tinnitus is a prevalent condition that could cause severe negative impact on an individual’s life. However, there has not been an established treatment due to a limited understanding of the pathophysiology of this multifarious disorder. In this study, we tested the efficacy of an integrative treatment, combining music therapy with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). We collected three groups of patients receiving three different treatments: Music-CBT, music therapy and CBT. We used both subjective (i.e., questionnaires) and objective (i.e., resting-state EEG data) measurements to assess the behavioral and neural changes brought upon by the treatments. Analyses of the subjective measurements found a significant improvement of scale scores in Music-CBT and CBT, but not in the Music group. Analysis of the EEG data further showed increased powers in alpha and theta band after the Music-CBT treatment, and increased gamma power after CBT, whereas no significant difference was found for the music therapy. Further source localization analysis of alpha and theta changes in the Music-CBT group found that primary sources of the changes were located at auditory processing regions such as superior temporal gyrus, and higher emotional and cognitive processing regions such as ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC), lateral prefrontal cortex and parahippocampus. These results indicated that Music-CBT was effective in improving tinnitus symptoms on both a behavioral and neural level, which is more robust than the music therapy or CBT alone.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Unified Behavioral Scoring for Preclinical Models</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00313</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Preclinical mental health research relies upon animal models, and whilst many encouraging advances are being made, reproducibility and translational relevance may be limited by sub-optimal testing or model choices. Animal behaviors are complex and test batteries should be designed to include their multifaceted nature. However, multiple behavioral testing is often avoided due to cost, availability or statistical rigor. Additionally, despite the disparity in the incidence of mental health problems between the sexes, a move toward reducing animal numbers could be a deterrent to including both male and female animals. The current study introduces a unified scoring system for specific behavioral traits with the aim of maximizing the use of all data generated whilst reducing the incidence of statistical errors. Female and male mice from two common background strains were tested on behavior batteries designed to probe multiple aspects of anxiety-related and social behavioral traits. Results for every outcome measure were normalized to generate scores for each test and combined to give each mouse a single unified score for each behavioral trait. The unified behavioral scores revealed clear differences in the anxiety and stress-related, and sociability traits of mice. Principle component analysis of data demonstrated significant clustering of animals into their experimental groups. In contrast, individual tests returned an ambiguous mixture of non-significant trends and significant effects for various outcome measures. Utilizing a range of behavioral measures and combining all outcome measure data to produce unified scores provides a useful tool for detecting subtle behavioral traits in preclinical models.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Dopaminergic Progenitors Derived From Epiblast Stem Cells Function Similarly to Primary VM-Derived Progenitors When Transplanted Into a Parkinson’s Disease Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00312</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural transplantation in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) offers to replace cells lost during the progression of the disease process. Primary fetal ventral mesencephalon (VM), the origin of bona fide midbrain dopaminergic (DAergic) precursors, is currently the gold standard source of cells for transplantation in PD. However, the use of tissue from this source raises ethical and logistical constraints necessitating the need for alternative supplies of donor cells. The requirement of any alternative donor cell source is to have the capability to generate authentic mature DAergic neurons, which could be utilized in cell-replacement strategies. Mouse pluripotent stem cells can efficiently generate electrochemically mature midbrain DAergic precursors in vitro using a stepwise control of FGF signaling. Here, we have compared DAergic transplants derived from two progenitor cell sources in an allograft system: mouse epiblast stem cells (EpiSC) and primary fetal mouse VM tissue. Cells were transplanted into the striatum of 6-OHDA lesioned mice pre-treated with L-DOPA. Drug-induced rotations, a number of motor tests and drug-induced abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) were assessed. Functional improvements were demonstrated post-transplantation in some behavioral tests, with no difference in graft volume or the number of TH immuno-positive cells in the grafts of the two transplant groups. L-DOPA-induced AIMs and amphetamine-induced AIMs were observed in both transplant groups, with no differences in rate or severity between the two groups. Collectively, in this mouse-to-mouse allograft system, we report no significant differences in the functional ability between the gold standard primary VM derived and pluripotent stem cell-derived DAergic transplants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Binding of the Human 14-3-3 Isoforms to Distinct Sites in the Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00302</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Proteins of the 14-3-3 family are well known modulators of the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) regulating kinase activity, cellular localization, and ubiquitylation. Although binding between those proteins has been investigated, a comparative study of all human 14-3-3 isoforms interacting with LRRK2 is lacking so far. In a comprehensive approach, we quantitatively analyzed the interaction between the seven human 14-3-3 isoforms and LRRK2-derived peptides covering both, reported and putative 14-3-3 binding sites. We observed that phosphorylation is an absolute prerequisite for 14-3-3 binding and generated binding patterns of 14-3-3 isoforms to interact with peptides derived from the N-terminal phosphorylation cluster (S910 and S935), the Roc domain (S1444) and the C-terminus. The tested 14-3-3 binding sites in LRRK2 preferentially were recognized by the isoforms γ and η, whereas the isoforms ϵ and especially σ showed the weakest or no binding. Interestingly, the possible pathogenic mutation Q930R in LRRK2 drastically increases binding affinity to a peptide encompassing pS935. We then identified the autophosphorylation site T2524 as a so far not described 14-3-3 binding site at the very C-terminus of LRRK2. Binding affinities of all seven 14-3-3 isoforms were quantified for all three binding regions with pS1444 displaying the highest affinity of all measured singly phosphorylated peptides. The strongest binding was detected for the combined phosphosites S910 and S935, suggesting that avidity effects are important for high affinity interaction between 14-3-3 proteins and LRRK2.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Frequency-Domain Techniques for Cerebral and Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00300</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This article reviews the basic principles of frequency-domain near-infrared spectroscopy (FD-NIRS), which relies on intensity-modulated light sources and phase-sensitive optical detection, and its non-invasive applications to the brain. The simpler instrumentation and more straightforward data analysis of continuous-wave NIRS (CW-NIRS) accounts for the fact that almost all the current commercial instruments for cerebral NIRS have embraced the CW technique. However, FD-NIRS provides data with richer information content, which complements or exceeds the capabilities of CW-NIRS. One example is the ability of FD-NIRS to measure the absolute optical properties (absorption and reduced scattering coefficients) of tissue, and thus the absolute concentrations of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin in brain tissue. This article reviews the measured values of such optical properties and hemoglobin concentrations reported in the literature for animal models and for the human brain in newborns, infants, children, and adults. We also review the application of FD-NIRS to functional brain studies that focused on slower hemodynamic responses to brain activity (time scale of seconds) and faster optical signals that have been linked to neuronal activation (time scale of 100 ms). Another example of the power of FD-NIRS data is related to the different regions of sensitivity featured by intensity and phase data. We report recent developments that take advantage of this feature to maximize the sensitivity of non-invasive optical signals to brain tissue relative to more superficial extracerebral tissue (scalp, skull, etc.). We contend that this latter capability is a highly appealing quality of FD-NIRS, which complements absolute optical measurements and may result in significant advances in the field of non-invasive optical sensing of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Decoding Imagined and Spoken Phrases From Non-invasive Neural (MEG) Signals</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00290</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Speech production is a hierarchical mechanism involving the synchronization of the brain and the oral articulators, where the intention of linguistic concepts is transformed into meaningful sounds. Individuals with locked-in syndrome (fully paralyzed but aware) lose their motor ability completely including articulation and even eyeball movement. The neural pathway may be the only option to resume a certain level of communication for these patients. Current brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) use patients' visual and attentional correlates to build communication, resulting in a slow communication rate (a few words per minute). Direct decoding of imagined speech from the neural signals (and then driving a speech synthesizer) has the potential for a higher communication rate. In this study, we investigated the decoding of five imagined and spoken phrases from single-trial, non-invasive magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals collected from eight adult subjects. Two machine learning algorithms were used. One was an artificial neural network (ANN) with statistical features as the baseline approach. The other was convolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied on the spatial, spectral and temporal features extracted from the MEG signals. Experimental results indicated the possibility to decode imagined and spoken phrases directly from neuromagnetic signals. CNNs were found to be highly effective with an average decoding accuracy of up to 93% for the imagined and 96% for the spoken phrases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: A Neuroergonomics Approach to Mental Workload, Engagement and Human Performance</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00268</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The assessment and prediction of cognitive performance is a key issue for any discipline concerned with human operators in the context of safety-critical behavior. Most of the research has focused on the measurement of mental workload but this construct remains difficult to operationalize despite decades of research on the topic. Recent advances in Neuroergonomics have expanded our understanding of neurocognitive processes across different operational domains. We provide a framework to disentangle those neural mechanisms that underpin the relationship between task demand, arousal, mental workload and human performance. This approach advocates targeting those specific mental states that precede a reduction of performance efficacy. A number of undesirable neurocognitive states (mind wandering, effort withdrawal, perseveration, inattentional phenomena) are identified and mapped within a two-dimensional conceptual space encompassing task engagement and arousal. We argue that monitoring the prefrontal cortex and its deactivation can index a generic shift from a nominal operational state to an impaired one where performance is likely to degrade. Neurophysiological, physiological and behavioral markers that specifically account for these states are identified. We then propose a typology of neuroadaptive countermeasures to mitigate these undesirable mental states.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00266</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is the most common cause of dementia. Symptoms of AD include memory loss, disorientation, mood and behavior changes, confusion, unfounded suspicions, and eventually, difficulty speaking, swallowing, and walking. These symptoms are caused by neuronal degeneration and cell loss that begins in the hippocampus, and later in disease progression spreading to the rest of the brain. While there are some medications that alleviate initial symptoms, there are currently no treatments that stop disease progression. Hippocampal deficits in amyloid-β-related rodent models of AD have revealed synaptic, behavioral and circuit-level defects. These changes in synaptic function, plasticity, neuronal excitability, brain connectivity, and excitation/inhibition imbalance all have profound effects on circuit function, which in turn could exacerbate disease progression. Despite, the wealth of studies on AD pathology we don’t yet have a complete understanding of hippocampal deficits in AD. With the increasing development of in vivo recording techniques in awake and freely moving animals, future studies will extend our current knowledge of the mechanisms underpinning how hippocampal function is altered in AD, and aid in progression of treatment strategies that prevent and/or delay AD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Elevated Thresholds for Light Touch in Children With Autism Reflect More Conservative Perceptual Decision-Making Rather Than a Sensory Deficit</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00122</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are often behaviorally hyper-reactive to light touch, but it is unclear to what degree this arises from a fundamental sensory difference vs. higher order systems for attention or emotion processing. Thus far, experimental findings for light touch detection are mixed, and few previous studies have independently considered sensitivity (the ability to discriminate signal from noise) and decision criterion (the overall response bias or tendency to answer “yes” or “no” in a detection task). We tested a large sample of children, adolescents, and adults with ASD (n = 88) and with neurotypical (NT) development (n = 59) using von Frey filaments to derive light touch thresholds at the palm. We calculated signal detection metrics for sensitivity (A&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;) and response criterion (c) from hit and false alarm rates. Both metrics exhibited significant group differences, such that the ASD group was less sensitive, but had a much more conservative response criterion. We used a best subset model selection procedure in three separate ordinal regressions for the whole group, adults, and children/adolescents. In all selected models, c was by far the most significant predictor of threshold, supplanting effects of diagnostic group that were significant in the baseline models. In contrast, Az was not a significant predictor of threshold in any of the models. Mean values of c were similar for adults with and without autism and for children/adolescents with ASD, but lower (more liberal) in neurotypical children/adolescents. This suggests that children with ASD exhibit a conservatism in their perceptual decision-making that differs from their NT peers but resembles that of adults. Across the sample, the value of c was significantly and positively correlated with age and with autism symptoms (SRS-2 total score), in addition to thresholds. The results of this study suggest that, rather than a sensory difference in detection of light touch, there is a difference in response bias such that children with ASD are more conservative/likely to report “no” if unsure, than their young NT peers. Future work should consider the implications of conservative response criterion in ASD for commonly used forced-choice psychophysical paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Cognitive Function Impairments Linked to Alcohol and Cannabis Use During Adolescence: A Study of Gender Differences</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00095</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Major neurocognitive changes occur during adolescence, making this phase one of the most critical developmental periods of life. Furthermore, this phase in life is also the time in which youth substance use begins. Several studies have demonstrated the differential associations of alcohol and cannabis use concerning the neurocognitive functioning of both males and females. Past and contemporary literature on gender-specific effects in neuroscience of addiction is predominantly based on cross-sectional datasets and data that is limited in terms of measurement variability. Given the importance of gender-specific effects in addiction studies, and in order to address the two above-mentioned gaps in the literature, the present study aimed to compare neurocognitive functioning of male and female adolescents in the context of cannabis and alcohol use, while employing a longitudinal design with multiple repeated measurements. Participants were 3,826 high school students (47% female; mean age, 12.7), who were recruited from 31 high schools in the greater Montreal area. Participants were requested to complete annual surveys for five consecutive years, from 7th to 11th grade, assessing their alcohol/cannabis use and neurocognitive functioning (working memory, delayed recall memory, perceptual reasoning, and inhibition control). The analytical strategy focused on the longitudinal association between each predictor (female, male) and each of the outcomes (domains of neurocognitive functioning). Multilevel linear models assessed the association of alcohol and cannabis consumption and the four domains of neurocognitive functioning. Results revealed a gender by within-subject interaction, suggesting a weaker effect of yearly fluctuation of cannabis use on working memory among males compared to females. Our findings suggest a different pattern of neurocognitive impairment of female and male working memory after using cannabis over the course of adolescence. Early initiation of cannabis use potentially results in more spatial working memory deficits in female adolescents. This may negatively influence young females’ capacity in academic settings and lead to significant impairment in adulthood, which critically decreases the individual’s quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Assessing the Effectiveness of Automated Emotion Recognition in Adults and Children for Clinical Investigation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00070</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent success stories in automated object or face recognition, partly fuelled by deep learning artificial neural network (ANN) architectures, have led to the advancement of biometric research platforms and, to some extent, the resurrection of Artificial Intelligence (AI). In line with this general trend, inter-disciplinary approaches have been taken to automate the recognition of emotions in adults or children for the benefit of various applications, such as identification of children's emotions prior to a clinical investigation. Within this context, it turns out that automating emotion recognition is far from being straightforward, with several challenges arising for both science (e.g., methodology underpinned by psychology) and technology (e.g., the iMotions biometric research platform). In this paper, we present a methodology and experiment and some interesting findings, which raise the following research questions for the recognition of emotions and attention in humans: (a) the adequacy of well-established techniques such as the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), (b) the adequacy of state-of-the-art biometric research platforms, (c) the extent to which emotional responses may be different in children and adults. Our findings and first attempts to answer some of these research questions are based on a mixed sample of adults and children who took part in the experiment, resulting in a statistical analysis of numerous variables. These are related to both automatically and interactively captured responses of participants to a sample of IAPS pictures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Human Neural Stem Cell Induced Functional Network Stabilization After Cortical Stroke: A Longitudinal Resting-State fMRI Study in Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00086</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Most stroke studies dealing with functional deficits and assessing stem cell therapy produce extensive hemispheric damage and can be seen as a model for severe clinical strokes. However, mild strokes have a better prospect for functional recovery. Recently, anatomic and behavioral changes have been reported for distal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), generating a well-circumscribed and small cortical lesion, which can thus be proposed as mild to moderate cortical stroke. Using this cortical stroke model of moderate severity in the nude mouse, we have studied the functional networks with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for 12 weeks following stroke induction. Further, human neural stem cells (hNSCs) were implanted adjacent to the ischemic lesion, and the stable graft vitality was monitored with bioluminescence imaging (BLI). Differentiation of the grafted neural stem cells was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and by patch-clamp electrophysiology. Following stroke induction, we found a pronounced and continuously rising hypersynchronicity of the sensorimotor networks including both hemispheres, in contrast to the severe stroke filament model where profound reduction of the functional connectivity had been reported by us earlier. The vitality of grafted neural stem cells remained stable throughout the whole 12 weeks observation period. In the stem cell treated animals, functional connectivity did not show hypersynchronicity but was globally slightly reduced below baseline at 2 weeks post-stroke, normalizing thereafter completely. Our resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) studies on cortical stroke reveal for the first time a hypersynchronicity of the functional brain networks. This hypersynchronicity appears as a hallmark of mild cortical strokes, in contrast to severe strokes with striatal involvement where exclusively hyposynchronicity has been reported. The effect of the stem cell graft was an early and persistent normalization of the functional sensorimotor networks across the whole brain. These novel functional results may help interpret future outcome investigations after stroke and demonstrate the highly promising potential of stem cell treatment for functional outcome improvement after stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00079</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Myelination is an essential process that consists of the ensheathment of axons by myelin. In the central nervous system (CNS), myelin is synthesized by oligodendrocytes. The proliferation, migration, and differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells constitute a prerequisite before mature oligodendrocytes extend their processes around the axons and progressively generate a multilamellar lipidic sheath. Although myelination is predominately driven by oligodendrocytes, the other glial cells including astrocytes and microglia, also contribute to this process. The present review is an update of the most recent emerging mechanisms involving astrocyte and microglia in myelin production. The contribution of these cells will be first described during developmental myelination that occurs in the early postnatal period and is critical for the proper development of cognition and behavior. Then, we will report the novel findings regarding the beneficial or deleterious effects of astroglia and microglia, which respectively promote or impair the endogenous capacity of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) to induce spontaneous remyelination after myelin loss. Acute delineation of astrocyte and microglia activities and cross-talk should uncover the way towards novel therapeutic perspectives aimed at recovering proper myelination during development or at breaking down the barriers impeding the regeneration of the damaged myelin that occurs in CNS demyelinating diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: A Brain Signaling Framework for Stress-Induced Depression and Ketamine Treatment Elucidated by Phosphoproteomics</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00048</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Depression is a common affective disorder characterized by significant and persistent low mood. Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, is reported to have a rapid and durable antidepressant effect, but the mechanisms are unclear. Protein phosphorylation is a post-translational modification that plays a crucial role in cell signaling. Thus, we present a phosphoproteomics approach to investigate the mechanisms underlying stress-induced depression and the rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine in mice. We analyzed the phosphoprotein changes induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and ketamine treatment in two known mood control centers, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc). We initially obtained &amp;gt;8,000 phosphorylation sites. Quantitation revealed 3,988 sites from the mPFC and 3,196 sites from the NAc. Further analysis revealed that changes in synaptic transmission-related signaling are a common feature. Notably, CUMS-induced changes were reversed by ketamine treatment, as shown by the analysis of commonly altered sites. Ketamine also induced specific changes, such as alterations in synapse organization, synaptic transmission, and enzyme binding. Collectively, our findings establish a signaling framework for stress-induced depression and the rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Impairs Amyloid Beta Degradation in a Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 Dependent Manner</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00092</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Despite the extensive use of hormonal methods as either contraception or menopausal hormone therapy (HT), there is very little known about the potential effects of these compounds on the cellular processes of the brain. Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (MPA) is a progestogen used globally in the hormonal contraceptive, Depo Provera, by women in their reproductive prime and is a major compound found in HT formulations used by menopausal women. MPA promotes changes in the circulating levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), such as MMP-9, in the endometrium, yet limited literature studying the effects of MPA on neurons and astroglia cells has been conducted. Additionally, the dysregulation of MMPs has been implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), where inhibiting the secretion of MMP-9 from astroglia reduces the proteolytic degradation of amyloid-beta. Thus, we hypothesize that exposure to MPA disrupts proteolytic degradation of amyloid-beta through the downregulation of MMP-9 expression and subsequent secretion. To assess the effect of progestins on MMP-9 and amyloid-beta, in vitro, C6 rat glial cells were exposed to MPA for 48 h and then the enzymatic, secretory, and amyloid-beta degrading capacity of MMP-9 was assessed from the conditioned culture medium. We found that MPA treatment inhibited transcription of MMP-9, which resulted in a subsequent decrease in the production and secretion of MMP-9 protein, in part through the glucocorticoid receptor. Additionally, we investigated the consequences of amyloid beta-degrading activity and found that MPA treatment decreased proteolytic degradation of amyloid-beta. Our results suggest MPA suppresses amyloid-beta degradation in an MMP-9-dependent manner, in vitro, and potentially compromises the clearance of amyloid-beta in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>We report the in vivo regulation of Inosine-5´-monophosphate dehydrogenase 1 (IMPDH1) in the retina. IMPDH1 catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides, impacting the cellular pools of GMP, GDP and GTP. Guanine nucleotide homeostasis is central to photoreceptor cells, where cGMP is the signal transducing molecule in the light response. Mutations in IMPDH1 lead to inherited blindness. We unveil a light-dependent phosphorylation of retinal IMPDH1 at Thr&lt;sup&gt;159&lt;/sup&gt;/Ser&lt;sup&gt;160&lt;/sup&gt; in the Bateman domain that desensitizes the enzyme to allosteric inhibition by GDP/GTP. When exposed to bright light, living mice increase the rate of GTP and ATP synthesis in their retinas; concomitant with IMPDH1 aggregate formation at the outer segment layer. Inhibiting IMPDH activity in living mice delays rod mass recovery. We unveil a novel mechanism of regulation of IMPDH1 in vivo, important for understanding GTP homeostasis in the retina and the pathogenesis of adRP10 IMPDH1 mutations.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Synaptic positions underlie precise circuit connectivity. Synaptic positions can be established during embryogenesis and sustained during growth. The mechanisms that sustain synaptic specificity during allometric growth are largely unknown. We performed forward genetic screens in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; for regulators of this process and identified &lt;i&gt;mig-17&lt;/i&gt;, a conserved ADAMTS metalloprotease. Proteomic mass spectrometry, cell biological and genetic studies demonstrate that MIG-17 is secreted from cells like muscles to regulate basement membrane proteins. In the nematode brain, the basement membrane does not directly contact synapses. Instead, muscle-derived basement membrane coats one side of the glia, while glia contact synapses on their other side. MIG-17 modifies the muscle-derived basement membrane to modulate epidermal-glial crosstalk and sustain glia location and morphology during growth. Glia position in turn sustains the synaptic pattern established during embryogenesis. Our findings uncover a muscle-epidermis-glia signaling axis that sustains synaptic specificity during the organism’s allometric growth.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Dedifferentiation is a critical response to tissue damage, yet is not well understood, even at a basic phenomenological level. Developing &lt;i&gt;Dictyostelium &lt;/i&gt;cells undergo highly efficient dedifferentiation, completed by most cells within 24 hours. We use this rapid response to investigate the control features of dedifferentiation, combining single cell imaging with high temporal resolution transcriptomics. Gene expression during dedifferentiation was predominantly a simple reversal of developmental changes, with expression changes not following this pattern primarily associated with ribosome biogenesis. Mutation of genes induced early in dedifferentiation did not strongly perturb the reversal of development. This apparent robustness may arise from adaptability of cells: the relative temporal ordering of cell and molecular events was not absolute, suggesting cell programmes reach the same end using different mechanisms. In addition, although cells start from different fates, they rapidly converged on a single expression trajectory. These regulatory features may contribute to dedifferentiation responses during regeneration.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55207</link>
	<content:encoded>Bulk whole genome sequencing (WGS) enables the analysis of tumor evolution but, because of depth limitations, can only identify old mutational events. The discovery of current mutational processes for predicting the tumor's evolutionary trajectory requires dense sequencing of individual clones or single cells. Such studies, however, are inherently problematic because of the discovery of excessive false positive mutations when sequencing picogram quantities of DNA. Data pooling to increase the confidence in the discovered mutations, moves the discovery back in the past to a common ancestor. Here we report a robust whole genome sequencing and analysis pipeline (DigiPico/MutLX) that virtually eliminates all false positive results while retaining an excellent proportion of true positives. Using our method, we identified, for the first time, a hyper-mutation (kataegis) event in a group of ∼30 cancer cells from a recurrent ovarian carcinoma. This was unidentifiable from the bulk WGS data. Overall, we propose DigiPico/MutLX method as a powerful framework for the identification of clone-specific variants at an unprecedented accuracy.</content:encoded>

Here we report a role for the condensin I subunit Cap-G in Drosophila neurons. We show that, despite not requiring condensin for mitotic chromosome compaction, post-mitotic neurons express Cap-G. Knockdown of Cap-G specifically in neurons (from their birth onwards) results in developmental arrest, behavioural defects, and dramatic gene expression changes, including reduced expression of a subset of neuronal genes and aberrant expression of genes that are not normally expressed in the developing brain. Knockdown of Cap-G in mature neurons results in similar phenotypes but to a lesser degree. Furthermore, we see dynamic binding of Cap-G at distinct loci in progenitor cells and differentiated neurons. Therefore, Cap-G is essential for proper gene expression in neurons and plays an important role during the early stages of neuronal development.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Endogenous itaconate is not required for particulate matter-induced NRF2 expression or inflammatory response</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54877</link>
	<content:encoded>Particulate matter (PM) air pollution causes cardiopulmonary mortality via macrophage-driven lung inflammation; however, the mechanisms are incompletely understood. RNA-sequencing demonstrated &lt;i&gt;Acod1 &lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;Aconitate decarboxylase 1&lt;/i&gt;) as one of the top genes induced by PM in macrophages. &lt;i&gt;Acod1&lt;/i&gt; encodes a mitochondrial enzyme that produces itaconate, which was shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects via NRF2 after LPS. Here, we demonstrate that PM induces Acod1 and itaconate, which reduced mitochondrial respiration via complex II inhibition. Using &lt;i&gt;Acod1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/- &lt;/sup&gt;mice, we found that Acod1/endogenous itaconate does not affect PM-induced inflammation or NRF2 activation in macrophages &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. In contrast, exogenous cell permeable itaconate, 4-octyl itaconate (OI) attenuated PM-induced inflammation in macrophages. OI was sufficient to activate NRF2 in macrophages; however, NRF2 was not required for the anti-inflammatory effects of OI. We conclude that the effects of itaconate production on inflammation are stimulus-dependent, and that there are important differences between endogenous and exogenously-applied itaconate.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Evolution of multifunctionality through a pleiotropic substitution in the innate immune protein S100A9</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54100</link>
	<content:encoded>Multifunctional proteins are evolutionary puzzles: how do proteins evolve to satisfy multiple functional constraints? S100A9 is one such multifunctional protein. It potently amplifies inflammation via Toll-like receptor 4 and is antimicrobial as part of a heterocomplex with S100A8. These two functions are seemingly regulated by proteolysis: S100A9 is readily degraded, while S100A8/S100A9 is resistant. We take an evolutionary biochemical approach to show that S100A9 evolved both functions and lost proteolytic resistance from a weakly proinflammatory, proteolytically resistant amniote ancestor. We identify a historical substitution that has pleiotropic effects on S100A9 proinflammatory activity and proteolytic resistance but has little effect on S100A8/S100A9 antimicrobial activity. We thus propose that mammals evolved S100A8/S100A9 antimicrobial and S100A9 proinflammatory activities concomitantly with a proteolytic 'timer' to selectively regulate S100A9. This highlights how the same mutation can have pleiotropic effects on one functional state of a protein but not another, thus facilitating the evolution of multifunctionality.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53898</link>
	<content:encoded>Rough-skinned newts (&lt;i&gt;Taricha granulosa&lt;/i&gt;) use tetrodotoxin (TTX) to block voltage-gated sodium (Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) channels as a chemical defense against predation. Interestingly, newts exhibit extreme population-level variation in toxicity attributed to a coevolutionary arms race with TTX-resistant predatory snakes, but the source of TTX in newts is unknown. Here, we investigated whether symbiotic bacteria isolated from toxic newts could produce TTX. We characterized the skin-associated microbiota from a toxic and non-toxic population of newts and established pure cultures of isolated bacterial symbionts from toxic newts. We then screened bacterial culture media for TTX using LC-MS/MS and identified TTX-producing bacterial strains from four genera, including &lt;i&gt;Aeromonas&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Shewanella&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Sphingopyxis&lt;/i&gt;. Additionally, we sequenced the Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; channel gene family in toxic newts and found that newts expressed Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; channels with modified TTX binding sites, conferring extreme physiological resistance to TTX. This study highlights the complex interactions among adaptive physiology, animal-bacterial symbiosis, and ecological context.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53582</link>
	<content:encoded>Meibum lipids form a lipid layer on the outermost side of the tear film and function to prevent water evaporation and reduce surface tension. (&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-Acyl)-ω-hydroxy fatty acids (OAHFAs), a subclass of these lipids, are thought to be involved in connecting the lipid and aqueous layers in tears, although their actual function and synthesis pathway have to date remained unclear. Here, we reveal that the fatty acid ω-hydroxylase &lt;i&gt;Cyp4f39&lt;/i&gt; is involved in OAHFA production. &lt;i&gt;Cyp4f39&lt;/i&gt;-deficient mice exhibited damaged corneal epithelium and shortening of tear film break-up time, both indicative of dry eye disease. In addition, tears accumulated on the lower eyelid side, indicating increased tear surface tension. In &lt;i&gt;Cyp4f39&lt;/i&gt;-deficient mice, the production of wax diesters (type 1ω and 2ω) and cholesteryl OAHFAs was also impaired. These OAHFA derivatives show intermediate polarity among meibum lipids, suggesting that OAHFAs and their derivatives contribute to lipid polarity gradient formation for tear film stabilization.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53552</link>
	<content:encoded>Controlling gain of cortical activity is essential to modulate weights between internal ongoing communication and external sensory drive. Here, we show that serotonergic input has separable suppressive effects on the gain of ongoing and evoked visual activity. We combined optogenetic stimulation of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) with wide-field calcium imaging, extracellular recordings, and iontophoresis of serotonin (5-HT) receptor antagonists in the mouse visual cortex. 5-HT1A receptors promote divisive suppression of spontaneous activity, while 5-HT2A receptors act divisively on visual response gain and largely account for normalization of population responses over a range of visual contrasts in awake and anesthetized states. Thus, 5-HT input provides balanced but distinct suppressive effects on ongoing and evoked activity components across neuronal populations. Imbalanced 5-HT1A/2A activation, either through receptor-specific drug intake, genetically predisposed irregular 5-HT receptor density, or change in sensory bombardment may enhance internal broadcasts and reduce sensory drive and vice versa.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53518</link>
	<content:encoded>Wiring a complex brain requires many neurons with intricate cell specificity, generated by a limited number of neural stem cells. &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; central brain lineages are a predetermined series of neurons, born in a specific order. To understand how lineage identity translates to neuron morphology, we mapped 18 &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; central brain lineages. While we found large aggregate differences between lineages, we also discovered shared patterns of morphological diversification. Lineage identity plus Notch-mediated sister fate govern primary neuron trajectories, whereas temporal fate diversifies terminal elaborations. Further, morphological neuron types may arise repeatedly, interspersed with other types. Despite the complexity, related lineages produce similar neuron types in comparable temporal patterns. Different stem cells even yield two identical series of dopaminergic neuron types, but with unrelated sister neurons. Together, these phenomena suggest that straightforward rules drive incredible neuronal complexity, and that large changes in morphology can result from relatively simple fating mechanisms.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53449</link>
	<content:encoded>Heritability of human lifespan is 23-33% as evident from twin studies.                    Genome-wide association studies explored this question by linking particular                    alleles to lifespan traits. However, genetic variants identified so far can                    explain only a small fraction of lifespan heritability in humans. Here, we                    report that the burden of rarest protein-truncating variants (PTVs) in two large                    cohorts is negatively associated with human healthspan and lifespan, accounting                    for 0.4 and 1.3 years of their variability, respectively. In addition,                    longer-living individuals possess both fewer rarest PTVs and less damaging PTVs.                    We further find that somatic accumulation of PTVs accounts for only a small                    fraction of mortality and morbidity acceleration and hence is unlikely to be                    causal in aging. We conclude that rare damaging mutations, both inherited and                    accumulated throughout life, contribute to the aging process, and that burden of                    ultra-rare variants in combination with common alleles better explain apparent                    heritability of human lifespan.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53191</link>
	<content:encoded>Goal-directed attention is usually studied by providing individuals with explicit instructions on what they should attend to. But in daily life, we often use past experiences to guide our attentional states. Given the importance of memory for predicting upcoming events, we hypothesized that memory-guided attention is supported by neural preparation for anticipated attentional states. We examined preparatory coding in the human hippocampus and mPFC, two regions that are important for memory-guided behaviors, in two tasks: one where attention was guided by memory and another in which attention was explicitly instructed. Hippocampus and mPFC exhibited higher activity for memory-guided vs. explicitly instructed attention. Furthermore, representations in both regions contained information about upcoming attentional states. In the hippocampus, this preparation was stronger for memory-guided attention, and occurred alongside stronger coupling with visual cortex during attentional guidance. These results highlight the mechanisms by which memories are used to prepare for upcoming attentional goals.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/52187</link>
	<content:encoded>In diverse organisms, nanostructures that coherently scatter light create structural color, but how such structures are built remains mysterious. We investigate the evolution and genetic regulation of butterfly scale laminae, which are simple photonic nanostructures. In a lineage of buckeye butterflies artificially selected for blue wing color, we found that thickened laminae caused a color shift from brown to blue. Deletion of the &lt;i&gt;optix&lt;/i&gt; patterning gene also altered color via lamina thickening, revealing shared regulation of pigments and lamina thickness. Finally, we show how lamina thickness variation contributes to the color diversity that distinguishes sexes and species throughout the genus &lt;i&gt;Junonia&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, quantitatively tuning one dimension of scale architecture facilitates both the microevolution and macroevolution of a broad spectrum of hues. Because the lamina is an intrinsic component of typical butterfly scales, our findings suggest that tuning lamina thickness is an available mechanism to create structural color across the Lepidoptera.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/51712</link>
	<content:encoded>Phytochemical diversity is thought to result from coevolutionary cycles as specialization in herbivores imposes diversifying selection on plant chemical defenses. Plants in the speciose genus &lt;i&gt;Erysimum&lt;/i&gt; (Brassicaceae) produce both ancestral glucosinolates and evolutionarily novel cardenolides as defenses. Here we test macroevolutionary hypotheses on co-expression, co-regulation, and diversification of these potentially redundant defenses across this genus. We sequenced and assembled the genome of &lt;i&gt;E. cheiranthoides&lt;/i&gt; and foliar transcriptomes of 47 additional &lt;i&gt;Erysimum&lt;/i&gt; species to construct a phylogeny from 9,869 orthologous genes, revealing several geographic clades but also high levels gene discordance. Concentrations, inducibility, and diversity of the two defenses varied independently among species, with no evidence for trade-offs. Closely related, geographically co-occurring species shared similar cardenolide traits, but not glucosinolate traits, likely as a result of specific selective pressures acting on each defense. Ancestral and novel chemical defenses in &lt;i&gt;Erysimum&lt;/i&gt; thus appear to provide complementary rather than redundant functions.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/51593</link>
	<content:encoded>Psychological theories of suicide suggest that certain traits may reduce aversion to physical threat and increase the probability of transitioning from suicidal ideation to action. Here, we investigated whether blunted sensitivity to bodily signals is associated with suicidal action by comparing individuals with a history of attempted suicide to a matched psychiatric reference sample without suicide attempts. We examined interoceptive processing across a panel of tasks: breath-hold challenge, cold-pressor challenge, and heartbeat perception during and outside of functional magnetic resonance imaging. Suicide attempters tolerated the breath-hold and cold-pressor challenges for significantly longer and displayed lower heartbeat perception accuracy than non-attempters. These differences were mirrored by reduced activation of the mid/posterior insula during attention to heartbeat sensations. Our findings suggest that suicide attempters exhibit an ‘interoceptive numbing’ characterized by increased tolerance for aversive sensations and decreased awareness of non-aversive sensations. We conclude that blunted interoception may be implicated in suicidal behavior.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/44571</link>
	<content:encoded>Mammalian cells typically start the cell-cycle entry program by activating cyclin-dependent protein kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6). CDK4/6 activity is clinically relevant as mutations, deletions, and amplifications that increase CDK4/6 activity contribute to the progression of many cancers. However, when CDK4/6 is activated relative to CDK2 remained incompletely understood. Here we developed a reporter system to simultaneously monitor CDK4/6 and CDK2 activities in single cells and found that CDK4/6 activity increases rapidly before CDK2 activity gradually increases, and that CDK4/6 activity can be active after mitosis or inactive for variable time periods. Markedly, stress signals in G1 can rapidly inactivate CDK4/6 to return cells to quiescence but with reduced probability as cells approach S phase. Together, our study reveals a regulation of G1 length by temporary inactivation of CDK4/6 activity after mitosis, and a progressively increasing persistence in CDK4/6 activity that restricts cells from returning to quiescence as cells approach S phase.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Physical and mental health characteristics of adults with subjective cognitive decline: A study of 3,407 people aged 18-81 years from an MTurk-based U.S. national sample</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.07.029553v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), or internal feelings of reduced mental capacity, is of increasing interest in the scientific, clinical, and lay community. Much of the extant literature is focused on SCD as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease in older adults, while less attention has been paid to non-cognitive health correlates of SCD across adulthood. Consequently, we investigated physical and mental health correlates of SCD in younger, middle-aged, and older adults. We recruited 3,407 U.S. residents through Amazon's Mechanical Turk, an online labor market. Participants completed a 90-item self-report survey questionnaire assessing sociodemographic characteristics, physical health, sleep, depression, anxiety, loneliness, wisdom, self-efficacy, and happiness. Overall, 493/1930 (25.5%) of younger adults (18-49) and 278/1032 (26.9%) of older adults (50 or older) endorsed the SCD item. Multivariate analysis of variance and follow-up t -tests revealed worse physical and mental health characteristics in people endorsing SCD compared to those who did not, with effect sizes primarily in the medium to large range. Additionally, age did not moderate relationships between SCD and physical and mental health. Results suggest that SCD is associated with a diverse set of negative health characteristics such as poor sleep and high body mass index, and lower levels of positive factors including happiness and wisdom. Effect sizes of psychological correlates of SCD were as large as (or larger than) those of physical correlates, indicating that mental health and affective symptoms may be critical to consider when evaluating SCD. Overall, findings from this large, national U.S. sample suggest the presence of relationships between SCD and multiple psychological and perceived health factors; our results also show that SCD may be highly prevalent in both younger and older adults, suggesting that it be assessed across the adult lifespan.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The control of plastic inhibition over excitatory synaptic plasticity leads to the joint emergence of sensory coding and contrast invariance.</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.07.029157v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Visual stimuli are represented by a highly efficient code in the primary visual cortex, but the development of this code is still unclear. Two distinct factors control coding efficiency: Representational efficiency, which is determined by neuronal tuning diversity, and metabolic efficiency, which is influenced by neuronal gain. How these determinants of coding efficiency are shaped during development, supported by excitatory and inhibitory plasticity, is only partially understood. We investigate a fully plastic spiking network of the primary visual cortex, building on phenomenological plasticity rules. Our results show that inhibitory plasticity is key to the emergence of tuning diversity and accurate input encoding. Additionally, inhibitory feedback increases the metabolic efficiency by implementing a gain control mechanism. Interestingly, this led to the spontaneous emergence of contrast-invariant tuning curves. Our findings highlight the role of interneuron plasticity during the development of receptive fields and in shaping sensory representations.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Distinct target-specific mechanisms homeostatically stabilize transmission at pre-and post-synaptic compartments</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.07.029108v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Neurons must establish and stabilize connections made with diverse targets, each with distinct demands and functional characteristics. At Drosophila neuromuscular junctions, synaptic strength remains stable in a manipulation that simultaneously induces hypo-innervation on one target and hyper-innervation on the other. However, the expression mechanisms that achieve this exquisite target-specific homeostatic control remain enigmatic. Here, we identify the distinct target-specific homeostatic expression mechanisms. On the hypo-innervated target, an increase in postsynaptic glutamate receptor (GluR) abundance is sufficient to compensate for reduced innervation, without any apparent presynaptic adaptations. In contrast, a target-specific reduction in presynaptic neurotransmitter release probability is reflected by a decrease in active zone components restricted to terminals of hyper-innervated targets. Finally, loss of postsynaptic GluRs on one target induces a compartmentalized, homeostatic enhancement of presynaptic neurotransmitter release called presynaptic homeostatic potentiation that can be precisely balanced with the adaptations required for both hypo- and hyper-innervation to maintain stable synaptic strength. Thus, distinct anterograde and retrograde signaling systems operate at pre- and post-synaptic compartments to enable target-specific, homeostatic control of neurotransmission.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Unsupervised Learning Predicts Human Perception and Misperception of Specular Surface Reflectance</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.07.026120v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Gloss perception is a challenging visual inference that requires disentangling the contributions of reflectance, lighting, and shape to the retinal image. Learning to see gloss must somehow proceed without labelled training data as no other sensory signals can provide the 'ground truth' required for supervised learning. We reasoned that paradoxically, we may learn to infer distal scene properties, like gloss, by learning to compress and predict spatial structure in proximal image data. We hypothesised that such unsupervised learning might explain both successes and failures of human gloss perception, where classical 'inverse optics' cannot. To test this, we trained unsupervised neural networks to model the pixel statistics of renderings of glossy surfaces and compared the resulting representations with human gloss judgments. The trained networks spontaneously cluster images according to underlying scene properties such as specular reflectance, shape and illumination, despite receiving no explicit information about them. More importantly, we find that linearly decoding specular reflectance from the model's internal code predicts human perception and misperception of glossiness on an image-by-image basis better than the true physical reflectance does, better than supervised networks explicitly trained to estimate specular reflectance, and better than alternative image statistic and dimensionality-reduction models. Indeed, the unsupervised networks correctly predict well-known illusions of gloss perception caused by interactions between surface relief and lighting which the supervised models totally fail to predict. Our findings suggest that unsupervised learning may explain otherwise inexplicable errors in surface perception, with broader implications for how biological brains learn to see the outside world.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.06.028829v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The firing pattern of ventral midbrain dopamine neurons is controlled by afferent and intrinsic activity to generate prediction error signals that are essential for reward-based learning. Given the absence of intracellular in vivo recordings in the last three decades, the subthreshold membrane potential events that cause changes in dopamine neuron firing patterns remain unknown. By establishing stable in vivo whole-cell recordings of &amp;gt;100 spontaneously active midbrain dopamine neurons in anaesthetized mice, we identified the repertoire of subthreshold membrane potential signatures associated with distinct in vivo firing patterns. We demonstrate that in vivo activity of dopamine neurons deviates from a single spike pacemaker pattern by eliciting transient increases in firing rate generated by at least two diametrically opposing biophysical mechanisms: a transient depolarization resulting in high frequency plateau bursts associated with a reactive depolarizing shift in action potential threshold, and a prolonged hyperpolarization preceding slower rebound bursts characterized by a predictive hyperpolarizing shift in action potential threshold. Our findings therefore illustrate a framework for the biophysical implementation of prediction error coding in dopamine neurons by tuning action potential threshold dynamics.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Dendrites shape information flow in neurons. Yet, there is little consensus on the level of spatial complexity at which they operate. We present a flexible and fast method to obtain simplified neuron models at any level of complexity. Through carefully chosen parameter fits, solvable in the least squares sense, we obtain optimal reduced compartmental models. We show that (back-propagating) action potentials, calcium-spikes and NMDA-spikes can all be reproduced with few compartments. We also investigate whether afferent spatial connectivity motifs admit simplification by ablating targeted branches and grouping the affected synapses onto the next proximal dendrite. We find that voltage in the remaining branches is reproduced if temporal conductance fluctuations stay below a limit that depends on the average difference in input impedance between the ablated branches and the next proximal dendrite. Further, our methodology fits reduced models directly from experimental data, without requiring morphological reconstructions. We provide a software toolbox that automatizes the simplification, eliminating a common hurdle towards including dendritic computations in network models.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.06.028084v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Parkinson disease is characterized by loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra. As with other neurodegenerative diseases, no disease modifying treatments exist. While most treatment objectives aim to prevent neuronal loss or protect vulnerable neuronal circuits, an important alternative is to replace lost neurons to reconstruct disrupted circuits. Herein we report an efficient single-step conversion of isolated mouse and human astrocytes into functional neurons by depleting the RNA binding protein PTB. Applying this approach to mice with a chemically induced Parkinson phenotype, we provide evidence that disease manifestations can be potently reversed through converting astrocytes into new substantia nigral neurons, effectively restoring dopamine levels via reestablishing the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway. We further demonstrate similar disease reversal with a therapeutically feasible approach using antisense oligonucleotides to transiently suppress PTB. These findings identify a generalizable therapeutic strategy for treating neurodegenerative disorders through replacing lost neurons in the brain.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Rewarding choice options typically contain multiple components, but neural signals vary in one dimension (up or down). We used rigorous concepts of Revealed Preference Theory to investigate how scalar neural responses represent vectorial rewards. Each reward constituted a bundle containing the same two milkshakes with independently set amounts. Using psychophysics, we estimated stochastic choice indifference curves (IC) that reflected the orderly integration of the bundle components. All bundles on same ICs were equally revealed preferred (choice indifference); bundles on higher ICs were preferred to bundles on lower ICs. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) demonstrated brain responses in reward-related brain structures, including striatum, midbrain and medial orbitofrontal cortex. These responses followed the characteristic revealed preference pattern: similar responses along ICs, but monotonic change across ICs. Thus, the striatum, midbrain and medial orbitofrontal cortex integrate multiple reward components into a scalar reward signal beyond known subjective value coding.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.06.027995v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Mecp2 deficiency, the gene responsible for Rett syndrome (RTT), affects brain maturation by impairing neuronal activity, transcription and morphology. These three elements are physiologically linked in a feed-forward cycle where neuronal activity modulates transcription and morphology to further increase network maturity. We hypothesized that the reduced activity displayed by maturing Mecp2 null neurons during development could perturb such cycle, sustaining an improper transcriptional program that, ultimately, impairs neuronal maturation. Accordingly, we show that by enhancing activity within an early time window, Ampakine redirects, in vitro, the development of null neuronal networks towards more physiological routes. Similarly, the administration of the drug to newborn null offspring delays the progression of symptoms, significantly prolonging life span. Our data highlights the role of altered neuronal activity during the establishment of Mecp2 null networks and the importance of such early defects to the typically poor maturity of RTT brain functions in adulthood. We propose the existence of an &quot;early molecular phase&quot; of Rett syndrome, a detailed description of which might disclose relevant targets for new rescue treatments.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Making predictions about future rewards or punishments is fundamental to adaptive behavior. These processes are influenced by prior experience. For example, prior exposure to aversive stimuli or stressors changes behavioral responses to negative- and positive-value predictive cues. Here, we demonstrate a role for medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) neurons projecting to the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT; mPFC[-&amp;gt;]PVT) in this process. We found that a history of punishments negatively biased behavioral responses to motivationally-relevant stimuli in mice and that this negative bias was associated with hyperactivity in mPFC[-&amp;gt;]PVT neurons during exposure to those cues. Furthermore, artificially mimicking this hyperactive response with selective optogenetic excitation of the same pathway recapitulated the punishment-induced negative behavioral bias. Together, our results highlight how information flow within the mPFC[-&amp;gt;]PVT circuit is critical for making predictions about imminent motivationally-relevant outcomes as a function of prior experience.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Genetic variation is a primary determinant of phenotypic diversity within populations. In laboratory mice, genetic variation has often been regarded as a serious experimental confounder, and thus minimized through inbreeding. However, generalizations of results obtained with inbred strains need to be made with caution. Effects of genetic background on traits need to be controlled, especially when working with complex phenotypes and disease models. Here we compared behavioral parameters of C57Bl/6, the mouse strain most widely used for biomedical research, with those of 129S4. Our data demonstrate high within-strain and intra-litter behavioral hyperactivity in C57Bl/6. In contrast, 129S4 had relatively consistent activity levels throughout life. This consistency would be advantageous for studying neurodegeneration and aging, when mice need to be analyzed for long periods. However, the majority of mouse models and transgenic tools are on a C57Bl/6 background. We recently established six popular Cre driver lines and two Cre effector lines in 129S4. To augment this collection, we genetically engineered a Cre mouse line to study astrocytes directly in 129S4, which we describe here. For functional validation, it was crossed with two Cre effector lines, each in a different genomic locus, and showed in both cases that it was functional and astrocyte-specific. Calcium currents studied with gCaMP5g-tdTomato were more heterogenous, lasted longer and had a higher amplitude in cortical compared to hippocampal astrocytes. Translatomes studied with RiboTag revealed that some genes thought to mark neurons are also expressed in astrocytes, that genes linked to a single neurodegenerative disease have highly divergent expression patterns, and that ribosome proteins are non-uniformly expressed across brain regions and cell types.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Stress responses are conserved physiological and behavioral outcomes as a result of facing potentially harmful stimuli, yet in pathological states, stress becomes debilitating. Stress responses vary considerably throughout the animal kingdom, but how these responses are shaped evolutionarily is unknown. The Mexican cavefish has emerged as a powerful system for examining genetic principles underlying behavioral evolution. Here, we demonstrate that cave Astyanax have reduced behavioral and physiological measures of stress when examined at larval stages. We also find increased expression of the glucocorticoid receptor, a repressible element of the neuroendocrine stress pathway. Additionally, we examine stress in three different cave populations, and find that some, but not all, show reduced stress measures. Together, these results reveal a mechanistic system by which cave-dwelling fish reduced stress, presumably to compensate for a predator poor environment.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.06.027508v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Prism adaptation is a well-known experimental procedure to study sensorimotor plasticity. It has been shown that following prism exposure, after-effects are not only restricted to the sensorimotor level but extend as well to spatial cognition. In the present study, we used a visuo-motor rotation task which approaches the perturbations induced by prism exposure. We induced either leftward or rightward 15-degree rotations and we presented the perturbation either abruptly (from one trial to the next) or gradually (over a 34-trial transition). First, we found that none of the conditions produced cognitive after-effects in perceptive line bisection task. This result has a strong methodological impact for prospective investigations focusing on sensorimotor plasticity while sparing space cognition; it is particularly relevant when investigating sensorimotor plasticity in patients with specific representational feature to preserve from aggravation. Second, another interesting result was the increase of the sensitivity with which we discriminate the center of the line, that we propose to call representational acuity. It improved following the perturbation more particularly after gradual exposure and persisted for some time after the sensorimotor adaptation. These innovative results are discussed in terms of sensorimotor processes underpinning the transfer of visuo-motor plasticity to spatial cognition.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.05.026419v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Why do people often exhaust unregulated common (shared) natural resources but manage to preserve similar private resources? To answer this question, in the present work we combine a neurobiological, economic, and cognitive modeling approach. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging on 50 participants, we show that sharp depletion of common and private resources is associated with deactivation of the ventral striatum, a brain region involved in the valuation of outcomes. Across individuals, when facing a common resource, ventral striatal activity is anti-correlated with resource preservation (less harvesting), whereas with private resources the opposite pattern is observed. This indicates that neural value signals distinctly modulate behavior in response to the depletion of common versus private resources. Computational modeling suggest that over-harvesting of common resources is facilitated by the modulatory effect of social comparison on value signals. In sum, the results provide an explanation of people's tendency to over-exploit unregulated common natural resources.</content:encoded>

Transcriptomic profiling is an immensely powerful hypothesis generating tool. However, accurately predicting the transcription factors (TFs) and cofactors that drive transcriptomic differences between samples is challenging. A number of algorithms draw on ChIP-seq tracks to define TFs and cofactors behind gene changes. These approaches assign TFs and cofactors to genes via a binary designation of ‘target’, or ‘non-target’ followed by Fisher Exact Tests to assess enrichment of TFs and cofactors. ENCODE archives 2314 ChIP-seq tracks of 684 TFs and cofactors assayed across a 117 human cell lines under a multitude of growth and maintenance conditions. The algorithm presented herein, Mining Algorithm for GenetIc Controllers (MAGIC), uses ENCODE ChIP-seq data to look for statistical enrichment of TFs and cofactors in gene bodies and flanking regions in gene lists without an &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; binary classification of genes as targets or non-targets. When compared to other TF mining resources, MAGIC displayed favourable performance in predicting TFs and cofactors that drive gene changes in 4 settings: 1) A cell line expressing or lacking single TF, 2) Breast tumors divided along PAM50 designations 3) Whole brain samples from WT mice or mice lacking a single TF in a particular neuronal subtype 4) Single cell RNAseq analysis of neurons divided by Immediate Early Gene expression levels. In summary, MAGIC is a standalone application that produces meaningful predictions of TFs and cofactors in transcriptomic experiments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HBHFwfm0YvY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by David M. Richards, Jamie J. Walker, Joel Tabak&lt;/p&gt;

Endocrine cells in the pituitary gland typically display either spiking or bursting electrical activity, which is related to the level of hormone secretion. Recent work, which combines mathematical modelling with dynamic clamp experiments, suggests the difference is due to the presence or absence of a few large-conductance potassium channels. Since endocrine cells only contain a handful of these channels, it is likely that stochastic effects play an important role in the pattern of electrical activity. Here, for the first time, we explicitly determine the effect of such noise by studying a mathematical model that includes the realistic noisy opening and closing of ion channels. This allows us to investigate how noise affects the electrical activity, examine the origin of spiking and bursting, and determine which channel types are responsible for the greatest noise. Further, for the first time, we address the role of cell size in endocrine cell electrical activity, finding that larger cells typically display more bursting, while the smallest cells almost always only exhibit spiking behaviour.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sMJc6idpiZU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Recent advances in electron microscopy have enabled the imaging of single cells in 3D at nanometer length scale resolutions. An uncharted frontier for &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; biology is the ability to simulate cellular processes using these observed geometries. Enabling such simulations requires watertight meshing of electron micrograph images into 3D volume meshes, which can then form the basis of computer simulations of such processes using numerical techniques such as the finite element method. In this paper, we describe the use of our recently rewritten mesh processing software, GAMer 2, to bridge the gap between poorly conditioned meshes generated from segmented micrographs and boundary marked tetrahedral meshes which are compatible with simulation. We demonstrate the application of a workflow using GAMer 2 to a series of electron micrographs of neuronal dendrite morphology explored at three different length scales and show that the resulting meshes are suitable for finite element simulations. This work is an important step towards making physical simulations of biological processes in realistic geometries routine. Innovations in algorithms to reconstruct and simulate cellular length scale phenomena based on emerging structural data will enable realistic physical models and advance discovery at the interface of geometry and cellular processes. We posit that a new frontier at the intersection of computational technologies and single cell biology is now open.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bMHqI_6inGU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

In multicellular organisms, the timing and placement of gene expression in a developing tissue assigns the fate of each cell in the embryo in order for a uniform field of cells to differentiate into a reproducible pattern of organs and tissues. This positional information is often achieved through the action of spatial gradients of morphogens. Spatial patterns of gene expression are paradoxically robust to variations in morphogen dosage, given that, by definition, gene expression must be sensitive to morphogen concentration. In this work we investigate the robustness of the Dorsal/NF-κB signaling module with respect to perturbations to the dosage of maternally-expressed &lt;i&gt;dorsal&lt;/i&gt; mRNA. The Dorsal morphogen gradient patterns the dorsal-ventral axis of the early &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; embryo, and we found that an empirical description of the Dorsal gradient is highly sensitive to maternal &lt;i&gt;dorsal&lt;/i&gt; dosage. In contrast, we found experimentally that gene expression patterns are highly robust. Although the components of this signaling module have been characterized in detail, how their function is integrated to produce robust gene expression patterns to variations in the &lt;i&gt;dorsal&lt;/i&gt; maternal dosage is still unclear. Therefore, we analyzed a mechanistic model of the Dorsal signaling module and found that Cactus, a cytoplasmic inhibitor for Dorsal, must be present in the nucleus for the system to be robust. Furthermore, active Toll, the receptor that dissociates Cactus from Dorsal, must be saturated. Finally, the vast majority of robust descriptions of the system require facilitated diffusion of Dorsal by Cactus. Each of these three recently-discovered mechanisms of the Dorsal module are critical for robustness. These mechanisms synergistically contribute to changing the amplitude and shape of the active Dorsal gradient, which is required for robust gene expression. Our work highlights the need for quantitative understanding of biophysical mechanisms of morphogen gradients in order to understand emergent phenotypes, such as robustness.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Xb4DsLMadIg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The renal outer medullary potassium (ROMK) channel is essential for potassium transport in the kidney, and its dysfunction is associated with a salt-wasting disorder known as Bartter syndrome. Despite its physiological significance, we lack a mechanistic understanding of the molecular defects in ROMK underlying most Bartter syndrome-associated mutations. To this end, we employed a ROMK-dependent yeast growth assay and tested single amino acid variants selected by a series of computational tools representative of different approaches to predict each variants’ pathogenicity. In one approach, we used &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; saturation mutagenesis, i.e. the scanning of all possible single amino acid substitutions at all sequence positions to estimate their impact on function, and then employed a new machine learning classifier known as Rhapsody. We also used two additional tools, EVmutation and Polyphen-2, which permitted us to make consensus predictions on the pathogenicity of single amino acid variants in ROMK. Experimental tests performed for selected mutants in different classes validated the vast majority of our predictions and provided insights into variants implicated in ROMK dysfunction. On a broader scope, our analysis suggests that consolidation of data from complementary computational approaches provides an improved and facile method to predict the severity of an amino acid substitution and may help accelerate the identification of disease-causing mutations in any protein.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YwUwN7kLcWI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Achieving accurate, real-time estimates of disease activity is challenged by delays in case reporting. “Nowcast” approaches attempt to estimate the complete case counts for a given reporting date, using a time series of case reports that is known to be incomplete due to reporting delays. Modeling the reporting delay distribution is a common feature of nowcast approaches. However, many nowcast approaches ignore a crucial feature of infectious disease transmission—that future cases are intrinsically linked to past reported cases—and are optimized to one or two applications, which may limit generalizability. Here, we present a Bayesian approach, NobBS (Nowcasting by Bayesian Smoothing) capable of producing smooth and accurate nowcasts in multiple disease settings. We test NobBS on dengue in Puerto Rico and influenza-like illness (ILI) in the United States to examine performance and robustness across settings exhibiting a range of common reporting delay characteristics (from stable to time-varying), and compare this approach with a published nowcasting software package while investigating the features of each approach that contribute to good or poor performance. We show that introducing a temporal relationship between cases considerably improves performance when the reporting delay distribution is time-varying, and we identify trade-offs in the role of moving windows to accurately capture changes in the delay. We present software implementing this new approach (R package “NobBS”) for widespread application and provide practical guidance on implementation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Em56XgwL-ys&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The cellular protein-protein interaction network that governs cellular proliferation (cell cycle) is highly complex. Here, we have developed a novel computational model of human mitotic cell cycle, integrating diverse cellular mechanisms, for the purpose of generating new hypotheses and predicting new experiments designed to help understand complex diseases. The pathogenic state investigated is infection by a human herpesvirus. The model starts at mitotic entry initiated by the activities of Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) and Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), transitions through Anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) bound to Cell division cycle protein 20 (CDC20), and ends upon mitotic exit mediated by APC/C bound to CDC20 homolog 1 (CDH1). It includes syntheses and multiple mechanisms of degradations of the mitotic proteins. Prior to this work, no such comprehensive model of the human mitotic cell cycle existed. The new model is based on a hybrid framework combining Michaelis-Menten and mass action kinetics for the mitotic interacting reactions. It simulates temporal changes in 12 different mitotic proteins and associated protein complexes in multiple states using 15 interacting reactions and 26 ordinary differential equations. We have defined model parameter values using both quantitative and qualitative data and using parameter values from relevant published models, and we have tested the model to reproduce the cardinal features of human mitosis determined experimentally by numerous laboratories. Like cancer, viruses create dysfunction to support infection. By simulating infection of the human herpesvirus, cytomegalovirus, we hypothesize that virus-mediated disruption of APC/C is necessary to establish a unique mitotic collapse with sustained CDK1 activity, consistent with known mechanisms of virus egress. With the rapid discovery of cellular protein-protein interaction networks and regulatory mechanisms, we anticipate that this model will be highly valuable in helping us to understand the network dynamics and identify potential points of therapeutic interventions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TZcHJUN1Ue8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The ability of biological and artificial collectives to outperform solitary individuals in a wide variety of tasks depends crucially on the efficient processing of social and environmental information at the level of the collective. Here, we model collective behavior in complex environments with many potentially distracting cues. Counter-intuitively, large-scale coordination in such environments can be maximized by strongly limiting the cognitive capacity of individuals, where due to self-organized dynamics the collective self-isolates from disrupting information. We observe a fundamental trade-off between coordination and collective responsiveness to environmental cues. Our results offer important insights into possible evolutionary trade-offs in collective behavior in biology and suggests novel principles for design of artificial swarms exploiting attentional bottlenecks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/N9e4fDKkmIQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Discovery of hierarchical representations for efficient planning</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Momchil S. Tomov, Samyukta Yagati, Agni Kumar, Wanqian Yang, Samuel J. Gershman&lt;/p&gt;

We propose that humans spontaneously organize environments into clusters of states that support hierarchical planning, enabling them to tackle challenging problems by breaking them down into sub-problems at various levels of abstraction. People constantly rely on such hierarchical presentations to accomplish tasks big and small—from planning one’s day, to organizing a wedding, to getting a PhD—often succeeding on the very first attempt. We formalize a Bayesian model of hierarchy discovery that explains how humans discover such useful abstractions. Building on principles developed in structure learning and robotics, the model predicts that hierarchy discovery should be sensitive to the topological structure, reward distribution, and distribution of tasks in the environment. In five simulations, we show that the model accounts for previously reported effects of environment structure on planning behavior, such as detection of bottleneck states and transitions. We then test the novel predictions of the model in eight behavioral experiments, demonstrating how the distribution of tasks and rewards can influence planning behavior via the discovered hierarchy, sometimes facilitating and sometimes hindering performance. We find evidence that the hierarchy discovery process unfolds incrementally across trials. Finally, we propose how hierarchy discovery and hierarchical planning might be implemented in the brain. Together, these findings present an important advance in our understanding of how the brain might use Bayesian inference to discover and exploit the hidden hierarchical structure of the environment.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/akS2_NKIMtI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Lymph nodes (LNs) are highly organized secondary lymphoid organs that mediate adaptive immune responses to antigens delivered via afferent lymphatic vessels. Lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) line intranodal lymphatic sinuses and organize lymph and antigen distribution. LECs also directly regulate T cells, mediating peripheral tolerance to self-antigens, and play a major role in many diseases, including cancer metastasis. However, little is known about the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of LN LECs. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we comprehensively defined the transcriptome of LECs in murine skin-draining LNs and identified new markers and functions of distinct LEC subpopulations. We found that LECs residing in the subcapsular sinus (SCS) have an unanticipated function in scavenging of modified low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and also identified a specific cortical LEC subtype implicated in rapid lymphocyte egress from LNs. Our data provide new, to our knowledge, insights into the diversity of LECs in murine LNs and a rich resource for future studies into the regulation of immune responses by LN LECs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Q_CXYqi-SUY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro: EGFR Signaling Causes Morphine Tolerance and Mechanical Sensitization in Rats</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/2/ENEURO.0460-18.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The safety and efficacy of opioids are compromised as analgesic tolerance develops. Opioids are also ineffective against neuropathic pain. Recent reports have suggested that inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), may have analgesic effects in cancer patients suffering from neuropathic pain. It has been shown that the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFR-β), an RTK that has been shown to interact with the EGFR, mediates opioid tolerance but does not induce analgesia. Therefore, we sought to determine whether EGFR signaling was involved in opioid tolerance and whether EGFR and PDGFR signaling could induce pain in rats. We found that gefitinib, an EGFR antagonist, eliminated morphine tolerance. In addition, repeated EGF administration rendered animals unresponsive to subsequent analgesic doses of morphine, a phenomenon we call &quot;pre-tolerance.&quot; Using a nerve injury model, we found that gefitinib alone was not analgesic. Rather, it reversed insensitivity to morphine analgesia (pre-tolerance) caused by the release of EGF by injured nerves. We also showed that repeated, but not acute EGF or PDGF-BB administration induced mechanical hypersensitivity in rats. EGFR and PDGFR-β signaling interacted to produce this sensitization. EGFR was widely expressed in primary sensory afferent cell bodies, demonstrating a neuroanatomical substrate for our findings. Taken together, our results suggest a direct mechanistic link between opioid tolerance and mechanical sensitization. EGFR antagonism could eventually play an important clinical role in the treatment of opioid tolerance and neuropathic pain that is refractory to opioid treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;In mice with Cx3cr1‐Cre‐mediated conditional deletion of mu opioid receptor (MOR) in microglia, morphine analgesic tolerance was delayed, opioid‐induced hyperalgesia was abolished in males, and physical dependence was attenuated in females. This sex‐specific role of microglial MOR provides a crucial information for developing opiate analgesia without adverse effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major challenge in medicine is developing potent pain therapies without the adverse effects of opiates. Neuroinflammation and in particular microglial activation have been shown to contribute to these effects. However, the implication of the microglial mu opioid receptor (MOR) is not known. We developed a novel conditional knockout (cKO) mouse line, wherein MOR is deleted in microglia. Morphine analgesic tolerance was delayed in both sexes in cKO mice in the hot plate assay. Opioid‐induced hyperalgesia (OIH) as measured in the tail immersion assay was abolished in male cKO mice, and physical dependence to morphine as assessed by naloxone‐induced withdrawal was attenuated in female cKO mice. Our results show a sex‐dependent contribution of microglial MOR in morphine analgesic tolerance, OIH, and physical dependence. In conclusion, our data suggest that blockade of microglial MOR could represent a therapeutic target for opiate analgesia without the opiate adverse effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Predicting Recovery and Outcome after Pediatric Stroke: Results from the International Pediatric Stroke Study</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25718?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To characterize predictors of recovery and outcome following pediatric arterial ischemic stroke, hypothesizing that age influences recovery after stroke.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We studied children enrolled in the International Pediatric Stroke Study between January 1, 2003 and July 31, 2014 with 2‐year follow‐up after arterial ischemic stroke. Outcomes were defined at discharge by clinician grading and at 2 years by the Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure. Demographic, clinical, and radiologic outcome predictors were examined. We defined changes in outcome from discharge to 2 years as recovery (improved outcome), emerging deficit (worse outcome), or no change.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our population consisted of 587 patients, including 174 with neonatal stroke and 413 with childhood stroke, with recurrent stroke in 8.2% of childhood patients. Moderate to severe neurological impairment was present in 9.4% of neonates versus 48.8% of children at discharge compared to 8.0% versus 24.7% after 2 years. Predictors of poor outcome included age between 28 days and 1 year (compared to neonates, odds ratio [OR] = 3.58, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), underlying chronic disorder (OR = 2.23, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), and involvement of both small and large vascular territories (OR = 2.84, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Recovery patterns differed, with emerging deficits more common in children &amp;lt;1 year of age (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outcomes after pediatric stroke are generally favorable, but moderate to severe neurological impairments are still common. Age between 28 days and 1 year appears to be a particularly vulnerable period. Understanding the timing and predictors of recovery will allow us to better counsel families and target therapies to improve outcomes after pediatric stroke.

	<title>eLife: Potential harmful effects of discontinuing ACE-inhibitors and ARBs in COVID-19 patients</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57278</link>
	<content:encoded>The discovery that SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) RNA binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-2, which is highly expressed in the lower airways, explained why SARS-CoV-2 causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure. After this, news spread that ACEis and ARBs would be harmful in SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects. To the contrary, compelling evidence exists that the ACE-1/angiotensin(Ang)II/ATR-1 pathway is involved in SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS, while the ACE-2/Ang(1-7)/ATR2/MasR pathway counteracts the harmful actions of AngII in the lung. A reduced ACE-1/ACE-2 ratio is, in fact, a feature of ARDS that can be rescued by human recombinant ACE-2 and Ang(1-7) administration, thus preventing SARS-CoV-2-induced damage to the lung. Based on the current clinical evidence treatment with ACE-inhibitors I (ACEis) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) continues to provide cardiovascular and renal protection in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Discontinuing these medications may therefore be potentially harmful in this patient population.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Zebrafish embryonic explants undergo genetically encoded self-assembly</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55190</link>
	<content:encoded>Embryonic stem cell cultures are thought to self-organize into embryoid bodies, able to undergo symmetry-breaking, germ layer specification and even morphogenesis. Yet, it is unclear how to reconcile this remarkable self-organization capacity with classical experiments demonstrating key roles for extrinsic biases by maternal factors and/or extraembryonic tissues in embryogenesis. Here, we show that zebrafish embryonic tissue explants, prepared prior to germ layer induction and lacking extraembryonic tissues, can specify all germ layers and form a seemingly complete mesendoderm anlage. Importantly, explant organization requires polarized inheritance of maternal factors from dorsal-marginal regions of the blastoderm. Moreover, induction of endoderm and head-mesoderm, which require peak Nodal-signaling levels, is highly variable in explants, reminiscent of embryos with reduced Nodal signals from the extraembryonic tissues. Together, these data suggest that zebrafish explants do not undergo &lt;i&gt;bona-fide&lt;/i&gt; self-organization, but rather display features of genetically encoded self-assembly, where intrinsic genetic programs control the emergence of order.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Chromosome organization by one-sided and two-sided loop extrusion</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53558</link>
	<content:encoded>SMC complexes, such as condensin or cohesin, organize chromatin throughout the cell cycle by a process known as loop extrusion. SMC complexes reel in DNA, extruding and progressively growing DNA loops. Modeling assuming two-sided loop extrusion reproduces key features of chromatin organization across different organisms. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; single-molecule experiments confirmed that yeast condensins extrude loops, however, they remain anchored to their loading sites and extrude loops in a 'one-sided' manner. We therefore simulate one-sided loop extrusion to investigate whether 'one-sided' complexes can compact mitotic chromosomes, organize interphase domains, and juxtapose bacterial chromosomal arms, as can be done by 'two-sided' loop extruders. While one-sided loop extrusion cannot reproduce these phenomena, variants can recapitulate &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; observations. We predict that SMC complexes &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; constitute effectively two-sided motors or exhibit biased loading and propose relevant experiments. Our work suggests that loop extrusion is a viable general mechanism of chromatin organization.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Dynamics of pattern formation and emergence of swarming in C. elegans</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/52781</link>
	<content:encoded>Many animals collectively form complex patterns to tackle environmental difficulties. Several biological and physical factors, such as animal motility, population densities, and chemical cues, play significant roles in this process. However, very little is known about how sensory information interplays with these factors and controls the dynamics of pattern formation. Here, we study the direct relation between oxygen sensing, pattern formation, and emergence of swarming in active C. elegans aggregates. We find that when thousands of animals gather on food, bacteria-mediated decrease in oxygen level slows down the animals and triggers motility-induced phase separation. Three coupled factors—bacterial accumulation, aerotaxis, and population density—act together and control the entire dynamics. Furthermore, we find that biofilm-forming bacterial lawns including &lt;i&gt;Bacillus Subtilis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; strongly alter the collective dynamics due to the limited diffusibility of bacteria. Additionally, our theoretical model captures behavioral differences resulting from genetic variations and oxygen sensitivity.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase uses its NAD+ substrate-binding site to chaperone phosphorylated Tau</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/51859</link>
	<content:encoded>Tau hyper-phosphorylation and deposition into neurofibrillary tangles have been found in brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other tauopathies. Molecular chaperones are involved in regulating the pathological aggregation of phosphorylated Tau (pTau) and modulating disease progression. Here, we report that nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT), a well-known NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; synthase, serves as a chaperone of pTau to prevent its amyloid aggregation in vitro as well as mitigate its pathology in a fly tauopathy model. By combining NMR spectroscopy, crystallography, single-molecule and computational approaches, we revealed that NMNAT adopts its enzymatic pocket to specifically bind the phosphorylated sites of pTau, which can be competitively disrupted by the enzymatic substrates of NMNAT. Moreover, we found that NMNAT serves as a co-chaperone of Hsp90 for the specific recognition of pTau over Tau. Our work uncovers a dedicated chaperone of pTau and suggests NMNAT as a key node between NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; metabolism and Tau homeostasis in aging and neurodegeneration.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.06.027524v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Synaptic transmission leading to release of neurotransmitters in the nervous system is a fast and highly dynamic process. Previously, protein interaction and phosphorylation have been thought to be the main regulators of synaptic transmission. Here we show a novel potential modulator of synaptic transmission, sialylation of N-linked glycosylation. The negatively charged sialic acids can be modulated, similarly to phosphorylation, by the action of sialyltransferases and sialidases thereby changing local structure and function of membrane glycoproteins. We characterized site-specific alteration in sialylation on N-linked glycoproteins in isolated rat nerve terminals after brief depolarization using quantitative sialiomics. We identified 1965 formerly sialylated N-linked glycosites in synaptic proteins and found that the abundances of 430 glycosites changed after five seconds depolarization. We observed changes on essential synaptic proteins such as synaptic vesicle proteins, ion channels and transporters, neurotransmitter receptors and cell adhesion molecules. This study is to our knowledge the first to describe ultra-fast site-specific modulation of the sialiome after brief stimulation of a biological system.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.06.027466v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Neuronal representations of spatial location and movement speed are important for a broad range of cognitive functions, including spatial self-localization and memory-guided navigation. Two possible speed signals, by theta frequency or by firing rate, have been hypothesized to provide the velocity signal needed for generating the spatially periodic grid cell firing pattern. However, which of these speed signals is utilized by the brain remains unknown. By manipulating visual inputs and analyzing the time-courses of evoked changes, we demonstrate that changes in spatial stability of grid cell firing correlate in time with changes in speed coding by local field potential theta frequency. In contrast, visual inputs do not affect speed coding by firing rate even if baseline firing rates are changed. Moreover, grid cells maintain a spatially periodic firing pattern, though less stable, in complete darkness. These data suggest that mice use an oscillatory speed signal to perform path integration.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.06.027441v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>To understand the nature of the complex behavior of the brain, one important step is to identify &quot;cores&quot; in the brain network, where neurons or brain areas strongly interact with each other. Cores can be considered as essential sub-networks for brain functions. In the last few decades, an information-theoretic approach to identifying cores has been developed. In this approach, many-to-many nonlinear interactions between parts are measured by an information loss function, which quantifies how much information would be lost if interactions between parts were removed. Then, a core called a &quot;complex&quot; is defined as a subsystem wherein the amount of information loss is locally maximal. Although identifying complexes can be a novel and useful approach to revealing essential properties of the brain network, its practical application is hindered by the fact that computation time grows exponentially with system size. Here we propose a fast and exact algorithm for finding complexes, called Hierarchical Partitioning for Complex search (HPC). HPC finds complexes by hierarchically partitioning systems to narrow down candidates for complexes. The computation time of HPC is polynomial, which is dramatically smaller than exponential. We prove that HPC is exact when an information loss function satisfies a mathematical property, monotonicity. We show that mutual information is one such information loss function. We also show that a broad class of submodular functions can be considered as such information loss functions, indicating the expandability of our framework to the class. In simulations, we show that HPC can find complexes in large systems (up to several hundred) in a practical amount of time when mutual information is used as an information loss function. Finally, we demonstrate the use of HPC in electrocorticogram recordings from monkeys. HPC revealed temporally stable and characteristic complexes, indicating that it can be reliably utilized to characterize brain networks.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.06.027359v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Due to its importance for successful human behavior, research into cognitive control functioning has gained increasing interest. The paced auditory serial addition task (PASAT) has been used to test and train this fundamental function. It is a challenging task, requiring a high cognitive load in a stressful and frustrating environment. Its underlying neural mechanisms, however, are still unclear. To explore the neural signatures of the PASAT and their link to ongoing cognitive processing, feedback locked event-related potentials were derived from healthy participants during an adaptive 2-back version of the PASAT. Larger neural activation after negative feedback was found for feedback related negativity (FRN), P300 and late positive potential (LPP). In early stages of feedback processing (FRN), a larger difference between positive and negative feedback responses was associated with poorer overall performance, whereas this association was inverted for the later stages (P300 and LPP). This indicates stage-dependent associations of neural activation after negative information and cognitive functioning. Conceivably, increased early responses to negative feedback signify distraction whereas higher activity at later stages reflect cognitive control processes to preserve ongoing performance.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.06.027227v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>When different senses are in conflict, one sense may dominate the perception of other sense, but it is not known whether the sensory cortex associated with the dominant modality exerts directional influence, at the functional brain level, over the sensory cortex associated with the dominated modality; in short, the link between sensory dominance and neuronal dominance is not established. In a task involving audio-visual conflict, using magnetoencephalography recordings in humans, we first demonstrated that the neuronal dominance, i.e. visual cortex being functionally influenced by the auditory cortex, was associated with the sensory dominance, i.e. participant's visual perception being qualitatively altered by sound. Further, we found that prestimulus auditory-to-visual connectivity could predict the perceptual outcome on a trial by trial basis. Subsequently, we performed an effective connectivity-guided neurofeedback electroencephalography experiment and showed that participants who were briefly trained to increase the neuronal dominance from auditory to visual cortex also showed higher sensory, i.e. auditory, dominance during the conflict task immediately after the training. The results shed new light into the interactive neuronal nature of multisensory integration and open up exciting opportunities by enhancing or suppressing targeted mental functions subserved by effective connectivity.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.06.026401v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Cortical and limbic brain areas are regarded as centres for learning. However, how thalamic sensory relays participate in plasticity upon associative learning, yet support stable long-term sensory coding remains unknown. Using a miniature microscope imaging approach, we monitor the activity of populations of auditory thalamus (MGB) neurons in freely moving mice upon fear conditioning. We find that single cells exhibit mixed selectivity and heterogeneous plasticity patterns to auditory and aversive stimuli upon learning, which is conserved in amygdala-projecting MGB neurons. In contrast to individual cells, population level encoding of auditory stimuli remained stable across days. Our data identifies MGB as a site for complex neuronal plasticity in fear learning upstream of the amygdala that is in an ideal position to drive plasticity in cortical and limbic brain areas. These findings suggest that MGB's role goes beyond a sole relay function by balancing experience-dependent, diverse single cell plasticity with consistent ensemble level representations of the sensory environment to support stable auditory perception with minimal affective bias.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>How are diverse regulatory strategies integrated to impose appropriately patterned gene expression that underlie in vivo phenotypes? Here, we reveal how coordinated miRNA regulation and neural-specific alternative polyadenylation (APA) of a single locus controls complex behaviors. Our entry was the unexpected observation that deletion of Bithorax-Complex (BX-C) miRNAs converts virgin female flies into a subjective post-mated behavioral state, normally induced by seminal proteins following copulation. Strikingly, this behavioral switch is directly attributable to misregulation of homothorax (hth). We localize specific CNS abdominal neurons where de-repressed Hth compromises virgin behavior in BX-C miRNA mutants. Moreover, we use genome engineering to demonstrate that precise mutation of hth 3'UTR sites for BX-C miRNAs, or deletion of its neural 3' UTR extension containing most of these sites, both induce post-mated behaviors in virgins. Thus, facilitation of miRNA-mediated repression by neural APA is required for virgin females to execute behaviors appropriate to their internal state.</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Cephalochordates (amphioxus or lancelets) are basal in the phylum Chiordata and can exemplify the relatively simple developmental and anatomical starting conditions likely to have evolved into more complex vertebrate features. Here we use serial blockface scanning electron microscopy to reconstruct the sensory peripheral nervous system in the tail of a lancelet. The nerves (glial cell/neurite complexes) branch within the dermis and then exit to the epidermis to associate with the perikarya of two kinds of ciliated sensory neurons. The results indicate that cephalochordate neuroglia have an intramedullary origin. Moreover, we suggest that the peripheral nerves in the dermis are, at least in part, comparable to Rohon‐Beard cells of vertebrates, whereas, in contrast, the placode‐ and neural crest‐derived peripheral neurons of vertebrates are evolutionary novelties that appear to have supplanted the epidermal sensory receptors of cephalochordates.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serial blockface scanning electron microscopy (SBSEM) is used to describe the sensory peripheral nervous system (PNS) in the tail of a cephalochordate, &lt;i&gt;Asymmetron lucayanum&lt;/i&gt;. The reconstructed region extends from the tail tip to the origin of the most posterior peripheral nerves from the dorsal nerve cord. As peripheral nerves ramify within the dermis, all the nuclei along their course belong to glial cells. Invaginations in the glial cell cytoplasm house the neurites, an association reminiscent of the non‐myelinated Schwann cells of vertebrates. Peripheral nerves pass from the dermis to the epidermis via small fenestrae in the sub‐epidermal collagen fibril layer; most nerves exit abruptly, but a few run obliquely within the collagen fibril layer for many micrometers before exiting. Within the epidermis, each nerve begins ramifying repeatedly, but the branches are too small to be followed to their tips with SBSEM at low magnification (previous studies on other cephalochordates indicate that the branches end freely or in association with epidermal sensory cells). In &lt;i&gt;Asymmetron&lt;/i&gt;, two morphological kinds of sensory cells are scattered in the epidermis, usually singly, but sometimes in pairs, evidently the recent progeny of a single precursor cell. The discussion considers the evolution of the sensory PNS in the phylum Chordata. In cephalochordates, Retzius bipolar neurons with intramedullary perikarya likely correspond to the Rohon‐Beard cells of vertebrates. However, extramedullary neurons originating from ventral epidermis in cephalochordates (and presumably in ancestral chordates) contrast with vertebrate sensory neurons, which arise from placodes and neural crest.&lt;/p&gt;

3 weeks of fluoxetine injection at dose of 5 mg / (kg • d) significantly improved the depressive‐like behavior in depressed model rats.
The oligodendrocytes of the CA1, CA3 and DG fields of hippocampus were significantly decreased after 7 weeks of CUS stimulations.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression is a mental illness which is harmful seriously to the society. This study investigated the effects of fluoxetine on the CNPase&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; oligodendrocytes in hippocampus of the depressed rats to explore the new target structure of antidepressants. Male Sprague ‐ Dawley rats were used to build chronic unpredictable stress(CUS) depressed model of rats. Then, the depressed rats were divided into the CUS standard group and the CUS + fluoxetine (CUS/FLX) group. The CUS/FLX group was treated with fluoxetine at dose of 5 mg / (kg·d) from the fifth week to seventh week. After 7 weeks CUS intervention, the sucrose preference of the CUS standard group was significantly lower than that of the control group and the CUS/FLX group. The stereological results showed that the total number of the CNPase&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in the CA1, CA3 and DG subfield of the hippocampus in the CUS standard group were significantly decreased, when compared with the CNPase&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in the control group. However, the total number of the CNPase&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in the CA1 and CA3 subfield of the hippocampus in the CUS standard group was significantly decreased when it compared with CNPase&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in the CUS/FLX group. Therefore, fluoxetine might prevent the loss of CNPase&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; oligodendrocytes in CA1 and CA3 subfields of hippocampus of the depressed rats. The oligodendrocytes in hippocampus may play an important role in the pathogenesis of depression. The current result might provide structural basis for the future studies that search for new antidepressant strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding force generation in nonequilibrium systems is a notable challenge in statistical physics. We uncover a fluctuation-induced force between two plates immersed in homogeneous isotropic turbulence using direct numerical simulations. The force is a nonmonotonic function of plate separation. The mechanism of force generation reveals an intriguing analogy with fluctuation-induced forces: In a fluid, energy and vorticity are localized in regions of defined length scales. When varying the distance between the plates, we exclude energy structures modifying the overall pressure on the plates. At intermediate plate distances, the intense vorticity structures (worms) are forced to interact in close vicinity between the plates. This interaction affects the pressure in the slit and the force between the plates. The combination of these two effects causes a nonmonotonic attractive force with a complex Reynolds number dependence. Our study sheds light on how length scale–dependent distributions of energy and high-intensity vortex structures determine Casimir forces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Numerous plants and animals harbor selfish B chromosomes that &quot;drive&quot; or transmit themselves at super-Mendelian frequencies, despite long-term fitness costs to the organism. Currently, it is unknown how B chromosome drive is mediated, and whether B-gene expression plays a role. We used modern sequencing technologies to analyze the fine-scale sequence composition and expression of paternal sex ratio (PSR), a B chromosome in the jewel wasp &lt;i&gt;Nasonia vitripennis&lt;/i&gt;. PSR causes female-to-male conversion by destroying the sperm’s hereditary material in young embryos to drive. Using RNA interference, we demonstrate that testis-specific expression of a PSR-linked gene, named &lt;i&gt;haploidizer&lt;/i&gt;, facilitates this genome elimination–and–sex conversion effect. &lt;i&gt;haploidizer&lt;/i&gt; encodes a putative protein with a DNA binding domain, suggesting a functional link with the sperm-derived chromatin.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Liquid emulsion droplet evaporation is of importance for various sensing and imaging applications. The liquid-to-gas phase transformation is typically triggered thermally or acoustically by low–boiling point liquids, or by inclusion of solid structures that pin the vapor/liquid contact line to facilitate heterogeneous nucleation. However, these approaches lack precise tunability in vaporization behavior. Here, we describe a previously unused approach to control vaporization behavior through an endoskeleton that can melt and blend into the liquid core to either enhance or disrupt cohesive intermolecular forces. This effect is demonstrated using perfluoropentane (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;) droplets encapsulating a fluorocarbon (FC) or hydrocarbon (HC) endoskeleton. FC skeletons inhibit vaporization, whereas HC skeletons trigger vaporization near the rotator melting transition. Our findings highlight the importance of skeletal interfacial mixing for initiating droplet vaporization. Tuning molecular interactions between the endoskeleton and droplet phase is generalizable for achieving emulsion or other secondary phase transitions, in emulsions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Modeling suggests that stress changes induced by the earthquake were too small to account for the overpressure in the dike without additional bubble growth to pressurize the magma chamber. We find that the magma must be both H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O-saturated and at lower temperatures than those expected for newly intruded basalts. Too hot and the stress drop required to grow the bubbles is too large, too cold and the magma can no longer flow. These observations suggest that partially cooled and crystallized basaltic magmas are more susceptible to triggering from earthquakes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Science Advances: Symmetry breaking in hydrodynamic forces drives meiotic spindle rotation in mammalian oocytes</title>
	<link>http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/6/14/eaaz5004?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Patterned cell divisions require a precisely oriented spindle that segregates chromosomes and determines the cytokinetic plane. In this study, we investigated how the meiotic spindle orients through an obligatory rotation during meiotic division in mouse oocytes. We show that spindle rotation occurs at the completion of chromosome segregation, whereby the separated chromosome clusters each define a cortical actomyosin domain that produces cytoplasmic streaming, resulting in hydrodynamic forces on the spindle. These forces are initially balanced but become unbalanced to drive spindle rotation. This force imbalance is associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking in the distribution of the Arp2/3 complex and myosin-II on the cortex, brought about by feedback loops comprising Ran guanosine triphosphatase signaling, Arp2/3 complex activity, and myosin-II contractility. The torque produced by the unbalanced hydrodynamic forces, coupled with a pivot point at the spindle midzone cortical contract, constitutes a unique mechanical system for meiotic spindle rotation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Science Advances: Quantum biology revisited</title>
	<link>http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/6/14/eaaz4888?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Photosynthesis is a highly optimized process from which valuable lessons can be learned about the operating principles in nature. Its primary steps involve energy transport operating near theoretical quantum limits in efficiency. Recently, extensive research was motivated by the hypothesis that nature used quantum coherences to direct energy transfer. This body of work, a cornerstone for the field of quantum biology, rests on the interpretation of small-amplitude oscillations in two-dimensional electronic spectra of photosynthetic complexes. This Review discusses recent work reexamining these claims and demonstrates that interexciton coherences are too short lived to have any functional significance in photosynthetic energy transfer. Instead, the observed long-lived coherences originate from impulsively excited vibrations, generally observed in femtosecond spectroscopy. These efforts, collectively, lead to a more detailed understanding of the quantum aspects of dissipation. Nature, rather than trying to avoid dissipation, exploits it via engineering of exciton-bath interaction to create efficient energy flow.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The lubrication properties of nanoconfined liquids underpin countless natural and industrial processes. However, our current understanding of lubricated friction is still limited, especially for nonideal interfaces exhibiting nanoscale chemical and topographical defects. Here, we use atomic force microscopy to explore the equilibrium and dynamical behavior of a model lubricant, squalane, confined between a diamond tip and graphite in the vicinity of an atomic step. We combine high-resolution imaging of the interface with highly localized shear measurements at different velocities and temperatures to derive a quantitative picture of the lubricated friction around surface defects. We show that defects tend to promote local molecular order and increase friction forces by reducing the number of stable molecular configurations in their immediate vicinity. The effect is general, can propagate over hundreds of nanometers, and can be quantitatively described by a semiempirical model that bridges the molecular details and mesoscale observations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/6/14/eaaz2310?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Oxygen activation is a critical step in ubiquitous heterogeneous oxidative processes, most prominently in catalysis, electrolysis, and pharmaceutical applications. We present here our findings on metal-free O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation on covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) as an important class of N-rich materials. The O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation process was studied for the formation of aldehydes, ketones and imines. A detailed mechanistic study of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation and the role of nitrogen heteroatoms were comprehensively investigated. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and control experiments provide strong evidence for the reaction mechanism proving the applicability of the CTFs to activate oxygen into superoxide species. This report highlights the importance of a self-templating procedure to introduce N functionalities for the development of metal-free catalytic materials. The presented findings reveal an important step toward the use of CTFs as inexpensive and high-performance alternatives to metal-based materials not only for catalysis but also for biorelated applications dealing with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/6/14/eaaz0682?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We study the effect of rotational state–dependent alignment in the scattering of molecules by optical fields. CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules in their lowest few rotational states are adiabatically aligned and transversely accelerated by a nonresonant optical standing wave. The width of the measured transverse velocity distribution increases to 160 m/s with the field intensity, while its central peak position moves from 10 to –10 m/s. These changes are well reproduced by numerical simulations based on the rotational state–dependent alignment but cannot be modeled when ignoring these effects. Moreover, the molecular scattering by an off-resonant optical field amounts to manipulating the translational motion of molecules in a rotational state–specific way. Conversely, our results demonstrate that scattering from a nonresonant optical standing wave is a viable method for rotational state selection of nonpolar molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Science Advances: A metal-free blue chromophore derived from plant pigments</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Blue natural pigments are rare, especially among plants. However, flowering species that evolved to attract Hymenoptera pollinators are colored by blue anthocyanin-metal complexes. Plants lacking anthocyanins are pigmented by betalains but are unable to produce blue hues. By extending the -system of betalains, we designed a photostable and metal-free blue dye named BeetBlue that did not show toxicity to human hepatic and retinal pigment epithelial cells and does not affect zebrafish embryonal development. This chiral dye can be conveniently synthesized from betalamic acid obtained from hydrolyzed red beetroot juice or by enzymatic oxidation of l-dopa. BeetBlue is blue in the solid form and in solution of acidified polar molecular solvents, including water. Its capacity to dye natural matrices makes BeetBlue the prototype of a new class of low-cost bioinspired chromophores suitable for a myriad of applications requiring a blue hue.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/6/14/eaaz0094?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nanobubbles (NBs) are nanoscopic gaseous domains than can exist on solid surfaces or in bulk liquids. They have attracted substantial attention due to their long-time (meta)stability and a high potential for real-world applications. Using an approach not previously investigated, we exploit surface-electrostatic NB formation and stabilization via application of external electric fields in gas-liquid systems, with the marked result of massively increased gas uptake into the liquid in NB form. The de facto gas solubility enhancement (over many months) ranges from 2.5-fold for oxygen to 30-fold for methane vis-à-vis respective Henry’s law values for gas solubility; the more hydrophobic the gas, the more spectacular the increase. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the origin of NBs’ movement lies in dielectrophoresis, while substantial NB stabilization arises from a surface-polarization interaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Personal moisture management fabrics that facilitate sweat transport away from the skin are highly desirable for wearer’s comfort and performance. Here, we demonstrate a &quot;skin-like&quot; directional liquid transport fabric, which enables continuous one-way liquid flow through spatially distributed channels acting like &quot;sweating glands&quot; yet repels external liquid contaminants. The water transmission rate can be 15 times greater than that of best commercial breathable fabrics. This exceptional property is achieved by creating gradient wettability channels across a predominantly superhydrophobic substrate. The flow directionality is explained by the Gibbs pinning criterion. The permeability, mechanical property, and abrasion resistance (up to 10,000 cycles) of the fabric were not affected by the treatment. In addition to functional clothing, this concept can be extended for developing materials for oil-water separation, wound dressing, geotechnical engineering, flexible microfluidics, and fuel cell membranes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/6/14/eaay9634?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Here, we describe a tripartite circular single-stranded (ss) DNA mycovirus, named Fusarium graminearum gemytripvirus 1 (FgGMTV1). The genome of FgGMTV1 comprises three circular ssDNA segments (DNA-A, DNA-B, and DNA-C). Sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses showed that FgGMTV1 is nested within the family Genomoviridae. We also constructed the first infectious DNA clones of a DNA mycovirus. Our results show that DNA-A and DNA-B are mutually interdependent for their replication and are associated with severely reduced colony growth and hypovirulence. DNA-C relies on DNA-A and DNA-B for replication and is necessary for the recovery of abnormal fungal phenotypes. DNA-C also enhances the accumulation of viral DNA in infected fungi and permits stable colonization and easy transmission via conidia. This is the first multipartite DNA virus isolated from a fungus. Our phylogenetic analyses also suggest that the multipartite genome of FgGMTV1 may have evolved from a monopartite genome of an ancient genomovirus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/6/14/eaay8562?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep-sea cold seeps are dynamic sources of methane release and unique habitats supporting ocean biodiversity and productivity. Here, we describe newly discovered animal-bacterial symbioses fueled by methane, between two species of annelid (a serpulid &lt;i&gt;Laminatubus&lt;/i&gt; and sabellid &lt;i&gt;Bispira&lt;/i&gt;) and distinct aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria belonging to the Methylococcales, localized to the host respiratory crown. Worm tissue &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C of –44 to –58 are consistent with methane-fueled nutrition for both species, and shipboard stable isotope labeling experiments revealed active assimilation of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-labeled methane into animal biomass, which occurs via the engulfment of methanotrophic bacteria across the crown epidermal surface. These worms represent a new addition to the few animals known to intimately associate with methane-oxidizing bacteria and may further explain their enigmatic mass occurrence at 150–million year–old fossil seeps. High-resolution seafloor surveys document significant coverage by these symbioses, beyond typical obligate seep fauna. These findings uncover novel consumers of methane in the deep sea and, by expanding the known spatial extent of methane seeps, may have important implications for deep-sea conservation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transient tunnels that assemble and disassemble to facilitate passage of unstable intermediates in enzymes containing multiple reaction centers are controlled by allosteric cues. Using the 140-kDa purine biosynthetic enzyme PurL as a model system and a combination of biochemical and x-ray crystallographic studies, we show that long-distance communication between ~25-Å distal active sites is initiated by an allosteric switch, residing in a conserved catalytic loop, adjacent to the synthetase active site. Further, combinatory experiments seeded from molecular dynamics simulations help to delineate transient states that bring out the central role of nonfunctional adaptor domains. We show that carefully orchestrated conformational changes, facilitated by interplay of dynamic interactions at the allosteric switch and adaptor-domain interface, control reactivity and concomitant formation of the ammonia tunnel. This study asserts that substrate channeling is modulated by allosteric hotspots that alter protein energy landscape, thereby allowing the protein to adopt transient conformations paramount to function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/6/14/eaay6650?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Metal oxide semiconductor junctions are central to most electronic and optoelectronic devices, but ultrafast measurements of carrier transport have been limited to device-average measurements. Here, charge transport and recombination kinetics in each layer of a Ni-TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Si junction is measured using the element specificity of broadband extreme ultraviolet (XUV) ultrafast pulses. After silicon photoexcitation, holes are inferred to transport from Si to Ni ballistically in ~100 fs, resulting in characteristic spectral shifts in the XUV edges. Meanwhile, the electrons remain on Si. After picoseconds, the transient hole population on Ni is observed to back-diffuse through the TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, shifting the Ti spectrum to a higher oxidation state, followed by electron-hole recombination at the Si-TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; interface and in the Si bulk. Electrical properties, such as the hole diffusion constant in TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the initial hole mobility in Si, are fit from these transient spectra and match well with values reported previously.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Stacking two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals materials with different interlayer atomic registry in a heterobilayer causes the formation of a long-range periodic superlattice that may bestow the heterostructure with properties such as new quantum fractal states or superconductivity. Recent optical measurements of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterobilayers have revealed the presence of hybridized interlayer electron-hole pair excitations at energies defined by the superlattice potential. The corresponding quasiparticle band structures, so-called minibands, have remained elusive, and no such features have been reported for heterobilayers composed of a TMD and another type of 2D material. We introduce a new x-ray capillary technology for performing microfocused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with a spatial resolution of ~1 μm, and directly observe minibands at certain twist angles in mini Brillouin zones (mBZs). We discuss their origin in terms of initial and final state effects by analyzing their dispersion in distinct mBZs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Using a unique multimode dataset that comprises a nationally representative sample of mobile, desktop, and television consumption, we refute this conventional wisdom on three levels. First, news consumption of any sort is heavily outweighed by other forms of media consumption, comprising at most 14.2% of Americans’ daily media diets. Second, to the extent that Americans do consume news, it is overwhelmingly from television, which accounts for roughly five times as much as news consumption as online. Third, fake news comprises only 0.15% of Americans’ daily media diet. Our results suggest that the origins of public misinformedness and polarization are more likely to lie in the content of ordinary news or the avoidance of news altogether as they are in overt fakery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/6/14/eaax0069?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) mutations in β-cardiac myosin and myosin binding protein-C (MyBP-C) lead to hypercontractility of the heart, an early hallmark of HCM. We show that hypercontractility caused by the HCM-causing mutation R663H cannot be explained by changes in fundamental myosin contractile parameters, much like the HCM-causing mutation R403Q. Using enzymatic assays with purified human β-cardiac myosin, we provide evidence that both mutations cause hypercontractility by increasing the number of functionally accessible myosin heads. We also demonstrate that the myosin mutation R403Q, but not R663H, ablates the binding of myosin with the C0-C7 fragment of MyBP-C. Furthermore, addition of C0-C7 decreases the wild-type myosin basal ATPase single turnover rate, while the mutants do not show a similar reduction. These data suggest that a primary mechanism of action for these mutations is to increase the number of myosin heads functionally available for interaction with actin, which could contribute to hypercontractility.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by David Pellow, Itzik Mizrahi, Ron Shamir&lt;/p&gt;

Many bacteria contain plasmids, but separating between contigs that originate on the plasmid and those that are part of the bacterial genome can be difficult. This is especially true in metagenomic assembly, which yields many contigs of unknown origin. Existing tools for classifying sequences of plasmid origin give less reliable results for shorter sequences, are trained using a fraction of the known plasmids, and can be difficult to use in practice. We present PlasClass, a new plasmid classifier. It uses a set of standard classifiers trained on the most current set of known plasmid sequences for different sequence lengths. We tested PlasClass sequence classification on held-out data and simulations, as well as publicly available bacterial isolates and plasmidome samples and plasmids assembled from metagenomic samples. PlasClass outperforms the state-of-the-art plasmid classification tool on shorter sequences, which constitute the majority of assembly contigs, allowing it to achieve higher F1 scores in classifying sequences from a wide range of datasets. PlasClass also uses significantly less time and memory. PlasClass can be used to easily classify plasmid and bacterial genome sequences in metagenomic or isolate assemblies.

Have you ever sought to use metagenomic DNA sequences reported in scientific publications? Were you successful? Here, we reveal that metagenomes from no fewer than 20% of the papers found in our literature search, published between 2016 and 2019, were not deposited in a repository or were simply inaccessible. The proportion of inaccessible data within the literature has been increasing year-on-year. Noncompliance with Open Data is best predicted by the scientific discipline of the journal. The number of citations, journal type (e.g., Open Access or subscription journals), and publisher are not good predictors of data accessibility. However, many publications in high–impact factor journals do display a higher likelihood of accessible metagenomic data sets. Twenty-first century science demands compliance with the ethical standard of data sharing of metagenomes and DNA sequence data more broadly. Data accessibility must become one of the routine and mandatory components of manuscript submissions—a requirement that should be applicable across the increasing number of disciplines using metagenomics. Compliance must be ensured and reinforced by funders, publishers, editors, reviewers, and, ultimately, the authors.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/J64iz9TnOSQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: BigBrain 3D atlas of cortical layers: Cortical and laminar thickness gradients diverge in sensory and motor cortices</title>

Histological atlases of the cerebral cortex, such as those made famous by Brodmann and von Economo, are invaluable for understanding human brain microstructure and its relationship with functional organization in the brain. However, these existing atlases are limited to small numbers of manually annotated samples from a single cerebral hemisphere, measured from 2D histological sections. We present the first whole-brain quantitative 3D laminar atlas of the human cerebral cortex. It was derived from a 3D histological atlas of the human brain at 20-micrometer isotropic resolution (BigBrain), using a convolutional neural network to segment, automatically, the cortical layers in both hemispheres. Our approach overcomes many of the historical challenges with measurement of histological thickness in 2D, and the resultant laminar atlas provides an unprecedented level of precision and detail. We utilized this BigBrain cortical atlas to test whether previously reported thickness gradients, as measured by MRI in sensory and motor processing cortices, were present in a histological atlas of cortical thickness and which cortical layers were contributing to these gradients. Cortical thickness increased across sensory processing hierarchies, primarily driven by layers III, V, and VI. In contrast, motor-frontal cortices showed the opposite pattern, with decreases in total and pyramidal layer thickness from motor to frontal association cortices. These findings illustrate how this laminar atlas will provide a link between single-neuron morphology, mesoscale cortical layering, macroscopic cortical thickness, and, ultimately, functional neuroanatomy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/HwoRD4mJykw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Neurophysiological evidence for crossmodal (face-name) person-identity representation in the human left ventral temporal cortex</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/cTYTWtgKEDA/article</link>

Putting a name to a face is a highly common activity in our daily life that greatly enriches social interactions. Although this specific person–identity association becomes automatic with learning, it remains difficult and can easily be disrupted in normal circumstances or neurological conditions. To shed light on the neural basis of this important and yet poorly understood association between different input modalities in the human brain, we designed a crossmodal frequency-tagging paradigm coupled to brain activity recording via scalp and intracerebral electroencephalography. In Experiment 1, 12 participants were presented with variable pictures of faces and written names of a single famous identity at a 4-Hz frequency rate while performing an orthogonal task. Every 7 items, another famous identity appeared, either as a face or a name. Robust electrophysiological responses were found exactly at the frequency of identity change (i.e., 4 Hz / 7 = 0.571 Hz), suggesting a crossmodal neural response to person identity. In Experiment 2 with twenty participants, two control conditions with periodic changes of identity for faces or names only were added to estimate the contribution of unimodal neural activity to the putative crossmodal face-name responses. About 30% of the response occurring at the frequency of crossmodal identity change over the left occipito-temporal cortex could not be accounted for by the linear sum of unimodal responses. Finally, intracerebral recordings in the left ventral anterior temporal lobe (ATL) in 7 epileptic patients tested with this paradigm revealed a small number of “pure” crossmodal responses, i.e., with no response to changes of identity for faces or names only. Altogether, these observations provide evidence for integration of verbal and nonverbal person identity-specific information in the human brain, highlighting the contribution of the left ventral ATL in the automatic retrieval of face-name identity associations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/cTYTWtgKEDA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Human brain neurons express a novel splice variant of excitatory amino acid transporter 5 (hEAAT5v)&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a2e4ce74-c563-48c4-88dd-00a739722fb5/cne24907-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternately spliced human EAAT5 (hEAAT5v) which contains an additional intron after exon 7 of normally spliced human EAAT5 (7‐int) was cloned from human brain. Immunocytochemistry reveals expression of this protein in apical (A) and basal (B) dendrites and axons (Ax) of human cortical pyramidal neurons. The protein is also expressed by GABAergic neurons including Purkinje cells. It plausibly functions as a glutamate‐gated chloride conductance rather than as a glutamate transporter.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excitatory amino acid transporter 5 (EAAT5) is a protein that is known to be alternately spliced and to be abundantly expressed in the retina by populations of neurons including photoreceptors and bipolar cells. EAAT5 acts as a slow glutamate transporter and also as glutamate‐gated chloride channel, the chloride conductance being large enough for EAAT5 to serve functionally as an “inhibitory” glutamate receptor. However, there has been a long‐standing view that the classically spliced form of EAAT5 is not abundant or widespread in the brain and so it has not been extensively investigated in the literature. We recently identified a human‐specific splicing form of EAAT5 that was not expressed by rodents but was shown to be a functional glutamate transporter. We have examined the expression of this form of EAAT5, hEAAT5v at the mRNA, and protein level in human brain, and show that populations of human cortical pyramidal neurons and cerebellar Purkinje cells show significant expression of hEAAT5v. Accordingly, we infer that EAAT5 may well be a player in modulating neuronal function in the human brain and propose that its localization in both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons could be compatible with a role in influencing intracellular chloride and thereby neuronal parameters such as membrane potential rather than acting as a presynaptic glutamate transporter.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors are composed of five subunits arranged around a central chloride channel. The different subunits originate from different genes or gene families. In the mammalian brain, they generally consist of two α‐, two β‐ and one γ‐ or δ‐subunit. The subunit organization crucially determines the physiological and pharmacological properties of the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. Here we investigated the distribution of 10 different GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor subunits in the forebrain of rhesus monkeys.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors are composed of five subunits arranged around a central chloride channel. Their subunits originate from different genes or gene families. The majority of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in the mammalian brain consist of two α‐, two β‐ and one γ‐ or δ‐subunit. This subunit organization crucially determines the physiological and pharmacological properties of the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. Using immunohistochemistry, we investigated the distribution of 10 GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor subunits (α1, α2, α3, α4, α5, β1, β2, β3, γ2, and δ) in the fore brain of three female rhesus monkeys (&lt;i&gt;Macaca mulatta&lt;/i&gt;). Within the cerebral cortex, subunits α1, α5, β2, β3, and γ2 were found in all layers, α2, α3, and β1 were more concentrated in the inner and outer layers. The caudate/putamen was rich in α1, α2, α5, all three β‐subunits, γ2, and δ. Subunits α3 and α5 were more concentrated in the caudate than in the putamen. In contrast, α1, α2, β1, β2, γ2, and δ were highest in the pallidum. Most dorsal thalamic nuclei contained subunits α1, α2, α4, β2, β3, and γ2, whereas α1, α3, β1, and γ2 were most abundant in the reticular nucleus. Within the amygdala, subunits α1, α2, α5, β1, β3, γ2, and δ were concentrated in the cortical nucleus, whereas in the lateral and basolateral amygdala α1, α2, α5, β1, β3, and δ, and in the central amygdala α1, α2, β3, and γ2 were most abundant. Interestingly, subunit α3‐IR outlined the intercalated nuclei of the amygdala. In the hippocampus, subunits α1, α2, α5, β2, β3, γ2, and δ were highly expressed in the dentate molecular layer, whereas α1, α2, α3, α5, β1, β2, β3, and γ2 were concentrated in sector CA1 and the subiculum. The distribution of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor subunits in the rhesus monkey was highly heterogeneous indicating a high number of differently assembled receptors. In most areas investigated, notably in the striatum/pallidum, amygdaloid nuclei and in the hippocampus it was more diverse than in the rat and mouse indicating a more heterogeneous and less defined receptor assembly in the monkey than in rodent brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To make full use of optogenetic and molecular techniques in the study of motor control, rich behavioral paradigms for rodents must rise to the same level of sophistication and applicability. We describe the layout, construction, use and analysis of data from joystick-based reaching in a head-fixed mouse. The step-by-step guide is designed for both experienced rodent motor labs and new groups looking to enter into this research space. Using this platform, mice learn to consistently perform large, easily-quantified reaches, including during a two-armed bandit probabilistic learning task. The metrics of performance (reach trajectory, amplitude, speed, duration, and inter-reach interval) can be used to quantify behavior or administer stimulation in closed loop with behavior. We provide a highly customizable, low cost and reproducible open-source behavior training platform for studying motor control, decision-making, and reaching reaction time. The development of this software and hardware platform enables behavioral work to complement recent advances in rodents, while remaining accessible to smaller institutions and labs, thus providing a high-throughput method to study unexplored features of action selection, motivation, and value-based decisions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Blood Pressure Goals and Clinical Outcomes after Successful Endovascular Therapy: A Multicenter Study</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25716?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) after successful revascularization (SR) via endovascular therapy (EVT) is a known predictor of poor outcome. However, the optimal SBP goal following EVT is still unknown. Our objective was to compare functional and safety outcomes between different SBP goals after EVT with SR.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This international multicenter study included 8 comprehensive stroke centers and patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion who were treated with EVT and achieved SR. SR was defined as modified thrombolysis in cerebral ischemia 2b to 3. Patients were divided into 3 groups based on SBP goal in the first 24 hours after EVT. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) propensity analysis was used to assess the effect of different SBP goals on clinical outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 1,019 patients were included. On IPTW analysis, the SBP goal of &amp;lt;140mmHg was associated with a higher likelihood of good functional outcome and lower odds of hemicraniectomy compared to SBP goal of &amp;lt;180mmHg. Similarly, SBP goal of &amp;lt;160mmHg was associated with lower odds of mortality compared to SBP goal of &amp;lt;180mmHg. In subgroup analysis including only patients with pre‐EVT SBP of ≥140mmHg, an SBP of &amp;lt;140mmHg was associated with a higher likelihood of good functional outcome, lower odds of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and lower odds of requirement for hemicraniectomy compared to SBP goal of &amp;lt;180mmHg.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SBP goals of &amp;lt;140 and &amp;lt; 160mmHg following SR with EVT appear to be associated with better clinical outcomes than SBP of &amp;lt;180mmHg. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Nystatin Regulates Axonal Extension and Regeneration by Modifying the Levels of Nitric Oxide</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00056</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nystatin is a pharmacological agent commonly used for the treatment of oral, mucosal and cutaneous fungal infections. Nystatin has also been extensively applied to study the cellular function of cholesterol-enriched structures because of its ability to bind and extract cholesterol from mammalian membranes. In neurons, cholesterol level is tightly regulated, being essential for synapse and dendrite formation, and axonal guidance. However, the action of Nystatin on axon regeneration has been poorly evaluated. Here, we examine the effect of Nystatin on primary cultures of hippocampal neurons, showing how acute dose (minutes) of Nystatin increases the area of growth cones, and chronic treatment (days) enhances axon length, axon branching, and axon regeneration post-axotomy. We describe two alternative signaling pathways responsible for the observed effects and activated at different concentrations of Nystatin. At elevated concentrations, Nystatin promotes growth cone expansion through phosphorylation of Akt; whereas, at low concentrations, Nystatin enhances axon length and regrowth by increasing nitric oxide levels. Together, our findings indicate new signaling pathways of Nystatin and propose this compound as a novel regulator of axon regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Noncanonical, Dopamine-Dependent Long-Term Potentiation at Hippocampal Output Synapses in a Rodent Model of First-Episode Psychosis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00055</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive deficits and positive symptoms in schizophrenia have both been linked to hippocampal dysfunction. Recently, subregion-specific aberrant and maladaptive hippocampal synaptic plasticity has been suggested as one of the mechanistic underpinnings. The subiculum is the final output hub of the hippocampus and orchestrates hippocampal information transfer to other brain regions. While most CA1 pyramidal neurons show regular-spiking behavior, subicular output neurons comprise bursting and regular-firing pyramidal cells. These two cell types target different brain regions and express unique forms of synaptic plasticity. Here, we used a single systemic application of the noncompetitive glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist MK-801 to model first-episode psychosis in rats and studied long-term potentiation (LTP) in subicular regular-firing cells in acute hippocampal slices. Previously, we have reported a facilitation of a presynaptic, late-onset LTP in subicular bursting pyramidal cells after systemic NMDAR antagonism. Here, we show that single systemic NMDAR antagonist application also facilitates the induction of a noncanonical, but postsynaptic NMDAR-independent LTP in ventral subicular but not in CA1 regular-firing pyramidal cells. This form of LTP was dependent on D1/D5 dopamine receptor activation. Activation of D1/D5 dopamine receptors by a specific agonist mimicked and occluded LTP induced by electrical high-frequency stimulation (HFS). Furthermore, our results indicate that this form of LTP relies on postsynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling and requires the activation of protein kinase A. Considering the pivotal role of the subiculum as information gatekeeper between the hippocampus and other brain regions, this aberrant LTP in ventral subicular regular-firing neurons is expected to interfere with physiological hippocampal output processing and might thereby contribute to hippocampal dysfunction in psychotic events.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Differential Influence of Sample Sex and Neuronal Maturation on mRNA and Protein Transport in Induced Human Neurons</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00046</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) across thenuclear envelope (NE) is tightly regulated in eukaryotic cells and iscritical for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Its dysregulationleads to aging and neurodegeneration. Because they maintainaging-associated hallmarks, directly reprogrammed neurons from human fibroblasts are invaluable in understanding NCT. However, it is not clear whether NCT activity is influenced by neuronal maturation and sample sex [a key biological variable emphasized by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) policy]. We examined here NCT activity at the single-cell level by measuring mRNA subcellular distribution and protein transport in directly induced motor neurons (diMNs) from adult human fibroblasts. The results show that mRNA subcellular distribution but not protein transport is affected by neuronal maturation stages, whereas both transport processes are not influenced by the sample sex. This study also provides quantitative methods and optimized conditions for measuring NCTs of mRNAs or protein cargoes, establishing a robust way for future functional examinations of NCT activity in directly induced neurons from diseased human patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Sensory Habituation as a Shared Mechanism for Sensory Over-Responsivity and Obsessive–Compulsive Symptoms</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00017</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Some individuals who suffer from obsessive–compulsive (OC) disorder (OCD), report disturbing sensory preoccupations. The inability to stop obsessing over stimuli resonates with a difficulty in sensory habituation. Impaired sensory habituation, to a degree that clearly dysregulates response to sensory stimuli, and impairs participation in everyday activities, can be part of a disorder known as sensory over-responsivity (SOR). Although previous studies indicated a correlation between OCD and SOR, physiological experiments show that individuals with OCD are not more sensitive to sensory stimuli than controls. In the current study, we (1) validated a sensory habituation psycho-physiological protocol and (2) tested whether a “slow to habituate” mechanism can explain the occurrence of elevated SOR and OC symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We designed a protocol to test auditory sensory habituation through electrodermal activity (EDA) recording. The protocol included two randomly ordered aversive and neutral sound conditions; each set of six everyday life sounds was presented as a continuous stimulus. During the presentation of sounds, EDA was measured and participants could press a button to shorten the stimuli. Participants also completed sensory and OC symptom questionnaires. Participants included 100 typically developing adults that were divided into high versus low OC symptom groups. Mixed models analysis was used throughout to meet the need for capturing the temporal nature of habituation.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Distinct physiological indices were computed to measure sensitivity versus habituation. Habituation was slower in the aversive versus neutral condition. Sensitivity was higher for the aversive stimuli. Self-report of sensory habituation and sensitivity partially correlated with the physiological habituation indices. A comparison of the physiological pattern between those with high versus low OC symptoms revealed significant differences in the habituation and sensitivity indices, across conditions.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The interplay between SOR and OC symptoms can be explained by a “slow to habituate” mechanism. Identifying behavioral and physiological markers of sensory problems in OCD is important for assessment, intervention and the discovery of underlying mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Melanopsin Driven Light Responses Across a Large Fraction of Retinal Ganglion Cells in a Dystrophic Retina</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00320</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) express the photopigment melanopsin and project to central targets, allowing them to contribute to both image-forming and non-image forming vision. Recent studies have highlighted chemical and electrical synapses between ipRGCs and neurons of the inner retina, suggesting a potential influence from the melanopsin-born signal to affect visual processing at an early stage of the visual pathway. We investigated melanopsin responses in ganglion cell layer (GCL) neurons of both intact and dystrophic mouse retinas using 256 channel multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings. A wide 200 μm inter-electrode spacing enabled a pan-retinal visualization of melanopsin’s influence upon GCL activity. Upon initial stimulation of dystrophic retinas with a long, bright light pulse, over 37% of units responded with an increase in firing (a far greater fraction than can be expected from the anatomically characterized number of ipRGCs). This relatively widespread response dissipated with repeated stimulation even at a quite long inter-stimulus interval (ISI; 120 s), to leave a smaller fraction of responsive units (&amp;lt;10%; more in tune with the predicted number of ipRGCs). Visually intact retinas appeared to lack such widespread melanopsin responses indicating that it is a feature of dystrophy. Taken together, our data reveal the potential for anomalously widespread melanopsin responses in advanced retinal degeneration. These could be used to probe the functional reorganization of retinal circuits in degeneration and should be taken into account when using retinally degenerate mice as a model of disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Functional and Structural Brain Alterations in Encephalitis With LGI1 Antibodies</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00304</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the neural substrates and mechanisms that generate memory deficits, seizures and neuropsychiatric abnormalities in encephalitis with LGI1 antibodies using a data-driven, multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Functional MRI data were acquired from 14 anti-LGI1 encephalitis patients and 14 age and gender matched normal controls. Independent component analysis with hierarchical partner matching (HPM-ICA) was used to assess the whole-brain intrinsic functional connectivity. Granger causality (GC) was applied to investigate the effective connectivity among the brain regions that identified by HPM-ICA. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was utilized to investigate white matter microstructural changes of the patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Participants with LGI1 antibodies encephalitis presented reduced functional connectivity in the brain areas associated with memory, cognition and motion circuits, while increased functional connectivity in putamen and caudate in comparison to the normal controls. Moreover, the effective connectivity in patients was decreased from the frontal cortex to supplementary motor area. Finally, patients had significant reductions in fractional anisotropy (FA) for the corpus callosum, internal capsule, corona radiata and superior longitudinal fasciculus, accompanied by increases in mean diffusivity (MD) for these regions as compared to controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the neural disorder and behavioral deficits of anti-LGI1 encephalitis may be associated with extensive changes in brain connectivity and microstructure. These pathological alterations affect the basal ganglia and limbic system besides the temporal and frontal lobe.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Ataxic Symptoms in Huntington’s Disease Transgenic Mouse Model Are Alleviated by Chlorzoxazone</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00279</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Huntington’s disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disease caused by a polyglutamine expansion in the huntingtin protein, Striatum atrophy in HD leads to a progressive disturbance of psychiatric, motor, and cognitive function. Recent studies of HD patients revealed that the degeneration of cerebellum is also observed independently from the striatal atrophy during early HD stage and may contribute to the motor impairment and ataxia observed in HD. Cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) are responsible for the proper cerebellar pathways functioning and motor control. Recent studies on mouse models of HD have shown that the abnormality of the biochemical functions of PCs are observed in HD, suggesting the contribution of PC dysfunction and death to the impaired movement coordination observed in HD. To investigate ataxic symptoms in HD we performed a series of experiments with the yeast artificial chromosome transgenic mouse model of HD (YAC128). Using extracellular single-unit recording method we found that the portion of the cerebellar PCs with bursting and irregular patterns of spontaneous activity drastically rises in aged YAC128 HD mice when compared with wild type littermates. Previous studies demonstrated that SK channels are responsible for the cerebellar PC pacemaker activity and that positive modulation of SK channel activity exerted beneficial effects in different ataxic mouse models. Here we studied effects of the SK channels modulator chlorzoxazone (CHZ) on the motor behavior of YAC128 HD mice and also on the electrophysiological activity and neuroanatomy of the cerebellar PCs from these mice. We determined that the long-term intraperitoneal injections of CHZ alleviated the progressive impairment in the firing pattern of YAC128 PCs. We also demonstrated that treatment with CHZ rescued age-dependent motor incoordination and improved the cerebellar morphology in YAC128 mice. We propose that abnormal changes in the PC firing patterns might be a one of the possible causes of ataxic symptoms in HD and in other polyglutamine disorders and that the pharmacological activation of SK channels may serve as a potential way to improve the activity of cerebellar PCs and relieve the ataxic phenotype in HD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00278</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Our goal was to determine the influence of sex, age and the head/brain size on the compartmental brain volumes in the radiologically verified healthy population (96 subjects; 54 women and 42 men) from the Upper Silesia region in Poland. The MRI examinations were done using 3T Philips Achieva with the same T1-weighted and T2-weighted protocols. The image segmentation procedures were performed with SPM (Statistical Parameter Mapping) and FSL-FIRST software. The volumes of 14 subcortical structures for the left and right hemispheres and 4 overall volumes were calculated. The General Linear Models (GLM) analysis was used with and without the Total Brain Volume (TBV) and Intracranial Volume (ICV) parameters as the covariates to study the regional vs. global brain atrophy. After the ICV/TBV adjustments, the majority of sex differences in the specific volumes of interest (VOIs) revealed to be linked to the difference in the head/brain size parameters. The analysis also confirmed the significant effect of the aging process on the brain loss. After the TBV adjustment, the age- and sex-related volumetric trends for the gray and white matter volumes were observed: the negative age dependence of the gray matter volume is more pronounced in the males, while in case of the white matter the positive age-related trend in the female group is weaker. The local losses of the left caudate nucleus and the right thalamus are more advanced than the global brain atrophy. Different head-size correction strategies are not interchangeable and may yield various volumetric results, but when used together, facilitate studies on the regional dependencies inherent to a healthy, but aging, brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Simulation of a Human-Scale Cerebellar Network Model on the K Computer</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00016</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Computer simulation of the human brain at an individual neuron resolution is an ultimate goal of computational neuroscience. The Japanese flagship supercomputer, K, provides unprecedented computational capability toward this goal. The cerebellum contains 80% of the neurons in the whole brain. Therefore, computer simulation of the human-scale cerebellum will be a challenge for modern supercomputers. In this study, we built a human-scale spiking network model of the cerebellum, composed of 68 billion spiking neurons, on the K computer. As a benchmark, we performed a computer simulation of a cerebellum-dependent eye movement task known as the optokinetic response. We succeeded in reproducing plausible neuronal activity patterns that are observed experimentally in animals. The model was built on dedicated neural network simulation software called MONET (Millefeuille-like Organization NEural neTwork), which calculates layered sheet types of neural networks with parallelization by tile partitioning. To examine the scalability of the MONET simulator, we repeatedly performed simulations while changing the number of compute nodes from 1,024 to 82,944 and measured the computational time. We observed a good weak-scaling property for our cerebellar network model. Using all 82,944 nodes, we succeeded in simulating a human-scale cerebellum for the first time, although the simulation was 578 times slower than the wall clock time. These results suggest that the K computer is already capable of creating a simulation of a human-scale cerebellar model with the aid of the MONET simulator.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00123</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease (PD) often receive deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment, in which conductive leads are surgically implanted in the brain. While DBS treats tremor and rigidity, patients often continue to suffer from speech and swallowing impairments. There is preliminary evidence that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the cortex may be beneficial for these symptoms. However, the potential electromagnetic interactions of the strong magnetic fields from TMS on the conductive leads is unknown, and the combination therapy has not been approved for use. In this article, we report an experimental study of the safety of combining DBS and TMS. We fabricated an anatomically accurate head and brain phantom with electrical conductivities matching cerebrospinal fluid and averaged conductivity of gray and white matter. Induced current on an implanted DBS probe in the brain phantom was measured. Our results show that TMS will induce current values in the range or higher than typical DBS stimulation current. Thus, the combination of TMS/DBS treatment might cause over-stimulation in the brain when stimulated directly over the DBS lead with 100% TMS current intensity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00118</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: The adult brain’s potential for plastic reorganization is an important mechanism for the preservation and restoration of function in patients with primary glial neoplasm. Patients with recurrent brain tumors requiring multiple interventions over time present an opportunity to examine brain reorganization. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a noninvasive imaging modality that can be used for motor cortical network mapping which, when performed at regular intervals, offers insight into this process of reorganization. Utilizing MEG-based motor mapping, we sought to characterize the reorganization of motor cortical networks over time in a cohort of 78 patients with recurrent glioma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: MEG-based motor cortical maps were obtained by measuring event-related desynchronization (ERD) in ß-band frequency during unilateral index finger flexion. Each patient presented at our Department at least on two occasions for tumor resection due to tumor recurrence, and MEG-based motor mapping was performed as part of preoperative assessment before each surgical resection. Whole-brain activation patterns from first to second MEG scan (obtained before first and second surgery) were compared. Additionally, we calculated distances of activation peaks, which represent the location of the primary motor cortex (MC), to determine the magnitude of movement in motor eloquent areas between the first and second MEG scan. We also explored which demographic, anatomic, and pathological factors influence these shifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The whole-brain activation motor maps showed a subtle movement of the primary MC from first to second timepoint, as was confirmed by the determination of motor activation peaks. The shift of ipsilesional MC was directly correlated with a frontal-parietal tumor location (p &amp;lt; 0.001), presence of motor deficits (p = 0.021), and with a longer period between MEG scans (p = 0.048). Also, a disengagement of wide areas in the contralesional (ipsilateral to finger movement) hemisphere at the second time point was observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: MEG imaging is a sensitive method for depicting the plasticity of the motor cortical network. Although the location of the primary MC undergoes only subtle changes, appreciable shifts can occur in the setting of a stronger and longer impairment of the tumor on the MC. The ipsilateral hemisphere may serve as a reservoir for functional recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Hearing Aids Do Not Alter Cortical Entrainment to Speech at Audible Levels in Mild-to-Moderately Hearing-Impaired Subjects</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00109</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Cortical entrainment to speech correlates with speech intelligibility and attention to a speech stream in noisy environments. However, there is a lack of data on whether cortical entrainment can help in evaluating hearing aid fittings for subjects with mild to moderate hearing loss. One particular problem that may arise is that hearing aids may alter the speech stimulus during (pre-)processing steps, which might alter cortical entrainment to the speech. Here, the effect of hearing aid processing on cortical entrainment to running speech in hearing impaired subjects was investigated.&lt;/p&gt;Methodology&lt;p&gt;Seventeen native English-speaking subjects with mild-to-moderate hearing loss participated in the study. Hearing function and hearing aid fitting were evaluated using standard clinical procedures. Participants then listened to a 25-min audiobook under aided and unaided conditions at 70 dBA sound pressure level (SPL) in quiet conditions. EEG data were collected using a 32-channel system. Cortical entrainment to speech was evaluated using decoders reconstructing the speech envelope from the EEG data. Null decoders, obtained from EEG and the time-reversed speech envelope, were used to assess the chance level reconstructions. Entrainment in the delta- (1–4 Hz) and theta- (4–8 Hz) band, as well as wideband (1–20 Hz) EEG data was investigated.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Significant cortical responses could be detected for all but one subject in all three frequency bands under both aided and unaided conditions. However, no significant differences could be found between the two conditions in the number of responses detected, nor in the strength of cortical entrainment. The results show that the relatively small change in speech input provided by the hearing aid was not sufficient to elicit a detectable change in cortical entrainment.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;For subjects with mild to moderate hearing loss, cortical entrainment to speech in quiet at an audible level is not affected by hearing aids. These results clear the pathway for exploring the potential to use cortical entrainment to running speech for evaluating hearing aid fitting at lower speech intensities (which could be inaudible when unaided), or using speech in noise conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00090</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;Sensory processing is the ability to capture, elaborate, and integrate information through the five senses and is impaired in over 90% of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The ASD population shows hyper–hypo sensitiveness to sensory stimuli that can generate alteration in information processing, affecting cognitive and social responses to daily life situations. Structured and semi-structured interviews are generally used for ASD assessment, and the evaluation relies on the examiner’s subjectivity and expertise, which can lead to misleading outcomes. Recently, there has been a growing need for more objective, reliable, and valid diagnostic measures, such as biomarkers, to distinguish typical from atypical functioning and to reliably track the progression of the illness, helping to diagnose ASD. Implicit measures and ecological valid settings have been showing high accuracy on predicting outcomes and correctly classifying populations in categories.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Two experiments investigated whether sensory processing can discriminate between ASD and typical development (TD) populations using electrodermal activity (EDA) in two multimodal virtual environments (VE): forest VE and city VE. In the first experiment, 24 children with ASD diagnosis and 30 TDs participated in both virtual experiences, and changes in EDA have been recorded before and during the presentation of visual, auditive, and olfactive stimuli. In the second experiment, 40 children have been added to test the model of experiment 1.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The first exploratory results on EDA comparison models showed that the integration of visual, auditive, and olfactive stimuli in the forest environment provided higher accuracy (90.3%) on sensory dysfunction discrimination than specific stimuli. In the second experiment, 92 subjects experienced the forest VE, and results on 72 subjects showed that stimuli integration achieved an accuracy of 83.33%. The final confirmatory test set (n = 20) achieved 85% accuracy, simulating a real application of the models. Further relevant result concerns the visual stimuli condition in the first experiment, which achieved 84.6% of accuracy in recognizing ASD sensory dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;According to our studies’ results, implicit measures, such as EDA, and ecological valid settings can represent valid quantitative methods, along with traditional assessment measures, to classify ASD population, enhancing knowledge on the development of relevant specific treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Dissecting the Dual Role of the Glial Scar and Scar-Forming Astrocytes in Spinal Cord Injury</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00078</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recovery from spinal cord injury (SCI) remains an unsolved problem. As a major component of the SCI lesion, the glial scar is primarily composed of scar-forming astrocytes and plays a crucial role in spinal cord regeneration. In recent years, it has become increasingly accepted that the glial scar plays a dual role in SCI recovery. However, the underlying mechanisms of this dual role are complex and need further clarification. This dual role also makes it difficult to manipulate the glial scar for therapeutic purposes. Here, we briefly discuss glial scar formation and some representative components associated with scar-forming astrocytes. Then, we analyze the dual role of the glial scar in a dynamic perspective with special attention to scar-forming astrocytes to explore the underlying mechanisms of this dual role. Finally, taking the dual role of the glial scar into account, we provide several pieces of advice on novel therapeutic strategies targeting the glial scar and scar-forming astrocytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Delayed PARP-1 Inhibition Alleviates Post-stroke Inflammation in Male Versus Female Mice: Differences and Similarities</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00077</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Post-stroke inflammation is almost involved in the whole process of stroke pathogenesis, which serves as a prime target for developing new stroke therapies. Despite known sex differences in the incidence and outcome of stroke, few preclinical or clinical studies take into account sex bias in treatment. Recent evidence suggests that poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 inhibitor exerts sex-specific neuroprotection in the ischemic stroke. This study was aimed to investigate the effects of delayed PARP-1 inhibition on post-stroke inflammation and possible sexual dimorphism, and explore the possible relevant mediators. In male and female C57BL/6 mice subjected to transit middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), we found that delayed treatment of PARP-1 inhibitor at 48 h following reperfusion could comparably alleviate neuro-inflammation at 72 h after stroke. Whereas, more remarkable reduction of iNOS and MMP9 induced by PARP-1 inhibition were found in male MCAO mice, and the improvement of behavioral outcomes was more prominent in male MCAO mice. In addition, we further identified that PARP-1 inhibitor might equivalently suppress microglial activation in males and females in vivo and in vitro. With proteomic analysis and western blotting assay, it was found that stroke-induced peroxiredoxin-1 (Prx1) expression was significantly affected by PARP-1 inhibition. Interestingly, injection of recombinant Prx1 into the ischemic core could block the anti-inflammatory effects of PARP-1 inhibitor in the experimental stroke. These findings suggest that PARP-1 inhibitor has effects on regulating microglial activation and post-stroke inflammation in males and females, and holds promise as a novel therapeutic agent for stroke with extended therapeutic time window. Efforts need to be made to delineate the actions of PARP-1 inhibition in stroke, and here we propose that Prx1 might be a critical mediator.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Programmed Cell Deaths and Potential Crosstalk With Blood–Brain Barrier Dysfunction After Hemorrhagic Stroke</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00068</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hemorrhagic stroke is a life-threatening neurological disease characterized by high mortality and morbidity. Various pathophysiological responses are initiated after blood enters the interstitial space of the brain, compressing the brain tissue and thus causing cell death. Recently, three new programmed cell deaths (PCDs), necroptosis, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis, were also found to be important contributors in the pathophysiology of hemorrhagic stroke. Additionally, blood–brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of hemorrhagic stroke. The primary insult following BBB dysfunction may disrupt the tight junctions (TJs), transporters, transcytosis, and leukocyte adhesion molecule expression, which may lead to brain edema, ionic homeostasis disruption, altered signaling, and immune infiltration, consequently causing neuronal cell death. This review article summarizes recent advances in our knowledge of the mechanisms regarding these new PCDs and reviews their contributions in hemorrhagic stroke and potential crosstalk in BBB dysfunction. Numerous studies revealed that necroptosis, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis participate in cell death after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Endothelial dysfunction caused by these three PCDs may be the critical factor during BBB damage. Also, several signaling pathways were involved in PCDs and BBB dysfunction. These new PCDs (necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis), as well as BBB dysfunction, each play a critical role after hemorrhagic stroke. A better understanding of the interrelationship among them might provide us with better therapeutic targets for the treatment of hemorrhagic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Advantages and Recent Developments of Autologous Cell Therapy for Parkinson’s Disease Patients</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00058</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a progressive degenerative disease characterized by tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and postural instability. There are approximately 7–10 million PD patients worldwide. Currently, there are no biomarkers available or pharmaceuticals that can halt the dopaminergic neuron degeneration. At the time of diagnosis about 60% of the midbrain dopamine (mDA) neurons have already degenerated, resulting in a depletion of roughly 70% of striatal dopamine (DA) levels and synapses. Symptomatic treatment (e.g., with L-dopa) can initially restore DA levels and motor function, but with time often lead to side-effects like dyskinesia. Deep-brain-stimulation can alleviate these side-effects and some of the motor symptoms but requires repeat procedures and adds limitations for the patients. Restoration of dopaminergic synapses using neuronal cell replacement therapy has shown benefit in clinical studies using cells from fetal ventral midbrain. This approach, if done correctly, increases DA levels and restores synapses, allowing biofeedback regulation between the grafted cells and the host brain. Drawbacks are that it is not scalable for a large patient population and the patients require immunosuppression. Stem cells differentiated in vitro to mDA neurons or progenitors have shown promise in animal studies and is a scalable approach that allows for cryopreservation of transplantable cells and rigorous quality control prior to transplantation. However, all allogeneic grafts require immunosuppression. HLA-donor-matching, reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the need for immunosuppression, and is currently investigated in a clinical trial for PD in Japan. Since immune compatibility is very important in all areas of transplantation, these approaches may ultimately be of less benefit to the patients than an autologous approach. By using the patient’s own somatic cells, reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and differentiated to mDA neurons immunosuppression is not required, and may also present with several biological and functional advantages in the patients, as described in this article. The proof-of-principle of autologous iPSC mDA restoration of function has been shown in parkinsonian non-human primates (NHPs), and this can now be investigated in clinical trials in addition to the allogeneic and HLA-matched approaches. In this review, we focus on the autologous approach of cell therapy for PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Parkinson’s Disease—Near-Infrared Photobiomodulation as a Potential Therapeutic Strategy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00089</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As the main driver of energy production in eukaryotes, mitochondria are invariably implicated in disorders of cellular bioenergetics. Given that dopaminergic neurons affected in Parkinson’s disease (PD) are particularly susceptible to energy fluctuations by their high basal energy demand, it is not surprising to note that mitochondrial dysfunction has emerged as a compelling candidate underlying PD. A recent approach towards forestalling dopaminergic neurodegeneration in PD involves near-infrared (NIR) photobiomodulation (PBM), which is thought to enhance mitochondrial function of stimulated cells through augmenting the activity of cytochrome C oxidase. Notwithstanding this, our understanding of the neuroprotective mechanism of PBM remains far from complete. For example, studies focusing on the effects of PBM on gene transcription are limited, and the mechanism through which PBM exerts its effects on distant sites (i.e., its “abscopal effect”) remains unclear. Also, the clinical application of NIR in PD proves to be challenging. Efficacious delivery of NIR light to the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), the primary site of disease pathology in PD, is fraught with technical challenges. Concerted efforts focused on understanding the biological effects of PBM and improving the efficiency of intracranial NIR delivery are therefore essential for its successful clinical translation. Nonetheless, PBM represents a potential novel therapy for PD. In this review, we provide an update on the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in PD and how PBM may help mitigate the neurodegenerative process. We also discussed clinical translation aspects of this treatment modality using intracranially implanted NIR delivery devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Gamified Motor Training With Tangible Robots in Older Adults: A Feasibility Study and Comparison With the Young</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00059</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: An increasing lifespan and the resulting change in our expectations of later life stages are dependent on a good health state. This emphasizes the importance of the development of strategies to further strengthen healthy aging. One important aspect of good health in later life stages is sustained skilled motor function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Here, we tested the effectiveness of robotic upper limb motor training in a game-like scenario assessing game-based learning and its transfer potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Thirty-six healthy participants (n = 18 elderly participants, n = 18 young controls) trained with a Pacman-like game using a hand-held Cellulo robot on 2 consecutive days. The game-related movements were conducted on a printed map displaying a maze and targets that had to be collected. Gradually, the task difficulty was adjusted between games by modifying or adding different game elements (e.g., speed and number of chasing ghosts, additional rules, and haptic feedback). Transfer was assessed by scoring simple robot manipulation on two different trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Elderly participants were able to improve their game performance over time [t&lt;sub&gt;(874)&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.97, p &amp;lt; 0.01]. The applied game elements had similar effects on both age groups. Importantly, the game-based learning was transferable to simple robot manipulation that resembles activities of daily life. Only minor age-related differences were present (smaller overall learning gain and different effects of the wall-crash penalty rule in the elderly group).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Gamified motor training with the Cellulo system has the potential to translate into an efficient and relatively low-cost robotic motor training tool for promoting upper limb function to promote healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Super-resolution microscopy reveals coupling between mammalian centriole subdistal appendages and distal appendages</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53580</link>
	<content:encoded>Subdistal appendages (sDAPs) are centriolar elements observed proximal to the distal appendages (DAPs) in vertebrates. Despite their obvious presence, structural and functional understanding of sDAPs remains elusive. Here, by combining super-resolved localization analysis and CRISPR-Cas9 genetic perturbation, we find that, although DAPs and sDAPs are primarily responsible for distinct functions in ciliogenesis and microtubule anchoring respectively, the presence of one element actually affects the positioning of the other. Specifically, we find dual layers of both ODF2 and CEP89, where their localizations are differentially regulated by DAP and sDAP integrity. DAP depletion relaxes longitudinal occupancy of sDAP protein ninein to cover the DAP region, implying a role of DAPs in sDAP positioning. Removing sDAPs alter the distal border of centrosomal γ-tubulins, illustrating a new role of sDAPs. Together, our results provide an architectural framework of sDAPs to shed light on functional understanding, surprisingly revealing the coupling between DAPs and sDAPs.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: KIT ligand protects against both light-induced and genetic photoreceptor degeneration</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/51698</link>
	<content:encoded>Photoreceptor degeneration is a major cause of blindness and a considerable health burden during aging but effective therapeutic or preventive strategies have not so far become readily available. Here we show in mouse models that signaling through the tyrosine kinase receptor KIT protects photoreceptor cells against both light-induced and inherited retinal degeneration. Upon light damage, photoreceptor cells upregulate Kit ligand (KITL) and activate KIT signaling, which in turn induces nuclear accumulation of the transcription factor NRF2 and stimulates the expression of the antioxidant gene &lt;i&gt;Hmox1&lt;/i&gt;. Conversely, a viable &lt;i&gt;Kit&lt;/i&gt; mutation promotes light-induced photoreceptor damage, which is reversed by experimental expression of &lt;i&gt;Hmox1&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, overexpression of KITL from a viral AAV8 vector prevents photoreceptor cell death and partially restores retinal function after light damage or in genetic models of human retinitis pigmentosa. Hence, application of KITL may provide a novel therapeutic avenue for prevention or treatment of retinal degenerative diseases.</content:encoded>

Author summary: Conferences are great venues for disseminating algorithmic bioinformatics results, but they unfortunately do not offer an opportunity to make major revisions in the way that journals do. As a result, it is not possible for authors to fix mistakes that might be easily correctable but nevertheless can cause the paper to be rejected. As a reviewer, I wish that I had the opportunity to tell the authors, “Hey, you forgot to do this really important thing, without which it is hard to accept the paper, but if you could go back and fix it, you might have a great paper for the conference.” This lack of a back and forth can be especially problematic for first-time submitters or those from outside the field, e.g., biologists.

Multiscale modelling of infectious disease systems falls within the domain of complexity science—the study of complex systems. However, what should be made clear is that current progress in multiscale modelling of infectious disease dynamics is still as yet insufficient to present it as a mature sub-discipline of complexity science. In this article we present a methodology for development of multiscale models of infectious disease systems. This methodology is a set of partially ordered research and development activities that result in multiscale models of infectious disease systems built from different scientific approaches. Therefore, the conclusive result of this article is a methodology to design multiscale models of infectious diseases. Although this research and development process for multiscale models cannot be claimed to be unique and final, it constitutes a good starting point, which may be found useful as a basis for further refinement in the discourse for multiscale modelling of infectious disease dynamics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/x6ziJKg0pEU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The molecular mechanisms and functions in complex biological systems currently remain elusive. Recent high-throughput techniques, such as next-generation sequencing, have generated a wide variety of multiomics datasets that enable the identification of biological functions and mechanisms via multiple facets. However, integrating these large-scale multiomics data and discovering functional insights are, nevertheless, challenging tasks. To address these challenges, machine learning has been broadly applied to analyze multiomics. This review introduces multiview learning—an emerging machine learning field—and envisions its potentially powerful applications to multiomics. In particular, multiview learning is more effective than previous integrative methods for learning data’s heterogeneity and revealing cross-talk patterns. Although it has been applied to various contexts, such as computer vision and speech recognition, multiview learning has not yet been widely applied to biological data—specifically, multiomics data. Therefore, this paper firstly reviews recent multiview learning methods and unifies them in a framework called multiview empirical risk minimization (MV-ERM). We further discuss the potential applications of each method to multiomics, including genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics, in an aim to discover the functional and mechanistic interpretations across omics. Secondly, we explore possible applications to different biological systems, including human diseases (e.g., brain disorders and cancers), plants, and single-cell analysis, and discuss both the benefits and caveats of using multiview learning to discover the molecular mechanisms and functions of these systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DGnjThFhIv0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Author summary: The purpose of this quick guide is to help new modelers who have little or no background in comparative modeling yet are keen to produce high-resolution protein 3D structures for their study by following systematic good modeling practices, using affordable personal computers or online computational resources. Through the available experimental 3D-structure repositories, the modeler should be able to access and use the atomic coordinates for building homology models. We also aim to provide the modeler with a rationale behind making a simple list of atomic coordinates suitable for computational analysis abiding to principles of physics (e.g., molecular mechanics). Keeping that objective in mind, these quick tips cover the process of homology modeling and some postmodeling computations such as molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD). A brief section was left for modeling nonprotein molecules, and a short case study of homology modeling is discussed.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/f1FXdcJi7Uo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Recent advances in animal tracking technology have ushered in a new era in biologging. However, the considerable size of many sophisticated biologging devices restricts their application to larger animals, whereas older techniques often still represent the state-of-the-art for studying small vertebrates. In industrial applications, low-power wireless sensor networks (WSNs) fulfill requirements similar to those needed to monitor animal behavior at high resolution and at low tag mass. We developed a wireless biologging network (WBN), which enables simultaneous direct proximity sensing, high-resolution tracking, and long-range remote data download at tag masses of 1 to 2 g. Deployments to study wild bats created social networks and flight trajectories of unprecedented quality. Our developments highlight the vast capabilities of WBNs and their potential to close an important gap in biologging: fully automated tracking and proximity sensing of small animals, even in closed habitats, at high spatial and temporal resolution.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/GWh2vVW6nuE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/368/6486/eaba0196?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As primary producers, plants rely on a large aboveground surface area to collect carbon dioxide and sunlight and a large underground surface area to collect the water and mineral nutrients needed to support their growth and development. Accessibility of the essential nutrients nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in the soil is affected by many factors that create a variable spatiotemporal landscape of their availability both at the local and global scale. Plants optimize uptake of the N and P available through modifications to their growth and development and engagement with microorganisms that facilitate their capture. The sensing of these nutrients, as well as the perception of overall nutrient status, shapes the plant’s response to its nutrient environment, coordinating its development with microbial engagement to optimize N and P capture and regulate overall plant growth.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/368/6486/eaax6367?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The success of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase–1 (PARP-1) inhibitors (PARPi) to treat cancer relates to their ability to trap PARP-1 at the site of a DNA break. Although different forms of PARPi all target the catalytic center of the enzyme, they have variable abilities to trap PARP-1. We found that several structurally distinct PARPi drive PARP-1 allostery to promote release from a DNA break. Other inhibitors drive allostery to retain PARP-1 on a DNA break. Further, we generated a new PARPi compound, converting an allosteric pro-release compound to a pro-retention compound and increasing its ability to kill cancer cells. These developments are pertinent to clinical applications where PARP-1 trapping is either desirable or undesirable.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the extinction of &lt;i&gt;Australopithecus&lt;/i&gt; and origins of &lt;i&gt;Paranthropus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Homo&lt;/i&gt; in South Africa has been hampered by the perceived complex geological context of hominin fossils, poor chronological resolution, and a lack of well-preserved early &lt;i&gt;Homo&lt;/i&gt; specimens. We describe, date, and contextualize the discovery of two hominin crania from Drimolen Main Quarry in South Africa. At ~2.04 million to 1.95 million years old, DNH 152 represents the earliest definitive occurrence of &lt;i&gt;Paranthropus robustus&lt;/i&gt;, and DNH 134 represents the earliest occurrence of a cranium with clear affinities to &lt;i&gt;Homo erectus&lt;/i&gt;. These crania also show that &lt;i&gt;Homo&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Paranthropus&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Australopithecus&lt;/i&gt; were contemporaneous at ~2 million years ago.

	<link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/368/6486/89?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of emotion relies on objective readouts of the emotional state of an individual, which remains a major challenge especially in animal models. We found that mice exhibit stereotyped facial expressions in response to emotionally salient events, as well as upon targeted manipulations in emotion-relevant neuronal circuits. Facial expressions were classified into distinct categories using machine learning and reflected the changing intrinsic value of the same sensory stimulus encountered under different homeostatic or affective conditions. Facial expressions revealed emotion features such as intensity, valence, and persistence. Two-photon imaging uncovered insular cortical neuron activity that correlated with specific facial expressions and may encode distinct emotions. Facial expressions thus provide a means to infer emotion states and their neuronal correlates in mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Science: Cysteine depletion induces pancreatic tumor ferroptosis in mice</title>
	<link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/368/6486/85?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is a form of cell death that results from the catastrophic accumulation of lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS). Oncogenic signaling elevates lipid ROS production in many tumor types and is counteracted by metabolites that are derived from the amino acid cysteine. In this work, we show that the import of oxidized cysteine (cystine) via system x&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; is a critical dependency of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which is a leading cause of cancer mortality. PDAC cells used cysteine to synthesize glutathione and coenzyme A, which, together, down-regulated ferroptosis. Studying genetically engineered mice, we found that the deletion of a system x&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; subunit, &lt;i&gt;Slc7a11&lt;/i&gt;, induced tumor-selective ferroptosis and inhibited PDAC growth. This was replicated through the administration of cyst(e)inase, a drug that depletes cysteine and cystine, demonstrating a translatable means to induce ferroptosis in PDAC.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The design of modular protein logic for regulating protein function at the posttranscriptional level is a challenge for synthetic biology. Here, we describe the design of two-input AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XNOR, and NOT gates built from de novo–designed proteins. These gates regulate the association of arbitrary protein units ranging from split enzymes to transcriptional machinery in vitro, in yeast and in primary human T cells, where they control the expression of the &lt;i&gt;TIM3&lt;/i&gt; gene related to T cell exhaustion. Designed binding interaction cooperativity, confirmed by native mass spectrometry, makes the gates largely insensitive to stoichiometric imbalances in the inputs, and the modularity of the approach enables ready extension to three-input OR, AND, and disjunctive normal form gates. The modularity and cooperativity of the control elements, coupled with the ability to de novo design an essentially unlimited number of protein components, should enable the design of sophisticated posttranslational control logic over a wide range of biological functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Slip of marine-terminating ice streams over beds of deformable till is responsible for most of the contribution of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet to sea level rise. Flow models of the ice sheet and till-bedded glaciers elsewhere require a law that relates slip resistance, slip velocity, and water pressure at the bed. We present results of experiments in which pressurized ice at its melting temperature is slid over a water-saturated till bed. Steady-state slip resistance increases with slip velocity owing to sliding of ice across the bed, but above a threshold velocity, till shears at its rate-independent Coulomb strength. These results motivate a generalized slip law for glacier-flow models that combines processes of hard-bedded sliding and bed deformation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A defining feature of emergent phenomena in complex oxides is the competition and cooperation between ground states. In manganites, the balance between metallic and insulating phases can be tuned by the lattice; extending the range of lattice control would enhance the ability to access other phases. We stabilized uniform extreme tensile strain in nanoscale La&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;Ca&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; membranes, exceeding 8% uniaxially and 5% biaxially. Uniaxial and biaxial strain suppresses the ferromagnetic metal at distinctly different strain values, inducing an insulator that can be extinguished by a magnetic field. Electronic structure calculations indicate that the insulator consists of charge-ordered Mn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mn&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; with staggered strain-enhanced Jahn-Teller distortions within the plane. This highly tunable strained membrane approach provides a broad opportunity to design and manipulate correlated electron states.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Precise three-dimensional (3D) atomic structure determination of individual nanocrystals is a prerequisite for understanding and predicting their physical properties. Nanocrystals from the same synthesis batch display what are often presumed to be small but possibly important differences in size, lattice distortions, and defects, which can only be understood by structural characterization with high spatial 3D resolution. We solved the structures of individual colloidal platinum nanocrystals by developing atomic-resolution 3D liquid-cell electron microscopy to reveal critical intrinsic heterogeneity of ligand-protected platinum nanocrystals in solution, including structural degeneracies, lattice parameter deviations, internal defects, and strain. These differences in structure lead to substantial contributions to free energies, consequential enough that they must be considered in any discussion of fundamental nanocrystal properties or applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) engages mitochondria at specialized ER domains known as mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs).

Mice with ERAD deficiency in brown adipocytes were cold sensitive and exhibited mitochondrial dysfunction. ERAD deficiency affected ER-mitochondria contacts and mitochondrial dynamics, at least in part, by regulating the turnover of the MAM protein, sigma receptor 1 (SigmaR1). Thus, our study provides molecular insights into ER-mitochondrial cross-talk and expands our understanding of the physiological importance of Sel1L-Hrd1 ERAD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/368/6486/48?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the developing and postnatal brain have distinct positional identities that dictate the types of neurons they generate. Although morphogens initially establish NSC positional identity in the neural tube, it is unclear how such regional differences are maintained as the forebrain grows much larger and more anatomically complex. We found that the maintenance of NSC positional identity in the murine brain requires a &lt;i&gt;mixed-lineage leukemia 1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Mll1&lt;/i&gt;)–dependent epigenetic memory system. After establishment by sonic hedgehog, ventral NSC identity became independent of this morphogen. Even transient MLL1 inhibition caused a durable loss of ventral identity, resulting in the generation of neurons with the characteristics of dorsal NSCs in vivo. Thus, spatial information provided by morphogens can be transitioned to epigenetic mechanisms that maintain regionally distinct developmental programs in the forebrain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro: Targeted Krüppel-Like Factor 4 Gene Knock-Out in Retinal Ganglion Cells Improves Visual Function in Multiple Sclerosis Mouse Model</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/2/ENEURO.0320-19.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Axonal demyelination injury and neuronal degeneration are the primary causes of visual disability in multiple sclerosis (MS)-linked optic neuritis patients. Immunomodulatory therapies targeting inflammation have failed to avert the disease progression and no therapies exist to prevent the neuronal deficits seen in MS to date. Neuroprotective strategies targeting oligodendrocytes and astroglia have shown limited success due to a lack of axonal regeneration from injured neurons. In this study, we used the chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS to investigate the axonal regenerative approach to improve the neuronal function. Our approach focused on targeted knock-out (KO) of the developmentally regulated axon growth inhibitory Krüppel-like factor 4 (&lt;i&gt;Klf4&lt;/i&gt;) gene in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) of &lt;i&gt;Klf4&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/i&gt;mice by intravitreal delivery of AAV2-Cre-ires-EGFP recombinant virus (1) at the time of EAE sensitization and (2) after the onset of optic neuritis-mediated visual defects in the mice. &lt;i&gt;Klf4&lt;/i&gt; gene KO performed simultaneous with EAE sensitization prevented the visual loss as assessed by pattern electroretinograms (PERGs) in the mice and protected the RGCs from EAE-mediated death. More importantly, however, &lt;i&gt;Klf4&lt;/i&gt; gene KO after the onset of optic neuritis also resulted in RGC neuroprotection with additional restoration of their function, thereby improving the visual function outcomes in the EAE model. This study establishes the efficacy of &lt;i&gt;Klf4&lt;/i&gt; targeted knock-down in EAE even after the onset of disease symptoms, and thus should be further explored as a potential treatment strategy for MS/optic neuritis patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Neurosurgical Intervention for Supratentorial Intracerebral Hemorrhage</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25732?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect of surgical treatment for supratentorial spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage and whether it is modified by key baseline characteristics and timing remains uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed a systematic review and meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials of surgical treatment of supratentorial spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage aimed at clot removal. We searched MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane databases up to February 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;, 2019. Primary outcome was good functional outcome at follow‐up; secondary outcomes were death and serious adverse events. We analyzed all types of surgery combined and minimally invasive approaches separately. We pooled risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals and assessed the modifying effect of age, Glasgow Coma Scale, hematoma volume and timing of surgery with meta‐regression analysis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We included 21 studies with 4145 patients; four (19%) were of the highest quality. Risk ratio of good functional outcome after any type of surgery was 1.40 (95% confidence interval 1.22–1.60; I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 46%; 20 studies) and after minimally invasive surgery 1.47 (1.26–1.72; I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 47%; 12 studies). For death the risk ratio for any type of surgery was 0.77 (0.68–0.85; I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 23%; 21 studies), and for minimally invasive surgery 0.68 (0.56–0.83; I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 14%; 13 studies). Serious adverse events were reported infrequently. Surgery seemed more effective when performed sooner after symptom onset (p = 0.04; 12 studies). Age, Glasgow Coma Scale and hematoma volume did not modify the effect of surgery.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surgical treatment of supratentorial spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage may be beneficial, in particular with minimally invasive procedures and when performed sooner after symptom onset. Further well‐designed randomized trials are needed to demonstrate whether (minimally‐invasive) surgery improves functional outcome after ICH and to determine the optimal time‐window of the treatment after symptom onset.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Dysregulation of synaptic pruning as a possible link between intestinal microbiota dysbiosis and neuropsychiatric disorders</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24616?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prenatal and early postnatal stages represent a critical time window for human brain development. Interestingly, this window partly overlaps with the maturation of the intestinal flora (microbiota) that play a critical role in the bidirectional communication between the central and the enteric nervous systems (microbiota‐gut‐brain axis). The microbial composition has important influences on general health and the development of several organ systems, such as the gastrointestinal tract, the immune system, and also the brain. Clinical studies have shown that microbiota alterations are associated with a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. In this review, we dissect the link between these neuropsychiatric disorders and the intestinal microbiota by focusing on their effect on synaptic pruning, a vital process in the maturation and establishing efficient functioning of the brain. We discuss in detail how synaptic pruning is dysregulated differently in the aforementioned neuropsychiatric disorders and how it can be influenced by dysbiosis and/or changes in the intestinal microbiota composition. We also review that the improvement in the intestinal microbiota composition by a change in diet, probiotics, prebiotics, or fecal microbiota transplantation may play a role in improving neuropsychiatric functioning, which can be at least partly explained &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; the optimization of synaptic pruning and neuronal connections. Altogether, the demonstration of the microbiota's influence on brain function &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; microglial‐induced synaptic pruning addresses the possibility that the manipulation of microbiota‐immune crosstalk represents a promising strategy for treating neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Left prefrontal impact links subthalamic stimulation with depressive symptoms</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25734?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN‐DBS) in Parkinson's Disease (PD) not only stimulates focal target structures but also affects distributed brain networks. The impact this network modulation has on &lt;i&gt;non‐motor&lt;/i&gt; DBS effects is not well characterized. By focusing on the affective domain, we systematically investigate the impact of electrode placement and associated structural connectivity on changes in depressive symptoms following STN‐DBS which have been reported to improve, worsen or remain unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depressive symptoms before and after STN‐DBS surgery were documented in 116 PD patients from three DBS centers (Berlin, Queensland, Cologne). Based on individual electrode reconstructions, the volumes of tissue activated (VTA) were estimated and combined with normative connectome data to identify structural connections passing through VTAs. Berlin and Queensland cohorts formed a training and cross‐validation dataset used to identify structural connectivity explaining change in depressive symptoms. The Cologne data served as test‐set for which depressive symptom change was predicted.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structural connectivity was linked to depressive symptom change under STN‐DBS. An optimal connectivity map trained on the Berlin cohort could predict changes in depressive symptoms in Queensland patients and vice versa. Furthermore, the joint training‐set map predicted changes in depressive symptoms in the independent test‐set. Worsening of depressive symptoms was associated with left prefrontal connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fibers linking the STN electrode with left prefrontal areas predicted worsening of depressive symptoms. Our results suggest that for the left STN‐DBS lead, placement impacting fibers to left prefrontal areas should be avoided to maximize improvement of depressive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00293</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) affect the cerebellum and its afferent and efferent systems that degenerate during disease progression. In the cerebellum, Purkinje cells (PCs) are the most vulnerable and their prominent loss in the late phase of the pathology is the main characteristic of these neurodegenerative diseases. Despite the constant advancement in the discovery of affected molecules and cellular pathways, a comprehensive description of the events leading to the development of motor impairment and degeneration is still lacking. However, in the last years the possible causal role for altered cerebellar development and neuronal circuit wiring in SCAs has been emerging. Not only wiring and synaptic transmission deficits are a common trait of SCAs, but also preventing the expression of the mutant protein during cerebellar development seems to exert a protective role. By discussing this tight relationship between cerebellar development and SCAs, in this review, we aim to highlight the importance of cerebellar circuitry for the investigation of SCAs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Gene Expression Dynamics at the Neurovascular Unit During Early Regeneration After Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury in Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00280</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;With increasing distribution of endovascular stroke therapies, transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) in mice now more than ever depicts a relevant patient population with recanalized M1 occlusion. In this case, the desired therapeutic effect of blood flow restauration is accompanied by breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and secondary reperfusion injury. The aim of this study was to elucidate short and intermediate-term transcriptional patterns and the involved pathways covering the different cellular players at the neurovascular unit after transient large vessel occlusion. To achieve this, male C57Bl/6J mice were treated according to an intensive post-stroke care protocol after 60 min occlusion of the middle cerebral artery or sham surgery to allow a high survival rate. After 24 h or 7 days, RNA from microvessel fragments from the ipsilateral and the contralateral hemispheres was isolated and used for mRNA sequencing. Bioinformatic analyses allowed us to depict gene expression changes at two timepoints of neurovascular post-stroke injury and regeneration. We validated our dataset by quantitative real time PCR of BBB-associated targets with well-characterized post-stroke dynamics. Hence, this study provides a well-controlled transcriptome dataset of a translationally relevant mouse model 24 h and 7 days after stroke which might help to discover future therapeutic targets in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00264</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Stimulation of the pineal gland via its sympathetic innervation pathway results in the production of N-acetylserotonin and melatonin. Melatonin has many therapeutic roles and is heavily implicated in the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle. In addition, N-acetylserotonin has recently been reported to promote neurogenesis in the brain. Upregulation of these indoleamines is possible via neuromodulation of the pineal gland. This is achieved by electrical stimulation of structures or fibres in the pineal gland sympathetic innervation pathway. Many studies have performed such pineal neuromodulation using both invasive and non-invasive methods. However, the effects of various experimental variables and stimulation paradigms has not yet been reviewed and evaluated. This review summarises these studies and presents the optimal experimental protocols and stimulation parameters necessary for maximal upregulation of melatonin metabolic output.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Illuminating Relationships Between the Pre- and Post-synapse</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00009</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Excitatory synapses in the mammalian cortex are highly diverse, both in terms of their structure and function. However, relationships between synaptic features indicate they are highly coordinated entities. Imaging techniques, that enable physiology at the resolution of individual synapses to be investigated, have allowed the presynaptic activity level of the synapse to be related to postsynaptic function. This approach has revealed that neuronal activity induces the pre- and post-synapse to be functionally correlated and that subsets of synapses are more susceptible to certain forms of synaptic plasticity. As presynaptic function is often examined in isolation from postsynaptic properties, the effect it has on the post-synapse is not fully understood. However, since postsynaptic receptors at excitatory synapses respond to release of glutamate, it follows that they may be differentially regulated depending on the frequency of its release. Therefore, examining postsynaptic properties in the context of presynaptic function may be a useful way to approach a broad range of questions on synaptic physiology. In this review, we focus on how optophysiology tools have been utilized to study relationships between the pre- and the post-synapse. Multiple imaging techniques have revealed correlations in synaptic properties from the submicron to the dendritic level. Optical tools together with advanced imaging techniques are ideally suited to illuminate this area further, due to the spatial resolution and control they allow.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Astrocytes Are Required for Oligodendrocyte Survival and Maintenance of Myelin Compaction and Integrity</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00074</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes have been implicated in regulating oligodendrocyte development and myelination in vitro, although their functions in vivo remain less well defined. Using a novel approach to locally ablate GFAP+ astrocytes, we demonstrate that astrocytes are required for normal CNS myelin compaction during development, and for maintaining myelin integrity in the adult. Transient ablation of GFAP+ astrocytes in the mouse spinal cord during the first postnatal week reduced the numbers of mature oligodendrocytes and inhibited myelin formation, while prolonged ablation resulted in myelin that lacked compaction and structural integrity. Ablation of GFAP+ astrocytes in the adult spinal cord resulted in the rapid, local loss of myelin integrity and regional demyelination. The loss of myelin integrity induced by astrocyte ablation was greatly reduced by NMDA receptor antagonists, both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that myelin stability was affected by elevation of local glutamate levels following astrocyte ablation. Furthermore, targeted delivery of glutamate into adult spinal cord white matter resulted in reduction of myelin basic protein expression and localized disruption of myelin compaction which was also reduced by NMDA receptor blockade. The pathology induced by localized astrocyte loss and elevated exogenous glutamate, supports the concept that astrocytes are critical for maintenance of myelin integrity in the adult CNS and may be primary targets in the initiation of demyelinating diseases of the CNS, such as Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;To examine whether the influence of hypertension (HTN) status on longitudinal changes in brain glucose metabolism was modified by the apolipoprotein 4 (APOE4) status among older people with normal cognition.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;In this study, we included 217 older individuals with normal cognition from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. Participants were divided into the HTN and no HTN groups based on self-reported medical history. Brain glucose metabolism was assessed by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). Linear mixed model was fitted to examine the association between the HTN × APOE4 interaction and longitudinal changes in brain glucose metabolism after controlling for several covariates.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;In the present study, we found that the association between HTN status and longitudinal changes in brain glucose metabolism varied as a function of the APOE4 status, such that the HTN/APOE4+ group showed a steeper decline in FDG SUVR than all other groups (No HTN/APOE4-, HTN/APOE4-, and No HTN/APOE4+). Nevertheless, there was no significant difference in the rate of decline in FDG SUVR among other groups (No HTN/APOE4-, HTN/APOE4-, and No HTN/APOE4+).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The APOE4 genotype interacted with hypertension status to affect longitudinal changes in brain glucose metabolism among older individual with normal cognition, such that the HTN/APOE4+ group showed a steeper decline in FDG SUVR than other groups.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Identifying the immune interactions underlying HLA class I disease associations</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54558</link>
	<content:encoded>Variation in the risk and severity of many autoimmune diseases, malignancies and infections is strongly associated with polymorphisms in the HLA class I loci. These genetic associations provide a powerful opportunity for understanding the etiology of human disease. HLA class I associations are often interpreted in the light of 'protective' or 'detrimental' CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell responses which are restricted by the host HLA class I allotype. However, given the diverse receptors which are bound by HLA class I molecules, alternative interpretations are possible. As well as binding T cell receptors on CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, HLA class I molecules are important ligands for inhibitory and activating killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) which are found on natural killer cells and some T cells; for the CD94:NKG2 family of receptors also expressed mainly by NK cells and for leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors (LILRs) on myeloid cells. The aim of this study is to develop an immunogenetic approach for identifying and quantifying the relative contribution of different receptor-ligand interactions to a given HLA class I disease association and then to use this approach to investigate the immune interactions underlying HLA class I disease associations in three viral infections: Human T cell Leukemia Virus type 1, Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 and Hepatitis C Virus as well as in the inflammatory condition Crohn's disease.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: A systematic pipeline for classifying bacterial operons reveals the evolutionary landscape of biofilm machineries</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/V0mOj-urAFQ/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Cedoljub Bundalovic-Torma, Gregory B. Whitfield, Lindsey S. Marmont, P. Lynne Howell, John Parkinson&lt;/p&gt;

In bacteria functionally related genes comprising metabolic pathways and protein complexes are frequently encoded in operons and are widely conserved across phylogenetically diverse species. The evolution of these operon-encoded processes is affected by diverse mechanisms such as gene duplication, loss, rearrangement, and horizontal transfer. These mechanisms can result in functional diversification, increasing the potential evolution of novel biological pathways, and enabling pre-existing pathways to adapt to the requirements of particular environments. Despite the fundamental importance that these mechanisms play in bacterial environmental adaptation, a systematic approach for studying the evolution of operon organization is lacking. Herein, we present a novel method to study the evolution of operons based on phylogenetic clustering of operon-encoded protein families and genomic-proximity network visualizations of operon architectures. We applied this approach to study the evolution of the synthase dependent exopolysaccharide (EPS) biosynthetic systems: cellulose, acetylated cellulose, poly-β-1,6-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (PNAG), Pel, and alginate. These polymers have important roles in biofilm formation, antibiotic tolerance, and as virulence factors in opportunistic pathogens. Our approach revealed the complex evolutionary landscape of EPS machineries, and enabled operons to be classified into evolutionarily distinct lineages. Cellulose operons show phyla-specific operon lineages resulting from gene loss, rearrangement, and the acquisition of accessory loci, and the occurrence of whole-operon duplications arising through horizonal gene transfer. Our evolution-based classification also distinguishes between PNAG production from Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria on the basis of structural and functional evolution of the acetylation modification domains shared by PgaB and IcaB loci, respectively. We also predict several &lt;i&gt;pel&lt;/i&gt;-like operon lineages in Gram-positive bacteria and demonstrate in our companion paper (Whitfield &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt; PLoS Pathogens, in press) that &lt;i&gt;Bacillus cereus&lt;/i&gt; produces a Pel-dependent biofilm that is regulated by cyclic-3’,5’-dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/V0mOj-urAFQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Despite over a century of intensive efforts, the great gains promised by the War on Cancer nearly 50 years ago have not materialized. Since 1999, we have analyzed the lack of progress in explaining and “curing” cancer by examining the merits of the premises that determine how cancer is understood and treated. Our ongoing critical analyses have aimed at clarifying the sources of misunderstandings at the root of the cancer puzzle while providing a plausible and comprehensive biomedical perspective as well as a new theory of carcinogenesis that is compatible with evolutionary theory. In this essay, we explain how this new theory, the tissue organization field theory (TOFT), can help chart a path to progress for cancer researchers by explaining features of cancer that remain unexplainable from the perspective of the still hegemonic somatic mutation theory (SMT) and its variants. Of equal significance, the premises underlying the TOFT offer new perspectives on basic biological phenomena.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/d3ENxC6IJQE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Extra‐axial inflammatory signal in parameninges in migraine with visual aura</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25731?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cortical spreading depression (CSD) underlies the neurobiology of migraine with aura (MWA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animal studies reveal networks of microvessels linking brain‐meninges‐bone marrow. CSD activates the trigeminovascular system, evoking a meningeal inflammatory response. Accordingly, this study examines the upregulation of an inflammatory marker in extra‐axial tissues in migraine with visual aura.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used simultaneously acquired &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C‐PBR28 PET/MRI data of 18 kDa translocator protein (an inflammatory marker) in MWA patients (n = 11) who experienced headaches and visual aura in the preceding month. We measured mean tracer uptake (SUVR) in four regions of interest comprising the meninges plus the adjacent overlying skull bone (parameningeal tissues, PMT). These data were compared to healthy controls and patients with pain (chronic low‐back pain, CLBP).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MWA had significantly higher mean SUVR in PMT overlying occipital cortex than both other groups, though not in the PMT overlying three other cortical areas. A positive correlation was also found between the number of visual auras and tracer uptake in occipital PMT.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strong persistent extra‐axial inflammatory signal was found in meninges and calvarial bone overlying the occipital lobe in migraine with visual auras. Our findings are reminiscent of CSD‐induced meningeal inflammation and provide the first imaging evidence implicating inflammation in the pathophysiology of migraine meningeal symptoms. We suspect that this inflammatory focus results from a signal that migrates from underlying brain and if so, may implicate newly discovered bridging vessels that crosstalk between brain and skull marrow, a finding of potential relevance to migraine plus other neuroinflammatory brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science Advances: Molecular targeting of FATP4 transporter for oral delivery of therapeutic peptide</title>
	<link>http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/6/14/eaba0145?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Low oral bioavailability of peptide drugs has limited their application to parenteral administration, which suffers from poor patient compliance. Here, we show that molecular targeting of the FATP4 transporter is an effective approach to specifically transport long-chain fatty acid (LCFA)–conjugated peptides across the enterocytic membrane and, thus, enables oral delivery of drug peptides. We packaged LCFA-conjugated exendin-4 (LCFA-Ex4) into liposomes and coated with chitosan nanoparticles to form an orally deliverable Ex4 (OraEx4). OraEx4 protected LCFA-Ex4 from damage by the gastric fluid and released LCFA-Ex4 in the intestinal cavity, where LCFA-Ex4 was transported across the enterocyte membrane by the FAPT4 transporter. OraEx4 had a high bioavailability of 24.8% with respect to subcutaneous injection and exhibited a substantial hypoglycemic effect in murine models of diabetes mellitus. Thus, molecular targeting of the FATP4 transporter enhances oral absorption of therapeutic peptides and provides a platform for oral peptide drug development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Science Advances: Pretargeted delivery of PI3K/mTOR small-molecule inhibitor-loaded nanoparticles for treatment of non-Hodgkins lymphoma</title>
	<link>http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/6/14/eaaz9798?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Overactivation of the PI3K/mTOR signaling has been identified in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. BEZ235 is an effective dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, but it was withdrawn from early-phase clinical trials owing to poor solubility and on-target/off-tumor toxicity. Here, we developed a nanoparticle (NP)–based pretargeted system for the therapeutic delivery of BEZ235 to CD20- and HLA-DR–expressing lymphoma cells for targeted therapy. The pretargeted system is composed of dibenzocyclooctyne-functionalized anti-CD20 and anti-Lym1 antibodies as the tumor-targeting components and azide-functionalized BEZ235-encapsulated NPs as the effector drug carrier. Using lymphoma cell lines with different CD20 and HLA-DR antigen densities as examples, we demonstrate that the dual antibody pretargeted strategy effectively raises the number of NPs retained on the target tumor cells and improves the in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity of BEZ235 through the inhibition of the PI3K/mTOR pathway. Our data demonstrate that the NP-based pretargeted system improves the therapeutic window of small-molecule kinase inhibitor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/6/14/eaaz7825?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are no methods available offering solutions to select and identify antibodies binding to a specific conformational epitope of an antigen. Here, we developed a method to allow epitope-directed antibody selection from a phage display library by photocrosslinking bound antibodies to a site that specifically incorporates a noncanonical amino acid, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (pBpa), on the target antigen epitope. By one or two rounds of panning against antibody phage display libraries, those hits that covalently bind to the proximity site of pBpa on specific epitopes of target antigens after ultraviolet irradiation are enriched and selected. This method was applied to specific epitopes on human interleukin-1β and complement 5a. In both cases, more than one-third of hits identified bind to the target epitopes, demonstrating the feasibility and versatility of this method.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Science Advances: Measles virus nucleo- and phosphoproteins form liquid-like phase-separated compartments that promote nucleocapsid assembly</title>
	<link>http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/6/14/eaaz7095?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many viruses are known to form cellular compartments, also called viral factories. Paramyxoviruses, including measles virus, colocalize their proteomic and genomic material in puncta in infected cells. We demonstrate that purified nucleoproteins (N) and phosphoproteins (P) of measles virus form liquid-like membraneless organelles upon mixing in vitro. We identify weak interactions involving intrinsically disordered domains of N and P that are implicated in this process, one of which is essential for phase separation. Fluorescence allows us to follow the modulation of the dynamics of N and P upon droplet formation, while NMR is used to investigate the thermodynamics of this process. RNA colocalizes to droplets, where it triggers assembly of N protomers into nucleocapsid-like particles that encapsidate the RNA. The rate of encapsidation within droplets is enhanced compared to the dilute phase, revealing one of the roles of liquid-liquid phase separation in measles virus replication.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Science Advances: Australopithecus afarensis endocasts suggest ape-like brain organization and prolonged brain growth</title>
	<link>http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/6/14/eaaz4729?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human brains are three times larger, are organized differently, and mature for a longer period of time than those of our closest living relatives, the chimpanzees. Together, these characteristics are important for human cognition and social behavior, but their evolutionary origins remain unclear. To study brain growth and organization in the hominin species &lt;i&gt;Australopithecus afarensis&lt;/i&gt; more than 3 million years ago, we scanned eight fossil crania using conventional and synchrotron computed tomography. We inferred key features of brain organization from endocranial imprints and explored the pattern of brain growth by combining new endocranial volume estimates with narrow age at death estimates for two infants. Contrary to previous claims, sulcal imprints reveal an ape-like brain organization and no features derived toward humans. A comparison of infant to adult endocranial volumes indicates protracted brain growth in &lt;i&gt;A. afarensis&lt;/i&gt;, likely critical for the evolution of a long period of childhood learning in hominins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Science Advances: MAP6 is an intraluminal protein that induces neuronal microtubules to coil</title>
	<link>http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/6/14/eaaz4344?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal activities depend heavily on microtubules, which shape neuronal processes and transport myriad molecules within them. Although constantly remodeled through growth and shrinkage events, neuronal microtubules must be sufficiently stable to maintain nervous system wiring. This stability is somehow maintained by various microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), but little is known about how these proteins work. Here, we show that MAP6, previously known to confer cold stability to microtubules, promotes growth. More unexpectedly, MAP6 localizes in the lumen of microtubules, induces the microtubules to coil into a left-handed helix, and forms apertures in the lattice, likely to relieve mechanical stress. These features have not been seen in microtubules before and could play roles in maintaining axonal width or providing flexibility in the face of compressive forces during development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/6/14/eaaz1039?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transplantation of patient-derived Schwann cells is a promising regenerative medicine therapy for spinal cord injuries; however, therapeutic efficacy is compromised by inefficient cell delivery. We present a materials-based strategy that addresses three common causes of transplanted cell death: (i) membrane damage during injection, (ii) cell leakage from the injection site, and (iii) apoptosis due to loss of endogenous matrix. Using protein engineering and peptide-based assembly, we designed injectable hydrogels with modular cell-adhesive and mechanical properties. In a cervical contusion model, our hydrogel matrix resulted in a greater than 700% improvement in successful Schwann cell transplantation. The combination therapy of cells and gel significantly improved the spatial distribution of transplanted cells within the endogenous tissue. A reduction in cystic cavitation and neuronal loss were also observed with substantial increases in forelimb strength and coordination. Using an injectable hydrogel matrix, therefore, can markedly improve the outcomes of cellular transplantation therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Science Advances: A multifunctional surfactant catalyst inspired by hydrolases</title>
	<link>http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/6/14/eaaz0404?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The remarkable power of enzymes to undertake catalysis frequently stems from their grouping of multiple, complementary chemical units within close proximity around the enzyme active site. Motivated by this, we report here a bioinspired surfactant catalyst that incorporates a variety of chemical functionalities common to hydrolytic enzymes. The textbook hydrolase active site, the catalytic triad, is modeled by positioning the three groups of the triad (-OH, -imidazole, and -CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H) on a single, trifunctional surfactant molecule. To support this, we recreate the hydrogen bond donating arrangement of the oxyanion hole by imparting surfactant functionality to a guanidinium headgroup. Self-assembly of these amphiphiles in solution drives the collection of functional headgroups into close proximity around a hydrophobic nano-environment, affording hydrolysis of a model ester at rates that challenge α-chymotrypsin. Structural assessment via NMR and XRD, paired with MD simulation and QM calculation, reveals marked similarities of the co-micelle catalyst to native enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a highly dynamic network of membranes. Here, we combine live-cell microscopy with in situ cryo–electron tomography to directly visualize ER dynamics in several secretory cell types including pancreatic β-cells and neurons under near-native conditions. Using these imaging approaches, we identify a novel, mobile form of ER, ribosome-associated vesicles (RAVs), found primarily in the cell periphery, which is conserved across different cell types and species. We show that RAVs exist as distinct, highly dynamic structures separate from the intact ER reticular architecture that interact with mitochondria via direct intermembrane contacts. These findings describe a new ER subcompartment within cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Science Advances: Biomechanical simulations reveal a trade-off between adaptation to glacial climate and dietary niche versatility in European cave bears</title>
	<link>http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/6/14/eaay9462?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The cave bear is one of the best known extinct large mammals that inhabited Europe during the &quot;Ice Age,&quot; becoming extinct 24,000 years ago along with other members of the Pleistocene megafauna. Long-standing hypotheses speculate that many cave bears died during their long hibernation periods, which were necessary to overcome the severe and prolonged winters of the Last Glacial. Here, we investigate how long hibernation periods in cave bears would have directly affected their feeding biomechanics using CT-based biomechanical simulations of skulls of cave and extant bears. Our results demonstrate that although large paranasal sinuses were necessary for, and consistent with, long hibernation periods, trade-offs in sinus-associated cranial biomechanical traits restricted cave bears to feed exclusively on low energetic vegetal resources during the predormancy period. This biomechanical trade-off constitutes a new key factor to mechanistically explain the demise of this dominant Pleistocene megafaunal species as a direct consequence of climate cooling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro: Paired Associative Stimulation Fails to Induce Plasticity in Freely Behaving Intact Rats</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/2/ENEURO.0396-19.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Paired associative stimulation (PAS) has been explored in humans as a noninvasive tool to drive plasticity and promote recovery after neurologic insult. A more thorough understanding of PAS-induced plasticity is needed to fully harness it as a clinical tool. Here, we tested the efficacy of PAS with multiple interstimulus intervals in an awake rat model to study the principles of associative plasticity. Using chronically implanted electrodes in motor cortex and forelimb, we explored PAS parameters to effectively drive plasticity. We assessed changes in corticomotor excitability using a closed-loop, EMG-controlled cortical stimulation paradigm. We tested 11 PAS intervals, chosen to force the coincidence of neuronal activity in the motor cortex and spinal cord of rats with timings relevant to the principles of Hebbian spike timing-dependent plasticity. However, despite a relatively large number of stimulus pairings (300), none of the tested intervals reliably changed corticospinal excitability relative to control conditions. Our results question PAS effectiveness under these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience: Microglial Depletion with CSF1R Inhibitor During Chronic Phase of Experimental Traumatic Brain Injury Reduces Neurodegeneration and Neurological Deficits</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/14/2960?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chronic neuroinflammation with sustained microglial activation occurs following severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and is believed to contribute to subsequent neurodegeneration and neurological deficits. Microglia, the primary innate immune cells in brain, are dependent on colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) signaling for their survival. In this preclinical study, we examined the effects of delayed depletion of chronically activated microglia on functional recovery and neurodegeneration up to 3 months postinjury. A CSF1R inhibitor, Plexxikon (PLX) 5622, was administered to adult male C57BL/6J mice at 1 month after controlled cortical impact to remove chronically activated microglia, and the inhibitor was withdrawn 1-week later to allow for microglial repopulation. Following TBI, the repopulated microglia displayed a ramified morphology similar to that of Sham uninjured mice, whereas microglia in vehicle-treated TBI mice showed the typical chronic posttraumatic hypertrophic morphology. PLX5622 treatment limited TBI-associated neuropathological changes at 3 months postinjury; these included a smaller cortical lesion, reduced hippocampal neuron cell death, and decreased NOX2- and NLRP3 inflammasome-associated neuroinflammation. Furthermore, delayed depletion of chronically activated microglia after TBI led to widespread changes in the cortical transcriptome and altered gene pathways involved in neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neuroplasticity. Using a variety of complementary neurobehavioral tests, PLX5622-treated TBI mice also had improved long-term motor and cognitive function recovery through 3 months postinjury. Together, these studies demonstrate that chronic phase removal of neurotoxic microglia after TBI using CSF1R inhibitors markedly reduce chronic neuroinflammation and associated neurodegeneration, as well as related motor and cognitive deficits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a debilitating neurological disorder that can seriously impact the patient's quality of life. Microglial-mediated neuroinflammation is induced after severe TBI and contributes to neurological deficits and on-going neurodegenerative processes. Here, we investigated the effect of breaking the neurotoxic neuroinflammatory loop at 1-month after controlled cortical impact in mice by pharmacological removal of chronically activated microglia using a colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor, Plexxikon 5622. Overall, we show that short-term elimination of microglia during the chronic phase of TBI followed by repopulation results in long-term improvements in neurological function, suppression of neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress pathways, and a reduction in persistent neurodegenerative processes. These studies are clinically relevant and support new concepts that the therapeutic window for TBI may be far longer than traditionally believed if chronic and evolving microglial-mediated neuroinflammation can be inhibited or regulated in a precise manner.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience: Loss of Piccolo Function in Rats Induces Cerebellar Network Dysfunction and Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia Type 3-like Phenotypes</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/14/2943?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Piccolo, a presynaptic active zone protein, is best known for its role in the regulated assembly and function of vertebrate synapses. Genetic studies suggest a further link to several psychiatric disorders as well as Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia type 3 (PCH3). We have characterized recently generated Piccolo KO (&lt;i&gt;Pclo&lt;sup&gt;gt/gt&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) rats. Analysis of rats of both sexes revealed a dramatic reduction in brain size compared with WT (&lt;i&gt;Pclo&lt;sup&gt;wt/wt&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) animals, attributed to a decrease in the size of the cerebral cortical, cerebellar, and pontine regions. Analysis of the cerebellum and brainstem revealed a reduced granule cell layer and a reduction in size of pontine nuclei. Moreover, the maturation of mossy fiber afferents from pontine neurons and the expression of the α6 GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor subunit at the mossy fiber-granule cell synapse are perturbed, as well as the innervation of Purkinje cells by cerebellar climbing fibers. Ultrastructural and functional studies revealed a reduced size of mossy fiber boutons, with fewer synaptic vesicles and altered synaptic transmission. These data imply that Piccolo is required for the normal development, maturation, and function of neuronal networks formed between the brainstem and cerebellum. Consistently, behavioral studies demonstrated that adult &lt;i&gt;Pclo&lt;sup&gt;gt/gt&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; rats display impaired motor coordination, despite adequate performance in tasks that reflect muscle strength and locomotion. Together, these data suggest that loss of Piccolo function in patients with PCH3 could be involved in many of the observed anatomical and behavioral symptoms, and that the further analysis of these animals could provide fundamental mechanistic insights into this devastating disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia Type 3 is a devastating developmental disorder associated with severe developmental delay, progressive microcephaly with brachycephaly, optic atrophy, seizures, and hypertonia with hyperreflexia. Recent genetic studies have identified non-sense mutations in the coding region of the PCLO gene, suggesting a functional link between this disorder and the presynaptic active zone. Our analysis of Piccolo KO rats supports this hypothesis, formally demonstrating that anatomical and behavioral phenotypes seen in patients with Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia Type 3 are also exhibited by these Piccolo deficient animals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience: Dopamine Receptor Dop1R2 Stabilizes Appetitive Olfactory Memory through the Raf/MAPK Pathway in Drosophila</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/14/2935?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, dopamine signaling to the mushroom body intrinsic neurons, Kenyon cells (KCs), is critical to stabilize olfactory memory. Little is known about the downstream intracellular molecular signaling underlying memory stabilization. Here we address this question in the context of sugar-rewarded olfactory long-term memory (LTM). We show that associative training increases the phosphorylation of MAPK in KCs, via Dop1R2 signaling. Consistently, the attenuation of &lt;i&gt;Dop1R2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Raf&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;MAPK&lt;/i&gt; expression in KCs selectively impairs LTM, but not short-term memory. Moreover, we show that the LTM deficit caused by the knockdown of &lt;i&gt;Dop1R2&lt;/i&gt; can be rescued by expressing active Raf in KCs. Thus, the Dop1R2/Raf/MAPK pathway is a pivotal downstream effector of dopamine signaling for stabilizing appetitive olfactory memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Dopaminergic input to the Kenyon cells (KCs) is pivotal to stabilize memory in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. This process is mediated by dopamine receptors like Dop1R2. Nevertheless, little is known for its underlying molecular mechanism. Here we show that the Raf/MAPK pathway is specifically engaged in appetitive long-term memory in KCs. With combined biochemical and behavioral experiments, we reveal that activation of the Raf/MAPK pathway is regulated through Dop1R2, shedding light on how dopamine modulates intracellular signaling for memory stabilization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience: Human Lateral Frontal Pole Contributes to Control over Emotional Approach-Avoidance Actions</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/14/2925?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Regulation of emotional behavior is essential for human social interactions. Recent work has exposed its cognitive complexity, as well as its unexpected reliance on portions of the anterior PFC (aPFC) also involved in exploration, relational reasoning, and counterfactual choice, rather than on dorsolateral and medial prefrontal areas involved in several forms of cognitive control. This study anatomically qualifies the contribution of aPFC territories to the regulation of prepotent approach–avoidance action tendencies elicited by emotional faces, and explores a possible structural pathway through which this emotional action regulation might be implemented. We provide converging evidence from task-based fMRI, diffusion-weighted imaging, and functional connectivity fingerprints for a novel neural element in emotional regulation. Task-based fMRI in human male participants (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 40) performing an emotional approach–avoidance task identified aPFC territories involved in the regulation of action tendencies elicited by emotional faces. Connectivity fingerprints, based on diffusion-weighted imaging and resting-state connectivity, localized those task-defined frontal regions to the lateral frontal pole (FPl), an anatomically defined portion of the aPFC that lacks a homologous counterpart in macaque brains. Probabilistic tractography indicated that 10%–20% of interindividual variation in emotional regulation abilities is accounted for by the strength of structural connectivity between FPl and amygdala. Evidence from an independent replication sample (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 50; 10 females) further substantiated this result. These findings provide novel neuroanatomical evidence for incorporating FPl in models of control over human action tendencies elicited by emotional faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Successful regulation of emotional behaviors is a prerequisite for successful participation in human society, as is evidenced by the social isolation and loss of occupational opportunities often encountered by people suffering from emotion regulation disorders, such as social-anxiety disorder and psychopathy. Knowledge about the precise cortical regions and connections supporting this control is crucial for understanding both the nature of computations needed to successfully traverse the space of possible actions in social situations, and the potential interventions that might result in efficient treatment of social-emotional disorders. This study provides evidence for a precise cortical region (lateral frontal pole) and a structural pathway (the ventral amygdalofugal bundle) through which a cognitively complex form of emotional action regulation might be implemented in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience: Sensory Modality-Independent Activation of the Brain Network for Language</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/14/2914?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The meaning of a sentence can be understood, whether presented in written or spoken form. Therefore, it is highly probable that brain processes supporting language comprehension are at least partly independent of sensory modality. To identify where and when in the brain language processing is independent of sensory modality, we directly compared neuromagnetic brain signals of 200 human subjects (102 males) either reading or listening to sentences. We used multiset canonical correlation analysis to align individual subject data in a way that boosts those aspects of the signal that are common to all, allowing us to capture word-by-word signal variations, consistent across subjects and at a fine temporal scale. Quantifying this consistency in activation across both reading and listening tasks revealed a mostly left-hemispheric cortical network. Areas showing consistent activity patterns included not only areas previously implicated in higher-level language processing, such as left prefrontal, superior and middle temporal areas, and anterior temporal lobe, but also parts of the control network as well as subcentral and more posterior temporal-parietal areas. Activity in this supramodal sentence-processing network starts in temporal areas and rapidly spreads to the other regions involved. The findings indicate not only the involvement of a large network of brain areas in supramodal language processing but also that the linguistic information contained in the unfolding sentences modulates brain activity in a word-specific manner across subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The brain can extract meaning from written and spoken messages alike. This requires activity of both brain circuits capable of processing sensory modality-specific aspects of the input signals as well as coordinated brain activity to extract modality-independent meaning from the input. Using traditional methods, it is difficult to disentangle modality-specific activation from modality-independent activation. In this work, we developed and applied a multivariate methodology that allows for a direct quantification of sensory modality-independent brain activity, revealing fast activation of a wide network of brain areas, both including and extending beyond the core network for language.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience: Differential Effects of Awareness and Task Relevance on Early and Late ERPs in a No-Report Visual Oddball Paradigm</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/14/2906?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To date it is poorly understood how and when deviance processing interacts with awareness and task relevance. Furthermore, an important issue in the study of consciousness is the prevalent confound of conscious perception with the requirement of reporting it. This study addresses these topics using a no-report inattentional blindness paradigm with a visual oddball sequence of geometrical shapes presented to male and female human participants. Electrophysiological responses were obtained in three physically identical Phases A–C that differed only with respect to the instructions: (A) participants were uninformed about the shapes and attended an unrelated foreground task (inattentional blind), (B) were informed about the shapes but still attended the foreground task, and (C) attended the shapes. Conscious processing of shapes was indexed by the visual awareness negativity but not a P3. Deviance processing was associated with the visual mismatch negativity independently of consciousness and task relevance. The oddball P3, however, only emerged when the stimuli were task relevant, and was absent for consciously perceived but task irrelevant stimuli. The P3 thus does not represent a reliable marker of stimulus awareness. This result pattern supports the view of hierarchical predictive processing, where lower levels display automatic deviance processing, whereas higher levels require attention and task relevance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; To react to potentially important changes in our environment it is fundamental to detect deviations from regularities of sensory input. It has yet to be understood how awareness and task relevance of this input interact with deviance processing. We investigated the role of awareness in deviance detection while at the same time circumventing the confound of awareness and report by means of a no-report paradigm. Our results suggest that early processes are elicited automatically, whereas, contrary to prominent theories, late processes do not depend on awareness but on task-based attention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience: Sleep Differentially Affects Early and Late Neuronal Responses to Sounds in Auditory and Perirhinal Cortices</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/14/2895?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A fundamental feature of sleep is reduced behavioral responsiveness to external events, but the extent of processing along sensory pathways remains poorly understood. While responses are comparable across wakefulness and sleep in auditory cortex (AC), neuronal activity in downstream regions remains unknown. Here we recorded spiking activity in 435 neuronal clusters evoked by acoustic stimuli in the perirhinal cortex (PRC) and in AC of freely behaving male rats across wakefulness and sleep. Neuronal responses in AC showed modest (~10%) differences in response gain across vigilance states, replicating previous studies. By contrast, PRC neuronal responses were robustly attenuated by 47% and 36% during NREM sleep and REM sleep, respectively. Beyond the separation according to cortical region, response latency in each neuronal cluster was correlated with the degree of NREM sleep attenuation, such that late (&amp;gt;40 ms) responses in all monitored regions diminished during NREM sleep. The robust attenuation of late responses prevalent in PRC represents a novel neural correlate of sensory disconnection during sleep, opening new avenues for investigating the mediating mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Reduced behavioral responsiveness to sensory stimulation is at the core of sleep's definition, but it is still unclear how the sleeping brain responds differently to sensory stimuli. In the current study, we recorded neuronal spiking responses to sounds along the cortical processing hierarchy of rats during wakefulness and natural sleep. Responses in auditory cortex only showed modest changes during sleep, whereas sleep robustly attenuated the responses of neurons in high-level perirhinal cortex. We also found that, during NREM sleep, the response latency predicts the degree of sleep attenuation in individual neurons above and beyond their anatomical location. These results provide anatomical and temporal signatures of sensory disconnection during sleep and pave the way to understanding the underlying mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience: Acetylcholine Modulates Cerebellar Granule Cell Spiking by Regulating the Balance of Synaptic Excitation and Inhibition</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/14/2882?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sensorimotor integration in the cerebellum is essential for refining motor output, and the first stage of this processing occurs in the granule cell layer. Recent evidence suggests that granule cell layer synaptic integration can be contextually modified, although the circuit mechanisms that could mediate such modulation remain largely unknown. Here we investigate the role of ACh in regulating granule cell layer synaptic integration in male rats and mice of both sexes. We find that Golgi cells, interneurons that provide the sole source of inhibition to the granule cell layer, express both nicotinic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors. While acute ACh application can modestly depolarize some Golgi cells, the net effect of longer, optogenetically induced ACh release is to strongly hyperpolarize Golgi cells. Golgi cell hyperpolarization by ACh leads to a significant reduction in both tonic and evoked granule cell synaptic inhibition. ACh also reduces glutamate release from mossy fibers by acting on presynaptic muscarinic receptors. Surprisingly, despite these consistent effects on Golgi cells and mossy fibers, ACh can either increase or decrease the spike probability of granule cells as measured by noninvasive cell-attached recordings. By constructing an integrate-and-fire model of granule cell layer population activity, we find that the direction of spike rate modulation can be accounted for predominately by the initial balance of excitation and inhibition onto individual granule cells. Together, these experiments demonstrate that ACh can modulate population-level granule cell responses by altering the ratios of excitation and inhibition at the first stage of cerebellar processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The cerebellum plays a key role in motor control and motor learning. While it is known that behavioral context can modify motor learning, the circuit basis of such modulation has remained unclear. Here we find that a key neuromodulator, ACh, can alter the balance of excitation and inhibition at the first stage of cerebellar processing. These results suggest that ACh could play a key role in altering cerebellar learning by modifying how sensorimotor input is represented at the input layer of the cerebellum.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience: Abundance Compensates Kinetics: Similar Effect of Dopamine Signals on D1 and D2 Receptor Populations</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/14/2868?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The neuromodulator dopamine plays a key role in motivation, reward-related learning, and normal motor function. The different affinity of striatal D1 and D2 dopamine receptor types has been argued to constrain the D1 and D2 signaling pathways to phasic and tonic dopamine signals, respectively. However, this view assumes that dopamine receptor kinetics are instantaneous so that the time courses of changes in dopamine concentration and changes in receptor occupation are basically identical. Here we developed a neurochemical model of dopamine receptor binding taking into account the different kinetics and abundance of D1 and D2 receptors in the striatum. Testing a large range of behaviorally-relevant dopamine signals, we found that the D1 and D2 dopamine receptor populations responded very similarly to tonic and phasic dopamine signals. Furthermore, because of slow unbinding rates, both receptor populations integrated dopamine signals over a timescale of minutes. Our model provides a description of how physiological dopamine signals translate into changes in dopamine receptor occupation in the striatum, and explains why dopamine ramps are an effective signal to occupy dopamine receptors. Overall, our model points to the importance of taking into account receptor kinetics for functional considerations of dopamine signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Current models of basal ganglia function are often based on a distinction of two types of dopamine receptors, D1 and D2, with low and high affinity, respectively. Thereby, phasic dopamine signals are believed to mostly affect striatal neurons with D1 receptors, and tonic dopamine signals are believed to mostly affect striatal neurons with D2 receptors. This view does not take into account the rates for the binding and unbinding of dopamine to D1 and D2 receptors. By incorporating these kinetics into a computational model we show that D1 and D2 receptors both respond to phasic and tonic dopamine signals. This has implications for the processing of reward-related and motivational signals in the basal ganglia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience: Parkinsonian Beta Dynamics during Rest and Movement in the Dorsal Pallidum and Subthalamic Nucleus</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/14/2859?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In Parkinson's disease (PD), pathologically high levels of beta activity (12–30 Hz) reflect specific symptomatology and normalize with pharmacological or surgical intervention. Although beta characterization in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) of PD patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) has now been translated into adaptive DBS paradigms, a limited number of studies have characterized beta power in the globus pallidus internus (GPi), an equally effective DBS target. Our objective was to compare beta power in the STN and GPi during rest and movement in people with PD undergoing DBS. Thirty-seven human female and male participants completed a simple behavioral experiment consisting of periods of rest and button presses, leading to local field potential recordings from 19 (15 participants) STN and 26 (22 participants) GPi nuclei. We examined overall beta power as well as beta time-domain dynamics (i.e., beta bursts). We found higher beta power during rest and movement in the GPi, which also had more beta desynchronization during movement. Beta power was positively associated with bradykinesia and rigidity severity; however, these clinical associations were present only in the GPi cohort. With regards to beta dynamics, bursts were similar in duration and frequency in the GPi and STN, but GPi bursts were stronger and correlated to bradykinesia-rigidity severity. Beta dynamics therefore differ across basal ganglia nuclei. Relative to the STN, beta power in the GPi may be readily detected, modulates more with movement, and relates more to clinical impairment. Together, this could point to the GPi as a potentially effective target for beta-based adaptive DBS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It is known that subthalamic nucleus (STN) beta activity is linked to symptom severity in Parkinson's disease (PD), but few studies have characterized beta activity in the globus pallidus internus (GPi), another effective target for deep brain stimulation (DBS). We compared beta power in the STN and GPi during rest and movement in 37 people with PD undergoing DBS. We found that beta dynamics differed across basal ganglia nuclei. Our results show that, relative to the STN, beta power in the GPi may be readily detected, modulates more with movement, and relates more to clinical impairment. Together, this could point to the GPi as a potentially effective target for beta-based adaptive DBS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience: Cortico-Thalamo-Cortical Circuits of Mouse Forelimb S1 Are Organized Primarily as Recurrent Loops</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/14/2849?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cortical projections to the thalamus arise from corticothalamic (CT) neurons in layer 6 and pyramidal tract-type (PT) neurons in layer 5B. We dissected the excitatory synaptic connections in the somatosensory thalamus formed by CT and PT neurons of the primary somatosensory (S1) cortex, focusing on mouse forelimb S1. Mice of both sexes were studied. The CT neurons in S1 synaptically excited S1-projecting thalamocortical (TC) neurons in subregions of both the ventral posterior lateral and posterior (PO) nuclei, forming a pair of recurrent cortico-thalamo-cortical (C-T-C) loops. The PT neurons in S1 also formed a recurrent loop with S1-projecting TC neurons in the same subregion of the PO. The PT neurons in the adjacent primary motor (M1) cortex formed a separate recurrent loop with M1-projecting TC neurons in a nearby subregion of the PO. Collectively, our results reveal that C-T-C circuits of mouse forelimb S1 are primarily organized as multiple cortical cell-type-specific and thalamic subnucleus-specific recurrent loops, with both CT and PT neurons providing the strongest excitatory input to TC neurons that project back to S1. The findings, together with those of related studies of C-T-C circuits, thus suggest that recurrently projecting thalamocortical neurons are the principal targets of cortical excitatory input to the mouse somatosensory and motor thalamus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Bidirectional cortical communication with the thalamus is considered an important aspect of sensorimotor integration for active touch in the somatosensory system, but the cellular organization of the circuits mediating this process is not well understood. We used an approach combining cell-type-specific anterograde optogenetic excitation with single-cell recordings targeted to retrogradely labeled thalamocortical neurons to dissect these circuits. The findings reveal a consistent pattern: cortical projections to the somatosensory thalamus target thalamocortical neurons that project back to the same cortical area. Commonalities of these findings to previous descriptions of related circuits in other areas suggest that cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits may generally be organized primarily as recurrent loops.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience: Activity Dependent and Independent Determinants of Synaptic Size Diversity</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/14/2828?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The extraordinary diversity of excitatory synapse sizes is commonly attributed to activity-dependent processes that drive synaptic growth and diminution. Recent studies also point to activity-independent size fluctuations, possibly driven by innate synaptic molecule dynamics, as important generators of size diversity. To examine the contributions of activity-dependent and independent processes to excitatory synapse size diversity, we studied glutamatergic synapse size dynamics and diversification in cultured rat cortical neurons (both sexes), silenced from plating. We found that in networks with no history of activity whatsoever, synaptic size diversity was no less extensive than that observed in spontaneously active networks. Synapses in silenced networks were larger, size distributions were broader, yet these were rightward-skewed and similar in shape when scaled by mean synaptic size. Silencing reduced the magnitude of size fluctuations and weakened constraints on size distributions, yet these were sufficient to explain synaptic size diversity in silenced networks. Model-based exploration followed by experimental testing indicated that silencing-associated changes in innate molecular dynamics and fluctuation characteristics might negatively impact synaptic persistence, resulting in reduced synaptic numbers. This, in turn, would increase synaptic molecule availability, promote synaptic enlargement, and ultimately alter fluctuation characteristics. These findings suggest that activity-independent size fluctuations are sufficient to fully diversify glutamatergic synaptic sizes, with activity-dependent processes primarily setting the scale rather than the shape of size distributions. Moreover, they point to reciprocal relationships between synaptic size fluctuations, size distributions, and synaptic numbers mediated by the innate dynamics of synaptic molecules as they move in, out, and between synapses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Sizes of glutamatergic synapses vary tremendously, even when formed on the same neuron. This diversity is commonly thought to reflect the outcome of activity-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity, yet activity-independent processes might also play some part. Here we show that in neurons with no history of activity whatsoever, synaptic sizes are no less diverse. We show that this diversity is the product of activity-independent size fluctuations, which are sufficient to generate a full repertoire of synaptic sizes at correct proportions. By combining modeling and experimentation we expose reciprocal relationships between size fluctuations, synaptic sizes and synaptic counts, and show how these phenomena might be connected through the dynamics of synaptic molecules as they move in, out, and between synapses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience: Structural Remodeling of Active Zones Is Associated with Synaptic Homeostasis</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/14/2817?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Perturbations to postsynaptic glutamate receptors (GluRs) trigger retrograde signaling to precisely increase presynaptic neurotransmitter release, maintaining stable levels of synaptic strength, a process referred to as homeostatic regulation. However, the structural change of homeostatic regulation remains poorly defined. At wild-type &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; neuromuscular junction synapse, there is one Bruchpilot (Brp) ring detected by superresolution microscopy at active zones (AZs). In the present study, we report multiple Brp rings (i.e., multiple T-bars seen by electron microscopy) at AZs of both male and female larvae when GluRs are reduced. At &lt;i&gt;GluRIIC&lt;/i&gt;-deficient neuromuscular junctions, quantal size was reduced but quantal content was increased, indicative of homeostatic presynaptic potentiation. Consistently, multiple Brp rings at AZs were observed in the two classic synaptic homeostasis models (i.e., &lt;i&gt;GluRIIA&lt;/i&gt; mutant and pharmacological blockade of GluRIIA activity). Furthermore, postsynaptic overexpression of the cell adhesion protein Neuroligin 1 partially rescued multiple Brp rings phenotype. Our study thus supports that the formation of multiple Brp rings at AZs might be a structural basis for synaptic homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Synaptic homeostasis is a conserved fundamental mechanism to maintain efficient neurotransmission of neural networks. Active zones (AZs) are characterized by an electron-dense cytomatrix, which is largely composed of Bruchpilot (Brp) at the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; neuromuscular junction synapses. It is not clear how the structure of AZs changes during homeostatic regulation. To address this question, we examined the structure of AZs by superresolution microscopy and electron microscopy during homeostatic regulation. Our results reveal multiple Brp rings at AZs of glutamate receptor-deficient neuromuscular junction synapses compared with single Brp ring at AZs in wild type (WT). We further show that Neuroligin 1-mediated retrograde signaling regulates multiple Brp ring formation at glutamate receptor-deficient synapses. This study thus reveals a regulatory mechanism for synaptic homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience: Direct Interaction of PP2A Phosphatase with GABAB Receptors Alters Functional Signaling</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/14/2808?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Addictive drugs usurp the brain's intrinsic mechanism for reward, leading to compulsive and destructive behaviors. In the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the center of the brain's reward circuit, GABAergic neurons control the excitability of dopamine (DA) projection neurons and are the site of initial psychostimulant-dependent changes in signaling. Previous work established that cocaine/methamphetamine exposure increases protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity, which dephosphorylates the GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R2 subunit, promotes internalization of the GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor (GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R) and leads to smaller GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R-activated G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) currents in VTA GABA neurons. How the actions of PP2A become selective for a particular signaling pathway is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that PP2A can associate directly with a short peptide sequence in the C terminal domain of the GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R1 subunit, and that GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs and PP2A are in close proximity in rodent neurons (mouse/rat; mixed sexes). We show that this PP2A-GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R interaction can be regulated by intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Finally, a peptide that potentially reduces recruitment of PP2A to GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs and thereby limits receptor dephosphorylation increases the magnitude of baclofen-induced GIRK currents. Thus, limiting PP2A-dependent dephosphorylation of GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs may be a useful strategy to increase receptor signaling for treating diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Dysregulation of GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs) underlies altered neurotransmission in many neurological disorders. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is involved in dephosphorylating and subsequent internalization of GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs in models of addiction and depression. Here, we provide new evidence that PP2A B55 regulatory subunit interacts directly with a small region of the C-terminal domain of the GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R1 subunit, and that this interaction is sensitive to intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. We demonstrate that a short peptide corresponding to the PP2A interaction site on GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R1 competes for PP2A binding, enhances phosphorylation GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R2 S783, and affects functional signaling through GIRK channels. Our study highlights how targeting PP2A dependent dephosphorylation of GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs may provide a specific strategy to modulate GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R signaling in disease conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience: The Relationship Between Glutamate Dynamics and Activity-Dependent Synaptic Plasticity</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/14/2793?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The spatiotemporal dynamics of excitatory neurotransmission must be tightly regulated to achieve efficient synaptic communication. By limiting spillover, glutamate transporters are believed to prevent excessive activation of extrasynaptically located receptors that can impair synaptic plasticity. While glutamate transporter expression is reduced in numerous neurodegenerative diseases, the contributions of transporter dysfunction to disease pathophysiology remain ambiguous as the fundamental relationship between glutamate dynamics and plasticity, and the mechanisms linking these two phenomena, remain poorly understood. Here, we combined electrophysiology and real-time high-speed imaging of extracellular glutamate transients during LTP induction and characterized the sensitivity of the relationship between glutamate dynamics during theta burst stimulation (TBS) and the resulting magnitude of LTP consolidation, both in control conditions and following selective and nonselective glutamate transporter blockade. Glutamate clearance times were negatively correlated with LTP magnitude following nonselective glutamate transporter inhibition but not following selective blockade of a majority of GLT-1, the brain's most abundant glutamate transporter. Although glutamate transporter inhibition reduced the postsynaptic population response to TBS, calcium responses to TBS were greatly exaggerated. The source of excess calcium was dependent on NMDARs, L-type VGCCs, GluA2-lacking AMPARs, and internal calcium stores. Surprisingly, inhibition of L-type VGCCs, but not GluA2-lacking AMPARs or ryanodine receptors, was required to restore robust LTP. In all, these data provide a detailed understanding of the relationship between glutamate dynamics and plasticity and uncover important mechanisms by which poor glutamate uptake can negatively impact LTP consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Specific patterns of neural activity can promote long-term changes in the strength of synaptic connections through a phenomenon known as synaptic plasticity. Synaptic plasticity is well accepted to represent the cellular mechanisms underlying learning and memory, and many forms of plasticity are initiated by the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. While essential for rapid cellular communication in the brain, excessive levels of extracellular glutamate can negatively impact brain function. In this study, we demonstrate that pharmacological manipulations that increase the availability of extracellular glutamate during neural activity can have profoundly negative consequences on synaptic plasticity. We identify mechanisms through which excess glutamate can negatively influence synaptic plasticity, and we discuss the relevance of these findings to neurodegenerative diseases and in the aging brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: A Deep Learning Approach for Mild Depression Recognition Based on Functional Connectivity Using Electroencephalography</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00192</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Early detection remains a significant challenge for the treatment of depression. In our work, we proposed a novel approach to mild depression recognition using electroencephalography (EEG). First, we explored abnormal organization in the functional connectivity network of mild depression using graph theory. Second, we proposed a novel classification model for recognizing mild depression. Considering the powerful ability of CNN to process two-dimensional data, we applied CNN separately to the two-dimensional data form of the functional connectivity matrices from five EEG bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma). In addition, inspired by recent breakthroughs in the ability of deep recurrent CNNs to classify mental load, we merged the functional connectivity matrices from the three EEG bands that performed the best into a three-channel image to classify mild depression-related and normal EEG signals using the CNN. The results of the graph theory analysis showed that the brain functional network of the mild depression group had a larger characteristic path length and a lower clustering coefficient than the healthy control group, showing deviation from the small-world network. The proposed classification model obtained a classification accuracy of 80.74% for recognizing mild depression. The current study suggests that the combination of a CNN and functional connectivity matrix may provide a promising objective approach for diagnosing mild depression. Deep learning approaches such as this might have the potential to inform clinical practice and aid in research on psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Predicting Alzheimer’s Disease Conversion From Mild Cognitive Impairment Using an Extreme Learning Machine-Based Grading Method With Multimodal Data</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00077</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Identifying patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who are at high risk of progressing to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is crucial for early treatment of AD. However, it is difficult to predict the cognitive states of patients. This study developed an extreme learning machine (ELM)-based grading method to efficiently fuse multimodal data and predict MCI-to-AD conversion. First, features were extracted from magnetic resonance (MR) images, and useful features were selected using a feature selection method. Second, multiple modalities of MCI subjects, including MRI, positron emission tomography, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and gene data, were individually graded using the ELM method. Finally, these grading scores calculated from different modalities were fed into a classifier to discriminate subjects with progressive MCI from those with stable MCI. The proposed approach has been validated on the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, and an accuracy of 84.7% was achieved for an AD prediction within 3 years. Experiments on predicting AD conversion from MCI within different periods showed similar results with the 3-year prediction. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach benefits from the efficient fusion of four modalities, resulting in an accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Protein structure determines biological function. Accurately conceptualizing 3D protein/ligand structures is thus vital to scientific research and education. Virtual reality (VR) enables protein visualization in stereoscopic 3D, but many VR molecular-visualization programs are expensive and challenging to use; work only on specific VR headsets; rely on complicated model-preparation software; and/or require the user to install separate programs or plugins. Here we introduce ProteinVR, a web-based application that works on various VR setups and operating systems. ProteinVR displays molecular structures within 3D environments that give useful biological context and allow users to situate themselves in 3D space. Our web-based implementation is ideal for hypothesis generation and education in research and large-classroom settings. We release ProteinVR under the open-source BSD-3-Clause license. A copy of the program is available free of charge from http://durrantlab.com/protein-vr/, and a working version can be accessed at http://durrantlab.com/pvr/.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v_Hjpdfwolo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: The spread of a wild plant pathogen is driven by the road network</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Elina Numminen, Anna-Liisa Laine&lt;/p&gt;

Spatial analyses of pathogen occurrence in their natural surroundings entail unique opportunities for assessing in vivo drivers of disease epidemiology. Such studies are however confronted by the complexity of the landscape driving epidemic spread and disease persistence. Since relevant information on how the landscape influences epidemiological dynamics is rarely available, simple spatial models of spread are often used. In the current study we demonstrate both how more complex transmission pathways could be incorpoted to epidemiological analyses and how this can offer novel insights into understanding disease spread across the landscape. Our study is focused on &lt;i&gt;Podosphaera plantaginis&lt;/i&gt;, a powdery mildew pathogen that transmits from one host plant to another by wind-dispersed spores. Its host populations often reside next to roads and thus we hypothesize that the road network influences the epidemiology of &lt;i&gt;P. plantaginis&lt;/i&gt;. To analyse the impact of roads on the transmission dynamics, we consider a spatial dataset on the presence-absence records on the pathogen collected from a fragmented landscape of host populations. Using both mechanistic transmission modeling and statistical modeling with road-network summary statistics as predictors, we conclude the evident role of the road network in the progression of the epidemics: a phenomena which is manifested both in the enhanced transmission along the roads and in infections typically occurring at the central hub locations of the road network. We also demonstrate how the road network affects the spread of the pathogen using simulations. Jointly our results highlight how human alteration of natural landscapes may increase disease spread.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4FS5-GTdITw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Icosahedral viral capsids must undergo conformational rearrangements to coordinate essential processes during the viral life cycle. Capturing such conformational flexibility has been technically challenging yet could be key for developing rational therapeutic agents to combat infections. Noroviruses are nonenveloped, icosahedral viruses of global importance to human health. They are a common cause of acute gastroenteritis, yet no vaccines or specific antiviral agents are available. Here, we use genetics and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to study the high-resolution solution structures of murine norovirus as a model for human viruses. By comparing our 3 structures (at 2.9- to 3.1-Å resolution), we show that whilst there is little change to the shell domain of the capsid, the radiating protruding domains are flexible, adopting distinct states both independently and synchronously. In doing so, the capsids sample a range of conformational space, with implications for maintaining virion stability and infectivity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/xAeZ9_qOVGY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behavioral data shows that humans and animals have the capacity to learn rules of associations applied to specific examples, and generalize these rules to a broad variety of contexts. This article focuses on neural circuit mechanisms to perform a context‐dependent association task that requires linking sensory stimuli to behavioral responses and generalizing to multiple other symmetrical contexts. The model uses neural gating units that regulate the pattern of physiological connectivity within the circuit. These neural gating units can be used in a learning framework that performs low‐rank matrix factorization analogous to recommender systems, allowing generalization with high accuracy to a wide range of additional symmetrical contexts. The neural gating units are trained with a biologically inspired framework involving traces of Hebbian modification that are updated based on the correct behavioral output of the network. This modeling demonstrates potential neural mechanisms for learning context‐dependent association rules and for the change in selectivity of neurophysiological responses in the hippocampus. The proposed computational model is evaluated using simulations of the learning process and the application of the model to new stimuli. Further, human subject behavioral experiments were performed and the results validate the key observation of a low‐rank synaptic matrix structure linking stimuli to responses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grid cells provide a compelling example of a link between cellular activity and an abstract and difficult to define concept like space. Accordingly, a &lt;i&gt;representational&lt;/i&gt; perspective on grid coding argues that neural grid coding underlies a fundamentally spatial metric. Recently, some theoretical proposals have suggested extending such a framework to nonspatial cognition as well, such as category learning. Here, we provide a critique of the frequently employed assumption of an isomorphism between patterns of neural activity (e.g., grid cells), mental representation, and behavior (e.g., navigation). Specifically, we question the strict isomorphism between these three levels and suggest that human spatial navigation is perhaps best characterized by a wide variety of both metric and nonmetric strategies. We offer an alternative perspective on how grid coding might relate to human spatial navigation, arguing that grid coding is part of a much larger conglomeration of neural activity patterns that dynamically tune to accomplish specific behavioral outputs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23173?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phase precessing place cells encode spatial information on fine timescales via the timing of their spikes. This phase code has been extensively studied on linear tracks and for short runs in the open field. However, less is known about the phase code on unconstrained trajectories lasting tens of minutes, typical of open field foraging. In previous work (Monsalve‐Mercado and Leibold, Physical Review Letters, 119, 38101 (2017)), an analytic expression was derived for the spike‐time cross‐correlation between phase precessing place cells during natural foraging in the open field. This expression makes two predictions on how this phase code differs from the linear track case: cross‐correlations are symmetric with respect to time, and they represent the distance between pairs of place fields in that the theta‐filtered cross‐correlations around zero time lag are positive for cells with nearby fields while they are negative for those with fields further apart. Here we analyze several available open field recordings and show that these predictions hold for pairs of CA1 place cells. We also show that the relationship remains during remapping in CA1, and it is also present in place cells in area CA3. For CA1 place cells of Fmr1‐null mice, which exhibit normal place fields but somewhat weaker temporal coordination with respect to theta compared to wild type, the cross‐correlations still remain symmetric but the relationship to place field overlap is largely lost. The relationship discussed here describes how spatial information is communicated by place cells to downstream areas in a finer theta‐timescale, relevant for learning and memory formation in behavioral tasks lasting tens of minutes in the open field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Nearby grid cells have been observed to express a remarkable degree of long‐range order, which is often idealized as extending potentially to infinity. Yet their strict periodic firing and ensemble coherence are theoretically possible only in flat environments, much unlike the burrows which rodents usually live in. Are the symmetrical, coherent grid maps inferred in the lab relevant to chart their way in their natural habitat? We consider spheres as simple models of curved environments and waiting for the appropriate experiments to be performed, we use our adaptation model to predict what grid maps would emerge in a network with the same type of recurrent connections, which on the plane produce coherence among the units. We find that on the sphere such connections distort the maps that single grid units would express on their own, and aggregate them into clusters. When remapping to a different spherical environment, units in each cluster maintain only partial coherence, similar to what is observed in disordered materials, such as spin glasses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Spike conduction velocity characteristically differs between myelinated and unmyelinated axons. Here we test whether spikes of myelinated and unmyelinated paths differ in other respects by measuring rat retinal ganglion cell (RGC) spike duration in the intraretinal, unmyelinated nerve fiber layer and the extraretinal, myelinated optic nerve and optic chiasm. We find that rapid spike firing and illumination broaden spikes in intraretinal axons but not in extraretinal axons. RGC axons thus initiate spikes intraretinally and normalize spike duration extraretinally. Additionally, we analyze spikes that were recorded in a previous study of rhesus macaque retinogeniculate transmission and find that rapid spike firing does not broaden spikes in optic tract. The spike normalization we find reduces the number of spike properties that can change during RGC light responses. However, this is not because identical spikes fire in all axons. Instead, our recordings show that different subtypes of RGC generate axonal spikes of different durations and that the differences resemble spike duration increases that alter neurotransmitter release from other neurons. Moreover, previous studies have shown that RGC spikes of shorter duration can fire at higher maximum frequencies. These properties should facilitate signal transfer by different mechanisms at RGC synapses onto subcortical target neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: An uncertainty principle for neural coding: Conjugate representations of position and velocity are mapped onto firing rates and co‐firing rates of neural spike trains</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23197?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hippocampal system contains neural populations that encode an animal's position and velocity as it navigates through space. Here, we show that such populations can embed two codes within their spike trains: a &lt;i&gt;firing rate code&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;) conveyed by within‐cell spike intervals, and a &lt;i&gt;co‐firing rate code&lt;/i&gt; () conveyed by between‐cell spike intervals. These two codes behave as &lt;i&gt;conjugates&lt;/i&gt; of one another, obeying an analog of the uncertainty principle from physics: information conveyed in &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/span&gt; comes at the expense of information in , and vice versa. An exception to this trade‐off occurs when spike trains encode a pair of conjugate variables, such as position and velocity, which do not compete for capacity across &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/span&gt; and . To illustrate this, we describe two biologically inspired methods for decoding &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/span&gt; and , referred to as &lt;i&gt;sigma&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;sigma‐chi&lt;/i&gt; decoding, respectively. Simulations of head direction and grid cells show that if firing rates are tuned for position (but not velocity), then position is recovered by sigma decoding, whereas velocity is recovered by sigma‐chi decoding. Conversely, simulations of oscillatory interference among theta‐modulated “speed cells” show that if co‐firing rates are tuned for position (but not velocity), then position is recovered by sigma‐chi decoding, whereas velocity is recovered by sigma decoding. Between these two extremes, information about both variables can be distributed across both channels, and partially recovered by both decoders. These results suggest that populations with different spatial and temporal tuning properties—such as speed versus grid cells—might not encode different information, but rather, distribute similar information about position and velocity in different ways across &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/span&gt; and . Such conjugate coding of position and velocity may influence how hippocampal populations are interconnected to form functional circuits, and how biological neurons integrate their inputs to decode information from firing rates and spike correlations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Untethered firing fields and intermittent silences: Why grid‐cell discharge is so variable</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23191?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grid cells in medial entorhinal cortex are notoriously variable in their responses, despite the striking hexagonal arrangement of their spatial firing fields. Indeed, when the animal moves through a firing field, grid cells often fire much more vigorously than predicted or do not fire at all. The source of this trial‐to‐trial variability is not completely understood. By analyzing grid‐cell spike trains from mice running in open arenas and on linear tracks, we characterize the phenomenon of “missed” firing fields using the statistical theory of zero inflation. We find that one major cause of grid‐cell variability lies in the spatial representation itself: firing fields are not as strongly anchored to spatial location as the averaged grid suggests. In addition, grid fields from different cells drift together from trial to trial, regardless of whether the environment is real or virtual, or whether the animal moves in light or darkness. Spatial realignment across trials sharpens the grid representation, yielding firing fields that are more pronounced and significantly narrower. These findings indicate that ensembles of grid cells encode relative position more reliably than absolute position.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Spatial coordinate transforms linking the allocentric hippocampal and egocentric parietal primate brain systems for memory, action in space, and navigation</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23171?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A theory and model of spatial coordinate transforms in the dorsal visual system through the parietal cortex that enable an interface via posterior cingulate and related retrosplenial cortex to allocentric spatial representations in the primate hippocampus is described. First, a new approach to coordinate transform learning in the brain is proposed, in which the traditional gain modulation is complemented by temporal trace rule competitive network learning. It is shown in a computational model that the new approach works much more precisely than gain modulation alone, by enabling neurons to represent the different combinations of signal and gain modulator more accurately. This understanding may have application to many brain areas where coordinate transforms are learned. Second, a set of coordinate transforms is proposed for the dorsal visual system/parietal areas that enables a representation to be formed in allocentric spatial view coordinates. The input stimulus is merely a stimulus at a given position in retinal space, and the gain modulation signals needed are eye position, head direction, and place, all of which are present in the primate brain. Neurons that encode the bearing to a landmark are involved in the coordinate transforms. Part of the importance here is that the coordinates of the allocentric view produced in this model are the same as those of spatial view cells that respond to allocentric view recorded in the primate hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex. The result is that information from the dorsal visual system can be used to update the spatial input to the hippocampus in the appropriate allocentric coordinate frame, including providing for idiothetic update to allow for self‐motion. It is further shown how hippocampal spatial view cells could be useful for the transform from hippocampal allocentric coordinates to egocentric coordinates useful for actions in space and for navigation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: A comprehensive knowledge base of synaptic electrophysiology in the rodent hippocampal formation</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23148?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cellular and synaptic architecture of the rodent hippocampus has been described in thousands of peer‐reviewed publications. However, no human‐ or machine‐readable public catalog of synaptic electrophysiology data exists for this or any other neural system. Harnessing state‐of‐the‐art information technology, we have developed a cloud‐based toolset for identifying empirical evidence from the scientific literature pertaining to synaptic electrophysiology, for extracting the experimental data of interest, and for linking each entry to relevant text or figure excerpts. Mining more than 1,200 published journal articles, we have identified eight different signal modalities quantified by 90 different methods to measure synaptic amplitude, kinetics, and plasticity in hippocampal neurons. We have designed a data structure that both reflects the differences and maintains the existing relations among experimental modalities. Moreover, we mapped every annotated experiment to identified potential connections, that is, specific pairs of presynaptic and postsynaptic neuron types. To this aim, we leveraged &lt;a href=&quot;http://hippocampome.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;Hippocampome.org&lt;/a&gt;, an open‐access knowledge base of morphologically, electrophysiologically, and molecularly characterized neuron types in the rodent hippocampal formation. Specifically, we have implemented a computational pipeline to systematically translate neuron type properties into formal queries in order to find all compatible potential connections. With this system, we have collected nearly 40,000 synaptic data entities covering 88% of the 3,120 potential connections in &lt;a href=&quot;http://hippocampome.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;Hippocampome.org&lt;/a&gt;. Correcting membrane potentials with respect to liquid junction potentials significantly reduced the difference between theoretical and experimental reversal potentials, thereby enabling the accurate conversion of all synaptic amplitudes to conductance. This data set allows for large‐scale hypothesis testing of the general rules governing synaptic signals. To illustrate these applications, we confirmed several expected correlations between synaptic measurements and their covariates while suggesting previously unreported ones. We release all data open‐source at &lt;a href=&quot;http://hippocampome.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;Hippocampome.org&lt;/a&gt; in order to further research across disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Excessive β-Catenin in Excitatory Neurons Results in Reduced Social and Increased Repetitive Behaviors and Altered Expression of Multiple Genes Linked to Human Autism</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00014</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Multiple human autism risk genes are predicted to converge on the β-catenin (β-cat)/Wnt pathway. However, direct tests to link β-cat up- or down-regulation with autism are largely lacking, and the associated pathophysiological changes are poorly defined. Here we identify excessive β-cat as a risk factor that causes expression changes in several genes relevant to human autism. Our studies utilize mouse lines with β-cat dysregulation in forebrain excitatory neurons, identified as cell types with a convergent expression of autism-linked genes in both human and mouse brains. We show that mice expressing excessive β-cat display behavioral and molecular changes, including decreased social interest, increased repetitive behaviors, reduced parvalbumin and altered expression levels of additional genes identified as potential risk factors for human autism. These behavioral and molecular phenotypes are averted by reducing β-cat in neurons predisposed by gene mutations to express elevated β-cat. Using next-generation sequencing of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), we identify 87 dysregulated genes that are shared between mouse lines with excessive β-cat and autism-like behaviors, but not mouse lines with reduced β-cat and normal social behavior. Our findings provide critical new insights into β-cat, Wnt pathway dysregulation in the brain causing behavioral phenotypes relevant to the disease and the molecular etiology which includes several human autism risk genes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Anterior Commissure Regulates Neuronal Activity of Amygdalae and Influences Locomotor Activity, Social Interaction and Fear Memory in Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00047</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The two hemispheres of the vertebrate brain are connected through several commissures. Although the anterior commissure (AC) is the most conserved white matter structure in the brains of different vertebrates, its complete physiological functionality remains elusive. Since the AC is involved in the connection between two amygdalae and because amygdalae are critical for emotional behaviors and social interaction, we assessed amygdalar activity and function to investigate the physiological role of the AC. We first performed ex vivo electrophysiological recording on mouse brains to demonstrate that the AC delivers a positive signal to facilitate synaptic responses and to recruit basolateral amygdalar neurons via glutamatergic synapses. Transection was then undertaken to investigate the role of the AC in vivo. Results from in vivo optogenetic stimulation suggest that AC transection impairs mutual activation between two basolateral amygdalae. Behavioral analyses were then used to assess if AC surgical lesioning results in hyperactivity, anxiety, social reduction or learning/memory impairment, which are behavioral features associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders. We found that AC transection results in higher locomotor activity, aberrant social interaction and reduced associative memory, but not anxiety. Moreover, systemic administration of D-cycloserine, a coagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, ameliorated auditory fear memory in AC-transected mice, reinforcing our evidence that the AC potentiates the activity of basolateral amygdalae. Our study suggests that the AC regulates basolateral amygdalar activity and influences neuropsychiatry-related behaviors in mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Roles of VMP1 in Autophagy and ER–Membrane Contact: Potential Implications in Neurodegenerative Disorders</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00042</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cellular communication processes are highly dynamic and mediated, at least in part, by contacts between various membrane structures. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the major biosynthetic organelle of the cell, establishes an extensive network with other membrane structures to regulate the transport of intracellular molecules. Vacuole membrane protein 1 (VMP1), an ER-localized metazoan-specific protein, plays important roles in the formation of autophagosomes and communication between the ER and other organelles, including mitochondria, autophagosome precursor membranes, Golgi, lipid droplets, and endosomes. Increasing evidence has indicated that autophagy and ER–membrane communication at membrane contact sites are closely related to neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In this review, we summarize the roles of VMP1 in autophagy and ER–membrane contacts and discuss their potential implications in neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Force Control and Motor Unit Firing Behavior Following Mental Fatigue in Young Female and Male Adults</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00015</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Purpose: The neuromuscular mechanisms leading to impaired motor performance in the presence of mental fatigue remain unclear. It is also unknown if mental fatigue differentially impacts motor performance in males and females. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of mental fatigue on force production and motor unit (MU) firing behavior in males and females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Nineteen participants performed 10-s isometric dorsiflexion (DF) contractions at 20 and 50% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) before, during, and after completing 22 min of the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT), to induce mental fatigue. The DF force and indwelling MU firing behavior of the tibialis anterior (TA) was measured before and immediately following the PVT and within the first and final minutes of the PVT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Force steadiness and motor unit firing rate (MUFR) variability did not change during or following the PVT at either contraction intensity (p ≥ 0.16). Overall, females had more variability than males in MUFR during the 20% MVCs (15.98 ± 2.19 vs. 13.64 ± 2.19%, p = 0.03), though no sex differences were identified during the 50% MVCs (p = 0.20). Mean MUFR decreased following mental fatigue in both sexes in the 20% MVC condition (14.79 ± 3.20 vs. 12.92 ± 2.53 Hz, p = 0.02), but only in males during the 50% MVC condition (18.65 ± 5.21 vs. 15.03 ± 2.60 Hz, p = 0.01).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: These results suggest possible sex and contraction intensity-specific neuromuscular changes in the presence of mental fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Role of Alterations in Protein Kinase p38γ in the Pathogenesis of the Synaptic Pathology in Dementia With Lewy Bodies and α-Synuclein Transgenic Models</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00286</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Progressive accumulation of the pre-synaptic protein α-synuclein (α-syn) has been strongly associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders of the aging population such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system atrophy. While the precise mechanisms are not fully understood, alterations in kinase pathways including that of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 have been proposed to play a role. In AD, p38α activation has been linked to neuro-inflammation while alterations in p38γ have been associated with tau phosphorylation. Although p38 has been studied in AD, less is known about its role in DLB/PD and other α-synucleinopathies. For this purpose, we investigated the expression of the p38 family in brains from α-syn overexpressing transgenic mice (α-syn Tg: Line 61) and patients with DLB/PD. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that in healthy human controls and non-Tg mice, p38α associated with neurons and astroglial cells and p38γ localized to pre-synaptic terminals. In DLB and α-syn Tg brains, however, p38α levels were increased in astroglial cells while p38γ immunostaining was redistributed from the synaptic terminals to the neuronal cell bodies. Double immunolabeling further showed that p38γ colocalized with α-syn aggregates in DLB patients, and immunoblot and qPCR analysis confirmed the increased levels of p38α and p38γ. α1-syntrophin, a synaptic target of p38γ, was present in the neuropil and some neuronal cell bodies in human controls and non-Tg mice. In DLB and and Tg mice, however, α1-syntrophin was decreased in the neuropil and instead colocalized with α-syn in intra-neuronal inclusions. In agreement with these findings, in vitro studies showed that α-syn co-immunoprecipitates with p38γ, but not p38α. These results suggest that α-syn might interfere with the p38γ pathway and play a role in the mechanisms of synaptic dysfunction in DLB/PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: fMRI-Targeted High-Angular Resolution Diffusion MR Tractography to Identify Functional Language Tracts in Healthy Controls and Glioma Patients</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00225</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;MR Tractography enables non-invasive preoperative depiction of language subcortical tracts, which is crucial for the presurgical work-up of brain tumors; however, it cannot evaluate the exact function of the fibers.&lt;/p&gt;Purpose&lt;p&gt;A systematic pipeline was developed to combine tractography reconstruction of language fiber bundles, based on anatomical landmarks (Anatomical-T), with language fMRI cortical activations. A fMRI-targeted Tractography (fMRI-T) was thus obtained, depicting the subsets of the anatomical tracts whose endpoints are located inside a fMRI activation. We hypothesized that fMRI-T could provide additional functional information regarding the subcortical structures, better reflecting the eloquent white matter structures identified intraoperatively.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Both Anatomical-T and fMRI-T of language fiber tracts were performed on 16 controls and preoperatively on 16 patients with left-hemisphere brain tumors, using a q-ball residual bootstrap algorithm based on High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging (HARDI) datasets (b = 3000 s/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; 60 directions); fMRI ROIs were obtained using picture naming, verbal fluency, and auditory verb generation tasks. In healthy controls, normalized MNI atlases of fMRI-T and Anatomical-T were obtained. In patients, the surgical resection of the tumor was pursued by identifying eloquent structures with intraoperative direct electrical stimulation mapping and extending surgery to the functional boundaries. Post-surgical MRI allowed to identify Anatomical-T and fMRI-T non-eloquent portions removed during the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;MNI Atlases showed that fMRI-T is a subset of Anatomical-T, and that different task-specific fMRI-T involve both shared subsets and task-specific subsets – e.g., verbal fluency fMRI-T strongly involves dorsal frontal tracts, consistently with the phonogical-articulatory features of this task. A quantitative analysis in patients revealed that Anatomical-T removed portions of AF-SLF and IFOF were significantly greater than verbal fluency fMRI-T ones, suggesting that fMRI-T is a more specific approach. In addition, qualitative analyses showed that fMRI-T AF-SLF and IFOF predict the exact functional limits of resection with increased specificity when compared to Anatomical-T counterparts, especially the superior frontal portion of IFOF, in a subcohort of patients.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that performing fMRI-T in addition to the ‘classic’ Anatomical-T may be useful in a preoperative setting to identify the ‘high-risk subsets’ that should be spared during the surgical procedure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Higher Sensitivity and Reproducibility of Wavelet-Based Amplitude of Resting-State fMRI</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00224</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The fast Fourier transform (FFT) is a widely used algorithm used to depict the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI). Wavelet transform (WT) is more effective in representing the complex waveform due to its adaptivity to non-stationary or local features of data and many varieties of wavelet functions with different shapes being available. However, there is a paucity of RS-fMRI studies that systematically compare between the results of FFT versus WT. The present study employed five cohorts of datasets and compared the sensitivity and reproducibility of FFT-ALFF with those of Wavelet-ALFF based on five mother wavelets (namely, db2, bior4.4, morl, meyr, and sym3). In addition to the conventional frequency band of 0.0117–0.0781 Hz, a comparison was performed in sub-bands, namely, Slow-6 (0–0.0117 Hz), Slow-5 (0.0117–0.0273 Hz), Slow-4 (0.0273–0.0742 Hz), Slow-3 (0.0742–0.1992 Hz), and Slow-2 (0.1992–0.25 Hz). The results indicated that the Wavelet-ALFF of all five mother wavelets was generally more sensitive and reproducible than FFT-ALFF in all frequency bands. Specifically, in the higher frequency band Slow-2 (0.1992–0.25 Hz), the mean sensitivity of db2-ALFF results was 1.54 times that of FFT-ALFF, and the reproducibility of db2-ALFF results was 2.95 times that of FFT-ALFF. The findings suggest that wavelet-ALFF can replace FFT-ALFF, especially in the higher frequency band. Future studies should test more mother wavelets on other RS-fMRI metrics and multiple datasets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Neurodegenerative Diseases – Is Metabolic Deficiency the Root Cause?</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00213</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer, Parkinson, Huntington, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, are a prominent class of neurological diseases currently without a cure. They are characterized by an inexorable loss of a specific type of neurons. The selective vulnerability of specific neuronal clusters (typically a subcortical cluster) in the early stages, followed by the spread of the disease to higher cortical areas, is a typical pattern of disease progression. Neurodegenerative diseases share a range of molecular and cellular pathologies, including protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, glutamate toxicity, calcium load, proteolytic stress, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and aging, which contribute to neuronal death. Efforts to treat these diseases are often limited by the fact that they tend to address any one of the above pathological changes while ignoring others. Lack of clarity regarding a possible root cause that underlies all the above pathologies poses a significant challenge. In search of an integrative theory for neurodegenerative pathology, we hypothesize that metabolic deficiency in certain vulnerable neuronal clusters is the common underlying thread that links many dimensions of the disease. The current review aims to present an outline of such an integrative theory. We present a new perspective of neurodegenerative diseases as metabolic disorders at molecular, cellular, and systems levels. This helps to understand a common underlying mechanism of the many facets of the disease and may lead to more promising disease-modifying therapeutic interventions. Here, we briefly discuss the selective metabolic vulnerability of specific neuronal clusters and also the involvement of glia and vascular dysfunctions. Any failure in satisfaction of the metabolic demand by the neurons triggers a chain of events that precipitate various manifestations of neurodegenerative pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Alcohol Craving in Heavy and Occasional Alcohol Drinkers After Cue Exposure in a Virtual Environment: The Role of the Sense of Presence</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00124</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The development of new technologies, and more specifically the opportunity to immerse participants in virtual controlled environments, provides a new ecological framework for researchers to study complex behaviors. This experiment aimed to compare post-immersion craving in occasional and heavy alcohol drinkers. Twenty-two occasional drinkers and eighteen heavy drinkers were recruited and immersed in a virtual bar, including alcoholic beverages. After the exposure, heavy drinkers reported a significantly higher craving than occasional drinkers. Post-immersion alcohol craving was significantly related to the levels of perceived ecological validity of the virtual environment. Finally, a moderation analysis suggested that the levels of craving more strongly increased with perceived ecological validity in heavy drinkers than in occasional drinkers. Therefore, the perceived ecological validity was an important experimental parameter to study craving in a virtual environment. These results further suggested that virtual reality might be a useful tool for both the scientific study of alcohol addiction and the treatment of alcohol dependence and relapse.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Egocentric and Allocentric Spatial Memory in Korsakoff’s Amnesia</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00121</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The goal of the present study was to investigate spatial memory in a group of patients with amnesia due to Korsakoff’s syndrome (KS). We used a virtual spatial memory task that allowed us to separate the use of egocentric and allocentric spatial reference frames to determine object locations. Research investigating the ability of patients with Korsakoff’s amnesia to use different reference frames is scarce and it remains unclear whether these patients are impaired in using ego- and allocentric reference frames to the same extent. Twenty Korsakoff patients and 24 matched controls watched an animation of a bird flying in one of three trees standing in a virtual environment. After the bird disappeared, the camera turned around, by which the trees were briefly out of sight and then turned back to the center of the environment. Participants were asked in which tree the bird was hiding. In half of the trials, a landmark was shown. Half of the trials required an immediate response whereas in the other half a delay of 10 s was present. Patients performed significantly worse than controls. For all participants trials with a landmark were easier than without a landmark and trials without a delay were easier than with a delay. While controls were above chance on all trials patients were at chance in allocentric trials without a landmark present and with a memory delay. Patients showed no difference in the ego- and the allocentric condition. Together the findings suggest that despite the amnesia, spatial memory and especially the use of ego- and allocentric reference frames in Korsakoff patients are spared.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Rating the Intensity of a Laser Stimulus, but Not Attending to Changes in Its Location or Intensity Modulates the Laser-Evoked Cortical Activity</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00120</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Top-down attention towards nociceptive stimuli can be modulated by asking participants to pay attention to specific features of a stimulus, or to provide a rating about its intensity/unpleasantness. Whether and how these different top-down processes may lead to different modulations of the cortical response to nociceptive stimuli remains an open question. We recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to brief nociceptive laser stimuli in 24 healthy participants while they performed a task in which they had to compare two subsequent stimuli on their Spatial location (Location task) or Intensity (Intensity Task). In two additional blocks (Location + Ratings, and Intensity + Ratings) participants had to further provide a rating of the perceived intensity of the stimulus. Such a design allowed us to investigate whether focusing on spatial or intensity features of a nociceptive stimulus and rating its intensity would exert different effects on the EEG responses. We did not find statistical evidence for an effect on the signal while participants were focusing on different features of the signal. We only observed a significant cluster difference in frontoparietal leads at approximately 300–500 ms post-stimulus between the magnitude of the signal in the Intensity and Intensity + Rating conditions, with a less negative response in the Intensity + Rating condition in frontal electrodes, and a less positive amplitude in parietal leads. We speculatively propose that activity in those electrodes and time window reflects magnitude estimation processes. Moreover, the smaller frontal amplitude in the Intensity + Rating condition can be explained by greater working memory engagement known to reduce the magnitude of the EEG signal. We conclude that different top-down attentional processes modulate responses to nociceptive laser stimuli at different electrodes and time windows depending on the underlying processes that are engaged.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Travel Planning Ability in Right Brain-Damaged Patients: Two Case Reports</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00117</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Planning ability is fundamental for goal-directed spatial navigation. Preliminary findings from patients and healthy individuals suggest that travel planning (TP)—namely, navigational planning—can be considered a distinct process from visuospatial planning (VP) ability. To shed light on this distinction, two right brain-damaged patients without hemineglect were compared with a control group on two tasks aimed at testing VP (i.e., Tower of London-16, ToL-16) and TP (i.e., Minefield Task, MFT). The former requires planning the moves to reach the right configuration of three colored beads on three pegs, whereas the latter was opportunely developed to assess TP in the navigational environment when obstacles are present. Specifically, the MFT requires participants to plan a route on a large carpet avoiding some hidden obstacles previously observed. Patient 1 showed lesions encompassing the temporoparietal region and the insula; she performed poorer than the control group on the ToL-16 but showed no deficit on the MFT. Conversely, Patient 2 showed lesions mainly located in the occipitoparietal network of spatial navigation; she performed worse than the control group on the MFT but not on the ToL-16. In both cases performances satisfied the criteria for a classical dissociation, meeting criteria for a double dissociation. These results support the idea that TP is a distinct ability and that it is dissociated from VP skills.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: A Preliminary Study of the Effects of Attentive Music Listening on Cochlear Implant Users’ Speech Perception, Quality of Life, and Behavioral and Objective Measures of Frequency Change Detection</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00110</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Most cochlear implant (CI) users have difficulty in listening tasks that rely strongly on perception of frequency changes (e.g., speech perception in noise, musical melody perception, etc.). Some previous studies using behavioral or subjective assessments have shown that short-term music training can benefit CI users’ perception of music and speech. Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings may reveal the neural basis for music training benefits in CI users.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;To examine the effects of short-term music training on CI hearing outcomes using a comprehensive test battery of subjective evaluation, behavioral tests, and EEG measures.&lt;/p&gt;Design&lt;p&gt;Twelve adult CI users were recruited for a home-based music training program that focused on attentive listening to music genres and materials that have an emphasis on melody. The participants used a music streaming program (i.e., Pandora) downloaded onto personal electronic devices for training. The participants attentively listened to music through a direct audio cable or through Bluetooth streaming. The training schedule was 40 min/session/day, 5 days/week, for either 4 or 8 weeks. The pre-training and post-training tests included: hearing thresholds, Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale (SSQ12) questionnaire, psychoacoustic tests of frequency change detection threshold (FCDT), speech recognition tests (CNC words, AzBio sentences, and QuickSIN), and EEG responses to tones that contained different magnitudes of frequency changes.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;All participants except one finished the 4- or 8-week training, resulting in a dropout rate of 8.33%. Eleven participants performed all tests except for two who did not participate in EEG tests. Results showed a significant improvement in the FCDTs as well as performance on CNC and QuickSIN after training (p &amp;lt; 0.05), but no significant improvement in SSQ scores (p &amp;gt; 0.05). Results of the EEG tests showed larger post-training cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs) in seven of the nine participants, suggesting a better cortical processing of both stimulus onset and within-stimulus frequency changes.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These preliminary data suggest that extensive, focused music listening can improve frequency perception and speech perception in CI users. Further studies that include a larger sample size and control groups are warranted to determine the efficacy of short-term music training in CI users.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Path Learning in Individuals With Down Syndrome: The Floor Matrix Task and the Role of Individual Visuo-Spatial Measures</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00107</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Environment learning is essential in everyday life. In individuals with Down syndrome (DS), this skill has begun to be examined using virtual exploration. Previous studies showed that individuals with DS can learn and remember paths in terms of sequences of turns and straight stretches, albeit with some difficulty, and this learning is supported by their cognitive abilities. This study further investigates environment learning in the DS population, newly examining their ability to learn a path from actual movements, and to learn increasingly long paths, and how their performance relates to their visuo-spatial abilities and everyday spatial activities. A group of 30 individuals with DS and 30 typically-developing (TD) children matched for receptive vocabulary performed a 4 × 4 Floor Matrix task in a grid comprising 16 squares (total area 2.3 × 2.3 meters). The task involved repeating increasingly long sequences of steps by actually moving in the grid. The sequences were presented in two learning conditions, called Observation (when participants watched the experimenter’s moves), or Map (when they were shown a map reproducing the path). Several visuo-spatial measures were also administered. The results showed a clear difference between the two groups’ performance in the individual visuo-spatial measures. In the Floor Matrix task, after controlling for visuo-spatial reasoning ability, both groups benefited to the same degree from the Observation condition vis-à-vis the Map condition, and no group differences emerged. In the group with DS, visuo-spatial abilities were more predictive of performance in the Floor Matrix task in the Observation condition than in the Map condition. The same was true of the TD group, but this difference was much less clear-cut. The visuo-spatial working memory and visualization tasks were the strongest predictors of Floor Matrix task performance. Finally, the group with DS showed a significant relation between Floor Matrix task performance in the Observation condition and everyday spatial activity. These results enlarge on what we know about path learning in individuals with DS and its relation to their visuo-spatial abilities. These findings are discussed within the frame of spatial cognition and the atypical development domain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Factors Associated With Virtual Reality Sickness in Head-Mounted Displays: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00096</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The use of head-mounted displays (HMD) for virtual reality (VR) application-based purposes including therapy, rehabilitation, and training is increasing. Despite advancements in VR technologies, many users still experience sickness symptoms. VR sickness may be influenced by technological differences within HMDs such as resolution and refresh rate, however, VR content also plays a significant role. The primary objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the literature on HMDs that report Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) scores to determine the impact of content. User factors associated with VR sickness were also examined. A systematic search was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Fifty-five articles met inclusion criteria, representing 3,016 participants (mean age range 19.5–80; 41% female). Findings show gaming content recorded the highest total SSQ mean 34.26 (95%CI 29.57–38.95). VR sickness profiles were also influenced by visual stimulation, locomotion and exposure times. Older samples (mean age ≥35 years) scored significantly lower total SSQ means than younger samples, however, these findings are based on a small evidence base as a limited number of studies included older users. No sex differences were found. Across all types of content, the pooled total SSQ mean was relatively high 28.00 (95%CI 24.66–31.35) compared with recommended SSQ cut-off scores. These findings are of relevance for informing future research and the application of VR in different contexts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00079</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Attributing mental states to others in social interactions [Theory of Mind (ToM)] often depends on visual social cues like eye gaze or mimic. This study presents an event-related potentials task (Brainy-ERP) that was developed in order to investigate the electrophysiological correlates of first-, second-, and third-order cognitive and affective ToM processing. The task was based on social visual cues and involved electroencephalographic event-related potential (ERP) analyses and exact low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography analyses (eLORETA) source localization analyses. Results showed that in cognitive and affective conditions, first-order trials elicited greater Anterior P2 (180–370 ms) amplitudes. In the cognitive condition, third-order trials elicited greatest amplitudes in the broadly distributed early negative slow wave (eNSW, 260–470 ms) and the late NSW (LNSW, 460–1,000 ms). In the affective condition, third-order and second-order trials elicited greatest amplitudes in a broadly distributed NSW (250–1,000 ms). Regarding affective trials in the NSW time span, statistical significant differences and trends were shown regarding activation of underlying brain regions. Third-order trials elicited greatest activation in a number of regions typically associated with the ToM network, especially the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), cuneus, and temporoparietal junction (TPJ). Furthermore, ToM low performers (participants with high accuracy but longer reaction times) showed by trend smaller Posterior N1 and significantly smaller eNSW amplitudes compared to average and high performers. This study offers new insights into electrophysiological correlates of basic and higher order cognitive and affective ToM processing and its precise time course.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Inhibition of Long-Term Variability in Decoding Forelimb Trajectory Using Evolutionary Neural Networks With Error-Correction Learning</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00022</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: In brain machine interfaces (BMIs), the functional mapping between neural activities and kinematic parameters varied over time owing to changes in neural recording conditions. The variability in neural recording conditions might result in unstable long-term decoding performance. Relevant studies trained decoders with several days of training data to make them inherently robust to changes in neural recording conditions. However, these decoders might not be robust to changes in neural recording conditions when only a few days of training data are available. In time-series prediction and feedback control system, an error feedback was commonly adopted to reduce the effects of model uncertainty. This motivated us to introduce an error feedback to a neural decoder for dealing with the variability in neural recording conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approach: We proposed an evolutionary constructive and pruning neural network with error feedback (ECPNN-EF) as a neural decoder. The ECPNN-EF with partially connected topology decoded the instantaneous firing rates of each sorted unit into forelimb movement of a rat. Furthermore, an error feedback was adopted as an additional input to provide kinematic information and thus compensate for changes in functional mapping. The proposed neural decoder was trained on data collected from a water reward-related lever-pressing task for a rat. The first 2 days of data were used to train the decoder, and the subsequent 10 days of data were used to test the decoder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Main Results: The ECPNN-EF under different settings was evaluated to better understand the impact of the error feedback and partially connected topology. The experimental results demonstrated that the ECPNN-EF achieved significantly higher daily decoding performance with smaller daily variability when using the error feedback and partially connected topology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significance: These results suggested that the ECPNN-EF with partially connected topology could cope with both within- and across-day changes in neural recording conditions. The error feedback in the ECPNN-EF compensated for decreases in decoding performance when neural recording conditions changed. This mechanism made the ECPNN-EF robust against changes in functional mappings and thus improved the long-term decoding stability when only a few days of training data were available.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Cortical Microcircuit Mechanisms of Mismatch Negativity and Its Underlying Subcomponents</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00013</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the neocortex, neuronal processing of sensory events is significantly influenced by context. For instance, responses in sensory cortices are suppressed to repetitive or redundant stimuli, a phenomenon termed “stimulus-specific adaptation” (SSA). However, in a context in which that same stimulus is novel, or deviates from expectations, neuronal responses are augmented. This augmentation is termed “deviance detection” (DD). This contextual modulation of neural responses is fundamental for how the brain efficiently processes the sensory world to guide immediate and future behaviors. Notably, context modulation is deficient in some neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ), as quantified by reduced “mismatch negativity” (MMN), an electroencephalography waveform reflecting a combination of SSA and DD in sensory cortex. Although the role of NMDA-receptor function and other neuromodulatory systems on MMN is established, the precise microcircuit mechanisms of MMN and its underlying components, SSA and DD, remain unknown. When coupled with animal models, the development of powerful precision neurotechnologies over the past decade carries significant promise for making new progress into understanding the neurobiology of MMN with previously unreachable spatial resolution. Currently, rodent models represent the best tool for mechanistic study due to the vast genetic tools available. While quantifying human-like MMN waveforms in rodents is not straightforward, the “oddball” paradigms used to study it in humans and its underlying subcomponents (SSA/DD) are highly translatable across species. Here we summarize efforts published so far, with a focus on cortically measured SSA and DD in animals to maintain relevance to the classically measured MMN, which has cortical origins. While mechanistic studies that measure and contrast both components are sparse, we synthesize a potential set of microcircuit mechanisms from the existing rodent, primate, and human literature. While MMN and its subcomponents likely reflect several mechanisms across multiple brain regions, understanding fundamental microcircuit mechanisms is an important step to understand MMN as a whole. We hypothesize that SSA reflects adaptations occurring at synapses along the sensory-thalamocortical pathways, while DD depends on both SSA inherited from afferent inputs and resulting disinhibition of non-adapted neurons arising from the distinct physiology and wiring properties of local interneuronal subpopulations and NMDA-receptor function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

In recent decades, they have been found across different brain regions, many of which are involved in autism-related social, emotional and cognitive deficits. Clinical studies have revealed possible correlation between those hormones and autism spectrum disorder pathogenesis. In animal models, gut peptide hormones modulate neurodevelopment, synaptic transmission and neural plasticity, explaining their behavioral relevance. This review article will summarize major findings from both clinical and basic research showing the role of gut peptide hormones in mediating autism-related neurological functions, and their potential implications in autism pathogenesis. The pharmaceutical value of gut hormones in alleviating autism-associated behavioral syndromes will be discussed to provide new insights for future drug development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: mTOR Suppresses Macroautophagy During Striatal Postnatal Development and Is Hyperactive in Mouse Models of Autism Spectrum Disorders</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00070</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) plays a critical role in neuronal function related to development and degeneration. Here, we investigated whether autophagy is developmentally regulated in the striatum, a brain region implicated in neurodevelopmental disease. We demonstrate that autophagic flux is suppressed during striatal postnatal development, reaching adult levels around postnatal day 28 (P28). We also find that mTOR signaling, a key regulator of autophagy, increases during the same developmental period. We further show that mTOR signaling is responsible for suppressing autophagy, via regulation of Beclin-1 and VPS34 activity. Finally, we discover that autophagy is downregulated during late striatal postnatal development (P28) in mice with in utero exposure to valproic acid (VPA), an established mouse model of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). VPA-exposed mice also display deficits in striatal neurotransmission and social behavior. Correction of hyperactive mTOR signaling in VPA-exposed mice restores social behavior. These results demonstrate that neurons coopt metabolic signaling cascades to developmentally regulate autophagy and provide additional evidence that mTOR-dependent signaling pathways represent pathogenic signaling cascades in ASD mouse models that are active during specific postnatal windows.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Inhibition of Microglial TGFβ Signaling Increases Expression of Mrc1</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microglia are constantly surveying their microenvironment and rapidly react to impairments by changing their morphology, migrating toward stimuli and adopting gene expression profiles characterizing their activated state. The increased expression of the M2-like marker Mannose receptor 1 (Mrc1), which is also referred to as CD206, in microglia has been reported after M2-like activation in vitro and in vivo. Mrc1 is a 175-kDa transmembrane pattern recognition receptor which binds a variety of carbohydrates and is involved in the pinocytosis and the phagocytosis of immune cells, including microglia, and thought to contribute to a neuroprotective microglial phenotype. Here we analyzed the effects of TGFβ signaling on Mrc1 expression in microglia in vivo and in vitro. Using C57BL/6 wild type and Cx3cr1&lt;sup&gt;CreERT2&lt;/sup&gt;:R26-YFP:Tgfbr2&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt; mice-derived microglia, we show that the silencing of TGFβ signaling results in the upregulation of Mrc1, whereas recombinant TGFβ1 induced the delayed downregulation of Mrc1. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments provided evidence that Mrc1 is not a direct Smad2/Smad4 target gene in microglia. Altogether our data indicate that the changes in Mrc1 expression after the activation or the silencing of microglial TGFβ signaling are likely to be mediated by modifications of the secondary intracellular signaling events influenced by TGFβ signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
