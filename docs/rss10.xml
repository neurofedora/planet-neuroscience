In the past years powerful tools specifically designed to aid the measurement of behavior have come to fruition. Here we discuss how capturing the postures of animals — pose estimation - has been rapidly advancing with new deep learning methods. While challenges still remain, we envision that the fast-paced development of new deep learning tools will rapidly change the landscape of realizable real-world neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The endosomal protein sorting nexin 4 is a novel synaptic protein</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/860940v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Sorting nexin 4 (SNX4) is an evolutionary conserved protein that mediates recycling from the endosomes back to the plasma membrane in yeast and mammalian cells. SNX4 is expressed in the brain, but its neuronal localization and function have not been addressed. Using a new antibody, endogenous neuronal SNX4 co-localized with both early and recycling endosomes, similar to the reported localization of SNX4 in non-neuronal cells. Neuronal SNX4 was accumulated in synapses, and immuno-electron microscopy revealed that SNX4 was predominantly localized to presynaptic terminals. Acute depletion of neuronal SNX4 using independent shRNAs did not affect the levels of the canonical SNX4-cargo transferrin receptor. Explorative mass spectrometry showed that each SNX4-targetted shRNA resulted in a reproducible and distinct proteome and that synaptic communication-related proteins were downregulated upon expression of the three shRNAs. The identification of SNX4 as a novel synaptic protein indicates a selective demand for SNX4 dependent sorting in synapses.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Coding of odour and space in the hemimetabolous insect Periplaneta americana</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/860908v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The general architecture of the olfactory system is highly conserved from insects to humans, but neuroanatomical and physiological differences can be observed across species. The American cockroach, inhabiting dark shelters with a rather stable olfactory landscape, is equipped with long antennae used for sampling the surrounding air-space for orientation and navigation. The antennae's exceptional length provides a wide spatial working range for odour detection; however, it is still largely unknown whether and how this is also used for mapping the structure of the olfactory environment. By selective labelling antennal lobe projection neurons with a calcium sensitive dye, we investigated the logic of olfactory coding in this hemimetabolous insect. We show that odour responses are stimulus-specific and concentration-dependent, and that structurally related odorants evoke physiologically similar responses. By using spatially confined stimuli, we show that proximal stimulations induce stronger and faster responses than distal ones. Spatially confined stimuli of the female pheromone periplanone-B activate sub-region of the male macroglomerulus. Thus, we report that the combinatorial logic of odour coding deduced from holometabolous insects applies also to this hemimetabolous species. Furthermore, a fast decrease in sensitivity along the antenna, not supported by a proportionate decrease in sensillar density, suggests a neural architecture that strongly emphasizes neuronal inputs from the proximal portion of the antenna.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Experimental Evaluation of Methods for Real-Time EEG Phase-Specific Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/860874v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Brain oscillations reflect system-level neural dynamics and capture the current brain state. These brain rhythms can be measured noninvasively in humans with electroencephalography (EEG). Up and down states of brain oscillations capture local changes in neuronal excitability. This makes them a promising target for non-invasive brain stimulation methods such as Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). Real-time EEG-TMS systems record ongoing brain signals, process the data, and deliver TMS stimuli at a specific brain state. Despite their promise to increase the temporal specificity of stimulation, best practices and technical solutions are still under development. Here, we implement and compare state-of-the-art methods (Fourier based, Autoregressive Prediction) for real-time EEG-TMS and evaluate their performance both in silico and experimentally. We further propose a new robust algorithm for delivering real-time EEG phase-specific stimulation based on short prerecorded EEG training data (Educated Temporal Prediction). We found that Educated Temporal Prediction performs at the same level or better than Fourier-based or Autoregressive methods both in silico and in vivo, while being computationally more efficient. Further, we document a dependency of EEG signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on algorithm accuracy across all algorithms. In conclusion, our results can give important insights for real-time TMS-EEG technical development as well as experimental design.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: 17q21.31 sub-haplotypes underlying H1-associated risk for Parkinson's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy converge on altered glial regulation</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/860668v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Parkinson's disease (PD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are clinically similar neurodegenerative movement disorders that display unique neuropathological features (i.e. Lewy body pathology and Tau pathology, respectively). While each disorder has distinct clinical and genetic risk factors, both are associated with the MAPT 17q.21.31 locus H1 haplotype. This suggests a pleiotropic effect of this genomic region. To better understand the genetic contribution of this region to these diseases, we fine-mapped the apparent pleiotropy of this locus. Our study indicates that PD and PSP are associated with different sub-haplotypes of the H1 clade. PD-associated sub-haplotypes were associated with altered LRRC37A copy number and expression, which, like other PD risk-associated genes, we hypothesize to be most relevant to astroglial function. In contrast, PSP was associated with grossly altered LD structure across the 17q21.31 locus, and risk-associated variants were found to impact chromatin structure in both neurons and microglia. We conclude that the contribution of the 17q21.31 locus to multiple disorders is a result of its structural and haplotypic complexity, which in turn impacts the regulation of multiple genes and neural cell types. This raises the possibility of novel disease-specific pathogenic mechanisms driven by 17q21.31 structural variation and altered epigenetic regulation that appear to converge on glial function and gene expression. By fine-mapping the association of H1 with PD and PSP, we have begun to untangle the apparent pleiotropy of this locus, and gain better insight into the mechanism of each disease, which will guide future functional analyses and disease models for PD and PSP.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Motion denoising of multiband resting state functional connectivity MRI data: An improved volume censoring method</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/860635v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The study of resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) using functional MRI scans has rapidly become one of the most promising and widely used techniques for investigations of human brain function in both healthy and psychiatric populations. Two critical recent developments in this field are 1) the increasing use of simultaneous multi-slice fMRI (multiband) acceleration techniques, which dramatically improves the spatial and temporal resolution of fMRI data, and 2) the recognition that participant motion is a critical confound in RSFC studies, which requires careful denoising in order to obtain valid results. However, motion artifact denoising techniques were not developed with the temporal resolution of multiband fMRI in mind, which results in the capture of high-frequency respiration-related motion of participants during scanning. This respiration-related motion appears to negatively impact the performance of existing volume censoring approaches. Using publicly available multiband RSFC data from the Human Connectome Project, we developed a new volume censoring motion correction approach that addresses respiration-related motion separately from other sources of motion, and outperforms one of the most widely used denoising pipelines. We further show that the assumptions underlying some of the most commonly employed metrics for evaluating motion denoising pipelines (testing for significant differences in RSFC correlations between high- and low-motion participants, and so-called QC-FC based methods) are invalid. Specifically, the number of significant RSFC correlations between high- and low-motion groups is dramatically reduced by exclusion of participants exhibiting substance use or who have a family history of psychiatric or neurological disorder, indicating that individual differences in unmeasured third variables contribute to both higher motion and true differences in RSFC correlations, thereby invalidating this widely used metric, which assumes that no true differences in RSFC exist between high- and low-motion groups. Finally, we develop and present an empirical basis for selecting volume censoring thresholds in any multiband RSFC dataset, which are widely used in the field but have had an exclusively heuristic basis prior to this work. These findings thus have three major impacts: first, to present a substantively improved pipeline for motion denoising of multiband RSFC data; second, to raise concerns about a key metric used to evaluate motion denoising for RSFC data more generally; and third, to provide investigators with an empirically-grounded estimate of the optimal volume censoring threshold to employ for any dataset.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/860536v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Amytrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder that has been associated with multiple genetic lesions, including mutations in the gene FUS (Fused in Sarcoma), an RNA/DNA-binding protein. Expression of the ALS-associated human FUS in C. elegans results in mislocalization and aggregation of FUS outside the nucleus, and leads to impaired neuromuscular behaviors. However, the mechanisms by which mutant FUS disrupts neuronal health and function remain partially understood. Here we investigated the impact of ALS-associated FUS on motor neuron health using correlative light and electron microscopy, electron tomography, and electrophysiology. Expression of ALS-associated FUS impairs synaptic vesicle docking at neuromuscular junctions, and leads to the emergence of a population of large and electron-dense filament-filled endosomes. Electrophysiological recording of neuromuscular transmission revealed reduced transmission from motor neurons to muscles. Together, these results suggest a potential direct or indirect role of human FUS in the organization of synaptic vesicles, and reduced transmission from motor neurons to muscles.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/860478v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Relations between task elements often follow hidden underlying structural forms such as periodicities or hierarchies, whose inferences fosters performance. However, transferring structural knowledge to novel environments requires flexible representations that are generalizable over particularities of the current environment, such as its stimuli and size. We suggest that humans represent structural forms as abstract basis sets and that in novel tasks, the structural form is inferred and the relevant basis set is transferred. Using a computational model, we show that such representation allows inference of the underlying structural form, important task states, effective behavioural policies and the existence of unobserved state-trajectories. In two experiments, participants learned three abstract graphs during two successive days. We tested how structural knowledge acquired on Day-1 affected Day-2 performance. In line with our model, participants who had a correct structural prior were able to infer the existence of unobserved state-trajectories and appropriate behavioural policies.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Is confidence in perceptual decisions generated by the same brain processes as decision itself, or does confidence require metacognitive processes following up on the decision? In a masked orientation task with varying stimulus-onset-asynchrony, we used EEG and cognitive modelling to trace the timing of the neural correlates of confidence. Confidence as reported by observers increased with stimulus-onset-asynchrony in correct and to a lesser degree in incorrect trials, a pattern incompatible with established models of confidence. Electrophysiological activity in two different time periods was associated with confidence, namely, 350 - 500 ms after stimulus onset and 250 - 350 ms after the response. Cognitive modelling revealed that only the activity following on the stimulus exhibited the same statistical regularities as confidence, while the statistical pattern of the activity following the response was not compatible with confidence. It is argued that electrophysiological markers of decision confidence and error awareness are at least in parts distinct.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Task rule and choice are reflected by layer-specific processing in rodent auditory cortical microcircuits</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/860064v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The primary auditory cortex (A1) is an essential node in the integrative brain network that encodes the behavioral relevance of acoustic stimuli, predictions, and auditory-guided decision making. Previous studies have revealed task-related information being present at both the single-unit and population activity. However, its realization with respect to the cortical microcircuitry is less well understood. In this study, we used chronic, laminar current source density (CSD) analysis from the A1 of behaving Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) in order to characterize layer-specific, spatiotemporal synaptic population activity. Animals were trained to first detect and subsequently to discriminate two pure tone frequencies in consecutive training phases in a Go/NoGo shuttle-box task. We demonstrate that not only sensory but also task- and choice-related information is represented in the mesoscopic neuronal population code distributed across cortical layers. Based on a single-trial analysis using generalized linear-mixed effect models (GLMM), we found infragranular layers to be involved in auditory-guided action initiation during tone detection. Supragranular layers, particularly, are involved in the coding of choice options during tone discrimination. Further, we found that the overall columnar synaptic network activity represents the accuracy of the opted choice. Our study thereby suggests a multiplexed representation of stimulus features in dependence of the task, action selection, and the behavioral options of the animal in preparation of correct choices. The findings expand our understanding of how individual layers contribute to the integrative circuit of the A1 in order to code task-relevant information and guide sensory-based decision making.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: An Adaptive Cue Selection Model of Allocentric Spatial Reorientation</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/860031v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>After becoming disoriented, an organism must use the local environment to reorient and recover vectors to important locations. Debates over how this happens have been extensive. A new theory, Adaptive Combination, suggests that the information from different spatial cues are combined with Bayesian efficiency. To test this further, we modified the standard reorientation paradigm to be more amenable to Bayesian cue combination analyses while still requiring reorientation, still requiring participants to recall goal locations from memory, and focusing on situations that require the use of the allocentric (world-based; not egocentric) frame. 12 adults and 20 children at 5-7 years old were asked to recall locations in a virtual environment after a disorientation. They could use either a pair of landmarks at the North and South, a pair at the East and West, or both. Results were not consistent with Adaptive Combination. Instead, they are consistent with the use of the most useful (nearest) single landmark in isolation. We term this Adaptive Selection. Experiment 2 suggests that adults also use the Adaptive Selection method when they are not disoriented but still required to use a local allocentric frame. This suggests that the process of recalling a location in the allocentric frame is typically guided by the single most useful landmark, rather than a Bayesian combination of landmarks -- regardless of whether the use of the allocentric frame is forced by disorientation or another method. These failures to benefit from a Bayesian strategy accord with the broad idea that there are important limits to Bayesian theories of the cognition, particularly for complex tasks such as allocentric recall.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/860007v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Sequence variants of the microglial expressed TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2) are a major risk factor for late onset Alzheimer's disease. TREM2 requires a stable interaction with DAP12 in the membrane to initiate signaling, which is terminated by TREM2 ectodomain shedding and subsequent intramembrane cleavage by {gamma}-secretase. To understand the structural basis for the specificity of the intramembrane cleavage event, we determined the solution structure of the TREM2 transmembrane helix (TMH). Due to the presence of a charged amino acid in the membrane region the TREM2-TMH adopts a kinked structure with increased flexibility. Charge removal leads to TMH stabilization and reduced dynamics, similar to its structure in complex with DAP12. Strikingly, these dynamical features perfectly correlate with the site of the initial {gamma}-secretase cleavage event. These data suggest an unprecedented cleavage mechanism by {gamma}-secretase where flexible TMH regions are identified to initiate substrate cleavage.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/859942v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Socially-relevant signals benefit from prioritized processing, from initial orientation to behavioral choice elaboration. Yet it remains unclear whether such prioritized processing engages specific or similar neural computations as the processing of non-social cues during decision-making. To address this question, we developed a novel behavioral paradigm in which participants performed two different detection tasks on the same, two-dimensional visual stimuli. We presented morphed facial displays of emotion (from neutral to angry) on top of a morphed colored background (from grey to violet). Participants were asked to report the presence or absence of either emotion (anger) or color (violet) in the stimulus, while ignoring the other task-irrelevant dimension. Importantly, we equalized detection sensitivity across dimensions using an adaptive titration procedure. Computational modeling of electroencephalographic (EEG) activity revealed that emotion cues benefit from a prioritized neural coding in action-selective brain regions. First, premotor EEG activity scales with the amount of perceptual evidence earlier, around 150ms, when the decision concerns emotion rather than color. Second, participant choice was decoded earlier during emotion (260ms) than color decisions in band-limited EEG power in the same premotor regions. Third, these two effects varied across participants as a function of their social anxiety. Together, these findings indicate a selective, prioritized neural representation of socially-relevant signals in motor preparation regions during perceptual decision-making.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/859843v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>There is still an unmet need of mapping the potential impairment of cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) in episodic migraineurs in the interictal state. We mapped CVR of 6 episodic migraineurs and 5 headache-free controls (HC) with blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) under carbon dioxide (CO2) challenge of 30-second epochs with an elevated end-tidal partial pressure of CO2 (PETCO2) by 4-8mmHg. Three migraineurs have migraine without aura (MOA) and the other three have migraine with aura (MA). We found that only MOA subjects showed a reduced or negative BOLD response to CO2 at the red nucleus. All 3 MOA subjects were characterized by bilateral posterior communicating artery hypoplasia (bPCAH) identified by MR angiography (MRA). MOA and HC subjects did not show any significant difference in BOLD responses to CO2 challenge in cortical and white matter while MA subjects showed poor positive association between BOLD responses and PETCO2 in large territories of the cortex and white matter tracts. The combined use of fMRI under CO2 challenge and MRA presented a unique approach to investigate the mechanisms of episodic migraine in the interictal state demonstrating for the first time negative CVR at the red nucleus of the midbrain in patients with MOA. CVR maps obtained from both the midbrain and cortical regions provided various signatures to explore the differences between migraineurs and HC and between MOA and MA.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Slow and fast cortical dynamics distinguish motor planning and execution</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/857300v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The smooth conduction of movements requires simultaneous motor planning and execution according to internal goals. So far it is not known how such movement plans can be modified without being distorted by ongoing movements. Previous studies have isolated planning and execution related neuronal activity by separating behavioral planning and movement periods in time by sensory cues. Here, we introduced two novel tasks in which motor planning developed intrinsically. We separated this continuous self-paced motor planning statistically from motor execution by experimentally minimizing the repetitiveness of the movements. Thereby, we found that in the rat sensorimotor cortex, neuronal motor planning processes evolved with slower dynamics than movement related responses both on a sorted unit and population level. The fast evolving neuronal activity preceded skilled forelimb movements while it coincided with movements in a locomotor task. We captured this fast evolving movement related activity via a high-pass filter approach. As biological mechanism underlying such a high pass filtering we suggest neuronal adaption. The differences in dynamics combined with a high pass filtering mechanism represents a simple principle for concurrent motor planning and execution in which planning will result in relatively slow dynamics that will not produce movements.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/855916v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Importance: Microstructural alterations in cortico-subcortical connections are thought to be present in Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). However, prior studies have yielded inconsistent findings, perhaps because small sample sizes provided insufficient power to detect subtle abnormalities. Objective: To investigate microstructural white matter alterations and their relation to clinical features in the largest dataset of adult and pediatric OCD to date. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional case control magnetic resonance study, we investigated diffusion tensor imaging metrics from 700 adult patients and 645 adult controls, as well as 174 pediatric patients and 144 pediatric controls across 19 sites participating in the ENIGMA-OCD Working Group. Main Outcomes and Measures: We extracted measures of fractional anisotropy (FA) as main outcome, and mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity as secondary outcomes for 25 white matter regions. We meta-analyzed patient control group differences (Cohens d) across sites, after adjusting for age and sex, and investigated associations with clinical characteristics. Results: Adult OCD patients showed significant FA reduction in the sagittal stratum (d=-0.21, z=-3.21, p=0.001) and posterior thalamic radiation (d=-0.26, z=-4.57, p&amp;lt;0.0001). In the sagittal stratum only, lower FA was associated with a younger age of onset (z=2.71, p=0.006), longer duration of illness (z=-2.086, p=0.036) and a higher percentage of medicated patients in the cohorts studied (z=-1.98, p=0.047). No significant association with symptom severity was found. Pediatric OCD patients did not show any detectable microstructural abnormalities compared to matched controls. Conclusions and Relevance: Microstructural alterations in projection and association fibers to posterior brain regions were found in adult OCD, and related to disease course and medication status. Such results are relevant to models positing deficits in connectivity as a crucial mechanism in OCD.</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Self‐Reported Head Trauma Predicts Poor Dual Task Gait in Retired National Football League Players</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25638?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptomatic head trauma associated with American‐style football (ASF) has been linked to brain pathology, along with physical and mental distress in later life. However, the longer‐term effects of such trauma on objective metrics of cognitive–motor function remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that ASF‐related symptomatic head trauma would predict worse gait performance, particularly during dual task conditions (ie, walking while performing an additional cognitive task), in later life.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixty‐six retired professional ASF players aged 29 to 75 years completed a health and wellness questionnaire. They also completed a validated smartphone‐based assessment in their own homes, during which gait was monitored while they walked normally and while they performed a verbalized serial‐subtraction cognitive task.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants who reported more symptomatic head trauma, defined as the total number of impacts to the head or neck followed by concussion‐related symptoms, exhibited greater dual task cost (ie, percentage increase) to stride time variability (ie, the coefficient of variation of mean stride time). Those who reported ≥1 hit followed by loss of consciousness, compared to those who did not, also exhibited greater dual task costs to this metric. Relationships between reported trauma and dual task costs were independent of age, body mass index, National Football League career duration, and history of musculoskeletal surgery. Symptomatic head trauma was not correlated with average stride times in either walking condition.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remote, smartphone‐based assessments of dual task walking may be utilized to capture meaningful data sensitive to the long‐term impact of symptomatic head trauma in former professional ASF players and other contact sport athletes. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Safety and Efficacy of Otaplimastat in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke Requiring tPA (SAFE‐TPA): A Multicenter, Randomized, Double‐Blind, Placebo‐Controlled Phase 2 Study</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25644?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otaplimastat is a neuroprotectant that inhibits matrix metalloprotease pathway, and reduces edema and intracerebral hemorrhage induced by recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) in animal stroke models. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of otaplimastat in patients receiving rtPA.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a phase 2, 2‐part, multicenter trial in stroke patients (19–80 years old) receiving rtPA. Intravenous otaplimastat was administered &amp;lt;30 minutes after rtPA. Stage 1 was a single‐arm, open‐label safety study in 11 patients. Otaplimastat 80 mg was administered twice daily for 3 days. Stage 2 was a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study involving 69 patients, assigned (1:1:1) to otaplimastat 40 mg, otaplimastat 80 mg, or a placebo. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of parenchymal hematoma (PH) on day 1. Secondary endpoints included serious adverse events (SAEs), mortality, and modified Rankin scale (mRS) distribution at 90 days (&lt;a href=&quot;http://clinicaltrials.gov&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;clinicaltrials.gov&lt;/a&gt; identifier: NCT02787278).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No safety issues were encountered in stage 1. The incidence of PH during stage 2 was comparable: 0 of 22 with the placebo, 0 of 22 with otaplimastat 40 mg, and 1 of 21 with the 80 mg dose. No differences in SAEs (13%, 17%, 14%) or death (8.3%, 4.2%, 4.8%) were observed among the 3 groups. Three adverse events (chills, muscle rigidity, hepatotoxicity) were judged to be related to otaplimastat.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intravenous otaplimastat adjunctive therapy in patients receiving rtPA is feasible and generally safe. The functional efficacy of otaplimastat needs to be investigated with further large trials. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Small-Molecule Lysophosphatidic Acid Receptor 5 (LPAR5) Antagonists: Versatile Pharmacological Tools to Regulate Inflammatory Signaling in BV-2 Microglia Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00531</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) species in the extracellular environment induce downstream signaling via six different G protein-coupled receptors (LPAR1–6). These signaling cascades are essential for normal brain development and function of the nervous system. However, in response to acute or chronic central nervous system (CNS) damage, LPA levels increase and aberrant signaling events can counteract brain function. Under neuro-inflammatory conditions signaling along the LPA/LPAR5 axis induces a potentially neurotoxic microglia phenotype indicating the need for new pharmacological intervention strategies. Therefore, we compared the effects of two novel small-molecule LPAR5 antagonists on LPA-induced polarization parameters of the BV-2 microglia cell line. AS2717638 is a selective piperidine-based LPAR5 antagonist (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 0.038 μM) while compound 3 is a diphenylpyrazole derivative with an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; concentration of 0.7 μM in BV-2 cells. Both antagonists compromised cell viability, however, at concentrations above their IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations. Both inhibitors blunted LPA-induced phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3, p65, and c-Jun and consequently reduced the secretion of pro-inflammatory cyto-/chemokines (IL-6, TNFα, IL-1β, CXCL10, CXCL2, and CCL5) at non-toxic concentrations. Both compounds modulated the expression of intracellular (COX-2 and Arg1) and plasma membrane-located (CD40, CD86, and CD206) polarization markers yet only AS2717638 attenuated the neurotoxic potential of LPA-activated BV-2 cell-conditioned medium towards CATH.a neurons. Our findings from the present in vitro study suggest that the two LPAR5 antagonists represent valuable pharmacological tools to interfere with LPA-induced pro-inflammatory signaling cascades in microglia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Alpha Isoform of Heat Shock Protein 90 and the Co-chaperones p23 and Cdc37 Promote Opioid Anti-nociception in the Brain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00294</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Opioid activation of the mu opioid receptor (MOR) promotes signaling cascades that evoke both analgesic responses to pain and side effects like addiction and dependence. Manipulation of these cascades, such as by biased agonism, has great promise to improve opioid therapy. However, the signaling cascades of the MOR are in general poorly understood, providing few targets for drug development. In our earlier work, we identified Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) as a novel and crucial regulator of opioid anti-nociception in the brain by promoting ERK MAPK activation. In this study, we sought to identify the molecular isoforms and co-chaperones by which Hsp90 carried out this role, which could provide specific targets for future clinical intervention. We used novel selective small molecule inhibitors as well as CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing constructs delivered by the intracerebroventricular (icv) route to the brains of adult CD-1 mice to target Hsp90 isoforms (Hsp90α/β, Grp94) and co-chaperones (p23, Cdc37, Aha1). We found that inhibition of the isoform Hsp90α fully blocked morphine anti-nociception in a model of post-surgical paw incision pain, while blocking ERK and JNK MAPK activation, suggesting Hsp90α as the main regulator of opioid response in the brain. We further found that inhibition of the co-chaperones p23 and Cdc37 blocked morphine anti-nociception, suggesting that these co-chaperones assist Hsp90α in promoting opioid anti-nociception. Lastly, we used cycloheximide treatment in the brain to demonstrate that rapid protein translation within 30 min of opioid treatment is required for Hsp90 regulation of opioid response. Together these studies provide insight into the molecular mechanisms by which Hsp90 promotes opioid anti-nociception. These findings thus both improve our basic science knowledge of MOR signal transduction and could provide future targets for clinical intervention to improve opioid therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Amphetamine and the Smart Drug 3,4-Methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) Induce Generalization of Fear Memory in Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00292</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human studies have consistently shown that drugs of abuse affect memory function. The psychostimulants amphetamine and the “bath salt” 3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) increase brain monoamine levels through a similar, yet not identical, mechanism of action. Findings indicate that amphetamine enhances the consolidation of memory for emotional experiences, but still MDPV effects on memory function are underinvestigated. Here, we tested the effects induced by these two drugs on generalization of fear memory and their relative neurobiological underpinnings. To this aim, we used a modified version of the classical inhibitory avoidance task, termed inhibitory avoidance discrimination task. According to such procedure, adult male Sprague–Dawley rats were first exposed to one inhibitory avoidance apparatus and, with a 1-min delay, to a second apparatus where they received an inescapable footshock. Forty-eight hours later, retention latencies were tested, in a randomized order, in the two training apparatuses as well as in a novel contextually modified apparatus to assess both strength and generalization of memory. Our results indicated that both amphetamine and MDPV induced generalization of fear memory, whereas only amphetamine enhanced memory strength. Co-administration of the β-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol prevented the effects of both amphetamine and MDPV on the strength and generalization of memory. The dopaminergic receptor blocker cis-flupenthixol selectively reversed the amphetamine effect on memory generalization. These findings indicate that amphetamine and MDPV induce generalization of fear memory through different modulations of noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Expression Profile and Potential Functions of Circulating Long Noncoding RNAs in Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Southern Chinese Han Population</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00290</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been confirmed to be associated with ischemic stroke (IS); however, their involvement still needs to be extensively explored. Therefore, we aimed to study the expression profile of lncRNAs and the potential roles and mechanisms of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in the Southern Chinese Han population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: In this study, lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles in AIS were analyzed using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and validated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment and network analyses were performed to predict the functions and interactions of the aberrantly expressed genes. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic value of lncRNAs in AIS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: RNA-Seq analysis showed that 428 lncRNAs and 957 mRNAs were significantly upregulated, while 791 lncRNAs and 4,263 mRNAs were downregulated in patients with AIS when compared with healthy controls. GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses of differentially expressed genes showed that the apoptosis, inflammatory, oxidative and calcium signaling pathways were potentially implicated in AIS pathology. The PCR results showed that the selected lncRNA-C14orf64 and lncRNA-AC136007.2 were significantly downregulated in AIS. ROC curve analysis showed that the area under the ROC curve (AUC) values of lncRNA-C14orf64 and lncRNA-AC136007.2 between AIS and healthy controls were 0.74 and 0.94, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This study provides evidence of altered expression of lncRNAs and their potential functions in AIS. Our findings may facilitate pathological mechanistic studies of lncRNAs in AIS and provide potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AIS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01273</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are among the most prevalent chronic diseases affecting the aging population. Extensive research evidence indicates that T2D is a well-established risk factor for AD; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this association have not been fully elucidated. Furthermore, how T2D may contribute to the progression of AD is a subject of extensive investigation. In this study, we compared the blood transcriptome of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD, and advanced AD to those afflicted with T2D to unveil shared and unique pathways and potential therapeutic targets. Blood transcriptomic analyses revealed a positive correlation between gene expression profiles of MCI, AD, and T2D in seven independent microarrays. Interestingly, gene expression profiles from women with advanced AD correlated negatively with T2D, suggesting sex-specific differences in T2D as a risk factor for AD. Network and pathway analysis revealed that shared molecular networks between MCI and T2D were predominantly enriched in inflammation and infectious diseases whereas those networks shared between overt AD and T2D were involved in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase B/Akt (PI3K-AKT) signaling pathway, a major mediator of insulin signaling in the body. The PI3K-AKT signaling pathway became more significantly dysregulated in the advanced AD and T2D shared network. Furthermore, endocrine resistance and atherosclerosis pathways emerged as dysregulated pathways in the advanced AD and T2D shared network. Interestingly, network analysis of shared differentially expressed genes between children with T2D and MCI subjects identified forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) as a central transcriptional regulator, suggesting that it may be a potential therapeutic target for early intervention in AD. Collectively, these results suggest that T2D may be implicated at different stages of AD through different molecular pathways disrupted during the preclinical phase of AD and more advanced stages of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: Large-Scale Simulation of a Layered Cortical Sheet of Spiking Network Model Using a Tile Partitioning Method</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00071</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;One of the grand challenges for computational neuroscience and high-performance computing is computer simulation of a human-scale whole brain model with spiking neurons and synaptic plasticity using supercomputers. To achieve such a simulation, the target network model must be partitioned onto a number of computational nodes, and the sub-network models are executed in parallel while communicating spike information across different nodes. However, it remains unclear how the target network model should be partitioned for efficient computing on next generation of supercomputers. Specifically, reducing the communication of spike information across compute nodes is essential, because of the relatively slower network performance than processor and memory. From the viewpoint of biological features, the cerebral cortex and cerebellum contain 99% of neurons and synapses and form layered sheet structures. Therefore, an efficient method to split the network should exploit the layered sheet structures. In this study, we indicate that a tile partitioning method leads to efficient communication. To demonstrate it, a simulation software called MONET (Millefeuille-like Organization NEural neTwork simulator) that partitions a network model as described above was developed. The MONET simulator was implemented on the Japanese flagship supercomputer K, which is composed of 82,944 computational nodes. We examined a performance of calculation, communication and memory consumption in the tile partitioning method for a cortical model with realistic anatomical and physiological parameters. The result showed that the tile partitioning method drastically reduced communication data amount by replacing network communication with DRAM access and sharing the communication data with neighboring neurons. We confirmed the scalability and efficiency of the tile partitioning method on up to 63,504 compute nodes of the K computer for the cortical model. In the companion paper by Yamaura et al., the performance for a cerebellar model was examined. These results suggest that the tile partitioning method will have advantage for a human-scale whole-brain simulation on exascale computers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Extracellular Vesicles From Auditory Cells as Nanocarriers for Anti-inflammatory Drugs and Pro-resolving Mediators</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00530</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Drug- and noise-related hearing loss are both associated with inflammatory responses in the inner ear. We propose that intracochlear delivery of a combination of pro-resolving mediators, specialized proteins and lipids that accelerate the return to homeostasis by modifying the immune response rather than by inhibiting inflammation, might have a profound effect on the prevention of sensorineural hearing loss. However, intracochlear delivery of such agents requires a reliable and effective method to convey them, fully active, directly to the target cells. The present study provides evidence that extracellular vesicles (EVs) from auditory HEI-OC1 cells may incorporate significant quantities of anti-inflammatory drugs, pro-resolving mediators and their polyunsaturated fatty acid precursors as cargo, and potentially could work as carriers for their intracochlear delivery. EVs generated by HEI-OC1 cells were divided by size into two fractions, small (≤150 nm diameter) and large (&amp;gt;150 nm diameter), and loaded with aspirin, lipoxin A4, resolvin D1, and the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic, docosahexanoic, and linoleic. Bottom-up proteomics revealed a differential distribution of selected proteins between small and large vesicles. Only 17.4% of these proteins were present in both fractions, whereas 61.5% were unique to smaller vesicles and only 3.7% were exclusively found in the larger ones. Importantly, the pro-resolving protein mediators Annexin A1 and Galectins 1 and 3 were only detected in small vesicles. Lipidomic studies, on the other hand, showed that small vesicles contained higher levels of eicosanoids than large ones and, although all of them incorporated the drugs and molecules investigated, small vesicles were more efficiently loaded with PUFA and the large ones with aspirin, LXA4 and resolvin D1. Importantly, our data indicate that the vesicles contain all necessary enzymatic components for the de novo generation of eicosanoids from fatty acid precursors, including pro-inflammatory agents, suggesting that their cargo should be carefully tailored to avoid interference with their therapeutic purpose. Altogether, these results support the idea that both small and large EVs from auditory HEI-OC1 cells could be used as nanocarriers for anti-inflammatory drugs and pro-resolving mediators.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Neuroligin 3 Regulates Dendritic Outgrowth by Modulating Akt/mTOR Signaling</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00518</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuroligins (NLs) are a group of postsynaptic cell adhesion molecules that function in synaptogenesis and synaptic transmission. Genetic defects in neuroligin 3 (NL3), a member of the NL protein family, are associated with autism. Studies in rodents have revealed that mutations of NL3 gene lead to increased growth and complexity in dendrites in the central nervous system. However, the detailed mechanism is still unclear. In our study, we found that deficiency of NL3 led to morphological changes of the pyramidal neurons in layer II/III somatosensory cortex in mice, including enlarged somata, elongated dendritic length, and increased dendritic complexity. Knockdown of NL3 in cultured rat neurons upregulated Akt/mTOR signaling, resulting in both increased protein synthesis and dendritic growth. Treating neurons with either rapamycin to inhibit the mTOR or LY294002 to inhibit the PI3K/Akt activity rescued the morphological abnormalities resulting from either NL3 knockdown or knockout (KO). In addition, we found that the hyperactivated Akt/mTOR signaling associated with NL3 defects was mediated by a reduction in phosphatase and tensin (PTEN) expression, and that MAGI-2, a scaffold protein, interacted with both NL3 and PTEN and could be a linker between NL3 and Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. In conclusion, our results suggest that NL3 regulates neuronal morphology, especially dendritic outgrowth, by modulating the PTEN/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, probably via MAGI-2. Thereby, this study provides a new link between NL3 and neuronal morphology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;The incidence of symptomatic chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is increasing in Chinese aging population, but its clinical and demographic knowledge is still lacking. This study sought to outline the clinical and demographic data of CSDH patients from two medical centers in Tianjin and Chongqing to provide a better understanding for CSDH treatment in China.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Age, sex, etiologies, conscious level on admission, treatment strategies, outcome at discharge, recurrence, and concomitant disease of enrolled patients were recorded. The data were further analyzed after the patients were sub-grouped into young/middle (less than 60 years old) and old (over than 60 years old) age groups.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;A total of 1281 CSDH patients were enrolled. Of these, 85.01% were male and 51.91% were aged between 60 and 80 years. 57.61% patients encountered head trauma before diagnosing CSDH. The top three clinical symptoms at admission were headache (58.55%), dyskinesia (36.92%), and dizziness (33.96%). Headache as well as dizziness often happened in young/middle age group, while dyskinesia often occurred in the old age group. The most common concomitant diseases were cardio-cerebrovascular system diseases (41.14%). The concomitant respiratory diseases in aged patients led to unfavorable outcomes (p = 0.049, OR:0.357). The prognosis of old age subgroup receiving conservative treatment was better than those who received burr-hole drainage treatment (p &amp;lt; 0.015, OR:4.091).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;CSDH mostly occurs in aged and male population with a history a head trauma. The respiratory disease often results in unfavorable outcomes in aged patients. Conservative treatment might benefit some patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/51184</link>
	<content:encoded>Both visual and auditory spatial selective attention result in lateralized alpha (8-14 Hz) oscillatory power in parietal cortex: alpha increases in the hemisphere ipsilateral to attentional focus. Brain stimulation studies suggest a causal relationship between parietal alpha and suppression of the representation of contralateral visual space. However, there is no evidence that parietal alpha controls auditory spatial attention. Here, we performed high definition transcranial alternating current stimulation (HD-tACS) on human subjects performing an auditory task in which they directed attention based on either spatial or nonspatial features. Alpha (10 Hz) but not theta (6 Hz) HD-tACS of right parietal cortex interfered with attending left but not right auditory space. Parietal stimulation had no effect for nonspatial auditory attention. Moreover, performance in post-stimulation trials returned rapidly to baseline. These results demonstrate a causal, frequency-, hemispheric-, and task-specific effect of parietal alpha brain stimulation on top-down control of auditory spatial attention.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/50333</link>
	<content:encoded>Human Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains and transgenic AD mouse models manifest hyperexcitability. This aberrant electrical activity is caused by synaptic dysfunction that represents the major pathophysiological correlate of cognitive decline. However, the underlying mechanism for this excessive excitability remains incompletely understood. To investigate the basis for the hyperactivity, we performed electrophysiological and immunofluorescence studies on hiPSC-derived cerebrocortical neuronal cultures and cerebral organoids bearing AD-related mutations in presenilin 1 or amyloid precursor protein vs. isogenic gene corrected controls. In the AD hiPSC-derived neurons/organoids, we found increased excitatory bursting activity, which could be explained in part by a decrease in neurite length. AD hiPSC-derived neurons also displayed increased sodium current density and increased excitatory and decreased inhibitory synaptic activity. Our findings establish hiPSC-derived AD neuronal cultures and organoids as a relevant model of early AD pathophysiology and provide mechanistic insight into the observed hyperexcitability.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/49562</link>
	<content:encoded>Massed synchronised neuronal firing is detrimental to information processing. When networks of task-irrelevant neurons fire in unison, they mask the signal generated by task-critical neurons. On a macroscopic level, such synchronisation can contribute to alpha/beta (8-30Hz) oscillations. Reducing the amplitude of these oscillations, therefore, may enhance information processing. Here, we test this hypothesis. Twenty-one participants completed an associative memory task while undergoing simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings. Using representational similarity analysis, we quantified the amount of stimulus-specific information represented within the BOLD signal on every trial. When correlating this metric with concurrently-recorded alpha/beta power, we found a significant negative correlation which indicated that as post-stimulus alpha/beta power decreased, stimulus-specific information increased. Critically, we found this effect in three unique tasks: visual perception, auditory perception, and visual memory retrieval, indicating that this phenomenon transcends both stimulus modality and cognitive task. These results indicate that alpha/beta power decreases parametrically track the fidelity of both externally-presented and internally-generated stimulus-specific information represented within the cortex.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The homeostasis of heart and other organs relies on the appropriate provision of nutrients and functional specialization of the local vasculature. Here, we have used mouse genetics, imaging and cell biology approaches to investigate how homeostasis in the adult heart is controlled by endothelial EphB4 and its ligand ephrin-B2, which are known regulators of vascular morphogenesis and arteriovenous differentiation during development. We show that inducible and endothelial cell-specific inactivation of &lt;i&gt;Ephb4&lt;/i&gt; in adult mice is compatible with survival, but leads to rupturing of cardiac capillaries, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and pathological cardiac remodeling. In contrast, EphB4 is not required for integrity and homeostasis of capillaries in skeletal muscle. Our analysis of mutant mice and cultured endothelial cells shows that EphB4 controls the function of caveolae, cell-cell adhesion under mechanical stress and lipid transport. We propose that EphB4 maintains critical functional properties of the adult cardiac vasculature and thereby prevents dilated cardiomyopathy-like defects.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Estimating brain age from structural MRI and MEG data: Insights from dimensionality reduction techniques</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/859660v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Brain age prediction studies measure the difference between the chronological age of an individual and their predicted age based on neuroimaging data, which has been proposed as an informative measure of disease and cognitive decline. As most previous studies relied exclusively on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, we hereby investigate whether combining structural MRI with functional magnetoencephalography (MEG) information improves age prediction using a large cohort of healthy subjects (N=613, age 18-88) from the Cam-CAN. To this end, we examined the performance of dimensionality reduction and multivariate associative techniques, namely Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), to tackle the high dimensionality of neuroimaging data. Using MEG features yielded worse performance when compared to using MRI features, but the combination of both feature sets slightly improved age prediction (mean absolute error of 5.28 yrs). Furthermore, we found that PCA resulted in worse performance, whereas CCA in conjunction with Gaussian process regression models yielded the best prediction performance. Notably, CCA allowed us to visualize the features that significantly contributed to age prediction. We found that MRI features from subcortical structures were more reliable age predictors than cortical features, and that spectral MEG measures were more reliable than connectivity metrics. Our results provide an insight into the underlying processes that are indicative of brain aging, thereby advancing the discovery of valuable biomarkers of neurological syndromes that emerge later during the lifespan.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Baseline dopamine predicts individual variation in methylphenidate's effects on cognitive motivation</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/859637v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Contrasting cognitive effects of dopaminergic drugs, for example in low- and high-impulsive individuals, have long been argued to reflect variability in baseline levels of dopamine. Here, we investigated whether individual differences in the effects of methylphenidate on cognitive motivation depend on baseline dopamine synthesis capacity. Fifty healthy participants (25 women) underwent an [18F]DOPA PET scan to quantify baseline dopamine synthesis capacity. They performed an effortful working memory task prior to drug administration and a cognitive effort discounting task after drug administration. To examine the neurochemical specificity to dopamine, effects of methylphenidate were compared with those of the selective dopamine D2 receptor antagonist sulpiride. Participants also completed a questionnaire to assess trait impulsivity. Methylphenidate increased cognitive motivation to a greater extent in people with high baseline midbrain dopamine synthesis capacity than in people with low baseline midbrain dopamine. Parallel effects were observed as a function of trait impulsivity, with high-impulsive participants exhibiting greater motivational enhancing effects than low-impulsive participants. This effect was fully mediated by baseline dopamine. There were no significant effects of sulpiride. This study provides a link between motivational enhancement by methylphenidate, baseline dopamine and trait impulsivity, thereby advancing the biological understanding of individual variation in the effects of methylphenidate.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: SUSD4 Controls Activity-Dependent Degradation of AMPA Receptor GLUA2 and Synaptic Plasticity</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/859587v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>At excitatory synapses, the choice between recycling or degradation of glutamate AMPA receptors controls the direction of synaptic plasticity. In this context, how the degradation machinery is targeted to specific synaptic substrates in an activity-dependent manner is not understood. Here we show that SUSD4, a complement-related transmembrane protein, is a tether for HECT ubiquitin ligases of the NEDD4 subfamily, which promote the degradation of a large number of cellular substrates. SUSD4 is expressed by many neuronal populations starting at the time of synapse formation. Loss-of-function of Susd4 in the mouse prevents activity-dependent degradation of the GLUA2 AMPA receptor subunit and long-term depression at cerebellar synapses, and leads to impairment in motor coordination adaptation and learning. SUSD4 could thus act as an adaptor targeting NEDD4 ubiquitin ligases to AMPA receptors during long-term synaptic plasticity. These findings shed light on the potential contribution of SUSD4 mutations to the etiology of neurodevelopmental diseases.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Revisiting the Global Workspace: Orchestration of the functional hierarchical organisation of the human brain</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/859579v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>A central, unsolved challenge in neuroscience is how the brain orchestrates function by organising the flow of information necessary for the underlying computation. It has been argued that this whole-brain orchestration is carried out by a core subset of integrative brain regions, commonly referred to as the 'global workspace', although quantifying the constitutive brain regions has proven elusive. We developed a normalised directed transfer entropy (NDTE) framework for determining the pairwise bidirectional causal flow between brain regions and applied it to multimodal whole-brain neuroimaging from over 1000 healthy participants. We established the full brain hierarchy and common regions in a 'functional rich club' (FRIC) coordinating the functional hierarchical organisation during rest and task. FRIC contains the core set of regions, which similar to a 'club' of functional hubs are characterized by a tendency to be more densely functionally connected among themselves than to the rest of brain regions from where they integrate information. The invariant global workspace is the intersection of FRICs across rest and seven tasks, and was found to consist of the precuneus, posterior and isthmus cingulate cortices, nucleus accumbens, putamen, hippocampus and amygdala that orchestrate the functional hierarchical organisation based on information from perceptual, long-term memory, evaluative and attentional systems. We confirmed the causal significance and robustness of this invariant global workspace by systematically lesioning a generative whole-brain model accurately simulating the functional hierarchy defined by NDTE. Overall, this is a major step forward in understanding the complex choreography of information flow within the functional hierarchical organisation of the human brain.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Multi-parametric quantitative spinal cord MRI with unified signal readout and image denoising</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/859538v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Multi-parametric quantitative MRI (qMRI) of the spinal cord is a promising non-invasive tool to probe early microstructural damage in neurological disorders. It is usually performed by combining acquisitions with multiple signal readouts, which exhibit different thermal noise levels, geometrical distortions and susceptibility to physiological noise. This ultimately hinders joint multi-contrast modelling and makes the geometric correspondence of parametric maps challenging. We propose an approach to overcome these limitations, by implementing state-of-the-art microstructural MRI of the spinal cord with a unified signal readout. We base our acquisition on single-shot echo planar imaging with reduced field-of-view, and obtain data from two different vendors (vendor 1: Philips Achieva; vendor 2: Siemens Prisma). Importantly, the unified acquisition allows us to compare signal and noise across contrasts, thus enabling overall quality enhancement via Marchenko-Pastur (MP) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) denoising. MP-PCA is a recent method relying on redundant acquisitions, i.e. such that the number of measurements is much larger than the number of informative principal components. Here we used in vivo and synthetic data to test whether a unified readout enables more efficient denoising of less redundant acquisitions, since these can be denoised jointly with more redundant ones. We demonstrate that a unified readout provides robust multi-parametric maps, including diffusion and kurtosis tensors from diffusion MRI, myelin metrics from two-pool magnetisation transfer, and T1 and T2 from relaxometry. Moreover, we show that MP-PCA improves the quality of our multi-contrast acquisitions, since it reduces the coefficient of variation (i.e. variability) by up to 15% for mean kurtosis, 8% for bound pool fraction (BPF, myelin-sensitive), and 13% for T1, while enabling more efficient denoising of modalities limited in redundancy (e.g. relaxometry). In conclusion, multi-parametric spinal cord qMRI with unified readout is feasible and provides robust microstructural metrics with matched resolution and distortions, whose quality benefits from MP-PCA denoising, a useful pre-processing tool for spinal cord MRI.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25655?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drug‐resistant seizures are common in patients with Leucine‐rich, glioma‐inactivated‐1 (LGI1) and contactin‐associated‐protein‐like‐2 (CASPR2)‐IgG associated encephalitis. We performed the first randomized double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial to evaluate efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in reducing seizure frequency.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our enrollment goal was 30 LGI1/CASPR2‐IgG‐seropositive adult patients with ≥2 seizures per‐week. Patients were randomized to receive IVIG (0.5g/kg day‐1, 1g/kg day‐2, 0.6g/kg week 3 and 5) or volume‐matched intravenous normal saline. Following the blinded‐phase, the non‐responders in the placebo group received IVIG. The primary clinical outcome was 50% reduction in seizure frequency from baseline to 5 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After enrollment of 17 patients (LGI1‐IgG, 14; CASPR2‐IgG, 3) over 34 months the study was terminated due to slow enrollment. Six of eight patients in the IVIG group were responders compared to two of nine in the placebo group (p=0.044, OR 10.5, 95% CI 1.1 to 98.9). For the LGI1‐IgG seropositive subgroup: 6 of 8 patients in the IVIG group were responders, compared to zero of 6 in the placebo group. Two LGI1‐IgG seropositive patients receiving IVIG, but none receiving placebo, were seizure free at the end of the blinded‐phase. Four of the six patients entering the open‐label IVIG arm reported ≥50% reduction in seizure frequency. There were no correlations with LGI1/CASPR2‐IgG1‐4 subclasses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpreation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Superiority of IVIG to placebo reached statistical significance for the primary end‐point for all patients and the subset with LGI1‐IgG. These results have to be interpreted with the caveat that the study did not reach its originally selected sample size.&lt;/p&gt;

development of digital biomarkers for dementia progress detection and
monitoring. We present a behavioral data collection concept for a subsequent
AI-based application together with a range of regression encouraging results of
Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores in the leave-one-subject-out

subject's emotional valence and arousal recognition responses, as well as
reaction times, together with self-reported education levels and ages, obtained
from a group of twenty older adults taking part in the reported data collection

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the design of artificially sentient robots, an obstacle always has been
that conventional computers cannot really process information in parallel,
whereas the human affective system is capable of producing experiences of
emotional concurrency (e.g., happy and sad). Another schism that has been in
the way is the persistent Cartesian divide between cognition and affect,
whereas people easily can reflect on their emotions or have feelings about a
thought. As an essentially theoretical exercise, we posit that quantum physics
at the basis of neurology explains observations in cognitive emotion psychology
from the belief that the construct of reality is partially imagined (Im) in the
complex coordinate space C^3. We propose a quantum computational account to
mixed states of reflection and affect, while transforming known psychological
dimensions into the actual quantum dynamics of electromotive forces. As a
precursor to actual simulations, we show examples of possible robot behaviors,
using Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen circuits. Keywords: emotion, reflection,
modelling, quantum computing

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Effects of spatial smoothing on group-level differences in functional brain networks. (arXiv:1911.12124v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12124</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain connectivity with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a
popular approach for detecting differences between healthy and clinical
populations. Before creating a functional brain network, the fMRI time series
must undergo several preprocessing steps to control for artifacts and to
improve data quality. However, preprocessing may affect the results in an
undesirable way. Spatial smoothing, for example, is known to alter functional
network structure. Yet, its effects on group-level network differences remain
unknown.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we investigate the effects of spatial smoothing on the difference
between patients and controls for two clinical conditions: autism spectrum and
bipolar disorder, considering fMRI data smoothed with Gaussian kernels (0-32
mm).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We find that smoothing affects network differences between groups. For
weighted networks, incrementing the smoothing kernel makes networks more
different until a peak is reached and the networks become more similar. For
thresholded networks, the effects depend on the network density. Smoothing also
alters the effect sizes of the individual link differences. This is independent
of the ROI size, but the effects of link length vary.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effects of spatial smoothing are diverse, non-trivial, and difficult to
predict. This has important consequences: the choice of smoothing kernel
affects the findings in network differences.

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00291</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Anxiety affects the life quality of a significant percentage of autism patients. To understand the possible biological basis of this high anxiety level, we used a valproic acid (VPA) model of autism. Anxiety level is significantly higher in VPA-injected mice, at both P35 and P70. In addition, protein kinase Mζ (PKMζ) level in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is significantly higher in VPA mice at both ages. Consistent with this finding, infusion of a PKMζ-blocking peptide z-pseudosubstrate inhibitory peptide (ZIP) into BLA significantly reduced anxiety levels in VPA mice. Furthermore, viral overexpression of PKMζ in the BLA led to elevated anxiety level in Wild Type (WT) mice, with concomitant higher intrinsic excitability of BLA excitatory neurons. Altogether, our results indicate a key contribution of BLA PKMζ level to anxiety, especially in autism; and this finding may provide a further understanding of the pathogenesis as well as treatment of anxiety symptoms in autism patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The results from epidemiologic studies linking blood folate concentrations, folic acid supplementation, or dietary folate to the risk of preterm birth are inconsistent. In this study, we aimed to summarize the available evidence on these associations. A systematic search of the PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases up to October 20, 2018 was performed and reference lists of retrieved articles were screened. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the highest vs. the lowest levels of folate concentrations, folic acid supplementation, and dietary folate were calculated using random-effects models. Subgroup analyses and univariate meta-regression were performed to explore the sources of heterogeneity. Ten studies (six prospective cohort studies and four case-control studies) were included on folate concentrations, 13 cohort studies were included about folic acid supplementation, and 4 cohort studies were included regarding dietary folate intake. Higher maternal folate levels were associated with a 28% reduction in the risk of preterm birth (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.56–0.93). Higher folic acid supplementation was associated with 10% lower risk of preterm birth (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.85–0.95). In addition, a significant negative association was observed between dietary folate intake and the risk of preterm birth (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.55–0.84), but no significant relation was seen between dietary folate and the risk of spontaneous preterm birth (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.57–1.41). In the subgroup analysis, higher maternal folate levels in the third trimester were associated with a lower risk of preterm birth (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.36–0.94). To initiate taking folic acid supplementation early before conception was adversely associated with preterm birth risk (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83–0.95). In conclusion, higher maternal folate levels and folic acid supplementation were significantly associated with a lower risk of preterm birth. The limited data currently available suggest that dietary folate is associated with a significantly decreased risk of preterm birth.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

We now report that miR-409-5p impairs neurite outgrowth, decreases neuronal viability, and accelerates the progression of Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;–&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;-induced pathologies. In this study, we found that Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;–&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; peptide significantly decreased the expression of miR-409-5p, which was consistent with the expression profile of miR-409-5p in the APP/PS1 mice cortexes. Plek was confirmed to be a potential regulatory target of miR-409-5p by luciferase assay and Western blotting. Overexpression of miR-409-5p has an obvious neurotoxicity in neuronal cell viability and differentiation, whereas Plek overexpression could partially rescue neurite outgrowth from this toxicity. Some cytoskeleton regulatory proteins have been found to be related to AD pathogenesis. Our data show some clues that cytoskeletal reorganization may play roles in AD pathology. The early downregulation of miR-409-5p in AD progression might be a self-protective reaction to alleviate the synaptic damage induced by Aβ, which may be used as a potential early biomarker of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Endovascular treatment of large or giant non-saccular vertebrobasilar aneurysms (VBAs) by conventional stents is difficult and has unsatisfactory outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;Object&lt;p&gt;This study was performed to retrospectively analyze the safety and efficacy of a flow diverter in treating large and giant non-saccular VBAs.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We identified 78 patients with 83 large or giant non-saccular VBAs who accepted endovascular treatment with a pipeline embolization device (PED) or conventional stent from January 2014 to June 2018. The technical details of the procedure, procedure-associated complications, angiographic outcomes, and clinical outcomes were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Forty-two patients (53.8%, 42/78) with 44 aneurysms (53.0%, 44/83) underwent endovascular treatment with PEDs. Thirty-six patients (46.2%, 36/78) with 39 aneurysms (47.0%, 39/83) underwent endovascular treatment with conventional stents. The complication rate of PED group and conventional stent group was 7.1% (3/42) and 5.6% (2/36), respectively (odds ratio, 0.765; 95% confidence interval, 0.121–4.851; P = 0.776). During a median follow-up time of 28.8 months, the complete occlusion rate in the PED group and conventional stent group was 90.2% (37/41) and 70.3% (26/37), respectively (odds ratio, 3.913; 95% confidence interval, 1.122–13.652; P = 0.032).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Endovascular treatment with a PED is a promising and safe modality for large and giant non-saccular VBAs, and the complication rate is acceptable, compared with conventional endovascular treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Microstate Changes Associated With Alzheimer’s Disease in Persons With Down Syndrome</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01251</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Down syndrome (DS) is associated with development of dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, due to considerable heterogeneity in intellectual function among persons with DS, it is difficult to assess whether a person with DS has developed dementia due to AD (DS-AD). EEG spectral power has previously shown very promising results with increased slowing in DS-AD compared to DS. However, another technique called microstates may be used to assess whole-brain dynamics and has to our knowledge not previously been investigated in either DS or DS-AD. The aim of the current study was to assess whether microstates could be used to differentiate between adults with DS, and DS-AD. We included EEGs from 10 persons with DS and 15 persons with DS-AD in the analysis. For the microstate analyses, we calculated four global maps, which were then back-fitted to all the EEGs. Lastly, we extracted the duration, occurrence, and coverage for each of the microstates. Here, we found the four archetypical maps as has previously been reported in the literature. We did not find any significant difference between DS and DS-AD but the largest difference in microstate duration between DS and DS-AD was found in microstate A and D. These findings are in line with structural MR studies showing that both the frontal and temporal lobes are affected in persons with DS-AD. Microstates may potentially serve as a diagnostic marker, but larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) to Improve Gait in Multiple Sclerosis: A Timing Window Comparison</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00420</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Unilateral weakness of the lower limb is a hallmark of multiple sclerosis (MS) and a significant contributor to the progressive worsening of walking ability. There are currently no effective rehabilitation strategies targeting strength asymmetries and/or gait impairments in people with MS (PwMS). Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has improved motor outcomes in various populations, but the effect of tDCS on gait in PwMS and the ideal timing window of tDCS application are still unknown. This study investigated the effects of tDCS, either before or during a 6 min walk test (6MWT), on the distance walked and gait characteristics in PwMS. Twelve participants were recruited and randomly assigned into BEFORE or DURING groups (both n = 6). The BEFORE group received stimulation before performing a 6MWT (sham/2 mA, 13 min). The DURING group received stimulation only during a 6MWT (sham/2 mA, 6 min). Stimulation was over the more MS-affected primary motor cortex (M1). Distance walked and gait characteristics of the walk were the primary and secondary outcomes. The results indicated a significant decrease in distance walked in the DURING group (p = 0.026) and a significant increase in gait velocity in the BEFORE group (p = 0.04). These changes were accompanied by trends (p &amp;lt; 0.1) in distance walked, gait velocity, and stride length. Overall, the results of this study suggest that tDCS performed before a 6MWT might be more effective than tDCS during a 6MWT and that a single session of tDCS may not be sufficient to influence gait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration:www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier #NCT03757819.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/50292</link>
	<content:encoded>Cancer cells often harbor chromosomes in abnormal numbers and with aberrant structure. The consequences of these chromosomal aberrations are difficult to study in cancer, and therefore several model systems have been developed in recent years. We show that human cells with extra chromosome engineered via microcell-mediated chromosome transfer often gain massive chromosomal rearrangements. The rearrangements arose by chromosome shattering and rejoining as well as by replication-dependent mechanisms. We show that the isolated micronuclei lack functional lamin B1 and become prone to envelope rupture, which leads to DNA damage and aberrant replication. The presence of functional lamin B1 partly correlates with micronuclei size, suggesting that the proper assembly of nuclear envelope might be sensitive to membrane curvature. The chromosomal rearrangements in trisomic cells provide growth advantage compared to cells without rearrangements. Our model system enables to study mechanisms of massive chromosomal rearrangements of any chromosome and their consequences in human cells.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/49806</link>
	<content:encoded>The 26S proteasome is essential for proteostasis and the regulation of vital processes through ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated substrates. To accomplish the multi-step degradation process, the proteasome's regulatory particle, consisting of lid and base subcomplexes, undergoes major conformational changes whose origin is unknown. Investigating the &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; proteasome, we found that peripheral interactions between the lid subunit Rpn5 and the base AAA+-ATPase ring are important for stabilizing the substrate-engagement-competent state and coordinating the conformational switch to processing states upon substrate engagement. Disrupting these interactions perturbs the conformational equilibrium and interferes with degradation initiation, while later processing steps remain unaffected. Similar defects in early degradation steps are observed when eliminating hydrolysis in the ATPase subunit Rpt6, whose nucleotide state seems to control proteasome conformational transitions. These results provide important insight into interaction networks that coordinate conformational changes with various stages of degradation, and how modulators of conformational equilibria may influence substrate turnover.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Determinants of combination GM-CSF immunotherapy and oncolytic virotherapy success identified through &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; treatment personalization</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/z-PEZKQFdTc/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Tyler Cassidy, Morgan Craig&lt;/p&gt;

Oncolytic virotherapies, including the modified herpes simplex virus talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC), have shown great promise as potent instigators of anti-tumour immune effects. The OPTiM trial, in particular, demonstrated the superior anti-cancer effects of T-VEC as compared to systemic immunotherapy treatment using exogenous administration of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Theoretically, a combined approach leveraging exogenous cytokine immunotherapy and oncolytic virotherapy would elicit an even greater immune response and improve patient outcomes. However, regimen scheduling of combination immunostimulation and T-VEC therapy has yet to be established. Here, we calibrate a computational biology model of sensitive and resistant tumour cells and immune interactions for implementation into an &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; clinical trial to test and individualize combination immuno- and virotherapy. By personalizing and optimizing combination oncolytic virotherapy and immunostimulatory therapy, we show improved simulated patient outcomes for individuals with late-stage melanoma. More crucially, through evaluation of individualized regimens, we identified determinants of combination GM-CSF and T-VEC therapy that can be translated into clinically-actionable dosing strategies without further personalization. Our results serve as a proof-of-concept for interdisciplinary approaches to determining combination therapy, and suggest promising avenues of investigation towards tailored combination immunotherapy/oncolytic virotherapy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/z-PEZKQFdTc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Altered Recruitment of Motor Cortex Neuronal Activity During the Grasping Phase of Skilled Reaching in a Chronic Rat Model of Unilateral Parkinsonism</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/48/9660?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease causes prominent difficulties in the generation and execution of voluntary limb movements, including regulation of distal muscles and coordination of proximal and distal movement components to achieve accurate grasping. Difficulties with manual dexterity have a major impact on activities of daily living. We used extracellular single neuron recordings to investigate the neural underpinnings of parkinsonian movement deficits in the motor cortex of chronic unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesion male rats performing a skilled reach-to-grasp task the. Both normal movements and parkinsonian deficits in this task have striking homology to human performance. In lesioned animals there were several differences in the activity of cortical neurons during reaches by the affected limb compared with control rats. These included an increase in proportions of neurons showing rate decreases, along with increased amplitude of their average rate-decrease response at specific times during the reach, suggesting a shift in the balance of net excitation and inhibition of cortical neurons; a significant increase in the duration of rate-increase responses, which could result from reduced coupling of cortical activity to specific movement components; and changes in the timing and incidence of neurons with pure rate-increase or biphasic responses, particularly at the end of reach when grasping would normally be occurring. The changes in cortical activity may account for the deficits that occur in skilled distal motor control following dopamine depletion, and highlight the need for treatment strategies targeted toward modulating cortical mechanisms for fine distal motor control in patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We show for the first time in a chronic lesion rat model of Parkinson's disease movement deficits that there are specific changes in motor cortex neuron activity associated with the grasping phase of a skilled motor task. Such changes provide a possible mechanism underpinning the problems with manual dexterity seen in Parkinson's patients and highlight the need for treatment strategies targeted toward distal motor control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sphingosine Kinase 2 Potentiates Amyloid Deposition but Protects against Hippocampal Volume Loss and Demyelination in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/48/9645?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a potent vasculoprotective and neuroprotective signaling lipid, synthesized primarily by sphingosine kinase 2 (SK2) in the brain. We have reported pronounced loss of S1P and SK2 activity early in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, and an inverse correlation between hippocampal S1P levels and age in females, leading us to speculate that loss of S1P is a sensitizing influence for AD. Paradoxically, SK2 was reported to mediate amyloid β (Aβ) formation from amyloid precursor protein (APP) &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. To determine whether loss of S1P sensitizes to Aβ-mediated neurodegeneration, we investigated whether SK2 deficiency worsens pathology and memory in male J20 (PDGFB-APP&lt;sub&gt;SwInd&lt;/sub&gt;) mice. SK2 deficiency greatly reduced Aβ content in J20 mice, associated with significant improvements in epileptiform activity and cross-frequency coupling measured by hippocampal electroencephalography. However, several key measures of APP&lt;sub&gt;SwInd&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent neurodegeneration were enhanced on the SK2-null background, despite reduced Aβ burden. These included hippocampal volume loss, oligodendrocyte attrition and myelin loss, and impaired performance in Y-maze and social novelty memory tests. Inhibition of the endosomal cholesterol exporter NPC1 greatly reduced sphingosine phosphorylation in glial cells, linking loss of SK2 activity and S1P in AD to perturbed endosomal lipid metabolism. Our findings establish SK2 as an important endogenous regulator of both APP processing to Aβ, and oligodendrocyte survival, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. These results urge greater consideration of the roles played by oligodendrocyte dysfunction and altered membrane lipid metabolic flux as drivers of neurodegeneration in AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Genetic, neuropathological, and functional studies implicate both Aβ and altered lipid metabolism and/or signaling as key pathogenic drivers of Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we first demonstrate that the enzyme SK2, which generates the signaling lipid S1P, is required for Aβ formation from APP &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Second, we establish a new role for SK2 in the protection of oligodendrocytes and myelin. Loss of SK2 sensitizes to Aβ-mediated neurodegeneration by attenuating oligodendrocyte survival and promoting hippocampal atrophy, despite reduced Aβ burden. Our findings support a model in which Aβ-independent sensitizing influences such as loss of neuroprotective S1P are more important drivers of neurodegeneration than gross Aβ concentration or plaque density.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Apnea Associated with Brainstem Seizures in Cacna1aS218L Mice Is Caused by Medullary Spreading Depolarization</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/48/9633?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Seizure-related apnea is common and can be lethal. Its mechanisms however remain unclear and preventive strategies are lacking. We postulate that brainstem spreading depolarization (SD), previously associated with lethal seizures in animal models, initiates apnea upon invasion of brainstem respiratory centers. To study this, we assessed effects of brainstem seizures on brainstem function and respiration in male and female mice carrying a homozygous S218L missense mutation that leads to gain-of-function of voltage-gated Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels and high risk for fatal seizures. Recordings of brainstem DC potential and neuronal activity, cardiorespiratory activity and local tissue oxygen were performed in freely behaving animals. Brainstem SD occurred during all spontaneous fatal seizures and, unexpectedly, during a subset of nonfatal seizures. Seizure-related SDs in the ventrolateral medulla correlated with respiratory suppression. Seizures induced by stimulation of the inferior colliculus could evoke SD that spread in a rostrocaudal direction, preceding local tissue hypoxia and apnea, indicating that invasion of SD into medullary respiratory centers initiated apnea and hypoxia rather than &lt;i&gt;vice versa&lt;/i&gt;. Fatal outcome was prevented by timely resuscitation. Moreover, NMDA receptor antagonists MK-801 and memantine prevented seizure-related SD and apnea, which supports brainstem SD as a prerequisite for brainstem seizure-related apnea in this animal model and has translational value for developing strategies that prevent fatal ictal apnea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Apnea during and following seizures is common, but also likely implicated in sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). This underlines the need to understand mechanisms for potentially lethal seizure-related apnea. In the present work we show, in freely behaving SUDEP-prone transgenic mice, that apnea is induced when spontaneous brainstem seizure-related spreading depolarization (SD) reaches respiratory nuclei in the ventrolateral medulla. We show that brainstem seizure-related medullary SD is followed by local hypoxia and recovers during nonfatal seizures, but not during fatal events. NMDA receptor antagonists prevented medullary SD and apnea, which may be of translational value.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Tau Misfolding Efficiently Propagates between Individual Intact Hippocampal Neurons</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/48/9623?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurofibrillary tangles, formed of misfolded, hyperphosphorylated tau protein, are a pathological hallmark of several neurodegenerations, including Alzheimer's disease. Tau pathology spreads between neurons and propagates misfolding in a prion-like manner throughout connected neuronal circuits. Tauopathy is accompanied by significant neuronal death, but the relationships between initial tau misfolding, propagation across connected neurons and cytotoxicity remain unclear. In particular the immediate functional consequence of tau misfolding for the individual neuron is not well understood. Here, using microfluidic devices to recreate discretely organized neuronal connections, we show that the spread and propagation of misfolded tau between individual murine neurons is rapid and efficient; it occurs within days. The neurons containing and propagating tau pathology display selective axonal transport deficits but remain viable and electrically competent. Therefore, we demonstrate that seed-competent misfolded tau species do not acutely cause cell death, but instead initiate discrete cellular dysfunctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Public awareness of progressive neurodegenerations such as dementias associated with aging or repetitive head trauma is rising. Protein misfolding underlies many neurodegenerative diseases including tauopathies, where the misfolded tau protein propagates pathology through connected brain circuits in a prion-like manner. Clinically, these diseases progress over the course of years. Here we show that the underlying protein misfolding propagates rapidly between individual neurons. Presence of misfolded tau is not directly cytotoxic to the neuron; the cells remain viable with limited deficits. This suggests that neurons with tau pathology could be rescued with a therapeutic disease modifier and highlights an under-appreciated time window for such therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: ApoE4 Alters ABCA1 Membrane Trafficking in Astrocytes</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/48/9611?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; 4 allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). ApoE protein aggregation plays a central role in AD pathology, including the accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ). Lipid-poor ApoE4 protein is prone to aggregate and lipidating ApoE4 protects it from aggregation. The mechanisms regulating ApoE4 aggregation &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; are surprisingly not known. ApoE lipidation is controlled by the activity of the ATP binding cassette A1 (ABCA1). ABCA1 recycling and degradation is regulated by ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6). We found that ApoE4 promoted greater expression of ARF6 compared with ApoE3, trapping ABCA1 in late-endosomes and impairing its recycling to the cell membrane. This was associated with lower ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux activity, a greater percentage of lipid-free ApoE particles, and lower Aβ degradation capacity. Human CSF from &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; 4/4 carriers showed a lower ability to induce ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux activity and greater percentage of aggregated ApoE protein compared with CSF from &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; 3/3 carriers. Enhancing ABCA1 activity rescued impaired Aβ degradation in ApoE4-treated cells and reduced both ApoE and ABCA1 aggregation in the hippocampus of male ApoE4-targeted replacement mice. Together, our data demonstrate that aggregated and lipid-poor ApoE4 increases ABCA1 aggregation and decreases ABCA1 cell membrane recycling. Enhancing ABCA1 activity to reduce ApoE and ABCA1 aggregation is a potential therapeutic strategy for the prevention of ApoE4 aggregation-driven pathology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; ApoE protein plays a key role in the formation of amyloid plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). ApoE4 is more aggregated and hypolipidated compared with ApoE3, but whether enhancing ApoE lipidation &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; can reverse ApoE aggregation is not known. ApoE lipidation is controlled by the activity of the ATP binding cassette A1 (ABCA1). In this study, we demonstrated that the greater propensity of lipid-poor ApoE4 to aggregate decreased ABCA1 membrane recycling and its ability to lipidate ApoE. Importantly, enhancing ABCA1 activity to lipidate ApoE reduced ApoE and ABCA1 aggregation. This work provides critical insights into the interactions among ABCA1, ApoE lipidation and aggregation, and underscores the promise of stabilizing ABCA1 activity to prevent ApoE-driven aggregation pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dorsal Hippocampal Actin Polymerization Is Necessary for Activation of G-Protein-Coupled Estrogen Receptor (GPER) to Increase CA1 Dendritic Spine Density and Enhance Memory Consolidation</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/48/9598?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Activation of the membrane estrogen receptor G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) in ovariectomized mice via the GPER agonist G-1 mimics the beneficial effects of 17β-estradiol (E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) on hippocampal CA1 spine density and memory consolidation, yet the cell-signaling mechanisms mediating these effects remain unclear. The present study examined the role of actin polymerization and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation in mediating effects of dorsal hippocampally infused G-1 on CA1 dendritic spine density and consolidation of object recognition and spatial memories in ovariectomized mice. We first showed that object learning increased apical CA1 spine density in the dorsal hippocampus (DH) within 40 min. We then found that DH infusion of G-1 increased both CA1 spine density and phosphorylation of the actin polymerization regulator cofilin, suggesting that activation of GPER may increase spine morphogenesis through actin polymerization. As with memory consolidation in our previous work (Kim et al., 2016), effects of G-1 on CA1 spine density and cofilin phosphorylation depended on JNK phosphorylation in the DH. Also consistent with our previous findings, E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced cofilin phosphorylation was not dependent on GPER activation. Finally, we found that infusion of the actin polymerization inhibitor, latrunculin A, into the DH prevented G-1 from increasing apical CA1 spine density and enhancing both object recognition and spatial memory consolidation. Collectively, these data demonstrate that GPER-mediated hippocampal spinogenesis and memory consolidation depend on JNK and cofilin signaling, supporting a critical role for actin polymerization in the GPER-induced regulation of hippocampal function in female mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Emerging evidence suggests that G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) activation mimics effects of 17β-estradiol on hippocampal memory consolidation. Unlike canonical estrogen receptors, GPER activation is associated with reduced cancer cell proliferation; thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms through which GPER regulates hippocampal function may provide new avenues for the development of drugs that provide the cognitive benefits of estrogens without harmful side effects. Here, we demonstrate that GPER increases CA1 dendritic spine density and hippocampal memory consolidation in a manner dependent on actin polymerization and c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation. These findings provide novel insights into the role of GPER in mediating hippocampal morphology and memory consolidation, and may suggest first steps toward new therapeutics that more safely and effectively reduce memory decline in menopausal women.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Multivariate Analysis of Electrophysiological Signals Reveals the Temporal Properties of Visuomotor Computations for Precision Grips</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/48/9585?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The frontoparietal networks underlying grasping movements have been extensively studied, especially using fMRI. Accordingly, whereas much is known about their cortical locus much less is known about the temporal dynamics of visuomotor transformations. Here, we show that multivariate EEG analysis allows for detailed insights into the time course of visual and visuomotor computations of precision grasps. Male and female human participants first previewed one of several objects and, upon its reappearance, reached to grasp it with the thumb and index finger along one of its two symmetry axes. Object shape classifiers reached transient accuracies of 70% at ~105 ms, especially based on scalp sites over visual cortex, dropping to lower levels thereafter. Grasp orientation classifiers relied on a system of occipital-to-frontal electrodes. Their accuracy rose concurrently with shape classification but ramped up more gradually, and the slope of the classification curve predicted individual reaction times. Further, cross-temporal generalization revealed that dynamic shape representation involved early and late neural generators that reactivated one another. In contrast, grasp computations involved a chain of generators attaining a sustained state about 100 ms before movement onset. Our results reveal the progression of visual and visuomotor representations over the course of planning and executing grasp movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Grasping an object requires the brain to perform visual-to-motor transformations of the object's properties. Although much of the neuroanatomic basis of visuomotor transformations has been uncovered, little is known about its time course. Here, we orthogonally manipulated object visual characteristics and grasp orientation, and used multivariate EEG analysis to reveal that visual and visuomotor computations follow similar time courses but display different properties and dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dentate Gyrus Mossy Cells Share a Role in Pattern Separation with Dentate Granule Cells and Proximal CA3 Pyramidal Cells</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/48/9570?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The complementary processes of pattern completion and pattern separation are thought to be essential for successful memory storage and recall. The dentate gyrus (DG) and proximal CA3 (pCA3) regions have been implicated in pattern separation, in part through extracellular recording studies of these areas. However, the DG contains two types of excitatory cells: granule cells of the granule layer and mossy cells of the hilus. Little is known about the firing properties of mossy cells in freely moving animals, and it is unclear how their activity may contribute to the mnemonic functions of the hippocampus. Furthermore, tetrodes in the dentate granule layer and pCA3 pyramidal layer can also record mossy cells, thus introducing ambiguity into the identification of cell types recorded. Using a random forests classifier, we classified cells recorded in DG (Neunuebel and Knierim, 2014) and pCA3 (Lee et al., 2015) of 16 male rats and separately examined the responses of granule cells, mossy cells, and pCA3 pyramidal cells in a local/global cue mismatch task. All three cell types displayed low correlations between the population representations of the rat's position in the standard and cue-mismatch sessions. These results suggest that all three excitatory cell types within the DG/pCA3 circuit may act as a single functional unit to support pattern separation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Mossy cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) are an integral component of the DG/pCA3 circuit. While the role of granule cells in the circuitry and computations of the hippocampus has been a focus of study for decades, the contributions of mossy cells have been largely overlooked. Recent studies have revealed the spatial firing properties of mossy cells in awake behaving animals, but how the activity of these highly active cells contributes to the mnemonic functions of the DG is uncertain. We separately analyzed mossy cells, granule cells, and pCA3 cells and found that all three cell types respond similarly to a local/global cue mismatch, suggesting that they form a single functional unit supporting pattern separation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cochlear Efferent Innervation Is Sparse in Humans and Decreases with Age</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/48/9560?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The mammalian cochlea is innervated by two cholinergic feedback systems called the medial olivocochlear (MOC) and lateral olivocochlear (LOC) pathways, which send control signals from the brainstem back to the outer hair cells and auditory-nerve fibers, respectively. Despite countless studies of the cochlear projections of these efferent fibers in animal models, comparable data for humans are almost completely lacking. Here, we immunostained the cochlear sensory epithelium from 23 normal-aging humans (14 males and 9 females), 0–86 years of age, with cholinergic markers to quantify the normal density of MOC and LOC projections, and the degree of age-related degeneration. In younger ears, the MOC density peaks in mid-cochlear regions and falls off both apically and basally, whereas the LOC innervation peaks near the apex. In older ears, MOC density decreases dramatically, whereas the LOC density does not. The loss of MOC feedback may contribute to the age-related decrease in word recognition in noise; however, even at its peak, the MOC density is lower than in other mammals, suggesting the MOC pathway is less important for human hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The cochlear epithelium and its sensory innervation are modulated by the olivocochlear (OC) efferent pathway. Although the medial OC (MOC) reflex has been extensively studied in humans, via contralateral sound suppression, the cochlear projections of these cholinergic neurons have not been described in humans. Here, we use immunostaining to quantify the MOC projections to outer hair cells and lateral OC (LOC) projections to the inner hair cell area in humans 0–89 years of age. We show age-related loss of MOC, but not LOC, innervation, which likely contributes to hearing impairments, and a relative paucity of MOC terminals at all ages, which may account for the relative weakness of the human MOC reflex and the difficulty in demonstrating a robust functional role in human experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/48/9546?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sensory cortices process stimuli in manners essential for perception. Very little is known regarding interactions between olfactory cortices. The piriform &quot;primary&quot; olfactory cortex, especially its anterior division (aPCX), extends dense association fibers into the ventral striatum's olfactory tubercle (OT), yet whether this corticostriatal pathway is capable of shaping OT activity, including odor-evoked activity, is unknown. Further unresolved is the synaptic circuitry and the spatial localization of OT-innervating PCX neurons. Here we build upon standing literature to provide some answers to these questions through studies in mice of both sexes. First, we recorded the activity of OT neurons in awake mice while optically stimulating principal neurons in the aPCX and/or their association fibers in the OT while the mice were delivered odors. This uncovered evidence that PCX input indeed influences OT unit activity. We then used patch-clamp recordings and viral tracing to determine the connectivity of aPCX neurons upon OT neurons expressing dopamine receptor types D1 or D2, two prominent cell populations in the OT. These investigations uncovered that both populations of neurons receive monosynaptic inputs from aPCX glutamatergic neurons. Interestingly, this input originates largely from the ventrocaudal aPCX. These results shed light on some of the basic physiological properties of this pathway and the cell-types involved and provide a foundation for future studies to identify, among other things, whether this pathway has implications for perception.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Estradiol Enhances the Depolarizing Response to GABA and AMPA Synaptic Conductances in Arcuate Kisspeptin Neurons by Diminishing Voltage-Gated Potassium Currents</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/48/9532?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synaptic and intrinsic properties interact to sculpt neuronal output. Kisspeptin neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus help convey homeostatic estradiol feedback to central systems controlling fertility. Estradiol increases membrane depolarization induced by GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor activation in these neurons. We hypothesized that the mechanisms underlying estradiol-induced alterations in postsynaptic response to GABA, and also AMPA, receptor activation include regulation of voltage-gated potassium currents. Whole-cell recordings of arcuate kisspeptin neurons in brain slices from ovariectomized (OVX) and OVX+estradiol (OVX+E) female mice during estradiol negative feedback revealed that estradiol reduced capacitance, reduced transient and sustained potassium currents, and altered voltage dependence and kinetics of transient currents. Consistent with these observations, estradiol reduced rheobase and action potential latency. To study more directly interactions between synaptic and active intrinsic estradiol feedback targets, dynamic clamp was used to simulate GABA and AMPA conductances. Both GABA and AMPA dynamic clamp-induced postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) were smaller in neurons from OVX than OVX+E mice; blocking transient potassium currents eliminated this difference. To interrogate the role of the estradiol-induced changes in passive intrinsic properties, different Markov model structures based on the properties of the transient potassium current in cells from OVX or OVX+E mice were combined &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; with passive properties reflecting these two endocrine conditions. Some of tested models reproduced the effect on PSPs &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt;, revealing that AMPA PSPs were more sensitive to changes in capacitance. These observations support the hypothesis that PSPs in arcuate kisspeptin neurons are regulated by estradiol-sensitive mechanisms including potassium conductances and membrane properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Kisspeptin neurons relay estradiol feedback to gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons, which regulate the reproductive system. The fast synaptic neurotransmitters GABA and glutamate rapidly depolarize arcuate kisspeptin neurons and estradiol increases this depolarization. Estradiol reduced both potassium current in the membrane potential range typically achieved during response to fast synaptic inputs and membrane capacitance. Using simulated GABA and glutamate synaptic inputs, we showed changes in both the passive and active intrinsic properties induced by &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; estradiol treatment affect the response to synaptic inputs, with capacitance having a greater effect on response to glutamate. The suppression of both passive and active intrinsic properties by estradiol feedback thus renders arcuate kisspeptin neurons more sensitive to fast synaptic inputs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Isolation of LMX1a Ventral Midbrain Progenitors Improves the Safety and Predictability of Human Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Neural Transplants in Parkinsonian Disease</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/48/9521?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are a promising resource for the replacement of degenerated ventral midbrain dopaminergic (vmDA) neurons in Parkinson's disease. Despite recent advances in protocols for the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; generation of vmDA neurons, the asynchronous and heterogeneous nature of the differentiations results in transplants of surprisingly low vmDA neuron purity. As the field advances toward the clinic, it will be optimal, if not essential, to remove poorly specified and potentially proliferative cells from donor preparations to ensure safety and predictable efficacy. Here, we use two novel hPSC knock-in reporter lines expressing GFP under the LMX1A and PITX3 promoters, to selectively isolate vm progenitors and DA precursors, respectively. For each cell line, unsorted, GFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and GFP&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; cells were transplanted into male or female Parkinsonian rodents. Only rats receiving unsorted cells, LMX1A-eGFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, or PITX3-eGFP&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; cell grafts showed improved motor function over 6 months. Postmortem analysis revealed small grafts from PITX3-eGFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells, suggesting that these DA precursors were not compatible with cell survival and integration. In contrast, LMX1A-eGFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; grafts were highly enriched for vmDA neurons, and importantly excluded expansive proliferative populations and serotonergic neurons. These LMX1A-eGFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; progenitor grafts accelerated behavioral recovery and innervated developmentally appropriate forebrain targets, whereas LMX1A-eGFP&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; cell grafts failed to restore motor deficits, supported by increased fiber growth into nondopaminergic target nuclei. This is the first study to use an hPSC-derived reporter line to purify vm progenitors, resulting in improved safety, predictability of the graft composition, and enhanced motor function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Clinical trials have shown functional integration of transplanted fetal-derived dopamine progenitors in Parkinson's disease. Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived midbrain progenitors are now being tested as an alternative cell source; however, despite current differentiation protocols generating &amp;gt;80% correctly specified cells for implantation, resultant grafts contain a small fraction of dopamine neurons. Cell-sorting approaches, to select for correctly patterned cells before implantation, are being explored yet have been suboptimal to date. This study provides the first evidence of using 2 hPSC reporter lines (LMX1A-GFP and PITX3-GFP) to isolate correctly specified cells for transplantation. We show LMX1A-GFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, but not PITX3-GFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, cell grafts are more predictable, with smaller grafts, enriched in dopamine neurons, showing appropriate integration and accelerated functional recovery in Parkinsonian rats.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: p75NTR and DR6 Regulate Distinct Phases of Axon Degeneration Demarcated by Spheroid Rupture</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/48/9503?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The regressive events associated with trophic deprivation are critical for sculpting a functional nervous system. After nerve growth factor withdrawal, sympathetic axons derived from male and female neonatal mice maintain their structural integrity for ~18 h (latent phase) followed by a rapid and near unison disassembly of axons over the next 3 h (catastrophic phase). Here we examine the molecular basis by which axons transition from latent to catastrophic phases of degeneration following trophic withdrawal. Before catastrophic degeneration, we observed an increase in intra-axonal calcium. This calcium flux is accompanied by p75 neurotrophic factor receptor-Rho-actin-dependent expansion of calcium-rich axonal spheroids that eventually rupture, releasing their contents to the extracellular space. Conditioned media derived from degenerating axons are capable of hastening transition into the catastrophic phase of degeneration. We also found that death receptor 6, but not p75 neurotrophic factor receptor, is required for transition into the catastrophic phase in response to conditioned media but not for the intra-axonal calcium flux, spheroid formation, or rupture that occur toward the end of latency. Our results support the existence of an interaxonal degenerative signal that promotes catastrophic degeneration among trophically deprived axons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Developmental pruning shares several morphological similarities to both disease- and injury-induced degeneration, including spheroid formation. The function and underlying mechanisms governing axonal spheroid formation, however, remain unclear. In this study, we report that axons coordinate each other's degeneration during development via axonal spheroid rupture. Before irreversible breakdown of the axon in response to trophic withdrawal, p75 neurotrophic factor receptor-RhoA signaling governs the formation and growth of spheroids. These spheroids then rupture, allowing exchange of contents ≤10 kDa between the intracellular and extracellular space to drive death receptor 6 and calpain-dependent catastrophic degeneration. This finding informs not only our understanding of regressive events during development but may also provide a rationale for designing new treatments toward myriad neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The LMTK1-TBC1D9B-Rab11A Cascade Regulates Dendritic Spine Formation via Endosome Trafficking</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/48/9491?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dendritic spines are postsynaptic protrusions at excitatory synapses that are critical for proper neuronal synaptic transmission. While lipid and protein membrane components are necessary for spine formation, it is largely unknown how they are recruited to developing spines. Endosomal trafficking is one mechanism that may influence this development. We recently reported that Lemur kinase 1A (LMTK1A), a membrane-bound Ser/Thr kinase, regulates trafficking of endosomes in neurons. LMTK1 has been shown to be a p35 Cdk5 activator-binding protein and a substrate for Cdk5-p35; however, its neuronal function has not been sufficiently studied. Here, we investigate the role of LMTK1 in spine formation. Depletion of LMTK1 increases spine formation, maturation, and density in primary cultured neurons and in mouse brain of either sex. Additionally, expression of kinase-negative LMTK1 stimulates spine formation in primary neurons and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. LMTK1 controls spine formation through Rab11, a regulator of recycling endosome trafficking. We identify TBC1D9B, a Rab11A GTPase-activating protein (Rab11A GAP), as a LMTK1 binding protein, and find that TBC1D9B mediates LMTK1 activity on Rab11A. TBC1D9B inactivates Rab11A under the control of LMTK1A. Further, by analyzing the effect of decreased TBC1D9B expression in primary neurons, we demonstrate that TBC1D9B indeed regulates spine formation. This is the first demonstration of the biological function of TBC1D9B. Together, with the regulation of LMTK1 by Cdk5-p35, we propose the Cdk5-LMTK1-TBC1D9B-Rab11A cascade as a novel signaling mechanism regulating endosomal transport for synapse formation and function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Dendritic spines are postsynaptic specializations essential for synaptic transmission. However, it is not known how critical membrane components are recruited to spines for their formation. Endosomal trafficking is one such mechanism that may mediate this process. Here we investigate regulators of endosomal trafficking and their contribution to spine formation. We identify two novel factors, LMTK1 and TBC1D9B, which regulate spine formation upstream of Rab11A, a small GTPase. LMTK1 is a membrane bound Ser/Thr kinase regulated by Cdk5-p35, and TBC1D9B is a recently identified Rab11 GAP. LMTK1 controls the GAP activity of TBC1D9B on Rab11A, and TBC1D9B mediates the LMTK1 activity on Rab11A. We propose the Cdk5-LMTK1-TBC1D9B-Rab11A cascade as a novel mechanism controlling spine formation and function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Protein Kinase C and Calmodulin Serve As Calcium Sensors for Calcium-Stimulated Endocytosis at Synapses</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/48/9478?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Calcium influx triggers and facilitates endocytosis, which recycles vesicles and thus sustains synaptic transmission. Despite decades of studies, the underlying calcium sensor remained not well understood. Here, we examined two calcium binding proteins, protein kinase C (PKC) and calmodulin. Whether PKC is involved in endocytosis was unclear; whether calmodulin acts as a calcium sensor for endocytosis was neither clear, although calmodulin involvement in endocytosis had been suggested. We generated PKC (α or β-isoform) and calmodulin (calmodulin 2 gene) knock-out mice of either sex and measured endocytosis with capacitance measurements, pHluorin imaging and electron microscopy. We found that these knock-outs inhibited slow (~10–30 s) and rapid (&amp;lt;~3 s) endocytosis at large calyx-type calyces, and inhibited slow endocytosis and bulk endocytosis (forming large endosome-like structures) at small conventional hippocampal synapses, suggesting the involvement of PKC and calmodulin in three most common forms of endocytosis-the slow, rapid and bulk endocytosis. Inhibition of slow endocytosis in PKC or calmodulin 2 knock-out hippocampal synapses was rescued by overexpressing wild-type PKC or calmodulin, but not calcium-binding-deficient PKC or calmodulin mutant, respectively, suggesting that calcium stimulates endocytosis by binding with its calcium sensor PKC and calmodulin. PKC and calmodulin 2 knock-out inhibited calcium-dependent vesicle mobilization to the readily releasable pool, suggesting that PKC and calmodulin may mediate calcium-dependent facilitation of vesicle mobilization. These findings shed light on the molecular signaling link among calcium, endocytosis and vesicle mobilization that are crucial in maintaining synaptic transmission and neuronal network activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Vesicle fusion releases neurotransmitters to mediate synaptic transmission. To sustain synaptic transmission, fused vesicles must be retrieved via endocytosis. Accumulating evidence suggests that calcium influx triggers synaptic vesicle endocytosis. However, how calcium triggers endocytosis is not well understood. Using genetic tools together with capacitance measurements, optical imaging and electron microscopy, we identified two calcium sensors, including protein kinase C (α and β isoforms) and calmodulin, for the most commonly observed forms of endocytosis: slow, rapid, and bulk. We also found that these two proteins are involved in calcium-dependent vesicle mobilization to the readily releasable pool. These results provide the molecular signaling link among calcium, endocytosis, and vesicle mobilization that are essential in sustaining synaptic transmission and neuronal network activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Loss of Tiparp Results in Aberrant Layering of the Cerebral Cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/6/ENEURO.0239-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)-inducible poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (TIPARP) is an enzyme that adds a single ADP-ribose moiety to itself or other proteins. Tiparp is highly expressed in the brain; however, its function in this organ is unknown. Here, we used &lt;i&gt;Tiparp&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice to determine Tiparp’s role in the development of the prefrontal cortex. Loss of Tiparp resulted in an aberrant organization of the mouse cortex, where the upper layers presented increased cell density in the knock-out mice compared with wild type. Tiparp loss predominantly affected the correct distribution and number of GABAergic neurons. Furthermore, neural progenitor cell proliferation was significantly reduced. Neural stem cells (NSCs) derived from &lt;i&gt;Tiparp&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice showed a slower rate of migration. Cytoskeletal components, such as α-tubulin are key regulators of neuronal differentiation and cortical development. α-tubulin mono-ADP ribosylation (MAR) levels were reduced in &lt;i&gt;Tiparp&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; cells, suggesting that Tiparp plays a role in the MAR of α-tubulin. Despite the mild phenotype presented by &lt;i&gt;Tiparp&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice, our findings reveal an important function for Tiparp and MAR in the correct development of the cortex. Unravelling Tiparp’s role in the cortex, could pave the way to a better understanding of a wide spectrum of neurological diseases which are known to have increased expression of &lt;i&gt;TIPARP&lt;/i&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Differences in GluN2B-Containing NMDA Receptors Result in Distinct Long-Term Plasticity at Ipsilateral versus Contralateral Cortico-Striatal Synapses</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/6/ENEURO.0118-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Excitatory neurons in the primary motor cortex project bilaterally to the striatum. However, whether synaptic structure and function in ipsilateral and contralateral cortico-striatal pathways is identical or different remains largely unknown. Here, we describe that excitatory synapses in the mouse contralateral pathway have higher levels of NMDA-type of glutamate receptors (NMDARs) than those in the ipsilateral pathway, although both synapses utilize the same presynaptic vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT). We also show that NMDARs containing the GluN2B subunit, but not GluN2A, contribute to this difference. The altered NMDAR subunit composition in these two pathways results in opposite synaptic plasticity induced by -burst stimulus: long-term depression in the ipsilateral pathway and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the contralateral pathway. The standard long-term depression (LTD)-inducing protocol using paired postsynaptic and presynaptic activity triggers synaptic depression at ipsilateral pathway synapses, but not at those of the contralateral pathway. Altogether, our results provide novel and unexpected evidence for the lack of bilaterality of NMDAR-mediated synaptic transmission at cortico-striatal pathways due to differences in the expression of GluN2B subunits, which results in differences in bidirectional synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Literally hundreds of statisticians have rightly called for an end to statistical significance testing (Amrhein et al. 2019; Wasserstein et al. 2019). But the practice of arbitrarily thresholding p-values is not only deeply embedded in statistical practice, it is also congenial to the human mind. It is thus not sufficient to tell our students, &quot;Don’t do this.&quot; We must vividly show them why the practice is wrong and its effects detrimental to scientific progress. I offer three teaching examples I have found to be useful in prompting students to think more deeply about the problem and to begin to interpret the results of statistical procedures as measures of how evidence should change our beliefs, and not as bright lines separating truth from falsehood.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Eye movements during visuomotor adaptation represent only part of the explicit learning</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0308-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Visuomotor rotations are learned through a combination of explicit strategy and implicit recalibration. However, measuring the relative contribution of each remains a challenge and the possibility of multiple explicit and implicit components complicates the issue. Recent interest has focused on the possibility that eye movements reflect explicit strategy. Here we compared eye movements during adaptation to two accepted measures of explicit learning - verbal report and the exclusion test. We found that while reporting, all subjects showed a match between all three measures. However, when subjects did not report their intention, the eye movements of some subjects suggested less explicit adaptation than what was measured in an exclusion test. Interestingly, subjects whose eye movements did match their exclusion could be clustered into two subgroups: fully implicit learners showing no evidence of explicit adaptation and explicit learners with little implicit adaptation. Subjects showing a mix of both explicit and implicit adaptation were also those where eye movements showed less explicit adaptation than did exclusion. Thus, our results support the idea of multiple components of explicit learning as only part of the explicit learning is reflected in the eye movements. Individual subjects may use explicit components that are reflected in the eyes or those that are not or some mixture of the two. Analysis of reaction times suggests that the explicit components reflected in the eye-movements involve longer reaction times. This component, according to recent literature, may be related to mental rotation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Visuomotor adaptation involves both explicit and implicit components: aware re-aiming and unaware error correction. Recent studies suggest that eye movements could be used to capture the explicit component, a method that would have significant advantages over other approaches. We show that eye movements capture only one component of explicit adaptation. This component scales with reaction time while the component unrelated to eye movements does not. Our finding has obvious practical implications for the use of eye movements as a proxy for explicit learning. However, our results also corroborate recent findings suggesting the existence of multiple explicit components, and, specifically, their decomposition into components correlated with reaction time and components that are not.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regional variations in oscillatory activity during human sleep remain unknown. Using the unique ability of intracranial electroencephalography to study in‐situ brain physiology, this study assesses regional variations of electroencephalographic sleep activity and creates the first atlas of human sleep using recordings from the first sleep cycle.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intracerebral electroencephalographic recordings with channels displaying physiological activity from non‐lesional tissue were selected from 91 patients of three tertiary epilepsy centers. Sections during non‐rapid eye movement sleep (N2, N3) and rapid eye movement sleep (R) were selected from the first sleep cycle for oscillatory and non‐oscillatory signal analysis. Results of 1468 channels were grouped into 38 regions covering all cortical areas.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found regional differences in the distribution of sleep transients and spectral content, during all sleep stages. There was a caudo‐rostral gradient with more slow frequencies and fewer spindles in temporo‐parieto‐occipital than in frontal cortex. Moreover, deep‐seated structures showed spectral peaks differing from the baseline electroencephalogram. The regions with &amp;gt;60% of channels presenting significant rhythmic activity were either mesial or temporal basal structures that contribute minimally to the scalp EEG. Finally, during deeper sleep stages, electroencephalographic analysis revealed a more homogeneous spatial distribution, with increased coupling between high and low frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study provides a better understanding of the regional variability of sleep, and establishes a baseline for human sleep in all cortical regions during the first sleep cycle. Furthermore, the open‐access atlas will be a unique resource for research (&lt;a href=&quot;https://mni-open-ieegatlas.research.mcgill.ca&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;https://mni‐open‐ieegatlas.research.mcgill.ca&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25645?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate whether midlife atherosclerosis is associated with different dementia subtypes and related underlying pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants comprised the cardiovascular cohort of the Swedish prospective population‐based Malmö Diet and Cancer Study (N = 6,103). Carotid plaques and intima media thickness (IMT) were measured at baseline (1991–1994). Dementia incidence until 2014 was obtained from national registers. Diagnoses were reviewed and validated in medical records. In a cognitively unimpaired subcohort (n = 330), β‐amyloid&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; and tau were quantified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and white matter hyperintensity volume, lacunar infarcts, and cerebral microbleeds were estimated on magnetic resonance imaging (2009–2015).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During 20 years of follow‐up, 462 individuals developed dementia (mean age at baseline = 57.5 ± 5.9 years, 58% women). Higher IMT in midlife was associated with an increased hazard ratio (HR) of all‐cause dementia (adjusted HR = 1.14 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03–1.26]) and vascular dementia (adjusted HR = 1.32 [95% CI = 1.10–1.57]) but not Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia (adjusted HR = 0.95 [95% CI = 0.77–1.17]). Carotid plaques were associated with vascular dementia when assessed as a 3‐graded score (adjusted HR = 1.90 [95% CI = 1.07–3.38]). In the cognitively unimpaired subcohort (53.8 ± 4.6 years at baseline, 60% women), higher IMT in midlife was associated with development of small vessel disease (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.47 [95% CI = 1.05–2.06]) but not significantly with abnormal CSF AD biomarkers (adjusted OR = 1.28 [95% CI = 0.87–1.90] for Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; and 1.35 [95% CI = 0.86–2.13] for Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;/p‐tau). Carotid plaques revealed no significant association with any of the underlying brain pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings support an association between midlife atherosclerosis and development of vascular dementia and cerebral small vessel disease but not between atherosclerosis and subsequent AD dementia or AD pathology. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To compare response to rituximab (RTX) between adult patients positive for myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and aquaporin‐4 (AQP4) antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We prospectively studied adult patients with MOG or AQP4 antibodies who received RTX under an individualized dosing schedule adapted to the biological effect of RTX monitored by memory B‐cell measurement. Memory B cells were counted monthly and when relapse occurred. The biological effect of RTX was considered significant with &amp;lt;0.05% memory B cells in peripheral blood lymphocytes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 16 patients with MOG antibodies and 29 with AQP4 antibodies, mean follow‐up was 19 (range = 9–38) and 38 (13–79) months. Under RTX, 10 relapses occurred in 6 of 16 (37.5%) patients with MOG antibodies, and 13 occurred in 7 of 29 (24%) with AQP4 antibodies. The median time of relapse after the most recent infusion was 2.6 (0.6–5.8) and 7 (0.8–13) months, respectively (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Memory B cells had reemerged in 2 of 10 (20%) relapses in patients with MOG antibodies and 12 of 13 (92.5%) with AQP4 antibodies (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In AQP4 antibody–associated disorder, relapse mostly occurs when the biological effect of RTX decreases, which argues for treatment efficacy. In MOG antibody–associated disorder, the efficacy of RTX is not constant, because one‐third of patients showed relapse despite an effective biological effect of RTX. In this subpopulation, memory B‐cell depletion was unable to prevent relapse, which was probably caused by different immunological mechanisms. These findings should be used to improve treatment strategies for MOG antibody–associated disorder. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25647?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin &lt;i&gt;(HTT)&lt;/i&gt; gene. No disease‐modifying therapy exists for the treatment of patients with HD. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate early disease mechanisms that potentially could be used as a target therapeutically.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lymphocyte activity in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 4 cohorts of &lt;i&gt;HTT&lt;/i&gt; gene expansion carriers (n = 121 in total) and controls was analyzed by techniques based on flow cytometry and enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assays.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data of this study provide evidence of immune abnormalities before motor onset of disease. In CSF of &lt;i&gt;HTT&lt;/i&gt; gene expansion carriers, we found increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL‐17, and increased consumption of the lymphocyte growth factor IL‐7 before motor onset of HD. In concordance, we observed an increased prevalence of IL‐17–producing Th17.1 cells in the CSF of &lt;i&gt;HTT&lt;/i&gt; gene expansion carriers, predominantly in pre–motor manifest individuals. The frequency of intrathecal Th17.1 cells correlated negatively with progression of HD and the level of neurodegeneration, suggesting a role of Th17.1 cells in the early disease stage. We also observed a skewing in the balance between proinflammatory and regulatory T cells potentially favoring a proinflammatory intrathecal environment in &lt;i&gt;HTT&lt;/i&gt; gene expansion carriers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These data suggest that Th17.1 cells are implicated in the earliest pathogenic phases of HD and suggest that treatment to dampen T ‐cell–driven inflammation before motor onset might be of benefit in &lt;i&gt;HTT&lt;/i&gt; gene expansion carriers. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It is generally thought that muscle excitability is almost exclusively controlled by currents responsible for generation of action potentials. We propose that smaller ion channel currents that contribute to setting the resting potential and to subthreshold fluctuations in membrane potential can also modulate excitability in important ways. These channels open at voltages more negative than the action potential threshold and are thus termed subthreshold currents. As subthreshold currents are orders of magnitude smaller than the currents responsible for the action potential, they are hard to identify and easily overlooked. Discovery of their importance in regulation of excitability opens new avenues for improved therapy for muscle channelopathies and diseases of the neuromuscular junction.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Motivated by the flexibility of biological neural networks whose connectivity
structure changes significantly during their lifetime, we introduce the
Unstructured Recursive Network (URN) and demonstrate that it can exhibit
similar flexibility during training via gradient descent. We show empirically
that many of the different neural network structures commonly used in practice
today (including fully connected, locally connected and residual networks of
different depths and widths) can emerge dynamically from the same URN. These
different structures can be derived using gradient descent on a single general
loss function where the structure of the data and the relative strengths of
various regulator terms determine the structure of the emergent network. We
show that this loss function and the regulators arise naturally when
considering the symmetries of the network as well as the geometric properties
of the input data.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11466</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rhythmic activity has been associated with a wide range of cognitive
processes. Previous studies have shown that spike-timing-dependent plasticity
can facilitate the transfer of rhythmic activity downstream the information
processing pathway. However, STDP has also been known to generate strong
winner-take-all like competitions between subgroups of correlated synaptic
inputs. Consequently, one might expect that STDP would induce strong
competition between different rhythmicity channels thus preventing the
multiplexing of information across different frequency channels. This study
explored whether STDP facilitates the multiplexing of information across
multiple frequency channels, and if so, under what conditions. We investigated
the STDP dynamics in the framework of a model consisting of two competing
subpopulations of neurons that synapse in a feedforward manner onto a single
postsynaptic neuron. Each sub-population was assumed to oscillate in an
independent manner and in a different frequency band. To investigate the STDP
dynamics, a mean field Fokker-Planck theory was developed in the limit of the
slow learning rate. Surprisingly, our theory predicted limited interactions
between the different sub-groups. Our analysis further revealed that the
interaction between these channels was mainly mediated by the shared component
of the mean activity. Next, we generalized these results beyond the simplistic
model using numerical simulations. We found that for a wide range of
parameters, the system converged to a solution in which the post-synaptic
neuron responded to both rhythms. Nevertheless, all the synaptic weights
remained dynamic and did not converge to a fixed point. These findings imply
that STDP can support the multiplexing of rhythmic information and demonstrate
how functionality can be retained in the face of continuous remodeling of all
the synaptic weights.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We begin by demonstrating that the neuronal state equation from Dynamic
Causal Modelling takes on the form of the discretized Fokker-Planck equation
upon the inclusion of local activity gradients within a network. Using the
Jacobian of this modified neuronal state equation, we show that an initially
unstable system can be rendered stable via a decrease in diffusivity.
Therefore, if a node within the system is known to be unstable due to a
tendency toward epileptic seizures for example, then our results indicate that
intervention techniques should take the counter-intuitive approach of mirroring
activity in the nodes immediately surrounding a pathological region -
effectively fighting seizures with seizures. Finally, using a two-region system
as an example, we show that one can also tune diffusivity in such a way as to
allow for the suppression of oscillatory activity during epileptic seizures.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11393</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Eye movements have been widely investigated to study the atypical visual
attention in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The majority of these studies have
been focused on limited eye movement features by statistical comparisons
between ASD and Typically Developing (TD) groups, which make it difficult to
accurately separate ASD from TD at the individual level. The deep learning
technology has been highly successful in overcoming this issue by automatically
extracting features important for classification through a data-driven learning
process. However, there is still a lack of end-to-end deep learning framework
for recognition of abnormal attention in ASD. In this study, we developed a
novel two-stream deep learning network for this recognition based on 700 images
and corresponding eye movement patterns of ASD and TD, and obtained an accuracy
of 0.95, which was higher than the previous state-of-the-art. We next
characterized contributions to the classification at the single image level and
non-linearly integration of this single image level information during the
classification. Moreover, we identified a group of pixel-level visual features
within these images with greater impacts on the classification. Together, this
two-stream deep learning network provides us a novel and powerful tool to
recognize and understand abnormal visual attention in ASD.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11326</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We propose a model for synaptic plasticity based on a calcium signaling
cascade. The model simplifies the full signaling pathways from a calcium influx
to the phosphorylation (potentiation) and dephosphorylation (depression) of
glutamate receptors that are gated by fictive C1 and C2 catalysts,
respectively. This model is based on tangible chemical reactions, including
fictive catalysts, for long-term plasticity rather than the conceptual theories
commonplace in various models, such as preset thresholds of calcium
concentration. Our simplified model successfully reproduced the experimental
synaptic plasticity induced by different protocols such as (i) a synchronous
pairing protocol and (ii) correlated presynaptic and postsynaptic action
potentials (APs). Further, the ocular dominance plasticity (or the experimental
verification of the celebrated Bienenstock--Cooper--Munro theory) was
reproduced by two model synapses that compete by means of back-propagating APs
(bAPs). The key to this competition is synapse-specific bAPs with reference to
bAP-boosting on the physiological grounds.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10010</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Conventional automated segmentation of MRI of the brain and head
distinguishes different tissues based on image intensities and prior tissue
probability maps (TPM). This works well for normal head anatomies, but fails in
the presence of unexpected lesions. Deep convolutional neural networks leverage
instead spatial patterns and can learn to segment lesions, but have thus far
not leveraged prior probabilities. Here we add to a three-dimensional
convolutional network spatial priors with a TPM, morphological priors with
conditional random fields, and context with a wider field-of-view at lower
resolution. We train and test these networks on images of 43 stroke patients
and 4 healthy individuals which have been manually segmented. The analysis
demonstrates the benefits of leveraging the three sources of prior information.
We also provide an out-of-sample validation and clinical application of the
approach on an additional 47 patients with disorders of consciousness.
Importantly, we demonstrate that the new architecture, which we call MultiPrior
network, surpaces the performance of expert human segmenters. We make the code
and trained networks freely available.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08410</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cortical synapse organization supports a range of dynamic states on multiple
spatial and temporal scales, from synchronous slow wave activity (SWA),
characteristic of deep sleep or anesthesia, to fluctuating, asynchronous
activity during wakefulness (AW). Such dynamic diversity poses a challenge for
producing efficient large-scale simulations that embody realistic metaphors of
short- and long-range synaptic connectivity. In fact, during SWA and AW
different spatial extents of the cortical tissue are active in a given timespan
and at different firing rates, which implies a wide variety of loads of local
computation and communication. A balanced evaluation of simulation performance
and robustness should therefore include tests of a variety of cortical dynamic
states. Here, we demonstrate performance scaling of our proprietary Distributed
and Plastic Spiking Neural Networks (DPSNN) simulation engine in both SWA and
AW for bidimensional grids of neural populations, which reflects the modular
organization of the cortex. We explored networks up to 192x192 modules, each
composed of 1250 integrate-and-fire neurons with spike-frequency adaptation,
and exponentially decaying inter-modular synaptic connectivity with varying
spatial decay constant. For the largest networks the total number of synapses
was over 70 billion. The execution platform included up to 64 dual-socket
nodes, each socket mounting 8 Intel Xeon Haswell processor cores @ 2.40GHz
clock rates. Network initialization time, memory usage, and execution time
showed good scaling performances from 1 to 1024 processes, implemented using
the standard Message Passing Interface (MPI) protocol. We achieved simulation
speeds of between 2.3x10^9 and 4.1x10^9 synaptic events per second for both
cortical states in the explored range of inter-modular interconnections.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Data assimilation for estimating electrophysiology simultaneously with connectivity within a biological neuronal network. (arXiv:1711.03834v7 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03834</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A method of data assimilation (DA) is employed to estimate
electrophysiological parameters of neurons simultaneously with their synaptic
connectivity in a small model biological network. The DA procedure is cast as
an optimization, with a cost function consisting of both a measurement error
and a model error term. An iterative reweighting of these terms permits a
systematic method to identify the lowest minimum, within a local region of
state space, on the surface of a non-convex cost function. In the model, two
sets of parameter values are associated with two particular functional modes of
network activity: simultaneous firing of all neurons, and a pattern-generating
mode wherein the neurons burst in sequence. The DA procedure is able to recover
these modes if: i) the stimulating electrical currents have chaotic waveforms,
and ii) the measurements consist of the membrane voltages of all neurons in the
circuit. Further, this method is able to prune a model of unnecessarily high
dimensionality to a representation that contains the maximum dimensionality
required to reproduce the provided measurements. This paper offers a
proof-of-concept that DA has the potential to inform laboratory designs for
estimating properties in small and isolatable functional circuits.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: NCS-1 Deficiency Affects mRNA Levels of Genes Involved in Regulation of ATP Synthesis and Mitochondrial Stress in Highly Vulnerable Substantia nigra Dopaminergic Neurons</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00252</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensor proteins (NCS) transduce changes in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis into altered signaling and neuronal function. NCS-1 activity has emerged as important for neuronal viability and pathophysiology. The progressive degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons, particularly within the Substantia nigra (SN), is the hallmark of Parkinson’s disease (PD), causing its motor symptoms. The activity-related Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis of SN DA neurons, mitochondrial dysfunction, and metabolic stress promote neurodegeneration and PD. In contrast, NCS-1 in general has neuroprotective effects. The underlying mechanisms are unclear. We analyzed transcriptional changes in SN DA neurons upon NCS-1 loss by combining UV-laser microdissection and RT-qPCR-approaches to compare expression levels of a panel of PD and/or Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-stress related genes from wildtype and NCS-1 KO mice. In NCS-1 KO, we detected significantly lower mRNA levels of mitochondrially coded ND1, a subunit of the respiratory chain, and of the neuron-specific enolase ENO2, a glycolytic enzyme. We also detected lower levels of the mitochondrial uncoupling proteins UCP4 and UCP5, the PARK7 gene product DJ-1, and the voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel Cav2.3 in SN DA neurons from NCS-1 KO. Transcripts of other analyzed uncoupling proteins (UCPs), mitochondrial Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transporters, PARK genes, and ion channels were not altered. As Cav channels are linked to regulation of gene expression, metabolic stress and degeneration of SN DA neurons in PD, we analyzed Cav2.3 KO mice, to address if the transcriptional changes in NCS-1 KO were also present in Cav.2.3 KO, and thus probably correlated with lower Cav2.3 transcripts. However, in SN DA neurons from Cav2.3 KO mice, ND1 mRNA as well as genomic DNA levels were elevated, while ENO2, UCP4, UCP5, and DJ-1 transcript levels were not altered. In conclusion, our data indicate a possible novel function of NCS-1 in regulating gene transcription or stabilization of mRNAs in SN DA neurons. Although we do not provide functional data, our findings at the transcript level could point to impaired ATP production (lower ND1 and ENO2) and elevated metabolic stress (lower UCP4, UCP5, and DJ-1 levels) in SN DA neurons from NCS-1 KO mice. We speculate that NCS-1 is involved in stimulating ATP synthesis, while at the same time controlling mitochondrial metabolic stress, and in this way could protect SN DA neurons from degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Partial Least Squares Regression Performs Well in MRI-Based Individualized Estimations</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01282</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Estimation of individuals’ cognitive, behavioral and demographic (CBD) variables based on MRI has attracted much research interest in the past decade, and effective machine learning techniques are of great importance for these estimations. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) is an attractive machine learning technique that can accommodate both single- and multi-label learning in a simple framework, while its potential for MRI-based estimations of CBD variables remains to be explored. In this study, we systemically investigated the performance of PLSR in MRI-based estimations of individuals’ CBD variables, especially its performance in simultaneous estimation of multiple CBD variables (multi-label learning). We performed the study on the dataset included in the HCP S1200 release. Resting state functional connections (RSFCs) were used as features, and a total of 10 CBD variables (e.g., age, gender, grip strength, and picture vocabulary) were estimated. The results showed that PLSR performed well in both single- and multi-label learning. In fact, the present estimations were better than those reported in literatures, as indicated by stronger correlations between the estimated and actual CBD variables, as well as high gender classification accuracy (97.8% in this study). Moreover, the RSFCs that contributed to the estimations exhibited strong correlations with the CBD variable estimated, that is, PLSR algorithm automatically selected the RSFCs closely related to one CBD variable to establish predictive models for the variable. Besides, the estimation accuracies based on RSFCs among 100, 200, and 300 regions of interest (ROIs) were higher than those based on RSFCs among 15, 25, and 50 ROIs; the estimation accuracies based on RSFCs evaluated using partial correlation were higher than those based on RSFCs evaluated using full correlation. In addition to the aforementioned virtues, PLSR is efficient in model training and testing, and it is simple and easy to use. Therefore, PLSR can be a favorable choice for future MRI-based estimations of CBD variables.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Influence of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation on Human Neurochemistry and Functional Connectivity: A Pilot MRI/MRS Study at 7 T</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01260</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation method commonly used in the disciplines of neuroscience, neurology, and neuropsychiatry to examine or modulate brain function. Low frequency rTMS (e.g., 1 Hz) is associated with a net suppression of cortical excitability, whereas higher frequencies (e.g., 5 Hz) purportedly increase excitability. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) allow investigation of neurochemistry and functional connectivity, respectively, and can assess the influence of rTMS in these domains. This pilot study investigated the effects of rTMS on the primary motor cortex using pre and post MRS and rsfMRI assessments at 7 T. Seven right-handed males (age 27 ± 7 y.o.) underwent single-voxel MRS and rsfMRI before and about 30-min after rTMS was administered outside the scanner for 20-min over the primary motor cortex of the left (dominant) hemisphere. All participants received 1-Hz rTMS; one participant additionally received 5-Hz rTMS in a separate session. Concentrations of 17 neurochemicals were quantified in left and right motor cortices. Connectivity metrics included fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) of both motor cortices, strength of related brain networks, and inter-hemispheric connectivity. The group-analysis revealed few trends (i.e., uncorrected for multiple comparisons), including a mean increase in the concentration of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) after the inhibitory rTMS protocol as compared to baseline in the stimulated (left) motor cortex (+8%, p = 0.043), along with a slight increase of total creatine (+2%, p = 0.018), and decrease of aspartate (−18%, p = 0.016). Additionally, GABA tended to decrease in the contralateral hemisphere (−6%, p = 0.033). No other changes of metabolite concentrations were found. Whereas functional connectivity outcomes did not exhibit trends of significant changes induced by rTMS, the percent changes of few connectivity metrics in both hemispheres were negatively correlated with GABA changes in the contralateral hemisphere. While studies in larger cohorts are needed to confirm these preliminary findings, our results indicate the safety and feasibility of detecting changes in key metabolites associated with neurotransmission after a single 1-Hz rTMS session, establishing the construct for future exploration of the neurochemical, and connectivity mechanisms of cortical responses to neuromodulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The electroencephalographic activity of particular brain areas during the decision making process is still little known. This paper presents results of experiments on the group of 30 patients with a wide range of psychiatric disorders and 41 members of the control group. All subjects were performing the Iowa Gambling Task that is often used for decision process investigations. The electroencephalographical activity of participants was recorded using the dense array amplifier. The most frequently active Brodmann Areas were estimated by means of the photogrammetry techniques and source localization algorithms. The analysis was conducted in the full frequency as well as in alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and theta bands. Next the mean electric charge flowing through each of the most frequently active areas and for each frequency band was calculated. The comparison of the results obtained for the subjects and the control groups is presented. The difference in activity of the selected Brodmann Areas can be observed in all variants of the task. The hyperactivity of amygdala is found in both the patients and the control group. It is noted that the somatosensory association cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and primary visual cortex play an important role in the decision-making process as well. Some of our results confirm the previous findings in the fMRI experiments. In addition, the results of the electroencephalographic analysis in the broadband as well as in specific frequency bands were used as inputs to several machine learning classifiers built in Azure Machine Learning environment. Comparison of classifiers' efficiency is presented to some extent and finding the most effective classifier may be important for planning research strategy toward finding decision-making biomarkers in cortical activity for both healthy people and those suffering from psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00070</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Heterogeneous mental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are notoriously difficult to diagnose, especially in children. The current psychiatric diagnostic process is based purely on the behavioral observation of symptomology (DSM-5/ICD-10) and may be prone to misdiagnosis. In order to move the field toward more quantitative diagnosis, we need advanced and scalable machine learning infrastructure that will allow us to identify reliable biomarkers of mental health disorders. In this paper, we propose a framework called ASD-DiagNet for classifying subjects with ASD from healthy subjects by using only fMRI data. We designed and implemented a joint learning procedure using an autoencoder and a single layer perceptron (SLP) which results in improved quality of extracted features and optimized parameters for the model. Further, we designed and implemented a data augmentation strategy, based on linear interpolation on available feature vectors, that allows us to produce synthetic datasets needed for training of machine learning models. The proposed approach is evaluated on a public dataset provided by Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange including 1, 035 subjects coming from 17 different brain imaging centers. Our machine learning model outperforms other state of the art methods from 10 imaging centers with increase in classification accuracy up to 28% with maximum accuracy of 82%. The machine learning technique presented in this paper, in addition to yielding better quality, gives enormous advantages in terms of execution time (40 min vs. 7 h on other methods). The implemented code is available as GPL license on GitHub portal of our lab (https://github.com/pcdslab/ASD-DiagNet).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Maintenance Versus Transmission Deficits: The Effect of Delay on Naming Performance in Aphasia</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00406</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We propose that deficits in lexical retrieval can involve difficulty in transmission of activation between processing levels, or difficulty in maintaining activation. In support, we present an investigation of picture naming by persons with aphasia in which the naming response is generated after a 1 s (sec) cue to respond in one condition or a 5 s cue to respond in another. Some individuals did better after 5 s, some did worse after 5 s, and some were not impacted by the delay. It is suggested that better performance after 5 s indicates a transmission deficit and that worse performance after 5 s indicates a maintenance deficit. To support this hypothesis, we adapted the two-step semantic-phonological model of lexical retrieval (Schwartz et al., 2006) so that it can simulate the passage of time and can simulate lesions in transmission (its semantic and phonological connection strength parameters) and/or maintenance (its decay parameter). The naming error patterns after 1 and 5 s for each participant were successfully fit to the model. Persons who did better after 5 s were found to have low connection strength parameters, persons who did worse after 5 s were simulated with an increased decay rate, and persons whose performance did not differ with delay were found to have lesions of both types. Some potential theoretical and clinical implications are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00372</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Haptic communication between humans plays an important role in society. Although this form of communication is ubiquitous at all levels of society and of human development, little is known about how synchronized coordination of motion between two persons leads to higher-order cognitive functions used in communication. In this study, we developed a novel experimental paradigm of a coin-collecting task in which participants used their hands to control a rod to jointly collect the coins on the screen. We characterized the haptic interactions between paired participants while they were taking part in a cooperative task. The individual participants first completed this task on their own and then with a randomly assigned partner for the cooperative task. Single participant experiments were used as a baseline to compare results of the paired participants. Forces applied to the rod were translated to four possible haptic states which encode the combination of the haptic interactions. As a next step, pairs of consecutive haptic states were then combined into 16 possible haptic signals which were classified in terms of their temporal patterns using a Tsallis q-exponential function. For paired participants, 80% of the haptic signals could be fit by the Tsallis q-exponential. On the other hand, only 30% of the signals found in the single-participant trials could be fit by the Tsallis q-exponential. This shows a clear difference in the temporal structures of haptic signals when participants are interacting with each other and when they are not. We also found a large difference in the number of haptic signals used by paired participants and singles. Single participants only used 1/4 of the possible haptic signals. Paired participants, on the other hand, used more than half of the possible signals. These results suggest that temporal structures present in haptic communication could be linked to the emergence of language at an evolutionary level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Laminar Organization of FM Direction Selectivity in the Primary Auditory Cortex of the Free-Tailed Bat</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00076</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We studied the columnar and layer-specific response properties of neurons in the primary auditory cortex (A1) of six (four females, two males) anesthetized free-tailed bats, Tadaridabrasiliensis, in response to pure tones and down and upward frequency modulated (FM; 50 kHz bandwidth) sweeps. In addition, we calculated current source density (CSD) to test whether lateral intracortical projections facilitate neuronal activation in response to FM echoes containing spectrally distant frequencies from the excitatory frequency response area (FRA). Auditory responses to a set of stimuli changing in frequency and level were recorded along 64 penetrations in the left A1 of six free-tailed bats. FRA shapes were consistent across the cortical depth within a column and there were no obvious differences in tuning properties. Generally, response latencies were shorter (&amp;lt;10 ms) for cortical depths between 500 and 600 μm, which might correspond to thalamocortical input layers IIIb–IV. Most units showed a stronger response to downward FM sweeps, and direction selectivity did not vary across cortical depth. CSD profiles calculated in response to the CF showed a current sink located at depths between 500 and 600 μm. Frequencies lower than the frequency range eliciting a spike response failed to evoke any visible current sink. Frequencies higher than the frequency range producing a spike response evoked layer IV sinks at longer latencies that increased with spectral distance. These data support the hypothesis that a progressive downward relay of spectral information spreads along the tonotopic axis of A1 via lateral connections, contributing to the neural processing of FM down sweeps used in biosonar.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00529</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Connexins (Cxs) are ubiquitous membrane proteins that are found throughout vertebrate organs, acting as building blocks of the gap junctions (GJs) known to play vital roles in the normal function of many organs. Mutations in Cx genes (particularly GJB2, which encodes Cx26) cause approximately half of all cases of congenital hearing loss in newborns. Great progress has been made in understanding GJ function and the molecular mechanisms for the role of Cxs in the cochlea. Data reveal that multiple types of Cxs work together to ensure normal development and function of the cochlea. These findings include many aspects not proposed in the classic K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; recycling theory, such as the formation of normal cochlear morphology (e.g., the opening of the tunnel of Corti), the fine-tuning of the innervation of nerve fibers to the hair cells (HCs), the maturation of the ribbon synapses, and the initiation of the endocochlear potential (EP). New data, especially those collected from targeted modification of major Cx genes in the mouse cochlea, have demonstrated that Cx26 plays an essential role in the postnatal maturation of the cochlea. Studies also show that Cx26 and Cx30 assume very different roles in the EP generation, given that only Cx26 is required for normal hearing. This article will review our current understanding of the molecular structure, cellular distribution, and major functions of cochlear GJs. Potential implications of the knowledge of cochlear GJs on the design and implementation of translational studies of cochlear gene therapies for Cx mutations are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00528</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality amongst civilians and military personnel globally. Despite advances in our knowledge of the complex pathophysiology of TBI, the underlying mechanisms are yet to be fully elucidated. While initial brain insult involves acute and irreversible primary damage to the parenchyma, the ensuing secondary brain injuries often progress slowly over months to years, hence providing a window for therapeutic interventions. To date, hallmark events during delayed secondary CNS damage include Wallerian degeneration of axons, mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity, oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death of neurons and glia. Extensive research has been directed to the identification of druggable targets associated with these processes. Furthermore, tremendous effort has been put forth to improve the bioavailability of therapeutics to CNS by devising strategies for efficient, specific and controlled delivery of bioactive agents to cellular targets. Here, we give an overview of the pathophysiology of TBI and the underlying molecular mechanisms, followed by an update on novel therapeutic targets and agents. Recent development of various approaches of drug delivery to the CNS is also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00524</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) modulates glutamatergic synaptic transmission and plasticity in the hippocampus, a brain area with a key role in learning and memory. In agreement, several studies have demonstrated that PACAP modulates learning in physiological conditions. Recent publications show reduced PACAP levels and/or alterations in PACAP receptor expression in different conditions associated with cognitive disability. It is noteworthy that PACAP administration rescued impaired synaptic plasticity and learning in animal models of aging, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Huntington’s chorea. In this context, results from our laboratory demonstrate that PACAP rescued metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus of a mouse model of fragile X syndrome (FXS), a genetic form of intellectual disability. PACAP is actively transported through the blood–brain barrier and reaches the brain following intranasal or intravenous administration. Besides, new studies have identified synthetic PACAP analog peptides with improved selectivity and pharmacokinetic properties with respect to the native peptide. Our review supports the shared idea that pharmacological activation of PACAP receptors might be beneficial for brain pathologies with cognitive disability. In addition, we suggest that the effects of PACAP treatment might be further studied as a possible therapy in FXS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00096</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There has been a surge of interest in the structure and function of the mammalian claustrum in recent years. However, most anatomical and physiological studies treat the claustrum as a relatively homogenous structure. Relatively little attention has been directed toward possible compartmentalization of the claustrum complex into anatomical subdivisions, and how this compartmentalization is reflected in claustrum connections with other brain structures. In this study, we examined the cyto- and myelo-architecture of the claustrum of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), to determine whether the claustrum contains internal anatomical structures or compartments, which could facilitate studies focused on understanding its role in brain function. NeuN, Nissl, calbindin, parvalbumin, and myelin-stained sections from eight adult marmosets were studied using light microscopy and serial reconstruction to identify potential internal compartments. Ultra high resolution (9.4T) post-mortem magnetic resonance imaging was employed to identify tractographic differences between identified claustrum subcompartments by diffusion-weighted tractography. Our results indicate that the classically defined marmoset claustrum includes at least two major subdivisions, which correspond to the dorsal endopiriform and insular claustrum nuclei, as described in other species, and that the dorsal endopiriform nucleus (DEnD) contains architecturally distinct compartments. Furthermore, the dorsal subdivision of the DEnD is tractographically distinguishable from the insular claustrum with respect to cortical connections.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00094</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The insular cortex has been linked to a multitude of functions. In contrast, the nearby claustrum is a densely connected subcortical region with unclear function. To view the insula-claustrum region from the molecular perspective we analyzed the transcriptomic profile of these areas in six adult and four fetal human brains. We identified marker genes with specific expression and performed transcriptome-wide tests for enrichment of biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components. In addition, specific insular and claustral expression of genes pertaining to diseases, addiction, and depression was tested. At the anatomical level, we used brain-wide analyses to determine the specificity of our results and to determine the transcriptomic similarity of the insula-claustrum region. We found UCMA to be the most significantly enriched gene in the insular cortex and confirmed specific expression of NR4A2, NTNG2, and LXN in the claustrum. Furthermore, the insula was found to have enriched expression of genes associated with mood disorders, learning, cardiac muscle contraction, oxygen transport, glutamate and dopamine signaling. Specific expression in the claustrum was enriched for genes pertaining to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), severe intellectual disability, epileptic encephalopathy, intracellular transport, spine development, and macroautophagy. We tested for enrichment of genes related to addiction and depression, but they were generally not highly specific to the insula-claustrum region. Exceptions include high insular expression of genes linked to cocaine abuse and genes associated with ever smoking in the claustrum. Brain-wide, we find that markers of the adult claustrum are most specifically expressed in the fetal and adult insula. Altogether, our results provide a novel molecular perspective on the unique properties of the insula and claustrum.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00330</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Declining serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D, a biomarker of vitamin D status] with aging is a well-recognized phenomenon. However, scarce information is available on the relation between 25(OH)D levels and cognitive performance over time in older individuals. Our purpose was to evaluate, longitudinally, the association of 25(OH)D with cognitive function in a healthy older adults’ cohort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Sixty-four individuals over 55 years-old with no cognitive impairment, clustered as healthy “Poor” and “Good” cognitive performers, were followed for an average of 18 months. Seasonal-adjusted 25(OH)D serum levels (measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry) were related, longitudinally, with cognitive (memory and general/executive) composite scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Overall seasonal-adjusted median serum 25(OH)D level was of 47 nmol/l [interquartile range (IQR), 38–60 nmol/l]. A negative correlation between baseline 25(OH)D and the general/executive composite score was found in the “Poor” cognitive performers (r&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; = −0.52, p = 0.006), an association lost after adjusting 25(OH)D levels for the season. No effect was found in both groups between seasonal-adjusted 25(OH)D levels and the variation of both memory and general/executive composites during follow-up when adjusted for age, gender and education level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: In this healthy older population with no cognitive impairment, lower serum levels of 25(OH)D were not longitudinally associated with poorer cognitive scores.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53400</link>
	<content:encoded>In contrast to most voltage-gated ion channels, hyperpolarization- and cAMP gated (HCN) ion channels open on hyperpolarization. Structure-function studies show that the voltage-sensor of HCN channels are unique but the mechanisms that determine gating polarity remain poorly understood. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations (~20 ms) of HCN1 channel under hyperpolarization reveals an initial downward movement of the S4 voltage-sensor but following the transfer of last gating charge, the S4 breaks into two sub-helices with the lower sub-helix becoming parallel to the membrane. Functional studies on bipolar channels show that the gating polarity strongly correlates with helical turn propensity of the substituents at the breakpoint. Remarkably, in a proto-HCN background, the replacement of breakpoint serine with a bulky hydrophobic amino acid is sufficient to completely flip the gating polarity from inward to outward-rectifying. Our studies reveal an unexpected mechanism of inward rectification involving a linker sub-helix emerging from HCN S4 during hyperpolarization.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/50026</link>
	<content:encoded>Intracellular &lt;i&gt;Wolbachia&lt;/i&gt; bacteria manipulate arthropod reproduction to promote their own inheritance. The most prevalent mechanism, cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), traces to a &lt;i&gt;Wolbachia&lt;/i&gt; deubiquitylase, CidB, and CidA. CidB has properties of a toxin, while CidA binds CidB and rescues embryonic viability. CidB is also toxic to yeast where we identified both host effects and high-copy suppressors of toxicity. The strongest suppressor was karyopherin-α, a nuclear-import receptor; this required nuclear localization-signal binding. A protein-interaction screen of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; extracts using a substrate-trapping catalytic mutant, CidB*, also identified karyopherin-α; the P32 protamine-histone exchange factor bound as well. When CidB* bound CidA, these host protein interactions disappeared. These associations would place CidB at the zygotic male pronucleus where CI defects first manifest. Overexpression of karyopherin-α, P32, or CidA in female flies suppressed CI. We propose that CidB targets nuclear-protein import and protamine-histone exchange and that CidA rescues embryos by restricting CidB access to its targets.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/49956</link>
	<content:encoded>The molecular codes underpinning the functions of plant NLR immune receptors are poorly understood. We used &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; Mu transposition to generate a random truncation library and identify the minimal functional region of NLRs. We applied this method to NRC4—a helper NLR that functions with multiple sensor NLRs within a Solanaceae receptor network. This revealed that the NRC4 N-terminal 29 amino acids are sufficient to induce hypersensitive cell death. This region is defined by the consensus MADAxVSFxVxKLxxLLxxEx (MADA motif) that is conserved at the N-termini of NRC family proteins and ~20% of coiled-coil (CC)-type plant NLRs. The MADA motif matches the N-terminal a1 helix of Arabidopsis NLR protein ZAR1, which undergoes a conformational switch during resistosome activation. Immunoassays revealed that the MADA motif is functionally conserved across NLRs from distantly related plant species. NRC-dependent sensor NLRs lack MADA sequences indicating that this motif has degenerated in sensor NLRs over evolutionary time.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/49915</link>
	<content:encoded>In area CA1 of the hippocampus, the selection of place cells to represent a new environment is biased towards neurons with higher excitability. However, different environments are represented by orthogonal cell ensembles, suggesting that regulatory mechanisms exist. Activity-dependent plasticity of intrinsic excitability, as observed in vitro, is an attractive candidate. Here, using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of CA1 pyramidal neurons in anesthetized rats, we have examined how inducing theta-bursts of action potentials affects their intrinsic excitability over time. We observed a long-lasting, homeostatic depression of intrinsic excitability which commenced within minutes, and, in contrast to in vitro observations, was not mediated by dendritic I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;. Instead, it was attenuated by the Kv1.1 channel blocker dendrotoxin K, suggesting an axonal origin. Analysis of place cells’ out-of-field firing in mice navigating in virtual reality further revealed an experience-dependent reduction consistent with decreased excitability. We propose that this mechanism could reduce memory interference.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/49314</link>
	<content:encoded>Cytokines activate signaling via assembly of cell surface receptors, but it is unclear whether modulation of cytokine-receptor binding parameters can modify biological outcomes. We have engineered IL-6 variants with different affinities to gp130 to investigate how cytokine receptor binding dwell-times influence functional selectivity. Engineered IL-6 variants showed a range of signaling amplitudes and induced biased signaling, with changes in receptor binding dwell-times affecting more profoundly STAT1 than STAT3 phosphorylation. We show that this differential signaling arises from defective translocation of ligand-gp130 complexes to the endosomal compartment and competitive STAT1/STAT3 binding to phospho-tyrosines in gp130, and results in unique patterns of STAT3 binding to chromatin. This leads to a graded gene expression response and differences in &lt;i&gt;ex vivo &lt;/i&gt;differentiation of Th17, Th1 and Treg cells. These results provide a molecular understanding of signaling biased by cytokine receptors, and demonstrate that manipulation of signaling thresholds is a useful strategy to decouple cytokine functional pleiotropy.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The computations and neural processes underpinning decision making have primarily been investigated using highly simplified tasks in which stimulus onsets cue observers to start accumulating choice-relevant information. Yet, in daily life we are rarely afforded the luxury of knowing precisely when choice-relevant information will appear. Here, we examined neural indices of decision formation while subjects discriminated subtle stimulus feature changes whose timing relative to stimulus onset ('foreperiod') was uncertain. Joint analysis of behavioural error patterns and neural decision signal dynamics indicated that subjects systematically began the accumulation process before any informative evidence was presented, and further, that accumulation onset timing varied systematically as a function of the foreperiod of the preceding trial. These results suggest that the brain can adjust to temporal uncertainty by strategically modulating accumulation onset timing according to statistical regularities in the temporal structure of the sensory environment with particular emphasis on recent experience.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The role of intracellular interactions in the collective polarization of tissues and its interplay with cellular geometry</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/Dn6nYNWsqt8/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Shahriar Shadkhoo, Madhav Mani&lt;/p&gt;

Planar cell polarity (PCP), the long-range in-plane polarization of epithelial tissues, provides directional information that guides a multitude of developmental processes at cellular and tissue levels. While it is manifest that cells utilize both intracellular and intercellular interactions, the coupling between the two modules, essential to the coordination of collective polarization, remains an active area of investigation. We propose a generalized reaction-diffusion model to study the role of intracellular interactions in the emergence of long-range polarization, and show that the nonlocality of cytoplasmic interactions, i.e. coupling of membrane proteins localized on different cell-cell junctions, is of vital importance to the faithful detection of weak directional signals, and becomes increasingly more crucial to the stability of polarization against the deleterious effects of large geometric irregularities. We demonstrate that nonlocal interactions are necessary for geometric information to become accessible to the PCP components. The prediction of the model regarding polarization in elongated tissues, is shown to be in agreement with experimental observations, where the polarity emerges perpendicular to the axis of elongation. Core PCP is adopted as a model pathway, in term of which we interpret the model parameters. To this end, we introduce three distinct classes of mutations, (I) in membrane proteins, (II) in cytoplasmic proteins, and (III) local enhancement of geometric disorder. Comparing the &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; phenotypes, we show that our model successfully recapitulates the salient phenotypic features of these mutations. Exploring the parameter space helps us shed light on the role of cytoplasmic proteins in cell-cell communications, and make falsifiable predictions regarding the cooperation of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins in the establishment of long-range polarization.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Dn6nYNWsqt8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pallido‐nigro‐luysian (PNL) system, the primary component of cortico‐subcortical circuits, is generally spared in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We evaluated the clinicopathological features of an unusual form of ALS with PNL degeneration (PNLD) and assessed whether ALS with PNLD represents a distinct ALS subtype.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a cohort of 97 autopsied cases of sporadic ALS with phosphorylated 43‐kDa TAR DNA‐binding protein (pTDP‐43) inclusions, we selected those with PNLD and analyzed their clinicopathological features.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eleven cases (11%) that showed PNLD were divided into two subtypes depending on the lesion distribution: i) &lt;i&gt;extensive type&lt;/i&gt; (n = 6) showing widespread TDP‐43 pathology and multisystem degeneration, both involving the PNL system, and ii) &lt;i&gt;limited type&lt;/i&gt; (n = 5) showing selective PNL and motor system involvement, thus being unclassifiable in terms of Brettschneiderʼs staging or Nishihiraʼs typing of ALS. The &lt;i&gt;limited type&lt;/i&gt; showed a younger age at onset and predominant PNLD that accounted for the early development of extrapyramidal signs. The &lt;i&gt;limited type&lt;/i&gt; exhibited the heaviest pathology in the subthalamus and external globus pallidus, suggesting that TDP‐43 inclusions propagated via indirect or hyperdirect pathways, unlike ALS without PNLD where the direct pathway is considered to convey TDP‐43 aggregates from the cerebral cortex to the substantia nigra.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PNL system can be involved in the disease process of ALS, either non‐selectively as part of multisystem degeneration, or selectively. ALS with selective involvement of the PNL and motor systems exhibits unique clinicopathological features and TDP‐43 propagation routes, thus representing a distinct subtype of ALS.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>RSS PAP: Charge-Balanced Electrical Stimulation Can Modulate Neural Precursor Cell Migration in the Presence of Endogenous Electric Fields in Mouse Brains</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0382-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Electric fields can direct cell migration and are crucial during development and tissue repair. We previously reported neural precursor cells are electrosensitive cells that can undergo rapid and directed migration towards the cathode using charge-balanced electrical stimulation &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we investigate the ability of electrical stimulation to direct neural precursor migration in mouse brains &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. To visualize migration, fluorescent adult murine neural precursors were transplanted onto the corpus callosum of adult male mice and intracortical platinum wire electrodes were implanted medial (cathode) and lateral (anode) to the injection site. We applied a charge-balanced biphasic monopolar stimulation waveform for 3 sessions per day, for 3 or 6 days. Irrespective of stimulation, the transplanted neural precursors had a propensity to migrate laterally along the corpus callosum, and applied stimulation affected that migration. Further investigation revealed an endogenous electric field along the corpus callosum that correlated with the lateral migration, suggesting that the applied electric field would need to overcome endogenous cues. There was no difference in transplanted cell differentiation and proliferation, or inflammatory cell numbers near the electrode leads and injection site comparing stimulated and implanted non-stimulated brains. Our results support that endogenous and applied electric fields are important considerations for designing cell therapies for tissue repair &lt;i&gt;in vivo.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The study of electricity in biological environments outside of the well-known action potential is becoming more prominent. Applied electrical stimulation is used clinically and can modulate cell behaviour. Endogenous electric fields exist in the adult brain along the rostral migratory stream and disrupting them can reverse the migration direction of neural precursor cells. We demonstrate that an endogenous electric field exists on the corpus callosum which correlates with the preferred lateral migration of transplanted neural precursor cells. Endogenous electric fields in the brain provide migratory cues that can impact neural repair.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: The importance of considering model choices when interpreting results in computational neuroimaging</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0196-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Model-based analyses open exciting opportunities for understanding neural information processing. In a commentary published in &lt;i&gt;eNeuro&lt;/i&gt;, Gardner &amp;amp; Liu (2019) discuss the role of model specification in interpreting results derived from complex models of neural data. As a case study, they suggest that one such analysis, the inverted encoding model (IEM), should not be used to assay properties of &quot;stimulus representations&quot; because the ability to apply linear transformations at various stages of the analysis procedure renders results &quot;arbitrary&quot;. Here, we argue that the &lt;i&gt;specification&lt;/i&gt; of all models is arbitrary to the extent that an experimenter makes choices based on current knowledge of the model system. However, the &lt;i&gt;results&lt;/i&gt; derived from any given model, such as the reconstructed channel response profiles obtained from an IEM analysis, are uniquely defined and are arbitrary only in the sense that changes in the model can predictably change results. IEM-based channel response profiles should therefore not be considered arbitrary when the model is clearly specified and guided by our best understanding of neural population representations in the brain regions being analyzed. Intuitions derived from this case study are important to consider when interpreting results from all model-based analyses, which are similarly contingent upon the specification of the models used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Gardner &amp;amp; Liu (2019) point out that linear models can provide equally good fits to data across a class of linear transforms applied during analysis. They suggest this is particularly problematic for one analysis method – the inverted encoding model – that uses activation patterns to estimate responses in modeled information channels, as this renders results arbitrary. Instead, we argue results are not arbitrary when considered in the context of a well-motivated model. Of course, changing model properties can change results, but this applies to all model-based analyses, regardless of inversion. Changing properties of models to recover desired results without disclosure is always ill-advised. When used properly, especially to compare population-level response profiles across conditions, these approaches remain useful tools.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25643?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To analyze why numerous acute stroke treatments were successful in the laboratory but failed in large clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We searched all phase 3 trials of medical treatments for acute ischemic stroke and corresponding early clinical and experimental studies. We compared the overall efficacy and assessed the impact of publication bias and study design on the efficacy. Furthermore, we estimated power and true report probability of experimental studies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified 50 phase 3 trials with 46,008 subjects, 75 early clinical trials with 12,391 subjects, and 209 experimental studies with &amp;gt;7,141 subjects. Three (6%) phase 3, 24 (32%) early clinical, and 143 (69.08%) experimental studies were positive. The mean treatment effect was 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.70–0.83) in experimental studies, 0.87 (95% CI = 0.71–1.06) in early clinical trials, and 1.00 (95% CI = 0.95–1.06) in phase 3 trials. Funnel plot asymmetry and trim‐and‐fill revealed a clear publication bias in experimental studies and early clinical trials. Study design and adherence to quality criteria had a considerable impact on estimated effect sizes. The mean power of experimental studies was 17%. Assuming a bias of 30% and pre‐study odds of 0.5 to 0.7, this leads to a true report probability of &amp;lt;50%.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pivotal study design differences between experimental studies and clinical trials, including different primary end points and time to treatment, publication bias, neglected quality criteria and low power, contribute to the stepwise efficacy decline of stroke treatments from experimental studies to phase 3 clinical trials. Even under conservative estimates, less than half of published positive experimental stroke studies are truly positive. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Therapeutic Drug Monitoring of Newer Antiepileptic Drugs: A Randomized Trial for Dosage Adjustment</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25641?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is widely established for older generation AEDs, whereas there is limited evidence about newer AEDs. Our aim is to assess the benefit of TDM of newer generation AEDs in epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed a randomized, controlled trial comparing systematic with rescue TDM of lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, brivaracetam, zonisamide, or pregabalin. Participants were adults with epilepsy, in whom treatment with newer generation AEDs was initiated or needed adjustment. In the systematic TDM arm, AED plasma levels were available at each appointment, whereas in the rescue TDM arm, levels were known only if a study endpoint was reached (inefficacy or adverse events). The primary outcome was the proportion of participants followed 1 year without reaching one of the predefined endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 151 participants were enrolled; global retention in the study was similar in both arms (56% overall, 58% in the systematic, and 53% in the rescue TDM arm, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.6, Cox regression). There was no difference in terms of outcome regarding treatment efficacy or tolerability. Partial adherence of clinicians to TDM (adjusting or not AED dosage based on blood levels) did not explain this lack of benefit.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study provides class A evidence that systematic drug level monitoring of newer generation AEDs does not bring tangible benefits in the management of patients with epilepsy. Poor correlation between clinical effects and drug levels likely accounts for this finding. However, TDM is useful in several situations, such as pregnancy, as well as when there are compliance issues. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Functional Assessment In Vivo of the Mouse Homolog of the Human Ala-9-Ser NHE6 Variant</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/6/ENEURO.0046-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Christianson syndrome (CS) is an X-linked neurogenetic disorder resulting from loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in &lt;i&gt;SLC9A6&lt;/i&gt;, which encodes the endosomal Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; exchanger 6 (NHE6). NHE6 regulates proton efflux from endosomes and, thus, participates in regulating cargo processing and trafficking. LoF mutations in NHE6 cause aberrant acidification of endosomes. While CS arises in males generally due to clear LoF mutations, other potentially hypomorphic variants have emerged, yet most of these variants have not been evaluated for functional effects, particularly &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Here we characterize an &lt;i&gt;SLC9A6&lt;/i&gt; variant that has been previously reported in patients, yet now also appears in exome datasets of largely control individuals—c.25G&amp;gt;T, p.A9S. By heterologous expression in cell lines, we show that human NHE6A9S is expressed and localizes in a manner comparable to control NHE6. By genome editing, we generated the equivalent NHE6 mutation in mouse—p.A11S—and determined that male NHE6A11S mice have normal brain size at 6 months of age and do not show cerebellar degeneration or defective neuronal arborization. Neurons from male NHE6A11S mice also did not demonstrate an abnormality in intraendosomal pH compared with controls. These findings are in contrast to findings in NHE6-null mice previously reported and indicate that the NHE6A11S variant functions at a level equivalent to control NHE6 for many of the assays performed. These data stand in support of the population genetic data, which are also evaluated here, indicating that the A9S variant is unlikely to confer disease susceptibility with high penetrance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11024</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Currently, the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is dependent upon
a subjective, time-consuming evaluation of behavioral tests by an expert
clinician. Non-invasive functional MRI (fMRI) characterizes brain connectivity
and may be used to inform diagnoses and democratize medicine. However,
successful construction of deep learning models from fMRI requires addressing
key choices about the model's architecture, including the number of layers and
number of neurons per layer. Meanwhile, deriving functional connectivity (FC)
features from fMRI requires choosing an atlas with an appropriate level of
granularity. Once a model has been built, it is vital to determine which
features are predictive of ASD and if similar features are learned across atlas
granularity levels. To identify aptly suited architectural configurations,
probability distributions of the configurations of high versus low performing
models are compared. To determine the effect of atlas granularity, connectivity
features are derived from atlases with 3 levels of granularity and important
features are ranked with permutation feature importance. Results show the
highest performing models use between 2-4 hidden layers and 16-64 neurons per
layer, granularity dependent. Connectivity features identified as important
across all 3 atlas granularity levels include FC to the supplementary motor
gyrus and language association cortex, regions associated with deficits in
social and sensory processing in ASD. Importantly, the cerebellum, often not
included in functional analyses, is also identified as a region whose abnormal
connectivity is highly predictive of ASD. Results of this study identify
important regions to include in future studies of ASD, help assist in the
selection of network architectures, and help identify appropriate levels of
granularity to facilitate the development of accurate diagnostic models of ASD.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Motivated by the celebrated discrete-time model of nervous activity outlined
by McCulloch and Pitts in 1943, we propose a novel continuous-time model, the
McCulloch-Pitts network (MPN), for sequence learning in spiking neural
networks. Our model has a local learning rule, such that the synaptic weight
updates depend only on the information directly accessible by the synapse. By
exploiting asymmetry in the connections between binary neurons, we show that
MPN can be trained to robustly memorize multiple spatiotemporal patterns of
binary vectors, generalizing the ability of the symmetric Hopfield network to
memorize static spatial patterns. In addition, we demonstrate that the model
can efficiently learn sequences of binary pictures as well as generative models
for experimental neural spike-train data. Our learning rule is consistent with
spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), thus providing a theoretical ground
for the systematic design of biologically inspired networks with large and
robust long-range sequence storage capacity.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10617</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transgender individuals show brain structural alterations that differ from
their biological sex as well as their perceived gender. To substantiate
evidence that the brain structure of transgender individuals differs from male
and female, we use a combined multivariate and univariate approach. Gray matter
segments resulting from voxel-based morphometry preprocessing of N = 1753
cisgender (CG) healthy participants were used to train (N = 1402) and validate
(20% hold-out N = 351) a support vector machine classifying the biological sex.
As a second validation, we classified N = 1104 patients with depression. A
third validation was performed using the matched CG sample of the transgender
women (TW) application sample. Subsequently, the classifier was applied to N =
25 TW. Finally, we compared brain volumes of CG-men, women and TW pre/post
treatment (CHT) in a univariate analysis controlling for sexual orientation,
age and total brain volume. The application of our biological sex classifier to
the transgender sample resulted in a significantly lower true positive rate
(TPR-male = 56.0%). The TPR did not differ between CG-individuals with
(TPR-male = 86.9%) and without depression (TPR-male = 88.5%). The univariate
analysis of the transgender application sample revealed that TW pre/post
treatment show brain structural differences from CG-women and CG-men in the
putamen and insula, as well as the whole-brain analysis. Our results support
the hypothesis that brain structure in TW differs from brain structure of their
biological sex (male) as well as their perceived gender (female). This finding
substantiates evidence that transgender individuals show specific brain
structural alterations leading to a different pattern of brain structure than
CG individuals.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Animal behavior is often quantified through subjective, incomplete variables
that may mask essential dynamics. Here, we develop a behavioral state space in
which the full instantaneous state is smoothly unfolded as a combination of
short-time posture dynamics. Our technique is tailored to multivariate
observations and extends previous reconstructions through the use of maximal
prediction. Applied to high-resolution video recordings of the roundworm
\textit{C. elegans}, we discover a low-dimensional state space dominated by
three sets of cyclic trajectories corresponding to the worm's basic stereotyped
motifs: forward, backward, and turning locomotion. In contrast to this broad
stereotypy, we find variability in the presence of locally-unstable dynamics,
and this unpredictability shows signatures of deterministic chaos: a collection
of unstable periodic orbits together with a positive maximal Lyapunov exponent.
The full Lyapunov spectrum is symmetric with positive, chaotic exponents
driving variability balanced by negative, dissipative exponents driving
stereotypy. The symmetry is indicative of damped, driven Hamiltonian dynamics
underlying the worm's movement control.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10227</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurological disorder characterized by
gait impairment. PD has no cure, and an impediment to developing a treatment is
the lack of any accepted method to predict disease progression rate. The
primary aim of this study was to develop a model using clinical measures and
biomechanical measures of gait and postural stability to predict an
individual's PD progression over two years. Data from 160 PD subjects were
utilized. Machine learning models, including XGBoost and Feed Forward Neural
Networks, were developed using extensive model optimization and
cross-validation. The highest performing model was a neural network that used a
group of clinical measures, achieved a PPV of 71% in identifying fast
progressors, and explained a large portion (37%) of the variance in an
individual's progression rate on held-out test data. This demonstrates the
potential to predict individual PD progression rate and enrich trials by
analyzing clinical and biomechanical measures with machine learning.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Retinal analysis of a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease with multi-contrast optical coherence tomography. (arXiv:1909.08466v2 [physics.med-ph] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08466</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent Alzheimer's disease (AD) patient studies have focused on retinal
analysis, as the retina is the only part of the central nervous system which
can be imaged non-invasively by optical methods. However as this is a
relatively new approach, the occurrence and role of pathological features such
as retinal layer thinning, extracellular amyloid beta (A$\beta$) accumulation
and vascular changes is still debated. Animal models of AD are therefore often
used in attempts to understand the disease. In this work, both eyes of 24
APP/PS1 transgenic mice (age: 45-104 weeks) and 15 age-matched wildtype
littermates were imaged by a custom-built multi-contrast optical coherence
tomography (OCT) system. The system provided a combination of standard
reflectivity data, polarization-sensitive data and OCT angiograms. This
tri-fold contrast provided qualitative and quantitative information on retinal
layer thickness and structure, presence of hyper-reflective foci, phase
retardation abnormalities and retinal vasculature. While abnormal structural
properties and phase retardation signals were observed in the retinas, the
observations were very similar in transgenic and control mice. At the end of
the experiment, retinas and brains were harvested from a subset of the mice (14
transgenic, 7 age-matched control) in order to compare the in vivo results to
histological analysis, and to quantify the cortical A$\beta$ plaque load.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Information capacity of a network of spiking neurons. (arXiv:1906.05584v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05584</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We study a model of spiking neurons, with recurrent connections that result
from learning a set of spatio-temporal patterns with a spike-timing dependent
plasticity rule and a global inhibition. We investigate the ability of the
network to store and selectively replay multiple patterns of spikes, with a
combination of spatial population and phase-of-spike code. Each neuron in a
pattern is characterized by a binary variable determining if the neuron is
active in the pattern, and a phase-lag variable representing the spike-timing
order among the active units. After the learning stage, we study the dynamics
of the network induced by a brief cue stimulation, and verify that the network
is able to selectively replay the pattern correctly and persistently. We
calculate the information capacity of the network, defined as the maximum
number of patterns that can be encoded in the network times the number of bits
carried by each pattern, normalized by the number of synapses, and find that it
can reach a value $\alpha_\text{max}\simeq 0.27$, similar to the one of
sequence processing neural networks, and almost double of the capacity of the
static Hopfield model. We study the dependence of the capacity on the global
inhibition, connection strength (or neuron threshold) and fraction of neurons
participating to the patterns. The results show that a dual population and
temporal coding can be optimal for the capacity of an associative memory.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Quantum calcium-ion interactions with EEG. (arXiv:0903.1856v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.1856</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Previous papers have developed a statistical mechanics of neocortical
interactions (SMNI) fit to short-term memory and EEG data. Adaptive Simulated
Annealing (ASA) has been developed to perform fits to such nonlinear stochastic
systems. An N-dimensional path-integral algorithm for quantum systems,
qPATHINT, has been developed from classical PATHINT. Both fold short-time
propagators (distributions or wave functions) over long times. Previous papers
applied qPATHINT to two systems, in neocortical interactions and financial
options. \textbf{Objective}: In this paper the quantum path-integral for
Calcium ions is used to derive a closed-form analytic solution at arbitrary
time that is used to calculate interactions with classical-physics SMNI
interactions among scales. Using fits of this SMNI model to EEG data, including
these effects, will help determine if this is a reasonable approach.
\textbf{Method}: Methods of mathematical-physics for optimization and for path
integrals in classical and quantum spaces are used for this project. Studies
using supercomputer resources tested various dimensions for their scaling
limits. In this paper the quantum path-integral is used to derive a closed-form
analytic solution at arbitrary time that is used to calculate interactions with
classical-physics SMNI interactions among scales. \textbf{Results}: The
mathematical-physics and computer parts of the study are successful, in that
there is modest improvement of cost/objective functions used to fit EEG data
using these models. \textbf{Conclusion}: This project points to directions for
more detailed calculations using more EEG data and qPATHINT at each time slice
to propagate quantum calcium waves, synchronized with PATHINT propagation of
classical SMNI.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Effect of Prior Direction Expectation on the Accuracy and Precision of Smooth Pursuit Eye Movements</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00071</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The integration of sensory with top–down cognitive signals for generating appropriate sensory–motor behaviors is an important issue in understanding the brain’s information processes. Recent studies have demonstrated that the interplay between sensory and high-level signals in oculomotor behavior could be explained by Bayesian inference. Specifically, prior knowledge for motion speed introduces a bias in the speed of smooth pursuit eye movements. The other important prediction of Bayesian inference is variability reduction by prior expectation; however, there is insufficient evidence in oculomotor behaviors to support this prediction. In the present study, we trained monkeys to switch the prior expectation about motion direction and independently controlled the strength of the motion stimulus. Under identical sensory stimulus conditions, we tested if prior knowledge about the motion direction reduced the variability of open-loop smooth pursuit eye movements. We observed a significant reduction when the prior expectation was strong; this was consistent with the prediction of Bayesian inference. Taking advantage of the open-loop smooth pursuit, we investigated the temporal dynamics of the effect of the prior to the pursuit direction bias and variability. This analysis demonstrated that the strength of the sensory evidence depended not only on the strength of the sensory stimulus but also on the time required for the pursuit system to form a neural sensory representation. Finally, we demonstrated that the variability and directional bias change by prior knowledge were quantitatively explained by the Bayesian observer model.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00289</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder categorized by severe disability in intellectual functions and affected by the loss of function of maternally inherited UBE3A gene. Mice deficient for the maternal Ube3a recapitulates many distinguishing behavioral features of the AS and is used as a typical model system to understand the disease pathogenic mechanism. Here, we first show a significant increase in HDAC1 and HDAC2 activities in AS mice brain from as early as embryonic day 16(E16). In depth study further reveals that the deficiency of Ube3a leads to transcriptional up-regulation of both HDAC1 and HDAC2. Restoration of HDAC1 and HDAC2 activities (as evident from the increased acetylation of histones H3 and H4) using simvastatin significantly improves the cognitive deficit and social interaction behavior in AS mice. Simvastatin treatment also restores the reduced level of BDNF in AS mice brain. Finally, we demonstrate that the treatment of simvastatin to primary cortical neuronal culture prepared from AS mice embryo also rescues altered acetylation of histones H3 and H4 and the level of BDNF. These results suggest that simvastatin could be a promising drug for the treatment of AS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00286</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) is involved in neuronal differentiation. This study aimed to identify the biosynthetic enzymes responsible for 2-AG production during retinoic acid (RA)-induced neurite outgrowth of Neuro-2a cells. First, we confirmed that RA stimulation of Neuro-2a cells increases 2-AG production and neurite outgrowth. The diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL) inhibitor DH376 blocked 2-AG production and reduced neuronal differentiation. Surprisingly, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockdown of DAGLα and DAGLβ in Neuro-2a cells did not reduce 2-AG levels, suggesting another enzyme capable of producing 2-AG in this cell line. Chemical proteomics revealed DAGLβ and α,β-hydrolase domain containing protein (ABHD6) as the only targets of DH376 in Neuro-2a cells. Biochemical, genetic and lipidomic studies demonstrated that ABHD6 possesses DAGL activity in conjunction with its previously reported monoacylglycerol lipase activity. RA treatment of Neuro-2a cells increased by three-fold the amount of active ABHD6. Our study shows that ABHD6 exhibits significant DAG lipase activity in Neuro-2a cells in addition to its known MAG lipase activity and suggest it is involved in neuronal differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Transcriptional Profiling of Non-injured Nociceptors After Spinal Cord Injury Reveals Diverse Molecular Changes</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00284</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) has devastating implications for patients, including a high predisposition for developing chronic pain distal to the site of injury. Chronic pain develops weeks to months after injury, consequently, patients are treated after irreparable changes have occurred. Nociceptors are central to chronic pain; however, the diversity of this cellular population presents challenges to understanding mechanisms and attributing pain modalities to specific cell types. To begin to address how peripheral sensory neurons below the injury level may contribute to the below-level pain reported by SCI patients, we examined SCI-induced changes in gene expression in lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRG) below the site of injury. SCI was performed at the T10 vertebral level, with injury produced by a vessel clip with a closing pressure of 15 g for 1 min. Alterations in gene expression produce long-term sensory changes, therefore, we were interested in studying SCI-induced transcripts before the onset of chronic pain, which may trigger changes in downstream signaling pathways and ultimately facilitate the transmission of pain. To examine changes in the nociceptor subpopulation in DRG distal to the site of injury, we retrograde labeled sensory neurons projecting to the hairy hindpaw skin with fluorescent dye and collected the corresponding lumbar (L2–L6) DRG 4 days post-injury. Following dissociation, labeled neurons were purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). RNA was extracted from sorted sensory neurons of naïve, sham, or SCI mice and sequenced. Transcript abundances validated that the desired population of nociceptors were isolated. Cross-comparisons to data sets from similar studies confirmed, we were able to isolate our cells of interest and identify a unique pattern of gene expression within a subpopulation of neurons projecting to the hairy hindpaw skin. Differential gene expression analysis showed high expression levels and significant transcript changes 4 days post-injury in SCI cell populations relevant to the onset of chronic pain. Regulatory interrelationships predicted by pathway analysis implicated changes within the synaptogenesis signaling pathway as well as networks related to inflammatory signaling mechanisms, suggesting a role for synaptic plasticity and a correlation with pro-inflammatory signaling in the transition from acute to chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Classification of Multiple Psychological Dimensions in Computer Game Players Using Physiology, Performance, and Personality Characteristics</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01278</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human psychological (cognitive and affective) dimensions can be assessed using several methods, such as physiological or performance measurements. To date, however, few studies have compared different data modalities with regard to their ability to enable accurate classification of different psychological dimensions. This study thus compares classification accuracies for four psychological dimensions and two subjective preferences about computer game difficulty using three data modalities: physiology, performance, and personality characteristics. Thirty participants played a computer game at nine difficulty configurations that were implemented via two difficulty parameters. In each configuration, seven physiological measurements and two performance variables were recorded. A short questionnaire was filled out to assess the perceived difficulty, enjoyment, valence, arousal, and the way the participant would like to modify the two difficulty parameters. Furthermore, participants’ personality characteristics were assessed using four questionnaires. All combinations of the three data modalities (physiology, performance, and personality) were used to classify six dimensions of the short questionnaire into either two, three or many classes using four classifier types: linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine (SVM), ensemble decision tree, and multiple linear regression. The classification accuracy varied widely between the different psychological dimensions; the highest accuracies for two-class and three-class classification were 97.6 and 84.1%, respectively. Normalized physiological measurements were the most informative data modality, though current game difficulty, personality and performance also contributed to classification accuracy; the best selected features are presented and discussed in the text. The SVM and multiple linear regression were the most accurate classifiers, with regression being more effective for normalized physiological data. In the future, we will further examine the effect of different classification approaches on user experience by detecting the user’s psychological state and adapting game difficulty in real-time. This will allow us to obtain a complete picture of the performance of affect-aware systems in both an offline (classification accuracy) and real-time (effect on user experience) fashion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: A Data-Driven Measure of Effective Connectivity Based on Renyi's α-Entropy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01277</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transfer entropy (TE) is a model-free effective connectivity measure based on information theory. It has been increasingly used in neuroscience because of its ability to detect unknown non-linear interactions, which makes it well suited for exploratory brain effective connectivity analyses. Like all information theoretic quantities, TE is defined regarding the probability distributions of the system under study, which in practice are unknown and must be estimated from data. Commonly used methods for TE estimation rely on a local approximation of the probability distributions from nearest neighbor distances, or on symbolization schemes that then allow the probabilities to be estimated from the symbols' relative frequencies. However, probability estimation is a challenging problem, and avoiding this intermediate step in TE computation is desirable. In this work, we propose a novel TE estimator using functionals defined on positive definite and infinitely divisible kernels matrices that approximate Renyi's entropy measures of order α. Our data-driven approach estimates TE directly from data, sidestepping the need for probability distribution estimation. Also, the proposed estimator encompasses the well-known definition of TE as a sum of Shannon entropies in the limiting case when α → 1. We tested our proposal on a simulation framework consisting of two linear models, based on autoregressive approaches and a linear coupling function, respectively, and on the public electroencephalogram (EEG) database BCI Competition IV, obtained under a motor imagery paradigm. For the synthetic data, the proposed kernel-based TE estimation method satisfactorily identifies the causal interactions present in the data. Also, it displays robustness to varying noise levels and data sizes, and to the presence of multiple interaction delays in the same connected network. Obtained results for the motor imagery task show that our approach codes discriminant spatiotemporal patterns for the left and right-hand motor imagination tasks, with classification performances that compare favorably to the state-of-the-art.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;Electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain–computer interfaces (BCI) in motor imagery (MI) have developed rapidly in recent years. A reliable feature extraction method is essential because of a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and time-dependent covariates of EEG signals. Because of efficient application in various fields, deep learning has been adopted in EEG signal processing and has obtained competitive results compared with the traditional methods. However, designing and training an end-to-end network to fully extract potential features from EEG signals remains a challenge in MI.&lt;/p&gt;Approach&lt;p&gt;In this study, we propose a parallel multiscale filter bank convolutional neural network (MSFBCNN) for MI classification. We introduce a layered end-to-end network structure, in which a feature-extraction network is used to extract temporal and spatial features. To enhance the transfer learning ability, we propose a network initialization and fine-tuning strategy to train an individual model for inter-subject classification on small datasets. We compare our MSFBCNN with the state-of-the-art approaches on open datasets.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The proposed method has a higher accuracy than the baselines in intra-subject classification. In addition, the transfer learning experiments indicate that our network can build an individual model and obtain acceptable results in inter-subject classification. The results suggest that the proposed network has superior performance, robustness, and transfer learning ability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01270</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is a non-invasive diagnostic tool that assesses the muscle inherent properties, whereas ultrasonography can assess the alteration in muscle architecture. This study aimed to combine EIM with ultrasonography to assess the changes of the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle properties during passive plantar/dorsiflexion in stroke survivors. Fifteen patients with subacute stroke were recruited. The muscle structures were simultaneously assessed by EIM and ultrasonography at five different extension angles (−10°, 0°, 10°, 20°, and 30°) of the ankle joint. The EIM parameters measured were resistance (R), reactance (X), and phase angle (θ). The parameters recorded by ultrasonography were pennation angle (PA), muscle thickness (MT), and fascicle length (FL). Two-way repeated ANOVA was performed to compare the differences between the affected and unaffected sides as well as the parameters that changed with joint angle. Linear correlation analysis was conducted to assess the association between muscle parameters and clinical scores. The results showed that as the ankle was passively plantarflexed, the θ (P = 0.003) and PA (P &amp;lt; 0.001) values decreased, and the X (P &amp;lt; 0.001), R (P &amp;lt; 0.001), and FL (P &amp;lt; 0.001) values increased. Significant correlations were found between the FL and R values (r = 0.615, P = 0.015), MT and R values (r = 0.522, P = 0.046), and FL and θ values (r = 0.561, P = 0.03), as well as between the PA and the Fugl–Meyer Assessment of Lower Extremity score (r = 0.615, P = 0.015), the R and the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) score (r = 0.58, P = 0.023), and the PA and the manual muscle testing (MMT) score (r = −0.575, P = 0.025). This study demonstrated a correlation between the EIM and the ultrasonography parameters at different joint angles. Therefore, both methods could jointly be applied in patients with stroke to detect changes in the muscle inherent properties and muscle architecture. This could assist clinicians to quantitatively evaluate the muscle condition in people with subacute stroke. The study was registered on the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (trial registration number: ChiCTR-IOR-17012299, http://www.chictr.org.cn/showprojen.aspx?proj=19818).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration Number: ChiCTR-IOR-17012299.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Modulation of Theta-Band Local Field Potential Oscillations Across Brain Networks With Central Thalamic Deep Brain Stimulation to Enhance Spatial Working Memory</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01269</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a well-established technique for the treatment of movement and psychiatric disorders through the modulation of neural oscillatory activity and synaptic plasticity. The central thalamus (CT) has been indicated as a potential target for stimulation to enhance memory. However, the mechanisms underlying local field potential (LFP) oscillations and memory enhancement by CT-DBS remain unknown. In this study, we used CT-DBS to investigate the mechanisms underlying the changes in oscillatory communication between the CT and hippocampus, both of which are involved in spatial working memory. Local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded from microelectrode array implanted in the CT, dentate gyrus, cornu ammonis (CA) region 1, and CA region 3. Functional connectivity (FC) strength was assessed by LFP–LFP coherence calculations for these brain regions. In addition, a T-maze behavioral task using a rat model was performed to assess the performance of spatial working memory. In DBS group, our results revealed that theta oscillations significantly increased in the CT and hippocampus compared with that in sham controls. As indicated by coherence, the FC between the CT and hippocampus significantly increased in the theta band after CT-DBS. Moreover, Western blotting showed that the protein expressions of the dopamine D1 and α4-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors were enhanced, whereas that of the dopamine D2 receptor decreased in the DBS group. In conclusion, the use of CT-DBS resulted in elevated theta oscillations, increased FC between the CT and hippocampus, and altered synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, suggesting that CT-DBS is an effective approach for improving spatial working memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Repurposing existing drugs represents a promising approach for successful development of acute stroke therapies. In this context, the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin has been shown to exert neuroprotection in mice due to its immunomodulatory properties. Here, we have demonstrated that acute administration of a single dose of azithromycin upon reperfusion produces a dose-dependent (ED&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.40 mg/kg; 95% CI = 0.48–4.03) reduction of ischemic brain damage measured 22 h after transient (2 h) middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) in adult male rats. Neuroprotection by azithromycin (150 mg/kg, i.p., upon reperfusion) was associated with a significant elevation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation in astrocytes and neurons of the peri-ischemic motor cortex as detected after 2 and 22 h of reperfusion. By contrast, in the core region of the striatum, drug administration resulted in a dramatic elevation of STAT3 phosphorylation only after 22 h of reperfusion, being the signal mainly ascribed to infiltrating leukocytes displaying an M2 phenotype. These early molecular events were associated with a long-lasting neuroprotection, since a single dose of azithromycin reduced brain infarct damage and neurological deficit measured up to 7 days of reperfusion. These data, together with the evidence that azithromycin was effective in a clinically relevant time-window (i.e., when administered after 4.5 h of MCAo), provide robust preclinical evidence to support the importance of developing azithromycin as an effective acute therapy for ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: The Impact of Spatial Normalization Strategies on the Temporal Features of the Resting-State Functional MRI: Spatial Normalization Before rs-fMRI Features Calculation May Reduce the Reliability</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01249</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Previous resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) studies frequently applied the spatial normalization on fMRI time series before the calculation of temporal features (here referred to as “Prenorm”). We hypothesized that calculating the rs-fMRI features, for example, functional connectivity (FC), regional homogeneity (ReHo), or amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in individual space, before the spatial normalization (referred to as “Postnorm”) can be an improvement to avoid artifacts and increase the results’ reliability. We utilized two datasets: (1) simulated images where temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) is kept a constant and (2) an empirical fMRI dataset with 50 healthy young subjects. For simulated images, the tSNR is constant as generated in individual space but increased after Prenorm and intersubject variability of tSNR was induced. In contrast, tSNR was kept constant after Postnorm. Consistently, for empirical images, higher tSNR, ReHo, and FC (default mode network, seed in precuneus) and lower ALFF were found after Prenorm compared to those of Postnorm. Coefficient of variability of tSNR and ALFF was higher after Prenorm compared to those of Postnorm. Moreover, the significant correlation was found between simulated tSNR after Prenorm and empirical tSNR, ALFF, and ReHo after Prenorm, indicating algorithmic variation in empirical rs-fMRI features. Furthermore, comparing to Prenorm, ALFF and ReHo showed higher intraclass correlation coefficients between two serial scans after Postnorm. Our results indicated that Prenorm may induce algorithmic intersubject variability on tSNR and reduce its reliability, which also significantly affected ALFF and ReHo. We suggest using Postnorm instead of Prenorm for future rs-fMRI studies using ALFF/ReHo.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurogenesis section | New and Recent Articles: Dimethylsulfoxide Inhibits Oligodendrocyte Fate Choice of Adult Neural Stem and Progenitor Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01242</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Several clinical trials address demyelinating diseases via transplantation of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). Published reports detail that administration of MSCs in patients may provide a beneficial immunomodulation, and that factors secreted by MSCs are potent inducers of oligodendrogenesis. Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) is widely used in life science and medicine as solvent, vehicle or cryoprotectant for cells used in transplantation. Importantly, most transplantation protocols do not include the removal of DMSO before injecting the cell suspension into patients. This indifferent application of DMSO is coming under increasing scrutiny following reports investigating its potential toxic side-effects. While the impact of DMSO on the central nervous system (CNS) has been partially studied, its effect on oligodendrocytes and oligodendrogenesis has not been addressed yet. Consequently, we evaluated the influence of DMSO on oligodendrogenesis, and on the pro-oligodendrogenic effect of MSCs’ secreted factors, using adult rat neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs). Here, we demonstrate that a concentration of 1% DMSO robustly suppressed oligodendrogenesis and drove the fate of differentiating NSPCs toward astrogenesis. Furthermore, the pro-oligodendrogenic effect of MSC-conditioned medium (MSCCM) was also nearly completely abolished by the presence of 1% DMSO. In this condition, inhibition of the Erk1/2 signal transduction pathway and high levels of Id2 expression, a specific inhibitor of oligodendrogenic differentiation, were detected. Furthermore, inflammatory demyelinating diseases may even potentiate the impact of DMSO on oligodendrogenesis. Our results demonstrate the imperative of considering the strong anti-oligodendrogenic activity of DMSO when designing future clinical trial protocols.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01238</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Subarachnoid hemorrhage resulting from intracranial aneurysms (IAs) is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Although trigger mechanisms in the pathogenesis of IAs have not been fully elucidated, accumulating evidence has demonstrated that inflammation acts as a critical contributor to aneurysm pathogenesis. IAs is initiated by disruption and dysfunction of endothelial cells (ECs) caused by abnormal wall shear stress (WSS). Subsequently, vascular inflammation can trigger a series of biochemical reactions resulting in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) apoptosis and migration, accompanied by inflammatory cell infiltration, secretion of various cytokines, and inflammatory factors. These changes result in degradation of vascular wall, leading to the progression and eventual rupture of IAs. Increasing our knowledge of the pathogenesis of these lesions will offer physicians new options for prevention and treatment. In this study, we review aneurysmal pathogenesis to seek for safe, effective, and non-invasive therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: miR-212 and miR-132 Are Downregulated in Neurally Derived Plasma Exosomes of Alzheimer’s Patients</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01208</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It was recently discovered that brain cells release extracellular vesicles (EV) which can pass from brain into blood. These findings raise the possibility that brain-derived EV’s present in blood can be used to monitor disease processes occurring in the cerebrum. Since the levels of certain micro-RNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to be altered in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brain, we sought to assess miRNA dysregulation in AD brain tissue and to determine if these changes were reflected in neural EVs isolated from blood of subjects with AD. To this end, we employed high-content miRNA arrays to search for differences in miRNAs in RNA pools from brain tissue of AD (n = 5), high pathological control (HPC) (n = 5), or cognitively intact pathology-free controls (n = 5). Twelve miRNAs were altered by &amp;gt;1.5-fold in AD compared to controls, and six of these were also changed compared to HPCs. Analysis of hits in brain extracts from 11 AD, 7 HPCs and 9 controls revealed a similar fold difference in these six miRNAs, with three showing statistically significant group differences and one with a strong trend toward group differences. Thereafter, we focused on the four miRNAs that showed group differences and measured their content in neurally derived blood EVs isolated from 63 subjects: 16 patients with early stage dementia and a CSF Aβ42+ tau profile consistent with AD, 16 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and an AD CSF profile, and 31 cognitively intact controls with normal CSF Aβ42+ tau levels. ROC analysis indicated that measurement of miR-132-3p in neurally-derived plasma EVs showed good sensitivity and specificity to diagnose AD, but did not effectively separate individuals with AD-MCI from controls. Moreover, when we measured the levels of a related miRNA, miR-212, we found that this miRNA was also decreased in neural EVs from AD patients compared to controls. Our results suggest that measurement of miR-132 and miR-212 in neural EVs should be further investigated as a diagnostic aid for AD and as a potential theragnostic.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Validation of the Virtual Reality Neuroscience Questionnaire: Maximum Duration of Immersive Virtual Reality Sessions Without the Presence of Pertinent Adverse Symptomatology</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00417</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There are major concerns about the suitability of immersive virtual reality (VR) systems (i.e., head-mounted display; HMD) to be implemented in research and clinical settings, because of the presence of nausea, dizziness, disorientation, fatigue, and instability (i.e., VR induced symptoms and effects; VRISE). Research suggests that the duration of a VR session modulates the presence and intensity of VRISE, but there are no suggestions regarding the appropriate maximum duration of VR sessions. The implementation of high-end VR HMDs in conjunction with ergonomic VR software seems to mitigate the presence of VRISE substantially. However, a brief tool does not currently exist to appraise and report both the quality of software features and VRISE intensity quantitatively. The Virtual Reality Neuroscience Questionnaire (VRNQ) was developed to assess the quality of VR software in terms of user experience, game mechanics, in-game assistance, and VRISE. Forty participants aged between 28 and 43 years were recruited (18 gamers and 22 non-gamers) for the study. They participated in 3 different VR sessions until they felt weary or discomfort and subsequently filled in the VRNQ. Our results demonstrated that VRNQ is a valid tool for assessing VR software as it has good convergent, discriminant, and construct validity. The maximum duration of VR sessions should be between 55 and 70 min when the VR software meets or exceeds the parsimonious cut-offs of the VRNQ and the users are familiarized with the VR system. Also, the gaming experience does not seem to affect how long VR sessions should last. Also, while the quality of VR software substantially modulates the maximum duration of VR sessions, age and education do not. Finally, deeper immersion, better quality of graphics and sound, and more helpful in-game instructions and prompts were found to reduce VRISE intensity. The VRNQ facilitates the brief assessment and reporting of the quality of VR software features and/or the intensity of VRISE, while its minimum and parsimonious cut-offs may appraise the suitability of VR software for implementation in research and clinical settings. The findings of this study contribute to the establishment of rigorous VR methods that are crucial for the viability of immersive VR as a research and clinical tool in cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Action Observation and Effector Independency</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00416</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The finding of reasonably consistent spatial and temporal productions of actions across different body parts has been used to argue in favor of the existence of a high-order representation of motor programs. In these terms, a generalized motor program consists of an abstract memory structure apt to specify a class of non-specific instructions used to guide a broad range of movements (e.g., “grasp,” “bite”). Although a number of studies, using a variety of tasks, have assessed the issue of effector independence in terms of action execution, little is known regarding the issue of effector independence within an action observation context. Here corticospinal excitability (CSE) of the right hand’s first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscles was assessed by means of single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS) during observation of a grasping action performed by the hand, the foot, the mouth, the elbow, or the knee. The results indicate that observing a grasping action performed with different body parts activates the effector typically adopted to execute that action, i.e., the hand. We contend that, as far as grasping is concerned, motor activations by action observation are evident in the muscles typically used to perform the observed action, even when the action is executed with another effector. Nevertheless, some exceptions call for a deeper analysis of motor coding.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: How Cortisol Reactivity Influences Prosocial Decision-Making: The Moderating Role of Sex and Empathic Concern</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00415</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The fight and flight theory and the tend-and-befriend theory suggest two opposite behavioral stress responses, and heterogeneous research results revealed the importance of taking sex into account. The experiment was designed to investigate the effect of stress-related cortisol reactivity on subsequent prosocial decision-making behaviors, and the moderating role of sex and empathic concern (EC) in the process. Sixty-one healthy students (34 women, 27 men) underwent the Trier Social Stress Test for Groups (TSST-G) or the control condition. Subsequently, participants completed three economic tasks—the dictator game, the ultimatum game, and the third-party compensation game. Statistical analyses revealed a significant main effect of cortisol reactivity on individuals’ third-party compensation behaviorssex. A sex-specific effect of stress-related cortisol change on prosocial behaviors was found, with men behaving more generously in the dictator game as stress-related cortisol reactivity increased. Furthermore, the level of EC was found to moderate the association between stress-related cortisol change and prosocial behaviors, that individuals with a low level of EC reported more generosity and third-party compensation behaviors. Overall, the present study contributes to a better understanding of the behavioral stress responses, that individuals whose hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are highly activated in response to stress would exhibit tend-and-befriend responses, but only among men and those with a low level of EC.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Brain Activity During Unilateral Physical and Imagined Isometric Contractions</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00413</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;By convention, it is believed that the ipsilateral side of the body is controlled by the contralateral side of the brain. Past studies measuring brain activity primarily recorded changes before and after an intervention is performed on one side of the body within one hemisphere (usually the contralateral) of the brain. The purpose of this investigation was to observe the brain activity within the left and right hemispheres of the prefrontal and sensorimotor cortices during physical and imagined, dominant and non-dominant unilateral isometric elbow flexion. Fifteen right hand dominant individuals (six males and nine females) between the ages of 18 and 21 performed four different isometric contractions of their biceps brachii at a preacher curl bench: dominant physical contraction (DomCon), non-dominant physical contraction (NonCon), dominant imagined contraction (DomImagine), and non-dominant imagined contraction (NonImagine). Each contraction was sustained for 5 s followed by 30 s of rest. Motor activity-related cortical potential (MRCP) and event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) within the right and left hemispheres of the sensorimotor and prefrontal cortices were determined for each condition at 500–1,000 ms and 2,000–2,500 ms after initiation of contraction. MRCP and ERSP were both changed at the 500–1,000 ms time window for all conditions. Changes in the 2,000–2,500 ms window were most consistently observed during physical contractions. While the changes during DomCon occurred in the left (contralateral) side of the brain, the greatest changes observed in MRCP and ERSP occurred in both sides of the brain during the NonCon condition. Further understanding of bilateral changes in brain activity during unilateral tasks is valuable for improving rehabilitation practices through mental and physical exercise.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00080</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Affective human-robot interaction requires lightweight software and cheap wearable devices that could further this field. However, the estimation of emotions in real-time poses a problem that has not yet been optimized. An optimization is proposed for the emotion estimation methodology including artifact removal, feature extraction, feature smoothing, and brain pattern classification. The challenge of filtering artifacts and extracting features, while reducing processing time and maintaining high accuracy results, is attempted in this work. First, two different approaches for real-time electro-oculographic artifact removal techniques are tested and compared in terms of loss of information and processing time. Second, an emotion estimation methodology is proposed based on a set of stable and meaningful features, a carefully chosen set of electrodes, and the smoothing of the feature space. The methodology has proved to perform on real-time constraints while maintaining high accuracy on emotion estimation on the SEED database, both under subject dependent and subject independent paradigms, to test the methodology on a discrete emotional model with three affective states.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00074</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human brain imaging studies have revealed several regions that are activated in patients with chronic pain. In rodent brains, functional changes due to chronic pain have not been fully elucidated, as brain imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography (PET) require the use of anesthesia to suppress movement. Consequently, conclusions derived from existing imaging studies in rodents may not accurately reflect brain activity under awake conditions. In this study, we used quantitative activation-induced manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging to directly capture the previous brain activity of awake mice. We also observed and quantified the brain activity of the spared nerve injury (SNI) neuropathic pain model during awake conditions. SNI-operated mice exhibited a robust decrease of mechanical nociceptive threshold 14 days after nerve injury. Imaging on SNI-operated mice revealed increased neural activity in the limbic system and secondary somatosensory, sensory-motor, piriform, and insular cortex. We present the first study demonstrating a direct measurement of awake neural activity in a neuropathic pain mouse model.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: c-Abl Deficiency Provides Synaptic Resiliency Against Aβ-Oligomers</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00526</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spine pathology has been implicated in the early onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), where Aβ-Oligomers (AβOs) cause synaptic dysfunction and loss. Previously, we described that pharmacological inhibition of c-Abl prevents AβOs-induced synaptic alterations. Hence, this kinase seems to be a key element in AD progression. Here, we studied the role of c-Abl on dendritic spine morphological changes induced by AβOs using c-Abl null neurons (c-Abl-KO). First, we characterized the effect of c-Abl deficiency on dendritic spine density and found that its absence increases dendritic spine density. While AβOs-treatment reduces the spine number in both wild-type (WT) and c-Abl-KO neurons, AβOs-driven spine density loss was not affected by c-Abl. We then characterized AβOs-induced morphological changes in dendritic spines of c-Abl-KO neurons. AβOs induced a decrease in the number of mushroom spines in c-Abl-KO neurons while preserving the populations of immature stubby, thin, and filopodia spines. Furthermore, synaptic contacts evaluated by PSD95/Piccolo clustering and cell viability were preserved in AβOs-exposed c-Abl-KO neurons. In conclusion, our results indicate that in the presence of AβOs c-Abl participates in synaptic contact removal, increasing susceptibility to AβOs damage. Its deficiency increases the immature spine population reducing AβOs-induced synapse elimination. Therefore, c-Abl signaling could be a relevant actor in the early stages of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00328</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia characterized by the deposition of extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ)-containing plaques, the formation of intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles as well as neuroinflammatory changes. As the key player in the brain innate immune system, microglia has now taken a center stage in AD research. A large number of AD risk loci identified by genome-wide association studies are located in or near the genes highly expressed in microglia. Among them, the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) has drawn much attention. A rare variant in TREM2 increases AD risk with an odds ratio comparable to the strongest genetic risk factor apolipoprotein ε4 allele. In the past 6 years, extensive studies have dissected the mechanisms by which TREM2 and its variants modulate microglial functions impacting amyloid and tau pathologies in both animal models and human studies. In addition to the full-length TREM2, research on the soluble form of TREM2 (sTREM2) has facilitated the translation of preclinical findings on TREM2. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the biology and pathobiology of sTREM2 including its origin, its emergence as a disease biomarker, and its potential neuroprotective functions. These aspects are important for understanding the involvement of sTREM2 in AD pathogenesis and may provide novel insights into applying sTREM2 for AD diagnosis and therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/52765</link>
	<content:encoded>Our behaviour is shaped by its consequences – we seek rewards and avoid harm. It has been reported that individuals vary markedly in their avoidance of detrimental consequences, i.e. in their sensitivity to punishment. The underpinnings of this variability are poorly understood; they may be driven by differences in aversion sensitivity, motivation for reward, and/or instrumental control. We examined these hypotheses by applying several analysis strategies to the behaviour of rats (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 48; 18 female) trained in a conditioned punishment task that permitted concurrent assessment of punishment, reward-seeking, and Pavlovian fear. We show that punishment insensitivity is a unique phenotype, unrelated to differences in reward-seeking and Pavlovian fear, and due to a failure of instrumental control. Subjects insensitive to punishment are afraid of aversive events, they are simply unable to change their behaviour to avoid them.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The computational principles underlying predictive capabilities in animals are poorly understood. Here, we wondered whether predictive models mediating prey capture could be reduced to a simple set of sensorimotor rules performed by a primitive organism. For this task, we chose the larval zebrafish, a tractable vertebrate that pursues and captures swimming microbes. Using a novel naturalistic 3D setup, we show that the zebrafish combines position and velocity perception to construct a future positional estimate of its prey, indicating an ability to project trajectories forward in time. Importantly, the stochasticity in the fish's sensorimotor transformations provides a considerable advantage over equivalent noise-free strategies. This surprising result coalesces with recent findings that illustrate the benefits of biological stochasticity to adaptive behavior. In sum, our study reveals that zebrafish are equipped with a recursive prey capture algorithm, built up from simple stochastic rules, that embodies an implicit predictive model of the world.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/50276</link>
	<content:encoded>Comprehensive knowledge of the host factors required for picornavirus infection would facilitate antiviral development. Here we demonstrate roles for three human genes, &lt;i&gt;TNK2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;WASL&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;NCK1&lt;/i&gt;, in infection by multiple picornaviruses. CRISPR deletion of &lt;i&gt;TNK2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;WASL&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;NCK1&lt;/i&gt; reduced encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), poliovirus and enterovirus D68 infection, and chemical inhibitors of TNK2 and WASL decreased EMCV infection. Reduced EMCV lethality was observed in mice lacking TNK2. TNK2, WASL and NCK1 were important in early stages of the viral lifecycle, and genetic epistasis analysis demonstrated that the three genes function in a common pathway. Mechanistically, reduced internalization of EMCV was observed in TNK2 deficient cells demonstrating that TNK2 functions in EMCV entry. Domain analysis of WASL demonstrated that its actin nucleation activity was necessary to facilitate viral infection. Together, these data support a model wherein TNK2, WASL, and NCK1 comprise a pathway important for multiple picornaviruses.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: The HCN domain couples voltage gating and cAMP response in Hyperpolarization-activated Cyclic Nucleotide-gated channels</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/49672</link>
	<content:encoded>Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels control spontaneous electrical activity in heart and brain. Binding of cAMP to the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (CNBD) facilitates channel opening by relieving a tonic inhibition exerted by the CNBD. Despite high resolution structures of the HCN1 channel in the cAMP bound and unbound states, the structural mechanism coupling ligand binding to channel gating is unknown. Here we show that the recently identified helical HCN-domain (HCND) mechanically couples the CNBD and channel voltage sensing domain (VSD), possibly acting as a sliding crank that converts the planar rotational movement of the CNBD into a rotational upward displacement of the VSD. This mode of operation and its impact on channel gating are confirmed by computational and experimental data showing that disruption of critical contacts between the three domains affects cAMP- and voltage-dependent gating in three HCN isoforms.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Ten simple rules for the computational modeling of behavioral data</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/49547</link>
	<content:encoded>Computational modeling of behavior has revolutionized psychology and neuroscience. By fitting models to experimental data we can probe the algorithms underlying behavior, find neural correlates of computational variables and better understand the effects of drugs, illness and interventions. But with great power comes great responsibility. Here, we offer ten simple rules to ensure that computational modeling is used with care and yields meaningful insights. In particular, we present a beginner-friendly, pragmatic and details-oriented introduction on how to relate models to data. What, exactly, can a model tell us about the mind? To answer this, we apply our rules to the simplest modeling techniques most accessible to beginning modelers and illustrate them with examples and code available online. However, most rules apply to more advanced techniques. Our hope is that by following our guidelines, researchers will avoid many pitfalls and unleash the power of computational modeling on their own data.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A novel network control model for identifying personalized driver genes in cancer</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/9Ha36IUjgX0/article</link>

Although existing computational models have identified many common driver genes, it remains challenging to identify the personalized driver genes by using samples of an individual patient. Recently, the methods of exploiting the structure-based control principles of complex networks provide new clues for identifying minimum number of driver nodes to drive the state transition of large-scale complex networks from an initial state to the desired state. However, the structure-based network control methods cannot be directly applied to identify the personalized driver genes due to the unknown network dynamics of the personalized system. Here we proposed the personalized network control model (PNC) to identify the personalized driver genes by employing the structure-based network control principle on genetic data of individual patients. In PNC model, we firstly presented a paired single sample network construction method to construct the personalized state transition network for capturing the phenotype transitions between healthy and disease states. Then, we designed a novel structure-based network control method from the Feedback Vertex Sets-based control perspective to identify the personalized driver genes. The wide experimental results on 13 cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas firstly showed that PNC model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, in terms of F-measures for identifying cancer driver genes enriched in the gold-standard cancer driver gene lists. Furthermore, these results showed that personalized driver genes can be explored by their network characteristics even when they are hidden factors in transcription and mutation profiles. Our PNC gives novel insights and useful tools into understanding the tumor heterogeneity in cancer.

Surveillance plays a crucial role in preventing emerging infectious diseases from becoming epidemic. In circumstances where it is possible to monitor the infection status of certain people, transport hubs, or hospitals, early detection of the disease allows interventions to be implemented before most of the damage can occur, or at least its impact can be mitigated. This paper addresses the question of which nodes we should select in a network of individuals susceptible to some infectious disease in order to minimize the number of casualties. By simulating disease outbreaks on a collection of empirical and synthetic networks we show that the best strategy depends on topological characteristics of the network. For highly modular or spatially embedded networks it is better to place the sentinels on nodes distributed across different regions. However, if the degree heterogeneity is high, then a strategy that targets network hubs is preferred. We further consider the consequences of having an incomplete sample of the network and demonstrate that the value of new information diminishes as more data is collected. Finally we find further marginal improvements using two heuristics informed by known results in graph theory that exploit the fragmented structure of sparse network data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1b5wzGpj8o4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Recurrent somatic mutations reveal new insights into consequences of mutagenic processes in cancer</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/sHFUUNRTSPo/article</link>

The sheer size of the human genome makes it improbable that identical somatic mutations at the exact same position are observed in multiple tumours solely by chance. The scarcity of cancer driver mutations also precludes positive selection as the sole explanation. Therefore, recurrent mutations may be highly informative of characteristics of mutational processes. To explore the potential, we use recurrence as a starting point to cluster &amp;gt;2,500 whole genomes of a pan-cancer cohort. We describe each genome with 13 recurrence-based and 29 general mutational features. Using principal component analysis we reduce the dimensionality and create independent features. We apply hierarchical clustering to the first 18 principal components followed by k-means clustering. We show that the resulting 16 clusters capture clinically relevant cancer phenotypes. High levels of recurrent substitutions separate the clusters that we link to UV-light exposure and deregulated activity of POLE from the one representing defective mismatch repair, which shows high levels of recurrent insertions/deletions. Recurrence of both mutation types characterizes cancer genomes with somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes and the cluster of genomes exposed to gastric acid. Low levels of recurrence are observed for the cluster where tobacco-smoke exposure induces mutagenesis and the one linked to increased activity of cytidine deaminases. Notably, the majority of substitutions are recurrent in a single tumour type, while recurrent insertions/deletions point to shared processes between tumour types. Recurrence also reveals susceptible sequence motifs, including TT[C&amp;gt;A]TTT and AAC[T&amp;gt;G]T for the POLE and ‘gastric-acid exposure’ clusters, respectively. Moreover, we refine knowledge of mutagenesis, including increased C/G deletion levels in general for lung tumours and specifically in midsize homopolymer sequence contexts for microsatellite instable tumours. Our findings are an important step towards the development of a generic cancer diagnostic test for clinical practice based on whole-genome sequencing that could replace multiple diagnostics currently in use.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sHFUUNRTSPo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Predicting Meridian in Chinese traditional medicine using machine learning approaches</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/S4kzsCbX3qo/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Yinyin Wang, Mohieddin Jafari, Yun Tang, Jing Tang&lt;/p&gt;

Plant-derived nature products, known as herb formulas, have been commonly used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for disease prevention and treatment. The herbs have been traditionally classified into different categories according to the TCM Organ systems known as Meridians. Despite the increasing knowledge on the active components of the herbs, the rationale of Meridian classification remains poorly understood. In this study, we took a machine learning approach to explore the classification of Meridian. We determined the molecule features for 646 herbs and their active components including structure-based fingerprints and ADME properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion), and found that the Meridian can be predicted by machine learning approaches with a top accuracy of 0.83. We also identified the top compound features that were important for the Meridian prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that molecular properties of the herb compounds are associated with the TCM Meridians. Taken together, the machine learning approach may provide novel insights for the understanding of molecular evidence of Meridians in TCM.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/S4kzsCbX3qo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Environmental enrichment partially repairs subcortical mapping errors in Ten-m3 knockout mice during an early critical period</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0478-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Environmental enrichment (EE) has been shown to improve neural function via the regulation of cortical plasticity. Its capacity to induce functional and/or anatomical repair of miswired circuits is unknown. Ten-m3 knockout (KO) mice exhibit a highly-stereotyped and profound miswiring of ipsilateral retinogeniculate axons and associated deficits in binocularly-mediated visual behaviour. We determined whether, and when, EE can drive the repair of subcortical wiring deficits by analysing Ten-m3 KO and wildtype mice that were enriched for 6 weeks from adulthood, weaning or birth in comparison to standard-housed controls. Six weeks of EE initiated from birth, but not later, induced a significant reduction in the area occupied by ipsilateral retinogeniculate terminals in KOs enriched from birth. No EE-induced correction of mistargeted axons was observed at postnatal day 7, indicating that this intervention impacts pruning rather than initial targeting of axons. This reduction was most prominent in the ventrolateral region of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, suggesting a preferential pruning of the most profoundly mistargeted axons. EE can thus partially repair a specific, subcortical axonal wiring deficit, but only during an early, developmentally-restricted time-window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The incorrect wiring of neural circuits can lead to profound disability. Using a mouse model which exhibits a marked miswiring of neural projections to subcortical relay centres of the brain, we show that positive modulation (enrichment) of the environment during the first few postnatal weeks can induce the pruning of aberrant neural projections. The capacity for environmental enrichment to correct miswired projections diminished prior to adolescence, suggesting that the enrichment can only drive these changes during an early critical period. This expands our knowledge of the capacity for enrichment to induce repair of neural circuits. The demonstration of dramatic effects on targeting of neural projections over a restricted period may have implications for the development of therapies for neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0226-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;While multiple studies have been conducted of gene expression in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), their findings have not reached a clear consensus and have not accounted for the potentially confounding effects of changes in cellular composition. To help address this gap, we conducted a re-analysis based meta-analysis of ten independent studies of hippocampal gene expression in mouse models of AD. We used estimates of cellular composition as covariates in statistical models aimed to identify genes differentially expressed at either early or late stages of progression. Our analysis revealed changes in gene expression at early phases shared across studies, including dysregulation of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and the complement system. Expression changes at later stages were dominated by cellular compositional effects. Thus despite the considerable heterogeneity of the mouse models, we identified common patterns that may contribute to our understanding of AD etiology. Our work also highlights the importance of controlling for cellular composition effects in genomics studies of neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement:&lt;/b&gt; A molecular understanding of Alzheimer's disease is important to the development of treatments. Because of the difficulty of studying brain tissue in humans, especially at very early stages of progression, many groups have performed transcriptomic studies of rodent models. Our study identified changes in gene expression that are strikingly consistent across multiple such studies, providing substantial insight into molecular changes present at early stages of these disease models and which may be of importance in the human condition. Our study also demonstrates the importance of accounting for the complex effects of neurodegeneration on brain tissue in data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Evoked frontal and parietal field potential signatures of target detection and response inhibition in rats performing an equiprobable auditory go/no-go task</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0055-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;To characterize the rat as a potential model of frontal-parietal auditory processing during sustained attention, target detection, and response inhibition, we recorded field potentials (FPs) at multiple sites in medial-dorsal frontal and posterior parietal cortex simultaneously while rats performed an equiprobable auditory go/no-go discrimination task. ERPs were calculated by averaging tone-triggered FPs across hit, miss, false alarm (FA), and correct rejection (CR) trials separately for each recording session, and five peak amplitudes (termed N1, P2, N2, P3E and P3L) were extracted from the individual-session ERPs. Comparing peak amplitudes across different trials types indicated a statistically significant amplification of the P2 peak on hit trials that accompanies detection of the target tone prior to the behavioral go response. This result appears analogous to human ERP phenomena during auditory target discrimination. Conversely, the rat P3 responses were not associated with target detection as in the human ERP literature. Likewise, we did not observe the &quot;no-go N2&quot; or &quot;no-go P3&quot; responses reported in the human literature in association with response inhibition, which might reflect differences in task context or a difference in auditory processing between rats and humans. We also present analyses of stimulus-induced spectral power and inter-area coherence to characterize oscillatory synchronization which may contribute to ERPs, and discuss possible error-related processing at the N2, P3E and P3L peaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Our results constrain potential neural models of sustained attention and auditory discrimination in rat cortex. To our knowledge our study is the first to unambiguously support that the rat P2 auditory ERP component is amplified by target detection as distinct from response production. This validates that our experimental paradigm can be used to mechanistically probe the cellular basis of the ERP, and potentially could reveal how ERP phenomena are disrupted in multiple neuropsychiatric disorders. Our results complement those of &quot;active oddball&quot; studies in which a neural response potentially related to target detection or response activation may be confounded with automatic rare-tone response amplification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25611?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with exposure to contact and collision sports, including American football. We hypothesized a dose–response relationship between duration of football played and CTE risk and severity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a convenience sample of 266 deceased American football players from the Veterans Affairs–Boston University–Concussion Legacy Foundation and Framingham Heart Study Brain Banks, we estimated the association of years of football played with CTE pathological status and severity. We evaluated the ability of years played to classify CTE status using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Simulation analyses quantified conditions that might lead to selection bias.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, 223 of 266 participants met neuropathological diagnostic criteria for CTE. More years of football played were associated with having CTE (odds ratio [OR] = 1.30 per year played, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.19–1.41; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 3.8 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;) and with CTE severity (severe vs mild; OR = 1.14 per year played, 95% CI = 1.07–1.22; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 3.1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;). Participants with CTE were 1/10th as likely to have played &amp;lt;4.5 years (negative likelihood ratio [LR] = 0.102, 95% CI = 0.100–0.105) and were 10 times as likely to have played &amp;gt;14.5 years (positive LR = 10.2, 95% CI = 9.8–10.7) compared with participants without CTE. Sensitivity and specificity were maximized at 11 years played. Simulation demonstrated that years played remained adversely associated with CTE status when years played and CTE status were both related to brain bank selection across widely ranging scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The odds of CTE double every 2.6 years of football played. After accounting for brain bank selection, the magnitude of the relationship between years played and CTE status remained consistent. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Clustering-independent analysis of genomic data using spectral simplicial theory</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/2bPoyHJP3uw/article</link>

The prevailing paradigm for the analysis of biological data involves comparing groups of replicates from different conditions (e.g. control and treatment) to statistically infer features that discriminate them (e.g. differentially expressed genes). However, many situations in modern genomics such as single-cell omics experiments do not fit well into this paradigm because they lack true replicates. In such instances, spectral techniques could be used to rank features according to their degree of consistency with an underlying metric structure without the need to cluster samples. Here, we extend spectral methods for feature selection to abstract simplicial complexes and present a general framework for clustering-independent analysis. Combinatorial Laplacian scores take into account the topology spanned by the data and reduce to the ordinary Laplacian score when restricted to graphs. We demonstrate the utility of this framework with several applications to the analysis of gene expression and multi-modal genomic data. Specifically, we perform differential expression analysis in situations where samples cannot be grouped into distinct classes, and we disaggregate differentially expressed genes according to the topology of the expression space (e.g. alternative paths of differentiation). We also apply this formalism to identify genes with spatial patterns of expression using fluorescence in-situ hybridization data and to establish associations between genetic alterations and global expression patterns in large cross-sectional studies. Our results provide a unifying perspective on topological data analysis and manifold learning approaches to the analysis of large-scale biological datasets.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2bPoyHJP3uw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Seasonal influenza results in substantial annual morbidity and mortality in the United States and worldwide. Accurate forecasts of key features of influenza epidemics, such as the timing and severity of the peak incidence in a given season, can inform public health response to outbreaks. As part of ongoing efforts to incorporate data and advanced analytical methods into public health decision-making, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has organized seasonal influenza forecasting challenges since the 2013/2014 season. In the 2017/2018 season, 22 teams participated. A subset of four teams created a research consortium called the FluSight Network in early 2017. During the 2017/2018 season they worked together to produce a collaborative multi-model ensemble that combined 21 separate component models into a single model using a machine learning technique called stacking. This approach creates a weighted average of predictive densities where the weight for each component is determined by maximizing overall ensemble accuracy over past seasons. In the 2017/2018 influenza season, one of the largest seasonal outbreaks in the last 15 years, this multi-model ensemble performed better on average than all individual component models and placed second overall in the CDC challenge. It also outperformed the baseline multi-model ensemble created by the CDC that took a simple average of all models submitted to the forecasting challenge. This project shows that collaborative efforts between research teams to develop ensemble forecasting approaches can bring measurable improvements in forecast accuracy and important reductions in the variability of performance from year to year. Efforts such as this, that emphasize real-time testing and evaluation of forecasting models and facilitate the close collaboration between public health officials and modeling researchers, are essential to improving our understanding of how best to use forecasts to improve public health response to seasonal and emerging epidemic threats.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eMce6xkJIF4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Anticipatory coadaptation of ankle stiffness and sensorimotor gain for standing balance</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/ons7ZPkKFWY/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Charlotte Le Mouel, Romain Brette&lt;/p&gt;

External perturbation forces may compromise standing balance. The nervous system can intervene only after a delay greater than 100 ms, during which the body falls freely. With ageing, sensorimotor delays are prolonged, posing a critical threat to balance. We study a generic model of stabilisation with neural delays to understand how the organism should adapt to challenging balance conditions. The model suggests that ankle stiffness should be increased in anticipation of perturbations, for example by muscle co-contraction, so as to slow down body fall during the neural response delay. Increased ankle muscle co-contraction is indeed observed in young adults when standing in challenging balance conditions, and in older relative to young adults during normal stance. In parallel, the analysis of the model shows that increases in either stiffness or neural delay must be coordinated with decreases in spinal sensorimotor gains, otherwise the feedback itself becomes destabilizing. Accordingly, a decrease in spinal feedback is observed in challenging conditions, and with age-related increases in neural delay. These observations have been previously interpreted as indicating an increased reliance on cortical rather than spinal control of balance, despite the fact that cortical responses have a longer latency. Our analysis challenges this interpretation by showing that these observations are consistent with a functional coadaptation of spinal feedback gains to functional changes in stiffness and neural delay.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ons7ZPkKFWY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Infections are a serious health concern worldwide, particularly in vulnerable populations such as the immunocompromised, elderly, and young. Advances in metagenomic sequencing availability, speed, and decreased cost offer the opportunity to supplement or even replace culture-based identification of pathogens with DNA sequence-based diagnostics. Adopting metagenomic analysis for clinical use requires that all aspects of the workflow are optimized and tested, including data analysis and computational time and resources. We tested the accuracy, sensitivity, and resource requirements of three top metagenomic taxonomic classifiers that use fast k-mer based algorithms: Centrifuge, CLARK, and KrakenUniq. Binary mixtures of bacteria showed all three reliably identified organisms down to 1% relative abundance, while only the relative abundance estimates of Centrifuge and CLARK were accurate. All three classifiers identified the organisms present in their default databases from a mock bacterial community of 20 organisms, but only Centrifuge had no false positives. In addition, Centrifuge required far less computational resources and time for analysis. Centrifuge analysis of metagenomes obtained from samples of VAP, infected DFUs, and FN showed Centrifuge identified pathogenic bacteria and one virus that were corroborated by culture or a clinical PCR assay. Importantly, in both diabetic foot ulcer patients, metagenomic sequencing identified pathogens 4–6 weeks before culture. Finally, we show that Centrifuge results were minimally affected by elimination of time-consuming read quality control and host screening steps.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9p_4mLbCm9o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: SCN1A variants in vaccine‐related febrile seizures: a prospective study</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25650?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Febrile seizures may follow vaccination. Common variants in the sodium channel gene, &lt;i&gt;SCN1A&lt;/i&gt;, are associated with febrile seizures and rare pathogenic variants in &lt;i&gt;SCN1A&lt;/i&gt; cause the severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy Dravet Syndrome. Following vaccination, febrile seizures may raise the spectre of poor outcome and inappropriately implicate vaccination as the cause. We aimed to determine the prevalence of &lt;i&gt;SCN1A&lt;/i&gt; variants in children having their first febrile seizure either proximal to vaccination, or unrelated to vaccination compared to controls.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed &lt;i&gt;SCN1A&lt;/i&gt; sequencing, blind to clinical category, in a prospective cohort of children presenting with their first febrile seizure as vaccine proximate (n=69), or as non‐vaccine proximate (n=75), and children with no history of seizures (n=90) recruited in Australian paediatric hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We detected two pathogenic variants in vaccine proximate cases (p.R568X and p.W932R), both of whom developed Dravet syndrome, and one in a non‐vaccine proximate case (p.V947L) who had Febrile seizures plus from 9 months. All had generalised tonic‐clonic seizures lasting longer than 15 minutes. We also found enrichment of a reported risk allele, rs6432860‐T, in children with febrile seizures compared to controls (Odds Ratio 1.91 [95% CI 1.31‐ 2.81]).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pathogenic &lt;i&gt;SCN1A&lt;/i&gt; variants may be identified in infants with vaccine proximate febrile seizures. As early diagnosis of Dravet syndrome is essential for optimal management and outcome. &lt;i&gt;SCN1A&lt;/i&gt; sequencing in infants with prolonged febrile seizures, proximate to vaccination, should become routine.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25637?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical outcomes in multiple sclerosis (MS) are highly variable. We aim to determine the long‐term clinical outcomes in MS, and to identify early prognostic features of these outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One hundred thirty‐two people presenting with a clinically isolated syndrome were prospectively recruited between 1984 and 1987, and followed up clinically and radiologically 1, 5, 10, 14, 20, and now 30 years later. All available notes and magnetic resonance imaging scans were reviewed, and MS was defined according to the 2010 McDonald criteria.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical outcome data were obtained in 120 participants at 30 years. Eighty were known to have developed MS by 30 years. Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores were available in 107 participants, of whom 77 had MS; 32 (42%) remained fully ambulatory (EDSS scores ≤3.5), all of whom had relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS), 3 (4%) had RRMS and EDSS scores &amp;gt;3.5, 26 (34%) had secondary progressive MS (all had EDSS scores &amp;gt;3.5), and MS contributed to death in 16 (20%). Of those with MS, 11 received disease‐modifying therapy. The strongest early predictors (within 5 years of presentation) of secondary progressive MS at 30 years were presence of baseline infratentorial lesions and deep white matter lesions at 1 year.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty years after onset, in a largely untreated cohort, there was a divergence of MS outcomes; some people accrued substantial disability early on, whereas others ran a more favorable long‐term course. These outcomes could, in part, be predicted by radiological findings from within 1 year of first presentation. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Layer‐ and Cell‐Specific Recruitment Dynamics during Epileptic Seizures In Vivo</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25628?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate the network dynamics mechanisms underlying differential initiation of epileptic interictal spikes and seizures.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed combined in vivo 2‐photon calcium imaging from different targeted neuronal subpopulations and extracellular electrophysiological recordings during 4‐aminopyridine–induced neocortical spikes and seizures.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both spikes and seizures were associated with intense synchronized activation of excitatory layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons (PNs) and to a lesser degree layer 4 neurons, as well as inhibitory parvalbumin‐expressing interneurons (INs). In sharp contrast, layer 5 PNs and somatostatin‐expressing INs were gradually and asynchronously recruited into the ictal activity during the course of seizures. Within layer 2/3, the main difference between onset of spikes and seizures lay in the relative recruitment dynamics of excitatory PNs compared to parvalbumin‐ and somatostatin‐expressing inhibitory INs. Whereas spikes exhibited balanced recruitment of PNs and parvalbumin‐expressing INs, during seizures IN responses were reduced and less synchronized than in layer 2/3 PNs. Similar imbalance was not observed in layers 4 or 5 of the neocortex. Machine learning–based algorithms we developed were able to distinguish spikes from seizures based solely on activation dynamics of layer 2/3 PNs at discharge onset.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During onset of seizures, the recruitment dynamics markedly differed between neuronal subpopulations, with rapid synchronous recruitment of layer 2/3 PNs, layer 4 neurons, and parvalbumin‐expressing INs and gradual asynchronous recruitment of layer 5 PNs and somatostatin‐expressing INs. Seizures initiated in layer 2/3 due to a dynamic mismatch between local PNs and inhibitory INs, and only later spread to layer 5 by gradually and asynchronously recruiting PNs in this layer.

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00070</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cortical slow oscillations (≲1 Hz) are an emergent property of the cortical network that integrate connectivity and physiological features. This rhythm, highly revealing of the characteristics of the underlying dynamics, is a hallmark of low complexity brain states like sleep, and represents a default activity pattern. Here, we present a methodological approach for quantifying the spatial and temporal properties of this emergent activity. We improved and enriched a robust analysis procedure that has already been successfully applied to both in vitro and in vivo data acquisitions. We tested the new tools of the methodology by analyzing the electrocorticography (ECoG) traces recorded from a custom 32-channel multi-electrode array in wild-type isoflurane-anesthetized mice. The enhanced analysis pipeline, named SWAP (Slow Wave Analysis Pipeline), detects Up and Down states, enables the characterization of the spatial dependency of their statistical properties, and supports the comparison of different subjects. The SWAP is implemented in a data-independent way, allowing its application to other data sets (acquired from different subjects, or with different recording tools), as well as to the outcome of numerical simulations. By using the SWAP, we report statistically significant differences in the observed slow oscillations (SO) across cortical areas and cortical sites. Computing cortical maps by interpolating the features of SO acquired at the electrode positions, we give evidence of gradients at the global scale along an oblique axis directed from fronto-lateral toward occipito-medial regions, further highlighting some heterogeneity within cortical areas. The results obtained using the SWAP will be essential for producing data-driven brain simulations. A spatial characterization of slow oscillations will also trigger a discussion on the role of, and the interplay between, the different regions in the cortex, improving our understanding of the mechanisms of generation and propagation of delta rhythms and, more generally, of cortical properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2019.00031</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Optogenetics is a state-of-the-art tool for interrogating neural circuits. In the cerebellum, Purkinje cells serve as the sole output of the cerebellar cortex where they synapse on neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN). To investigate the properties of this synaptic connection, we sought to elicit time-locked single action potentials from Purkinje cell axons. Using optical stimulation of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-expressing Purkinje cells combined with patch-clamp recordings of Purkinje cells and DCN neurons in acute cerebellar slices, we determine the photostimulation parameters required to elicit single time-locked action potentials from Purkinje cell axons. We show that axons require longer light pulses than somata do to elicit single action potentials and that Purkinje cell axons are also more susceptible to light perturbations. We then demonstrate that these empirically determined photostimulation parameters elicit time-locked synaptic currents from postsynaptic cells in the DCN. Our results highlight the importance of optimizing optogenetic stimulation conditions to interrogate synaptic connections.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a challenging clinical problem worldwide. The cellular state and molecular expression in spinal cord tissue after injury are extremely complex and closely related to functional recovery. However, the spatial and temporal changes of gene expression and regulation in various cell types after SCI are still unclear. Here, we collected the rostral and caudal regions to the lesion at 11 time points over a period of 28 days after rat hemisection SCI. Combining whole-transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatic analysis, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between spinal cord tissue from injured and sham-operated animals. Significantly altered biological processes were enriched from DEGs in astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, immune cells, and vascular systems after SCI. We then identified dynamic trends in these processes using the average expression profiles of DEGs. Gene expression and regulatory networks for selected biological processes were also constructed to illustrate the complicate difference between rostral and caudal tissues. Finally, we validated the expressions of some key genes from these networks, including α-synuclein, heme oxygenase 1, bone morphogenetic protein 2, activating transcription factor 3, and leukemia inhibitory factor. Collectively, we provided a comprehensive network of gene expression and regulation to shed light on the molecular characteristics of critical biological processes that occur after SCI, which will broaden the understanding of SCI and facilitate clinical therapeutics for SCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Tissue Specific Reference Genes for MicroRNA Expression Analysis in a Mouse Model of Peripheral Nerve Injury</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00283</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as master switch regulators in many biological processes in health and disease, including neuropathy. miRNAs are commonly quantified by reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), usually estimated as relative expression through reference genes normalization. Different non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are used for miRNA normalization; however, there is no study identifying the optimal reference genes in animal models for peripheral nerve injury. We evaluated the stability of eleven ncRNAs, commonly used for miRNA normalization, in dorsal root ganglia (DRG), dorsal horn of the spinal cord (dhSC), and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in the mouse spared nerve injury (SNI) model. After RT-qPCR, the stability of each ncRNA was determined by using four different methods: BestKeeper, the comparative delta-Cq method, geNorm, and NormFinder. The candidates were rated according to their performance in each method and an overall ranking list was compiled. The most stable ncRNAs were: sno420, sno429, and sno202 in DRG; sno429, sno202, and U6 in dhSC; sno202, sno420, and sno142 in mPFC. We provide the first reference genes’ evaluation for miRNA normalization in different neuronal tissues in an animal model of peripheral nerve injury. Our results underline the need for careful selection of reference genes for miRNA normalization in different tissues and experimental conditions. We further anticipate that our findings can be used in a broad range of nerve injury related studies, to ensure validity and promote reproducibility in miRNA quantification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Modulation of Glycine Receptor-Mediated Pain Signaling in vitro and in vivo by Glucose</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00280</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The inhibitory glycine receptor (GlyR) plays an important role in rapid synaptic inhibition in mammalian spinal cord, brainstem, higher brain centers, and is involved in transmission of nociceptive signals. Glucose and related mono- and disaccharides potentiate currents mediated by recombinant α1, α1-β, and α3 GlyRs. Here, we confirmed the specific potentiation of α3 GlyR signaling by glucose through: (i) patch-clamp electrophysiology on recombinant receptors; and (ii) by verifying in vitro data in a mouse model in vivo. Mice were intraperitoneally (IP) injected with glucose (2 g/kg) or vehicle, and then challenged with sublethal doses of strychnine (0.2 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg). Pain-related behavior was assessed using two established models: (i) touch sensitivity tests using von Frey filaments; and (ii) hotplate assay. We observed a reduction of pain sensitivity in glucose-treated mice relative to vehicle-treated control mice. Injection of strychnine resulted in an increased sensitivity to tactile and heat stimuli, which was reversed in the presence of glucose. Analgesic effects of glucose were more pronounced in von Frey experiments, consistent with the established use of this model for neuropathic pain. Overall, glucose showed mild analgesic effects and was able to compensate for strychnine-induced allodynia in mice. Since the action of strychnine is specific for GlyR, these experiments show for the first time an in vivo potentiation of GlyR activity by glucose and suggest a molecular mechanism for glucose-mediated analgesia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;To determine the relationship between alterations in resting state functional connectivity and social cognition dysfunction among patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and healthy controls (HC).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Fifty-seven participants (FTD = 10, AD = 18, PD = 19, and HC = 10) underwent structural and functional imaging and completed the Awareness of Social Inference Test-Emotion Evaluation Test (TASIT-EET), Behavioral Inhibition System/Behavioral Activation System (BIS/BAS) scale, Revised Self-Monitoring Scale (RSMS), Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), and Social Norms Questionnaire (SNQ). A multi-variate pattern analysis (MVPA) was carried out to determine activation differences between the groups. The clusters from the MVPA were used as seeds for the ROI-to-voxel analysis. Relationship between social cognition deficits and uncinate integrity was also investigated.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;BOLD signal activation differed among the four groups of AD, PD, FTD, and HC in the left inferior temporal gyrus-anterior division [L-ITG (ant)], right central opercular cortex (R-COp), right supramarginal gyrus, posterior division (R-SMG, post), right angular gyrus (R-AG), and R-ITG. The BOLD co-activation of the L-ITG (ant) with bilateral frontal pole (FP) and paracingulate gyrus was positively associated with IRI-perspective taking (PT) (r = 0.38, p = 0.007), SNQ total (r = 0.37, p = 0.009), and TASIT-EET (r = 0.47, p &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Patients with neurodegenerative diseases showed alterations in connectivity in brain regions important for social cognition compared with HCs. Functional connectivity correlated with performance on social cognition tasks and alterations could be responsible for some of the social cognition deficits observed in all neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: A Novel Mouse Model of MYO7A USH1B Reveals Auditory and Visual System Haploinsufficiencies</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01255</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Usher’s syndrome is the most common combined blindness–deafness disorder with USH1B, caused by mutations in MYO7A, resulting in the most severe phenotype. The existence of numerous, naturally occurring shaker1 mice harboring variable MYO7A mutations on different genetic backgrounds has complicated the characterization of MYO7A knockout (KO) and heterozygote mice. We generated a novel MYO7A KO mouse (Myo7a&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;/&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;) that is easily genotyped, maintained, and confirmed to be null for MYO7A in both the eye and inner ear. Like USH1B patients, Myo7a&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;/&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; mice are profoundly deaf, and display near complete loss of inner and outer cochlear hair cells (HCs). No gross structural changes were observed in vestibular HCs. Myo7a&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;/&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibited modest declines in retinal function but, unlike patients, no loss of retinal structure. We attribute the latter to differential expression of MYO7A in mouse vs. primate retina. Interestingly, heterozygous Myo7a&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;/&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; mice had reduced numbers of cochlear HCs and concomitant reductions in auditory function relative to Myo7a&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; controls. Notably, this is the first report that loss of a single Myo7a allele significantly alters auditory structure and function and suggests that audiological characterization of USH1B carriers is warranted. Maintenance of vestibular HCs in Myo7a&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;/&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; mice suggests that gene replacement could be used to correct the vestibular dysfunction in USH1B patients. While Myo7a&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;/&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; mice do not exhibit sufficiently robust retinal phenotypes to be used as a therapeutic outcome measure, they can be used to assess expression of vectored MYO7A on a null background and generate valuable pre-clinical data toward the treatment of USH1B.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Gastrodin Ameliorates Motor Learning Deficits Through Preserving Cerebellar Long-Term Depression Pathways in Diabetic Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01239</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive dysfunction is a very severe consequence of diabetes, but the underlying causes are still unclear. Recently, the cerebellum was reported to play an important role in learning and memory. Since long-term depression (LTD) is a primary cellular mechanism for cerebellar motor learning, we aimed to explore the role of cerebellar LTD pathways in diabetic rats and the therapeutic effect of gastrodin. Diabetes was induced by a single injection of streptozotocin into adult Sprague–Dawley rats. Motor learning ability was assessed by a beam walk test. Pathological changes of the cerebellum were assessed by Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) and Nissl staining. Cellular apoptosis was assessed by anti-caspase-3 immunostaining. Protein expression levels of LTD pathway-related factors, including GluR2, protein kinase C (PKC), NR2A, and nNOS, in the cerebellar cortex were evaluated by western blotting and double immunofluorescence. The NO concentration was measured. The cellular degeneration and the apoptosis of Purkinje cells were evident in the cerebellum of diabetic rats. Protein expression levels of GluR2 (NC9W: 1.26 ± 0.12; DM9W + S: 0.81 ± 0.07), PKC (NC9W: 1.66 ± 0.10; DM9W + S: 0.58 ± 0.19), NR2A (NC9W: 1.40 ± 0.05; DM9W + S: 0.63 ± 0.06), nNOS (NC9W: 1.26 ± 0.12; DM9W + S: 0.68 ± 0.04), and NO (NC9W: 135.61 ± 31.91; DM9W + S: 64.06 ± 24.01) in the cerebellum were significantly decreased in diabetic rats. Following gastrodin intervention, the outcome of motor learning ability was significantly improved (NC9W: 6.70 ± 3.31; DM9W + S: 20.47 ± 9.43; DM9W + G: 16.04 ± 7.10). In addition, degeneration and apoptosis were ameliorated, and this was coupled with the elevation of the protein expression of the abovementioned biomarkers. Arising from the above, we concluded that gastrodin may contribute to the improvement of motor learning by protecting the LTD pathways in Purkinje cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We evaluated whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in two different montages could improve picture naming abilities in participants with anomic Alzheimer Disease or Frontotemporal dementia.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Utilizing a double-blind cross-over design, twelve participants were trained on picture naming over a series of 10 sessions with 30 min of anodal (2 mA) tDCS stimulation to either the left inferior parietotemporal region (P3), the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (F3), or sham stimulation. We evaluated performance on a trained picture naming list, an equivalent novel untrained list, and additional neuropsychological tasks.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;For trained item picture naming, significantly larger improvement was seen for real stimulation vs. sham stimulation for both the DLPFC and left inferior parieto-temporal stimulation montages at the end of the stimulation sessions. The parieto-temporal montage remained superior to sham 2 weeks poststimulation. Significant improvement vs. sham was also seen for novel “untrained” item picture naming 2 weeks post-stimulation when the parieto-temporal montage was given, whereas no change was observed when the DLPFC montage was given. Finally, comparing groups when they received the parieto-temporal montage, participants with semantic variant Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) showed the least improvement for untrained items after their sessions. Scores on the additional neuropsychological tasks were unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;tDCS stimulation has promise as a treatment for individuals with anomia arising from neurodegenerative disease, but its effectiveness can vary depending on the training given, the montage location used, as well as a participants’ diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This study was conducted to explore the composition of the fecal microflora of Chinese Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, as well as to explore links between PD clinical features and antiparkinsonian medications on the gut microflora. Seventy-two PD cases [59 patients suffering from PD for &amp;gt;1 year (OPD) and 13 new PD (NPD) patients] were studied. Microflora communities in the feces of the patients and corresponding healthy controls (HCs) were examined using high-throughput Illumina MiSeq sequencing targeting the 16S rRNA gene. The gut microflora of OPD patients contained high levels of Rikenellaceae compared to corresponding HCs. In addition, significantly higher levels of Turicibacteraceae were found in the NPD group compared to the corresponding HCs. The genera Turicibacter and Prevotella were significantly correlated with the PD severity scores. Our findings that some fecal microflora were closely related to PD clinical characteristics may enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00403</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Stereotypes exist in the interactions between different social groups, and gender stereotypes are particularly prevalent. Previous studies have suggested that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is involved in the social cognition that plays an important role in gender stereotypes, but the specific causal effect of the mPFC remains controversial. In this study, we aimed to use transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to identify a direct link between the mPFC and gender bias. Implicit stereotypes were measured by the gender implicit association test (IAT), and explicit prejudice was measured by the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI). We found that male and female participants had different behavioral and neural correlates of gender stereotypes. Anodal tDCS significantly reduced male participants’ gender D-IAT scores compared with cathodal and sham stimulation, while the stimulation had an insignificant effect in female participants. The reduction in male participants’ gender bias mainly resulted from a decrease in the difference in reaction time (RT) between congruent and incongruent blocks. Regarding the explicit bias measurement, male and female participants had distinct attitudes, but tDCS had no effect on ASI. Our results revealed that the mPFC played a causal role in controlling implicit gender stereotypes, which is consistent with previous observations and complements past lesion, neuroimaging, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies and suggests that males and females have different neural bases for gender stereotypes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pericytes are functional components of the neurovascular unit (NVU) that are located around the blood vessels, and their roles in the regulation of cerebral health and diseases has been reported. Currently, the potential properties of pericytes as emerging therapeutic targets for cerebrovascular diseases have attracted considerable attention. Nonetheless, few reviews have comprehensively discussed pericytes and their roles in cerebrovascular diseases. Therefore, in this review, we not only summarized and described the basic characteristics of pericytes but also focused on clarifying the new understanding about the roles of pericytes in the pathogenesis of cerebrovascular diseases, including white matter injury (WMI), hypoxic–ischemic brain damage, depression, neovascular insufficiency disease, and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Furthermore, we summarized the current therapeutic strategies targeting pericytes for cerebrovascular diseases. Collectively, this review is aimed at providing a comprehensive understanding of pericytes and new insights about the use of pericytes as novel therapeutic targets for cerebrovascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Otoprotection to Implanted Cochlea Exposed to Noise Trauma With Dexamethasone Eluting Electrode</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00492</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cochlear implantation (CI) is now widely used to provide auditory rehabilitation to individuals having severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). However, CI can lead to electrode insertion trauma (EIT) that can cause damage to sensory cells in the inner ear resulting in loss of residual hearing. Even with soft surgical techniques where there is minimal macroscopic damage, we can still observe the generation of molecular events that may initiate programmed cell death via various mechanisms such as oxidative stress, the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and activation of the caspase pathway. In addition, individuals with CI may be exposed to noise trauma (NT) due to occupation and leisure activities that may affect their hearing ability. Recently, there has been an increased interest in the auditory community to determine the efficacy of drug-eluting electrodes for the protection of residual hearing. The objective of this study is to determine the effect of NT on implanted cochlea as well as the otoprotective efficacy of dexamethasone eluting electrode to implanted cochlea exposed to NT in a guinea pig model of CI. Animals were divided into five groups: EIT with dexamethasone eluting electrode exposed to NT; EIT exposed to NT; NT only; EIT only and naïve animals (control group). The hearing thresholds were determined by auditory brainstem recordings (ABRs). The cochlea was harvested and analyzed for transcript levels of inflammation, apoptosis and fibrosis genes. We observed that threshold shifts were significantly higher in EIT, NT or EIT + NT groups compared to naive animals at all the tested frequencies. The dexamethasone eluting electrode led to a significant decrease in hearing threshold shifts in implanted animals exposed to NT. Proapoptotic tumor necrosis factor-α [TNF-α, TNF-α receptor 1a (TNFαR1a)] and pro-fibrotic transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ) genes were more than two-fold up-regulated following EIT and EIT + NT compared to the control group. The use of dexamethasone releasing electrode significantly decreased the transcript levels of pro-apoptotic and pro-fibrotic genes. The dexamethasone releasing electrode has shown promising results for hearing protection in implanted animals exposed to NT. The results of this study suggest that dexamethasone releasing electrode holds great potential in developing effective treatment modalities for NT in the implanted cochlea.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Delayed Advantage: Multi-Session Training at Evening Hours Leads to Better Long-Term Retention of Motor Skill in the Elderly</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00321</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The acquisition and retention of motor skills is necessary for everyday functioning in the elderly and may be critical in the context of motor rehabilitation. Recent studies indicate that motor training closely followed by sleep may result in better engagement of procedural (“how to”) memory consolidation processes in the elderly. Nevertheless, elderly individuals are mostly morning oriented and a common practice is to time rehabilitation programs to morning hours. Here, we tested whether the time-of-day wherein training is afforded (morning, 8–10:30 a.m., or evening, 6–9 p.m.) affects the long-term outcome of a multi-session motor practice program (10 sessions across 3–4 weeks) in healthy elderly participants. Twenty-nine (15 women) older adults (60–75 years) practiced an explicitly instructed five-element key-press sequence by repeatedly generating the sequence “as fast and accurately as possible.” The groups did not differ in terms of sleep habits and quality (1-week long actigraphy); all were morning-oriented individuals. All participants gained robustly from the intervention, shortening sequence tapping duration and retaining the gains (&amp;gt; 90%) at 1-month post-intervention, irrespective of the time-of-day of training. However, retesting at 7-months post-intervention showed that the attrition of the training induced gains was more pronounced in the morning trained group compared to the evening group (76 and 56.5% loss in sequence tapping time; 7/14 and 3/14 participants showed a &amp;gt; 5% decline in accuracy relative to end of training, respectively). Altogether, the results show that morning-oriented older adults effectively acquired skill in the performance of a sequence of finger movements, in both morning and evening practice sessions. However, evening training leads to a significant advantage, over morning training, in the long-term retention of the skill. Evening training should be considered an appropriate time window for motor skill learning in older adults, even in individuals with morning chronotype. The results are in line with the notion that motor training preceding a sleep interval may be better consolidated into long-term memory in the elderly, and thus result in lower forgetting rates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Pilot Study of an In-Home Multicomponent Exergame Training for Older Adults: Feasibility, Usability and Pre-Post Evaluation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00304</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aging is associated with sensory, motor and cognitive impairments that may lead to reduced daily life functioning including gait disturbances, falls, injuries and mobility restrictions. A strong need exists for implementing effective evidence-based interventions for healthy aging. Therefore, the aim of this study was to (i) evaluate the feasibility and usability of an in-home multicomponent exergame training and (ii) explore its effects on physical functions, cognition and cortical activity. Twenty-one healthy and independently living older adults were included (11 female, 74.4 ± 7.0 years, range: 65–92 years) and performed 24 trainings sessions (each 40 min) over eight weeks. The first part was conducted in a living lab (home-like laboratory environment), the second part at participants’ home. The multicomponent exergame included Tai Chi-inspired exercises, dance movements and step-based cognitive games to train strength, balance and cognition. Attendance and attrition rates were calculated and safety during training was evaluated to determine feasibility. Participants rated the usability of the exergame (System Usability Scale) and reported on their game experience (Game Experience Questionnaire). Physical and cognitive functions and cortical activity (resting state electroencephalopathy) were assessed pre and post intervention. Results showed a high training attendance rate for the living lab and the home-based setting (91.7 and 91.0%, respectively) with a rather high attrition rate (28.6%, six drop-outs). Half of the drop-out reasons were related to personal or health issues. System usability was rated acceptable with a mean score of 70.6/100. Affective game experience was rated favorable. Significant improvements were found for minimal toe clearance, short-term attentional span, and information processing speed (p &amp;lt; 0.05). No significant pre-post differences were found for cortical activity. To summarize, the exergame is generally feasible and usable for healthy older adults applied in an in-home setting and provides an overall positive emotional game experience. Nevertheless, flawless technical functionality should be a mandatory consideration. Additionally, the training might have potential positive influence on specific functions in older adults. However, the efficacy has to be evaluated in a future randomized controlled trial assessing the behavioral and neuroplastic changes in a larger population after a longer training period.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Dengue and influenza-like illness (ILI) are two of the leading causes of viral infection in the world and it is estimated that more than half the world’s population is at risk for developing these infections. It is therefore important to develop accurate methods for forecasting dengue and ILI incidences. Since data from multiple sources (such as dengue and ILI case counts, electronic health records and frequency of multiple internet search terms from Google Trends) can improve forecasts, standard time series analysis methods are inadequate to estimate all the parameter values from the limited amount of data available if we use multiple sources. In this paper, we use a computationally efficient implementation of the known variable selection method that we call the Autoregressive Likelihood Ratio (ARLR) method. This method combines sparse representation of time series data, electronic health records data (for ILI) and Google Trends data to forecast dengue and ILI incidences. This sparse representation method uses an algorithm that maximizes an appropriate likelihood ratio at every step. Using numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method recovers the underlying sparse model much more accurately than the lasso method. We apply our method to dengue case count data from five countries/states: Brazil, Mexico, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand and to ILI case count data from the United States. Numerical experiments show that our method outperforms existing time series forecasting methods in forecasting the dengue and ILI case counts. In particular, our method gives a 18 percent forecast error reduction over a leading method that also uses data from multiple sources. It also performs better than other methods in predicting the peak value of the case count and the peak time.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RY7VezuN2ss&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: An inelastic quadrupedal model discovers four-beat walking, two-beat running, and pseudo-elastic actuation as energetically optimal</title>

It is widely held that quadrupeds choose steady gaits that minimize their energetic cost of transport, but it is difficult to explore the entire range of possible footfall sequences empirically. We present a simple model of a quadruped that can spontaneously produce any of the thousands of planar footfall sequences available to quadrupeds. The inelastic, planar model consists of two point masses connected with a rigid trunk on massless legs. It requires only center of mass position, hind and forelimb proportions and a stride-length to speed relationship as input. Through trajectory optimization of a work and force-rate cost, and a large sample of random initial guesses, we provide evidence for the global optimality of symmetrical four-beat walking at low speeds and two beat running (trotting) at intermediate speeds. Using input parameters based on measurements in dogs (&lt;i&gt;Canis lupus familiaris&lt;/i&gt;), the model predicts the correct phase offset in walking and a realistic walk-trot transition speed. It also spontaneously reproduces the double-hump ground reaction force profile observed in walking, and the smooth single-hump profile observed in trotting. Actuation appears elastic, despite the model’s lack of springs, suggesting that spring-like locomotory behaviour emerges as an optimal tradeoff between work minimization and force-rate penalties.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0AJ6qImOFXQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/L50I85XwiuA/article</link>

As cancer advances, cells often spread from the primary tumor to other parts of the body and form metastases. This is the main cause of cancer related mortality. Here we investigate a conceptually simple model of metastasis formation where metastatic lesions are initiated at a rate which depends on the size of the primary tumor. The evolution of each metastasis is described as an independent branching process. We assume that the primary tumor is resected at a given size and study the earliest time at which any metastasis reaches a minimal detectable size. The parameters of our model are estimated independently for breast, colorectal, headneck, lung and prostate cancers. We use these estimates to compare predictions from our model with values reported in clinical literature. For some cancer types, we find a remarkably wide range of resection sizes such that metastases are very likely to be present, but none of them are detectable. Our model predicts that only very early resections can prevent recurrence, and that small delays in the time of surgery can significantly increase the recurrence probability.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/L50I85XwiuA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, the “flipped classroom” approach is taking the center stage within medical education. However, very few reports on the implementation of the flipped classroom in neurology have been published to date, and this educational model still represents a challenge for students and educators alike. In this article, neurology educators from the American Academy of Neurology's A. B. Baker Section on Neurological Education analyze reports of flipped classroom in other medical/surgical subspecialties, review the current implementation in neurology, and discuss future strategies to flip the neurology curriculum through contextualization of the benefits and the consequences.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Evolution of anosognosia in Alzheimer's disease and its relationship to amyloid</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25649?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unawareness, or &lt;i&gt;anosognosia,&lt;/i&gt; of memory deficits is a challenging manifestation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that adversely affects a patient's safety and decision‐making. However, there is a lack of consensus regarding the presence, as well as the evolution of altered awareness of memory function across the preclinical and prodromal stages of AD. Here, we aimed to characterize change in awareness of memory abilities and its relationship to beta‐amyloid (Aß) burden in a large cohort (N=1,070) of individuals across the disease spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memory awareness was longitudinally assessed (average number of visits=4.3) and operationalized using the discrepancy between mean participant and partner report on the Everyday Cognition scale (ECog; memory domain). Aß deposition was measured at baseline using [18F]Florbetapir positron emission tomography imaging.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aß predicted longitudinal changes in memory awareness, such that awareness decreased faster in participants with increased Aß burden. Aß and clinical group interacted to predict change in memory awareness, demonstrating the strongest effect in dementia participants, but could also be found in the CN participants. In a subset of CN participants who progressed to MCI, heightened memory awareness was observed up to 1.6 years before MCI diagnosis, with memory awareness declining until the time of progression to MCI (‐0.08discrepant‐points/year&lt;i&gt;)&lt;/i&gt;. In a subset of MCI participants who progressed to dementia, awareness was low initially and continued to decline (‐0.23discrepant‐points/year&lt;i&gt;),&lt;/i&gt; reaching anosognosia 3.2 years before dementia onset.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aß burden is associated with a progressive decrease in self‐awareness of memory deficits, reaching anosognosia approximately three years before dementia diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Early Actions of Neurotransmitters During Cortex Development and Maturation of Reprogrammed Neurons</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2019.00033</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The development of the brain is shaped by a myriad of factors among which neurotransmitters play remarkable roles before and during the formation and maturation of synaptic circuits. Cellular processes such as neurogenesis, morphological development, synaptogenesis and maturation of synapses are temporary and spatially regulated by the local or distal influence of neurotransmitters in the developing cortex. Thus, research on this area has contributed to the understanding of fundamental mechanisms of brain development and to shed light on the etiology of various human neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and Rett syndrome (RTT), among others. Recently, the field of neuroscience has been shaken by an explosive advance of experimental approaches linked to the use of induced pluripotent stem cells and reprogrammed neurons. This new technology has allowed researchers for the first time to model in the lab the unique events that take place during early human brain development and to explore the mechanisms that cause synaptopathies. In this context, the role of neurotransmitters during early stages of cortex development is beginning to be re-evaluated and a revision of the state of the art has become necessary in a time when new protocols are being worked out to differentiate stem cells into functional neurons. New perspectives on reconsidering the function of neurotransmitters include opportunities for methodological advances, a better understanding of the origin of mental disorders and the potential for development of new treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00288</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Serotonylation, the covalent linkage of serotonin to proteins has been discovered more than 60 years ago but only recently the mechanisms and first functions have been elucidated. It has been found that transglutaminases (TG) such as TG2 and the blood coagulation factor XIIIa are the enzymes which catalyze the linkage of serotonin and other monoamines to distinct glutamine (Gln) residues of target proteins. The first target proteins, small G-proteins and extracellular matrix constituents, were found in platelets and are pivotally involved in platelet aggregation and the formation of thrombi. The serotonylation of the same proteins is also involved in insulin secretion and in the proliferation of pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells and thereby in the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Recently histones have been described as targets of serotonylation opening the area of transcriptional control to this posttranslational protein modification. Future studies will certainly reveal further target proteins, signaling pathways, cellular processes, and diseases, in which serotonylation or, more general, monoaminylation is important.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Immune Checkpoint Blockade – How Does It Work in Brain Metastases?</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00282</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Immune checkpoints restrain the immune system following its activation and their inhibition unleashes anti-tumor immune responses. Immune checkpoint inhibitors revolutionized the treatment of several cancer types, including melanoma, and immune checkpoint blockade with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies is becoming a frontline therapy in metastatic melanoma. Notably, up to 60% of metastatic melanoma patients develop metastases in the brain. Brain metastases (BrM) are also very common in patients with lung and breast cancer, and occur in ∼20–40% of patients across different cancer types. Metastases in the brain are associated with poor prognosis due to the lack of efficient therapies. In the past, patients with BrM used to be excluded from immune-based clinical trials due to the assumption that such therapies may not work in the context of “immune-specialized” environment in the brain, or may cause harm. However, recent trials in patients with BrM demonstrated safety and intracranial activity of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapy. We here discuss how immune checkpoint therapy works in BrM, with focus on T cells and the cross-talk between BrM, the immune system, and tumors growing outside the brain. We discuss major open questions in our understanding of what is required for an effective immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in BrM.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Seeding Activity-Based Detection Uncovers the Different Release Mechanisms of Seed-Competent Tau Versus Inert Tau via Lysosomal Exocytosis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01258</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The pathological aggregation of tau characterizes a set of neurodegenerative diseases collectively referred to as tauopathies. Recent studies using cellular and animal models have suggested that tau pathology progresses by trans-cellular propagation. The process of propagation is mediated by certain species of extracellular tau, which are taken up by recipient cells and serve as a seed for tau aggregation. Tau propagation is currently one of the most active areas of research in dementia. Previous efforts to identify the specific tau molecules involved in propagation have suggested that multiple forms of tau with different molecular weights derived from recombinant tau or brain lysates exert seeding activity. Nonetheless, the molecular characteristics of the “extracellular” seed-competent tau as well as its release mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Given that tau is physiologically released into the extracellular space, it is critical to distinguish seed-competent tau from normal monomeric tau. Utilizing biosensor cells expressing P301S mutant tau fused to CFP/YFP, here we discriminated between seed-competent tau and inert monomer tau released from HEK293 cells. By analyzing the size-exclusion fractions of the media, we found that seed-competent tau was enriched in high molecular weight fractions of &amp;gt;2,000 kDa, while the majority of soluble tau in the media positively detected by ELISA was in low molecular weight fractions. We also found that lysosomal stress not only increased Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent release of seed-competent tau but also altered its molecular size. Inhibiting lysosomal exocytosis specifically decreased release of seed-competent tau without influencing total tau. These data underscore the differential response of seed-competent tau and inert tau to lysosomal stress and indicates the presence of distinct release mechanisms via lysosomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01250</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Stroke patients often use trunk to compensate for impaired upper limb motor function during upper limb rehabilitation training, which results in a reduced rehabilitation training effect. Detecting trunk compensations can improve the effect of rehabilitation training. This study investigates the feasibility of a surface electromyography-based trunk compensation detection (sEMG-bTCD) method. Five healthy subjects and nine stroke subjects with cognitive and comprehension skills were recruited to participate in the experiments. The sEMG signals from nine superficial trunk muscles were collected during three rehabilitation training tasks (reach-forward-back, reach-side-to-side, and reach-up-to-down motions) without compensation and with three common trunk compensations [lean-forward (LF), trunk rotation (TR), and shoulder elevation (SE)]. Preprocessing like filtering, active segment detection was performed and five time domain features (root mean square, variance, mean absolute value (MAV), waveform length, and the fourth order autoregressive model coefficient) were extracted from the collected sEMG signals. Excellent TCD performance was achieved in healthy participants by using support vector machine (SVM) classifier (LF: accuracy = 94.0%, AUC = 0.97, F1 = 0.94; TR: accuracy = 95.8%, AUC = 0.99, F1 = 0.96; SE: accuracy = 100.0%, AUC = 1.00, F1 = 1.00). By using SVM classifier, TCD performance in stroke participants was also obtained (LF: accuracy = 74.8%, AUC = 0.90, F1 = 0.73; TR: accuracy = 67.1%, AUC = 0.85, F1 = 0.71; SE: accuracy = 91.3%, AUC = 0.98, F1 = 0.90). Compared with the methods based on cameras or inertial sensors, better detection performance was obtained in both healthy and stroke participants. The results demonstrated the feasibility of the sEMG-bTCD method, and it helps to prompt the stroke patients to correct their incorrect posture, thereby improving the effectiveness of rehabilitation training.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01232</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) is a major contributor to global air pollution. The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that air pollution due to gasoline and diesel emissions from internal combustion engines of automobiles, trucks, locomotives, and ships leads to 800,000 premature deaths annually due to pulmonary, cardiovascular, and neurological complications. It has been observed that individuals living and working in areas of heavy vehicle traffic have high susceptibility to anxiety, depression, and cognitive deficits. Information regarding the mechanisms that potentially lead to detrimental mental health effects of TRAP is gradually increasing. Several studies have suggested that TRAP is associated with adverse effects in the central nervous system (CNS), primarily due to increase in oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Animal studies have provided further useful insights on the deleterious effects of vehicle exhaust emissions (VEEs). The mechanistic basis for these effects is unclear, although gasoline and diesel exhaust-induced neurotoxicity seems the most plausible cause. Several important points emerge from these studies. First, TRAP leads to neurotoxicity. Second, TRAP alters neurobehavioral function. Exactly how that happens remains unclear. This review article will discuss current state of the literature on this subject and potential leads that have surfaced from the preclinical work.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Stuttering Severity Modulates Effects of Non-invasive Brain Stimulation in Adults Who Stutter</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00411</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Stuttering is a neurodevelopmental disorder that manifests as frequent disruptions in the flow of speech, affecting 1% of adults. Treatments are limited to behavioral interventions with variable success and high relapse rates, particularly in adults. However, even in severe cases, fluency can be temporarily induced during conditions in which the speaker synchronizes his speech with external rhythmic cues, such as when reading in unison (choral speech) or with a metronome. Non-invasive neuromodulation techniques such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have shown promise in augmenting the effects of behavioral treatment during motor and speech/language rehabilitation, but only one study to date has examined behavioral modulatory effects of tDCS in the context of stuttering. Using high-definition (HD)-tDCS electrodes, which improves focality of stimulation relative to conventional tDCS, we investigated the effects of tDCS on speech fluency and brain activation in 14 adults who stutter (AWS). Either anodal or sham stimulation was delivered on separate days over left supplementary motor area (SMA). During stimulation, participants read aloud in sync with a metronome. Measures of speech fluency and brain activity functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were collected before and after stimulation. No significant differences in brain activity or speech fluency were found when comparing active and sham stimulation. However, stuttering severity significantly modulated the effect of stimulation: active stimulation attenuated the atypically strong association between stuttering severity and right thalamocortical network activity, especially in more severe speakers. These preliminary results warrant additional research into potential application of HD-tDCS to modulate speech motor networks to enhance fluency in stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Relationship of Inflammatory Cytokines From M1-Type Microglia/Macrophages at the Injured Site and Lumbar Enlargement With Neuropathic Pain After Spinal Cord Injury in the CCL21 Knockout (plt) Mouse</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00525</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes loss of normal sensation and often leads to debilitating neuropathic pain (NeP). Chronic NeP develops at or below the SCI lesion in as many as 80% of patients with SCI and may be induced by modulators of neuronal excitability released from activated microglia and macrophages. In the inflammatory response after SCI, different microglia/macrophage populations that are classically activated (M1 phenotype) or alternatively activated (M2 phenotype) have become of great interest. Chemokines have also recently attracted attention in neuron-microglia communication. CCL21 is a chemokine that activates microglia in the central nervous system (CNS) and is expressed only in neurons with an insult or mechanical injury. In this study using an SCI model in mutant (plt) mice with deficient CCL21 expression, we assessed post-SCI NeP and expression of microglia/macrophages and inflammatory cytokines at the injured site and lumbar enlargement. SCI-induced hypersensitivities to mechanical and thermal stimulation were relieved in plt mice compared with those in wild-type (C57BL/6) mice, although there was no difference in motor function. Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry analysis showed that the phenotype of microglia/macrophages was M1 type-dominant in both types of mice at the lesion site and lumbar enlargement. A decrease of M1-type microglia/macrophages was seen in plt mice compared with wild-type, while the number of M2-type microglia/macrophages did not differ between these mice. In immunoblot analysis, expression of M1-induced cytokines [tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon-γ (IFN-γ)] was decreased in plt mice, while that of M2-induced cytokines interleukin-4 (IL-4, IL-10) did not differ in the two types of mice. The results of this study indicate that suppression of expression of inflammatory cytokines by decreasing the number of M1-type microglia/macrophages at the injured site and lumbar enlargement is associated with provision of an environment for reduction of NeP. These findings may be useful for the design of new therapies to alleviate NeP after SCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Observations From a Mouse Model of Forebrain Voa1 Knockout: Focus on Hippocampal Structure and Function</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00484</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Voa protein is a subunit of V-ATPase proton pump which is essential to acidify intracellular organelles including synaptic vesicles. Voa1 is one of the four isoforms of Voa family with strong expression in neurons. Our present study was aimed to examine the role of Voa1 protein in mammalian brain neurons. To circumvent embryonic lethality, we generated conditional Voa1 knockout mice in which Voa1 was selectively deleted from forebrain pyramidal neurons. We performed experiments in the Voa1 knockout mice of ages 5–6 months to assess the persistent effects of Voa1 deletion. We found that the Voa1 knockout mice exhibited poor performance in the Morris water maze test compared to control mice. In addition, synaptic field potentials of the hippocampal CA1 region were greatly diminished in the Voa1 knockout mice when examined in brain slices in vitro. Furthermore, brain histological experiments showed severe degeneration of dorsal hippocampal CA1 neurons while CA3 neurons were largely preserved. The CA1 neurodegeneration was associated with general brain atrophy as overall hemispheric areas were reduced in the Voa1 cKO mice. Despite the CA1 degeneration and dysfunction, electroencephalographic recordings from the hippocampal CA3 area revealed aberrant spikes and non-convulsive discharges in the Voa1 knockout mice but not in control mice. These hippocampal spikes were suppressed by single intra-peritoneal injection of diazepam which is a benzodiazepine GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor enhancer. Together these results suggest that Voa1 related activities are essential for the survival of the targeted neurons in the dorsal hippocampal CA1 as well as other forebrain areas. We postulate that the Voa1 knockout mice may serve as a valuable model for further investigation of V-ATPase dysfunction related neuronal degeneration and functional abnormalities in forebrain areas particularly the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Hippocampus Radiomic Biomarkers for the Diagnosis of Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Machine Learning Method</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00323</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Recent evidence suggests the presence of hippocampal neuroanatomical abnormalities in subjects of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Our study aimed to identify the radiomic biomarkers of the hippocampus for building the classification models in aMCI diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: For this target, we recruited 42 subjects with aMCI and 44 normal controls (NC). The right and left hippocampi were segmented for each subject using an efficient learning-based method. Then, the radiomic analysis was applied to calculate and select the radiomic features. Finally, two logistic regression models were built based on the selected features obtained from the right and left hippocampi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: There were 385 features derived after calculation, and four features remained after feature selection from each group of data. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, precision, recall, and F-score of the classification evaluation index of the right hippocampus logistic regression model were 0.76, 0.71, 0.69, 0.69, 0.71, 0.69, 0.69, and 0.69, and those of the left hippocampus model were 0.79, 0.71, 0.54, 0.64, 0.63, 0.64, 0.54, and 0.58, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Results demonstrate the potential hippocampal radiomic biomarkers are valid for the aMCI diagnosis. The MRI-based radiomic analysis, with further improvement and validation, can be used to identify patients with aMCI and guide the individual treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Role of Tau Protein in Remodeling of Circadian Neuronal Circuits and Sleep</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00320</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Multiple neurological, physiological, and behavioral functions are synchronized by circadian clocks into daily rhythms. Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and related tauopathies are associated with a decay of circadian rhythms, disruption of sleep patterns, and impaired cognitive function but the mechanisms underlying these alterations are still unclear. Traditional approaches in neurodegeneration research have focused on understanding how pathology impinges on circadian function. Since in Alzheimer’s disease and related tauopathies tau proteostasis is compromised, here we sought to understand the role of tau protein in neuronal circadian biology and related behavior. Considering molecular mechanisms underlying circadian rhythms are conserved from Drosophila to humans, here we took advantage of a recently developed tau-deficient Drosophila line to show that loss of tau promotes dysregulation of daily circadian rhythms and sleep patterns. Strikingly, tau deficiency dysregulates the structural plasticity of the small ventral lateral circadian pacemaker neurons by disrupting the temporal cytoskeletal remodeling of its dorsal axonal projections and by inducing a slight increase in the cytoplasmic accumulation of core clock proteins. Taken together, these results suggest that loss of tau function participates in the regulation of circadian rhythms by modulating the correct operation and connectivity of core circadian networks and related behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Altered Intra- and Inter-regional Functional Connectivity of the Anterior Cingulate Gyrus in Patients With Tremor-Dominant Parkinson’s Disease Complicated With Sleep Disorder</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00319</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: To investigate changes in brain function at the regional and whole-brain levels in patients with tremor-dominant Parkinson’s disease (TDPD) complicated by sleep disorder (SD) by regional homogeneity (ReHo) and functional connectivity (FC) analysis of whole-brain resting-state functional magnetic resonance images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials and Methods: ReHo and seed-based FC analyses were conducted among 32 patients with TDPD and SD (TDPD-SD), 24 with TDPD and no SD (TDPD-NSD), and 23 healthy controls (HCs) to assess spontaneous brain activity and network-level brain function. Correlation analyses were used to examine the associations between brain activity and the clinical data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC) ReHo values differed significantly among the groups. ACC ReHo values were increased in TDPD-SD vs. HC and TDPD-SD vs. TDPD-NSD. ACC ReHo values were reduced in TDPD-NSD vs. HC. TDPD-SD ReHo values were positively correlated with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores (r = 0.41, p = 0.020) but negatively correlated with Parkinson’s Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS) scores (r = −0.38, p = 0.030). FC analysis using ACC as a mask showed that FC of the left olfactory cortex (L-OC), right straight gyrus (R-SG), right superior parietal gyrus (R-SPG), and right precuneus differed significantly among the groups. FC values between R-SG and ACC were significantly lower in TDPD-SD than in TDPD-NSD, while the FC of L-OC and R-OC with ACC was significantly lower in TDPD-SD than in HC. FC between ACC and L-OC, R-SPG, and the right precuneus was lower in TDPD-NSD than in HC. There was no correlation between the FC values and other clinical data in any of the groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Localized abnormal activity in TDPD-SD was chiefly triggered by ACC. The change in the ReHo of ACC is closely related to the severity of TDPD-associated SD, revealing the role of this region as a regulator of the sleep mechanism in TDPD. Significant abnormal FC was found between R-SG and ACC in TDPD-SD but was not shown to correlate with clinical data.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00312</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Age-related neurodegenerative and neurochemical changes are considered to be the basis for the decline of motor function; however, the change of effective connections in cortical motor networks that come with aging remains unclear. Here, we investigated the age-related changes of the dynamic interaction between cortical motor regions. Twenty young subjects and 20 older subjects underwent both right hand motor execution (ME) and right hand motor imagery (MI) tasks by using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Conditional Granger causality analysis (CGCA) was used to compare young and older adults’ effective connectivity among regions of the motor network during the tasks. The more effective connections among motor regions in older adults were found during ME; however, effective within-domain hemisphere connections were reduced, and the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal was significantly delayed in older adults during MI. Supplementary motor area (SMA) had a significantly higher In+Out degree within the network during ME and MI in older adults. Our results revealed a dynamic interaction within the motor network altered with aging during ME and MI, which suggested that the interaction with cortical motor neurons caused by the mental task was more difficult with aging. The age-related effects on the motor cortical network provide a new insight into our understanding of neurodegeneration in older individuals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Lagged Coupled Changes Between White Matter Microstructure and Processing Speed in Healthy Aging: A Longitudinal Investigation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00298</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Age-related differences in white matter (WM) microstructure have been linked to lower performance in tasks of processing speed in healthy older individuals. However, only few studies have examined this link in a longitudinal setting. These investigations have been limited to the correlation of simultaneous changes in WM microstructure and processing speed. Still little is known about the nature of age-related changes in WM microstructure, i.e., regionally distinct vs. global changes. In the present study, we addressed these open questions by exploring whether previous changes in WM microstructure were related to subsequent changes in processing speed: (a) 1 year later; or (b) 2 years later. Furthermore, we investigated whether age-related changes in WM microstructure were regionally specific or global. We used data from four occasions (covering 4 years) of the Longitudinal Healthy Aging Brain (LHAB) database project (N = 232; age range at baseline = 64–86). As a measure of WM microstructure, we used mean fractional anisotropy (FA) in 10 major WM tracts averaged across hemispheres. Processing speed was measured with four cognitive tasks. Statistical analyses were conducted with bivariate latent change score (LCS) models. We found, for the first time, evidence for lagged couplings between preceding changes in FA and subsequent changes in processing speed 2 years, but not 1 year later in some of the WM tracts (anterior thalamic radiation, superior longitudinal fasciculus). Our results supported the notion that FA changes were different between regional WM tracts rather than globally shared, with some tracts showing mean declines in FA, and others remaining relatively stable across 4 years.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Visual neurons respond to static images with specific dynamics: neuronal responses sum sub-additively over time, reduce in amplitude with repeated or sustained stimuli (neuronal adaptation), and are slower at low stimulus contrast. Here, we propose a simple model that predicts these seemingly disparate response patterns observed in a diverse set of measurements–intracranial electrodes in patients, fMRI, and macaque single unit spiking. The model takes a time-varying contrast time course of a stimulus as input, and produces predicted neuronal dynamics as output. Model computation consists of linear filtering, expansive exponentiation, and a divisive gain control. The gain control signal relates to but is slower than the linear signal, and this delay is critical in giving rise to predictions matched to the observed dynamics. Our model is simpler than previously proposed related models, and fitting the model to intracranial EEG data uncovers two regularities across human visual field maps: estimated linear filters (temporal receptive fields) systematically differ across and within visual field maps, and later areas exhibit more rapid and substantial gain control. The model is further generalizable to account for dynamics of contrast-dependent spike rates in macaque V1, and amplitudes of fMRI BOLD in human V1.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5J1pT69_J10&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Serum Amyloid A-Mediated Inflammasome Activation of Microglial Cells in Cerebral Ischemia</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/47/9465?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Serum amyloid A (SAA) proteins are acute-phase reactant associated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles and increase in the plasma 1000-fold during inflammation. Recent studies have implicated SAAs in innate immunity and various disorders; however, the precise mechanism eludes us. Previous studies have shown SAAs are elevated following stroke and cerebral ischemia, and our studies demonstrated that SAA-deficient mice reduce inflammation and infarct volumes in a mouse stroke model. Our studies demonstrate that SAA increases the cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β), which is mediated by Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, cathepsin B, and caspase-1 and may play a role in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. SAA induced the expression of NLRP3, which mediated IL-1β induction in murine BV-2 cells and both sex primary mouse microglial cells, in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Inhibition or KO of the NLRP3 in microglia prevented the increase in IL-1β. &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-l-cysteine and mito-TEMPO blocked the induction of IL-1β by inhibiting ROS with SAA treatment. In addition, inhibition of cathepsin B with different drugs or microglia from CatB-deficient mice attenuated inflammasome activation. Our studies suggest that the impact of SAA on inflammasome stimulation is mediated in part by the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts and Toll-like receptor proteins 2 and 4. SAA induced inflammatory cytokines and an M1 phenotype in the microglial cells while downregulating anti-inflammation M2 phenotype. These studies suggest that brain injury to can elicit a systemic inflammatory response mediated through SAA that contributes to the pathological outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In the present study, serum amyloid A can induce that activation of the inflammasome in microglial cells and give rise to IL-1β release, which can further inflammation in the brain following neurological diseases. The also presents a novel target for therapeutic approaches in stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Microglial P2Y12 Receptor Regulates Seizure-Induced Neurogenesis and Immature Neuronal Projections</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/47/9453?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Seizures are common in humans with various etiologies ranging from congenital aberrations to acute injuries that alter the normal balance of brain excitation and inhibition. A notable consequence of seizures is the induction of aberrant neurogenesis and increased immature neuronal projections. However, regulatory mechanisms governing these features during epilepsy development are not fully understood. Recent studies show that microglia, the brain's resident immune cell, contribute to normal neurogenesis and regulate seizure phenotypes. However, the role of microglia in aberrant neurogenic seizure contexts has not been adequately investigated. To address this question, we coupled the intracerebroventricular kainic acid model with current pharmacogenetic approaches to eliminate microglia in male mice. We show that microglia promote seizure-induced neurogenesis and subsequent seizure-induced immature neuronal projections above and below the pyramidal neurons between the DG and the CA3 regions. Furthermore, we identify microglial P2Y12 receptors (P2Y12R) as a participant in this neurogenic process. Together, our results implicate microglial P2Y12R signaling in epileptogenesis and provide further evidence for targeting microglia in general and microglial P2Y12R in specific to ameliorate proepileptogenic processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Epileptogenesis is a process by which the brain develops epilepsy. Several processes have been identified that confer the brain with such epileptic characteristics, including aberrant neurogenesis and increased immature neuronal projections. Understanding the mechanisms that promote such changes is critical in developing therapies to adequately restrain epileptogenesis. We investigated the role of purinergic P2Y12 receptors selectively expressed by microglia, the resident brain immune cells. We report, for the first time, that microglia in general and microglial P2Y12 receptors in specific promote both aberrant neurogenesis and increased immature neuronal projections. These results indicate that microglia enhance epileptogenesis by promoting these processes and suggest that targeting this immune axis could be a novel therapeutic strategy in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Transgenic Archaerhodopsin-3 Expression in Hypocretin/Orexin Neurons Engenders Cellular Dysfunction and Features of Type 2 Narcolepsy</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/47/9435?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Narcolepsy, characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, is associated with dysfunction of the hypothalamic hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt) system, either due to extensive loss of Hcrt cells (Type 1, NT1) or hypothesized Hcrt signaling impairment (Type 2, NT2). Accordingly, efforts to recapitulate narcolepsy-like symptoms in mice have involved ablating these cells or interrupting Hcrt signaling. Here, we describe &lt;i&gt;orexin/Arch&lt;/i&gt; mice, in which a modified archaerhodopsin-3 gene was inserted downstream of the &lt;i&gt;prepro-orexin&lt;/i&gt; promoter, resulting in expression of the yellow light-sensitive Arch-3 proton pump specifically within Hcrt neurons. Histological examination along with &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiological recordings of male and female &lt;i&gt;orexin/Arch&lt;/i&gt; mice demonstrated silencing of Hcrt neurons when these cells were photoilluminated. However, high expression of the &lt;i&gt;Arch&lt;/i&gt; transgene affected cellular and physiological parameters independent of photoillumination. The excitability of Hcrt neurons was reduced, and both circadian and metabolic parameters were perturbed in a subset of &lt;i&gt;orexin/Arch&lt;/i&gt; mice that exhibited high levels of Arch expression. &lt;i&gt;Orexin/Arch&lt;/i&gt; mice also had increased REM sleep under baseline conditions but did not exhibit cataplexy, a sudden loss of muscle tone during wakefulness characteristic of NT1. These aberrations resembled some aspects of mouse models with Hcrt neuron ablation, yet the number of Hcrt neurons in &lt;i&gt;orexin/Arch&lt;/i&gt; mice was not reduced. Thus, &lt;i&gt;orexin/Arch&lt;/i&gt; mice may be useful to investigate Hcrt system dysfunction when these neurons are intact, as is thought to occur in narcolepsy without cataplexy (NT2). These results also demonstrate the utility of extended phenotypic screening of transgenic models when specific neural circuits have been manipulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Optogenetics has become an invaluable tool for functional dissection of neural circuitry. While opsin expression is often achieved by viral injection, stably integrated transgenes offer some practical advantages. Here, we demonstrate successful transgenic expression of an inhibitory opsin in hypocretin/orexin neurons, which are thought to promote or maintain wakefulness. Both brief and prolonged illumination resulted in inhibition of these neurons and induced sleep. However, even in the absence of illumination, these cells exhibited altered electrical characteristics, particularly when transgene expression was high. These aberrant properties affected metabolism and sleep, resulting in a phenotype reminiscent of the narcolepsy Type 2, a sleep disorder for which no good animal model currently exists.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Threat Memory Reminder Under Matrix Metalloproteinase 9 Inhibitor Doxycycline Globally Reduces Subsequent Memory Plasticity</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/47/9424?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Associative memory can be rendered malleable by a reminder. Blocking the ensuing reconsolidation process is suggested as a therapeutic target for unwanted aversive memories. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is required for structural synapse remodeling involved in memory consolidation. Inhibiting MMP-9 with doxycycline is suggested to attenuate human threat conditioning. Here, we investigated whether MMP-9 inhibition also interferes with threat memory reconsolidation. Male and female human participants (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 78) learned the association between two visual conditioned stimuli (CS&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and a 50% chance of an unconditioned nociceptive stimulus (US), and between CS&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; and the absence of US. On day 7, one CS&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was reminded without reinforcement 3.5 h after ingesting either 200 mg of doxycycline or placebo. On day 14, retention of CS memory was assessed under extinction by fear-potentiated startle. Contrary to our expectations, we observed a greater CS&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CS&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; difference in participants who were reminded under doxycycline compared with placebo. Participants who were reminded under placebo showed extinction learning during the retention test, which was not observed in the doxycycline group. There was no difference between the reminded and the nonreminded CS&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in either group. In contrast, during relearning after the retention test, the CS&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CS&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; difference was more pronounced in the placebo group than in the doxycycline group. To summarize, a single dose of doxycycline before threat memory reminder appeared to have no specific impact on reconsolidation, but to globally impair extinction learning, and threat relearning, beyond drug clearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Matrix metalloproteinase-9 inhibition appears to attenuate memory consolidation. It could also be a target for blocking reconsolidation. Here, we test this hypothesis in human threat conditioning. We find that doxycycline has no specific impact on a reminded cue, but confers a global reduction in extinction learning and threat learning beyond the clearance of the drug.

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Identifying Parabrachial Neurons Selectively Regulating Satiety for Highly Palatable Food in Mice</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/6/ENEURO.0252-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Food consumption is necessary for organisms to maintain metabolic homeostasis. Both extrinsic and intrinsic processes, relayed via intricate neural circuitry, orchestrate the initiation and termination of food intake. More specifically, there are functionally distinct neural circuits that mediate either homeostatic or hedonic suppression of feeding. Notably, being satiated is a positive feeling whereas food aversion is a negative feeling. While significant progress has been made toward elucidating neural circuitry underlying aversive appetite suppression in mice, the circuitry underlying homeostatic satiety is not fully understood. The lateral parabrachial nucleus (PB&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) is known as a node that regulates various sensory and visceral processes. Here, we identified and selectively labeled neurons in the caudal lateral region of PB&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (PB&lt;sub&gt;cl&lt;/sub&gt;) that are activated by consumption of condensed milk, chocolate Ensure, or peanut butter, which we refer to as PB&lt;sub&gt;cl&lt;/sub&gt;-palatable-food activated neurons (PANs). Specific optogenetic activation of PANs induced positive place preference but decreased the consumption of high-caloric foods such as condensed milk, whereas silencing these cells significantly increased condensed milk consumption in feeding assays. Thus, the PB&lt;sub&gt;cl&lt;/sub&gt; PANs revealed here represent a novel neural substrate regulating caloric-sufficiency mediated satiation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: A Novel Birthdate-Labeling Method Reveals Segregated Parallel Projections of Mitral and External Tufted Cells in the Main Olfactory System</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/6/ENEURO.0234-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A fundamental strategy in sensory coding is parallel processing, whereby unique, distinct features of sensation are computed and projected to the central target in the form of submodal maps. It remains unclear, however, whether such parallel processing strategy is employed in the main olfactory system, which codes the complex hierarchical odor and behavioral scenes. A potential scheme is that distinct subsets of projection neurons in the olfactory bulb (OB) form parallel projections to the targets. Taking advantage of the observation that the distinct projection neurons develop at different times, we developed a Cre-loxP-based method that allows for birthdate-specific labeling of cell bodies and their axon projections in mice. This birthdate tag analysis revealed that the mitral cells (MCs) born in an early developmental stage and the external tufted cells (TCs) born a few days later form segregated parallel projections. Specifically, the latter subset converges the axons onto only two small specific targets, one of which, located at the anterolateral edge of the olfactory tubercle (OT), excludes widespread MC projections. This target is made up of neurons that express dopamine D1 but not D2 receptor and corresponds to the most anterolateral isolation of the CAP compartments (aiCAP) that were defined previously. This finding of segregated projections suggests that olfactory sensing does indeed involve parallel processing of functionally distinct submodalities. Importantly, the birthdate tag method used here may pave the way for deciphering the functional meaning of these individual projection pathways in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Spreading depolarizations occur in mild traumatic brain injuries and are associated with post-injury behavior</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0070-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Millions of people suffer mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBIs) every year, and there is growing evidence that repeated injuries can result in long-term pathology. The acute symptoms of these injuries may or may not include the loss of consciousness but do include disorientation, confusion, and/or the inability to concentrate. Most of these acute symptoms spontaneously resolve within a few hours or days. However, the underlying physiological and cellular mechanisms remain unclear. Spreading depolarizations (SDs) are known to occur in rodents and humans following moderate and severe TBIs, and SDs have long been hypothesized to occur in more mild injuries. Using a closed skull impact model, we investigated the presence of SDs immediately following a mTBI. Animals remained motionless for multiple minutes following an impact and once recovered had fewer episodes of movement. We recorded the defining electrophysiological properties of SDs, including the large extracellular field potential shifts and suppression of high frequency cortical activity. Impact-induced SDs were also associated with a propagating wave of reduced cerebral blood flow. In the wake of the SD, there was a prolonged period of reduced CBF that recovered in approximately 90 minutes. Similar to SDs in more severe injuries, the impact-induced SDs could be blocked with ketamine. Interestingly, impacts at a slower velocity did not produce the prolonged immobility and did not initiate SDs. Our data suggest that SDs play a significant role in mTBIs and SDs may contribute to the acute symptoms of mTBIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Millions of people suffer from concussions every year and repeated concussions are associated with Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). Spreading Depolarizations (SDs) are propagating waves of brain tissue depolarization that have been associated with strokes, subarachnoid hemorrhages, and moderate to severe brain injuries. SDs have long been hypothesized to occur in mild brain injuries, but have not been recorded. Our studies are the first to directly record the electrophysiological properties of SDs following a closed skull impact, and suggest that SDs may contribute to the acute symptoms of mTBIs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2019.00032</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The connection strength of most chemical synapses changes dynamically during normal use as a function of the recent history of activity. The phenomenon is known as short-term synaptic plasticity or synaptic dynamics, and is thought to be involved in processing and filtering information as it is transmitted across the synaptic cleft. Multiple presynaptic mechanisms have been implicated, but large gaps remain in our understanding of how the mechanisms are modulated and how they interact. One important factor is the timing of recruitment of synaptic vesicles to a readily-releasable pool. A number of studies have concluded that activity and/or residual Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; can accelerate the mechanism, but alternative explanations for some of the evidence have emerged. Here I review the methodology that we have developed for isolating the recruitment and the dependence on activity from other kinds of mechanisms that are activated concurrently.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Optic radiation (OR) tractography may help predict and reduce post-neurosurgical visual field deficits. OR tractography methods currently lack pediatric and surgical focus.&lt;/p&gt;Purpose&lt;p&gt;We propose a clinically feasible OR tractography strategy in a pediatric neurosurgery setting and examine its intra-rater and inter-rater reliability/agreements.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Preoperative and intraoperative MRI data were obtained from six epilepsy and two brain tumor patients on 3 Tesla MRI scanners. Four raters with different clinical experience followed the proposed strategy to perform probabilistic OR tractography with manually drawing anatomical landmarks to reconstruct the OR pathway, based on fiber orientation distributions estimated from high angular resolution diffusion imaging data. Intra- and inter-rater reliabilities/agreements of tractography results were assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and dice similarity coefficient (DSC) across various tractography and OR morphological metrics, including the lateral geniculate body positions, tract volumes, and Meyer’s loop position from temporal anatomical landmarks.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Good to excellent intra- and inter-rater reproducibility was demonstrated for the majority of OR reconstructions (ICC = 0.70–0.99; DSC = 0.84–0.89). ICC was higher for non-lesional (0.82–0.99) than lesional OR (0.70–0.99). The non-lesional OR’s mean volume was 22.66 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;; the mean Meyer’s loop position was 29.4 mm from the temporal pole, 5.89 mm behind of and 10.26 mm in front of the temporal ventricular horn. The greatest variations (± 1.00–3.00 mm) were observed near pathology, at the tract edges or at cortical endpoints. The OR tractography were used to assist surgical planning and guide lesion resection in all cases, no patient had new visual field deficits postoperatively.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The proposed tractography strategy generates reliable and reproducible OR tractography images that can be reliably implemented in the routine, non-emergency pediatric neurosurgical setting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00522</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microglia, the immune cells of the brain, play a major role in the maintenance of brain homeostasis and constantly screen the brain environment to detect any infection or damage. Once activated by a stimulus, microglial cells initiate an immune response followed by the resolution of brain inflammation. A failure or deviation in the housekeeping function of these guardian cells can lead to multiple diseases, including brain cancer and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). A small number of studies have investigated the causal relation of both diseases, thereby revealing an inverse relationship where cancer patients have a reduced risk to develop AD and vice versa. In this review, we aim to shed light on the role of microglia in the fate to develop specifically glioma as one type of cancer or AD. We will examine the common and/or opposing genetic predisposition as well as associated pathways of these diseases to unravel a possible involvement of microglia in the occurrence of either disease. Lastly, a set of guidelines will be proposed for future research and diagnostics to clarify and improve the knowledge on the role of microglia in the decision toward one pathology or another.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Spinal V3 Interneurons and Left–Right Coordination in Mammalian Locomotion</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00516</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Commissural interneurons (CINs) mediate interactions between rhythm-generating locomotor circuits located on each side of the spinal cord and are necessary for left-right limb coordination during locomotion. While glutamatergic V3 CINs have been implicated in left-right coordination, their functional connectivity remains elusive. Here, we addressed this issue by combining experimental and modeling approaches. We employed Sim1&lt;sup&gt;Cre/+&lt;/sup&gt;; Ai32 mice, in which light-activated Channelrhodopsin-2 was selectively expressed in V3 interneurons. Fictive locomotor activity was evoked by NMDA and 5-HT in the isolated neonatal lumbar spinal cord. Flexor and extensor activities were recorded from left and right L2 and L5 ventral roots, respectively. Bilateral photoactivation of V3 interneurons increased the duration of extensor bursts resulting in a slowed down on-going rhythm. At high light intensities, extensor activity could become sustained. When light stimulation was shifted toward one side of the cord, the duration of extensor bursts still increased on both sides, but these changes were more pronounced on the contralateral side than on the ipsilateral side. Additional bursts appeared on the ipsilateral side not seen on the contralateral side. Further increase of the stimulation could suppress the contralateral oscillations by switching to a sustained extensor activity, while the ipsilateral rhythmic activity remained. To delineate the function of V3 interneurons and their connectivity, we developed a computational model of the spinal circuits consisting of two (left and right) rhythm generators (RGs) interacting via V0&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;, V0&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;, and V3 CINs. Both types of V0 CINs provided mutual inhibition between the left and right flexor RG centers and promoted left-right alternation. V3 CINs mediated mutual excitation between the left and right extensor RG centers. These interactions allowed the model to reproduce our current experimental data, while being consistent with previous data concerning the role of V0&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; and V0&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; CINs in securing left–right alternation and the changes in left–right coordination following their selective removal. We suggest that V3 CINs provide mutual excitation between the spinal neurons involved in the control of left and right extensor activity, which may promote left-right synchronization during locomotion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00322</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tau is a microtubule-associated protein, localizing mainly in the axon of mature neurons. Phenotypic analysis of Tau knockout mice has revealed an impairment of synaptic plasticity but without gross changes in brain morphology. Since we previously described the presence of tau mRNA in the somatodendritic compartment, including the postsynapse, and demonstrated that it could be locally translated in response to glutamate, it appears that the regulated translation of synaptic tau can have a direct impact on synaptic function. Using SH-SY5Y cells, we herein confirm that glutamate dose-dependently regulates the translation of tau protein without altering tau mRNA levels. This is supported by the finding that cycloheximide blocks glutamate-stimulated increases in tau protein levels. Our observation that neural excitation can directly upregulate tau mRNA translation helps explain the pathological accumulation of tau in the somatodendrite.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00311</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurons are highly specialized post-mitotic cells that are inherently dependent on mitochondria owing to their high bioenergetic demand. Mitochondrial dysfunction is therefore associated with various age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), wherein accumulation of damaged and dysfunctional mitochondria has been reported as an early symptom further contributing to disease progression. In AD, impairment of mitochondrial function causes bioenergetic deficiency, intracellular calcium imbalance and oxidative stress, thereby aggravating the effect of Aβ and tau pathologies, leading to synaptic dysfunction, cognitive impairment and memory loss. Although there are reports suggesting intricate parallelism between mitochondrial dysfunction and AD pathologies such as Aβ aggregation and hyperphosphorylated tau accumulation, the factors that drive the pathogenesis of either are unclear. In addition, emerging evidence suggest that mitochondrial quality control (QC) mechanisms such as mitophagy are impaired in AD. As an important mitochondrial QC mechanism, mitophagy plays a critical role in maintaining neuronal health and function. Studies show that various proteins involved in mitophagy, mitochondrial dynamics, and mitochondrial biogenesis are affected in AD. Compromised mitophagy may also be attributed to impairment in autophagosome–lysosome fusion and defects in lysosomal acidification. Therapeutic interventions aiming to restore mitophagy functions can be used as a strategy for ameliorating AD pathogenesis. Recent evidence implicates the role of microglial activation via mitophagy induction in reducing amyloid plaque load. This review summarizes the current developments in the field of mitophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0298-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons receive glutamatergic and/or GABAergic input from other local neurons within the VTA. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) activity is capable of modulating such intra-VTA transmission, but the mechanisms are unclear. Here, we isolated monosynaptic glutamate or GABA transmission from mouse medial VTA (mVTA) to lateral VTA (latVTA) using pharmacology and optogenetics, and we studied nicotine’s ability to modulate these modes of transmission. Nicotine’s action on mVTA to latVTA glutamate transmission was bidirectional; nicotine enhanced glutamate release in half of the recorded latVTA cells and inhibited release in the other half. Nicotine-mediated reduction in glutamate release was reversed by blockade of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. This, coupled with expression data demonstrating co-expression of vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (vGluT2) and glutamate decarboxylase 2 (Gad2) in mVTA neurons, suggests that nicotine is able to stimulate GABA co-release from mVTA vGluT2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons. Nicotine had an altogether different effect on mVTA to latVTA GABA release from Gad2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells; nicotine suppressed GABA release from mVTA Gad2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; terminals in nearly all cells tested. Together, these data uncover a complex system of local circuitry in the VTA that is modulated by nAChR activity. These actions of nicotine, which occurred at concentrations of nicotine found in the artificial cerebrospinal fluid of cigarette smokers, may play a role in the reward system’s adaptive response to repeated nicotine exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; This study uncovers novel aspects of nAChR neuropharmacology and VTA neurobiology that have implications for understanding nicotine dependence mechanisms. Nicotine must interact with receptors and circuits in VTA to cause dependence, and this study advances our understanding of specific nicotine-sensitive circuits that reside within this brain area. Identifying these novel nicotine-sensitive systems could provide new/additional mechanisms for targeting with smoking cessation drugs or therapeutics. Our results also add new details to the conceptual framework associated with reward circuit wiring, which could lead to an improved mechanistic understanding of natural reward processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Temporary visual deprivation causes decorrelation of spatio-temporal population responses in adult mouse auditory cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0269-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Although within-modality sensory plasticity is limited to early developmental periods, cross-modal plasticity can occur even in adults. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiological studies have shown that transient visual deprivation (dark exposure, DE) in adult mice improves the frequency selectivity and discrimination of neurons in thalamorecipient layer 4 (L4) of primary auditory cortex (A1). Since sound information is processed hierarchically in A1 by populations of neurons, we investigated if DE alters network activity in A1 L4 and layer 2/3 (L2/3). We examined neuronal populations in both L4 and L2/3 using &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; two-photon Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging of transgenic mice expressing GCaMP6s. We find that one week of DE in adult mice increased the sound evoked responses and frequency selectivity of both L4 and L2/3 neurons. Moreover, after DE the frequency representation changed with L4 and L2/3 showing a reduced representation of cells with best frequencies between 8 and 16 kHz and an increased representation of cells with best frequencies above 32 kHz. Cells in L4 and L2/3 showed decreased pairwise signal correlations (SCs) consistent with sharper tuning curves. The decreases in SCs were larger in L4 than in L2/3. The decreased pairwise correlations indicate a sparsification of A1 responses to tonal stimuli. Thus, cross-modal experience in adults can both alter the sound-evoked responses of A1 neurons and change activity correlations within A1 potentially enhancing the encoding of auditory stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance&lt;/b&gt; Our results show that the brief period of visual deprivation in mice can alter the tone evoked responses of neurons as well as the frequency representation in multiple layers of the primary auditory cortex. Thus, the tuning of auditory cortex neurons can be altered even after the critical period. Moreover, our results show that pairwise correlations are decreased indicating a sparsification of the evoked responses in the auditory cortex. These results add to the mounting evidence that cross-modal sensory experience has the power to alter network circuitry and population dynamics even into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Differences in GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors result in distinct long-term plasticity at ipsilateral vs. contralateral cortico-striatal synapses</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0118-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Excitatory neurons in the primary motor cortex project bilaterally to the striatum. However, whether synaptic structure and function in ipsilateral and contralateral cortico-striatal pathways is identical or different remains largely unknown. Here, we describe that excitatory synapses in the mouse contralateral pathway have higher levels of NMDA-type of glutamate receptors (NMDARs) than those in the ipsilateral pathway, although both synapses utilize the same presynaptic vesicular glutamate transporter. We also show that NMDARs containing the GluN2B subunit, but not GluN2A, contribute to this difference. The altered NMDAR subunit composition in these two pathways results in opposite synaptic plasticity induced by theta burst stimulus: long-term depression in the ipsilateral pathway and long-term potentiation in the contralateral pathway. The standard LTD-inducing protocol using paired post- and presynaptic activity triggers synaptic depression at ipsilateral pathway synapses, but not at those of the contralateral pathway. Altogether, our results provide novel and unexpected evidence for the lack of bilaterality of NMDAR-mediated synaptic transmission at cortico-striatal pathways due to differences in the expression of GluN2B subunits, which results in differences in bidirectional synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Excitatory neurons in the cortex project bilaterally to the striatum. It is generally assumed that synapses formed by ipsilateral and contralateral cortical efferents have similar synaptic features, and serve to synchronize inter-hemispheric activity. We demonstrate that the contralateral cortico-striatal pathway has higher levels of GluN2B-containing NMDARs than the ipsilateral pathway. This altered content of GluN2B and GluN2A subunits in NMDARs results in different forms of LTP and LTD at excitatory synapses in the ipsilateral and contralateral pathways. These findings provide a novel mechanistic insight into how cortical neurons distinctly modulate ipsilateral and contralateral subcortical regions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Abnormal photic entrainment to phase-delaying stimuli in the R6/2 mouse model of Huntington's disease, despite retinal responsiveness to light</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0088-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The circadian clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in mammals entrains to ambient light via the retinal photoreceptors. This allows behavioural rhythms to change in synchrony with seasonal and daily changes in light period. Circadian rhythmicity is progressively disrupted in Huntington’s disease (HD) and in HD mouse models such as the transgenic R6/2 line. Although retinal afferent inputs to the SCN are disrupted in R6/2 mice at late stages, they can respond to changes in light-dark cycles, as seen in jet lag and 23-hour-day paradigms. To investigate photic entrainment and SCN function in R6/2 mice at different stages of disease, we first assessed the effect on locomotor activity of exposure to a 15-minute light pulse given at different times of the day. We then placed the mice under 5 non-standard light conditions. These were light cycle regimes (T-cycles) of T21 (10.5h light:10.5h dark), T22 (11h light:11h dark), T26 (13h light:13h dark), constant light or constant dark. We found a progressive impairment in photic synchronisation in R6/2 mice when the stimuli required the SCN to lengthen rhythms (phase-delaying light pulse, T26 or constant light), but normal synchronisation to stimuli that required the SCN to shorten rhythms (phase-advancing light pulse and T22). Despite the behavioural abnormalities, we found that &lt;i&gt;Per1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;c-fos&lt;/i&gt; gene expression remained photo-inducible in SCN of R6/2 mice. Both the endogenous drift of the R6/2 mouse SCN to shorter periods and its inability to adapt to phase-delaying changes will contribute to the HD circadian dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Imaging and Quantification of Myelin Integrity After Injury With Spectral Confocal Reflectance Microscopy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00275</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Developing a high-throughput approach to quantify the extent of myelin integrity in preclinical models of demyelinating diseases will enhance our capacity to identify novel therapies for myelin repair. In light of the technical limitations of electron microscopy and immunohistochemical analyses of myelination, we have utilized a novel imaging technique, spectral confocal reflectance (SCoRe) microscopy. SCoRe takes advantage of the optically reflective properties of compact myelin, allowing the integrity of compact myelin to be quantified over the course of the cuprizone-induced model of central demyelination. We applied SCoRe imaging on fixed frozen brain sections. SCoRe analysis of control mice identified an increase in corpus callosum myelination during the period of cuprizone administration and recovery, suggesting that the normal developmental processes of myelination are ongoing at this time. Importantly, analysis of mice subjected to cuprizone identified a significant reduction in compact myelin in both rostral and caudal corpus callosum compared to age-matched control mice. SCoRe microscopy also allowed the visualization and quantification of the amount of myelin debris in demyelinating lesions. Combining SCoRe imaging with immunohistochemistry, we quantified the amount of myelin debris within IBA-1+ microglia and found that 11% of myelin debris colocalized in microglia irrespective of the callosal regions, with the vast majority of debris outside of microglia. In summary, we have demonstrated that SCoRe microscopy is an effective and powerful tool to perform both quantitative and qualitative analyses of compact myelin integrity in health or after injury in vivo, demonstrating its future application in high-throughput assessments and screening of the therapeutic efficacy of myelin repair therapies in preclinical animal models of demyelinating diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00274</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A number of [PSI&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]-no-more (PNM) mutations, eliminating [PSI&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] prion, were previously described in SUP35. In this study, we designed and analyzed a new PNM mutation based on the parallel in-register β-structure of Sup35 prion fibrils suggested by the known experimental data. In such an arrangement, substitution of non-charged residues by charged ones may destabilize the fibril structure. We introduced Q33K/A34K amino acid substitutions into the Sup35 protein, corresponding allele was called sup35-M0. The mutagenized residues were chosen based on ArchCandy in silico prediction of high inhibitory effect on the amyloidogenic potential of Sup35. The experiments confirmed that Sup35-M0 leads to the elimination of [PSI&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] with high efficiency. Our data suggested that the elimination of the [PSI&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] prion is associated with the decreased aggregation properties of the protein. The new mutation can induce the prion with very low efficiency and is able to propagate only weak [PSI&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] prion variants. We also showed that Sup35-M0 protein co-aggregates with the wild-type Sup35 in vivo. Moreover, our data confirmed the utility of the strategy of substitution of non-charged residues by charged ones to design new mutations to inhibit a prion formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Optimized Configuration of Functional Brain Network for Processing Semantic Audiovisual Stimuli Underlying the Modulation of Attention: A Graph-Based Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00067</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Semantic audiovisual stimuli have a facilitatory effect on behavioral performance and influence the integration of multisensory inputs across sensory modalities. Many neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies investigated the neural mechanisms of multisensory semantic processing and reported that attention modulates the response to multisensory semantic inputs. In the present study, we designed an functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment of semantic discrimination using the unimodal auditory, unimodal visual and bimodal audiovisual stimuli with semantic information. By manipulating the stimuli present on attended and unattended position, we recorded the task-related fMRI data corresponding to the unimodal auditory, unimodal visual and bimodal audiovisual stimuli in attended and unattended conditions. We also recorded the fMRI data in resting state. Then the fMRI method was used together with a graph theoretical analysis to construct the functional brain networks in task-related and resting states and quantitatively characterize the topological network properties. The aim of our present study is to explore the characteristics of functional brain networks that process semantic audiovisual stimuli in attended and unattended conditions, revealing the neural mechanism of multisensory processing and the modulation of attention. The behavioral results showed that the audiovisual stimulus presented simultaneously promoted the performance of semantic discrimination task. And the analyses of network properties showed that compared with the resting-state condition, the functional networks of processing semantic audiovisual stimuli (both in attended and unattended conditions) had greater small-worldness, global efficiency, and lower clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, global efficiency and hierarchy. In addition, the hubs were concentrated in the bilateral temporal lobes, especially in the anterior temporal lobes (ATLs), which were positively correlated to reaction time (RT). Moreover, attention significantly altered the degree of small-worldness and the distribution of hubs in the functional network for processing semantic audiovisual stimuli. Our findings suggest that the topological structure of the functional brain network for processing semantic audiovisual stimulus is modulated by attention, and has the characteristics of high efficiency and low wiring cost, which maintains an optimized balance between functional segregation and integration for multisensory processing efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Pre-emptive Intervention for Autism Spectrum Disorder: Theoretical Foundations and Clinical Translation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00066</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are an emergent public health problem, placing significant burden upon the individual, family and health system. ASD are polygenetic spectrum disorders of neural connectome development, in which one or more feedback loops amplify small genetic, structural, or functional variations in the very early development of motor and sensory-motor pathways. These perturbations trigger a ‘butterfly effect’ of unpredictable cascades of structural and functional imbalances in the global neuronal workspace, resulting in atypical behaviors, social communication, and cognition long-term. The first 100 days post-term are critically neuroplastic and comprise an injury-sensitive developmental window, characterized by a neural biomarker, the persistence of the cortical subplate, and a behavioral biomarker, the crying diathesis. By the time potential diagnostic signs are identified, from 6 months of age, ASD neuropathy is already entrenched. The International Society for Autism Research Special Interest Group has called for pre-emptive intervention, based upon rigorous theoretical frames, and real world translation and evaluation. This paper responds to that call. It synthesizes heterogenous evidence concerning ASD etiologies from both psychosocial and biological research literatures with complexity science and evolutionary biology, to propose a theoretical framework for pre-emptive intervention. This paper hypothesizes that environmental factors resulting from a mismatch between environment of evolutionary adaptedness and culture initiate or perpetuate early motor and sensory-motor lesions, triggering a butterfly effect of multi-directional cascades of atypical developmental in the complex adaptive system of the parent and ASD-susceptible infant. Chronic sympathetic nervous system/hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperarousal and disrupted parent-infant biobehavioral synchrony are the key biologic and behavioral mechanisms perpetuating these atypical developmental cascades. A clinical translation of this evidence is proposed, for application antenatally and in the first 6 months of life, as pre-emptive intervention for ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is an autoimmune inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS). The purpose of the study was to examine the association between the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met genotype and structural and functional optic nerve damage in the eyes of NMOSD patients. A total of 17 NMOSD subjects (34 eyes) were included in the study and were divided into subgroups based on optic neuritis (ON) history and BDNF Val66Met polymorphisms. The mean (range) age was 47.8 (23–78) years, and the mean (SD) disease duration was 7.4 (2–39) years. All participants had undergone optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans for global retinal nerve fiber layer (gRNFL) and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thickness and multifocal visual evoked potential (mfVEP) test for amplitude and latency. BDNF Val66Met polymorphisms were genotyped in all participants. OCT and mfVEP changes were compared between two genotype groups (Met carriers vs. Val homozygotes) by using the generalised estimating equation (GEE) models. The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism was significantly associated with more severe nerve fiber layer damage and axonal loss in ON eyes of NMOSD subjects. Met carriers had more significantly reduced GCIPL (P = 0.002) and gRNFL (P &amp;lt; 0.001) thickness as well as more delayed mfVEP latency (P = 0.008) in ON eyes. No association was found between Val66Met variants and non-ON (NON)-eye of the participants. These findings suggest that the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism may be associated with optic nerve damage caused by acute ON attacks in NMOSD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01233</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;EphA4 is a receptor of the Eph-ephrin system, which plays an important role in axon guidance during development. Previously, we identified EphA4 as a genetic modifier of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in both zebrafish and rodent models, via modulation of the intrinsic vulnerability, and re-sprouting capacity of motor neurons. Moreover, loss of EphA4 rescued the motor axon phenotype in a zebrafish model of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Similar to ALS, SMA is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting spinal motor neurons resulting in neuromuscular junction (NMJ) denervation, muscle atrophy and paralysis. In this study, we investigated the disease modifying potential of reduced EphA4 protein levels in the SMNΔ7 mouse model for severe SMA. Reduction of EphA4 did not improve motor function, survival, motor neuron survival or NMJ innervation. Our data suggest that either lowering EphA4 has limited therapeutic potential in SMA or that the clinical severity hampers the potential beneficial role of EphA4 reduction in this mouse model for SMA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

In recent years, this technique has been widely used in clinic, and an increasing number of studies have reported its mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of rTMS-mediated autophagy flux in human bone mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A frequency of 50 Hz was employed. Cells were divided into five groups: (1) normal, (2) sham, (3) 0.5 T, (4) 1.0 T, and (5) 1.5 T. Cells were stimulated for 20 min/day. The levels of p62, LC3-II/I, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK), ERK, phosphorylated-AKT (p-AKT), AKT, phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR), mTOR, phosphorylated protein kinase A (p-PKA), PKA, phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (p-EGFR), EGFR, Nanog, Oct4, Sox2, and NMDA receptor (NMDAR1) were investigated by western blotting. Intracellular calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) levels were quantified by flow cytometry. p62 and LC3 expression was also assessed by immunofluorescence analysis.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;In the 0.5 T group, rTMS increased the expression of LC3-II/I, p-ERK/ERK, and NMDAR1 and decreased the levels of p62 and p-mTOR/mTOR than in the normal group. The ratio of p-AKT/AKT, p-PKA/PKA, and p-EGFR/EGFR and the expression of Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 remained unchanged. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed colocalization of p62 with LC3 puncta, and flow cytometry analysis displayed that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels were elevated. However, in the 1.0 and 1.5 T groups, no changes in the expression of these autophagy markers were observed.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;In the 0.5 T group, high-frequency rTMS can induce autophagy through NMDAR–Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;–ERK–mTOR signaling in BMSCs.

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01202</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Defects in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane shaping and interaction with other organelles seem to be a crucial mechanism underlying Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP) neurodegeneration. REEP1, a transmembrane protein belonging to TB2/HVA22 family, is implicated in SPG31, an autosomal dominant form of HSP, and its interaction with Atlastin/SPG3A and Spastin/SPG4, the other two major HSP linked proteins, has been demonstrated to play a crucial role in modifying ER architecture. In addition, the Drosophila ortholog of REEP1, named ReepA, has been found to regulate the response to ER neuronal stress. Herein we investigated the role of ReepA in ER morphology and stress response. ReepA is upregulated under stress conditions and aging. Our data show that ReepA triggers a selective activation of Ire1 and Atf6 branches of Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) and modifies ER morphology. Drosophila lacking ReepA showed Atf6 and Ire1 activation, expansion of ER sheet-like structures, locomotor dysfunction and shortened lifespan. Furthermore, we found that naringenin, a flavonoid that possesses strong antioxidant and neuroprotective activity, can rescue the cellular phenotypes, the lifespan and locomotor disability associated with ReepA loss of function. Our data highlight the importance of ER homeostasis in nervous system functionality and HSP neurodegenerative mechanisms, opening new opportunities for HSP treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01194</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain regenerative strategies through the transplantation of stem cells hold the potential to promote functional rescue of brain lesions caused either by trauma or neurodegenerative diseases. Most of the positive modulations fostered by stem cells are fueled by bystander effects, namely increase of neurotrophic factors levels and reduction of neuroinflammation. Nevertheless, the ultimate goal of cell therapies is to promote cell replacement. Therefore, the ability of stem cells to migrate and differentiate into neurons that later become integrated into the host neuronal network replacing the lost neurons has also been largely explored. However, as most of the preclinical studies demonstrate, there is a small functional integration of graft-derived neurons into host neuronal circuits. Thus, it is mandatory to better study the whole brain cell therapy approach in order to understand what should be better comprehended concerning graft-derived neuronal and glial cells migration and integration before we can expect these therapies to be ready as a viable solution for brain disorder treatment. Therefore, this review discusses the positive mechanisms triggered by cell transplantation into the brain, the limitations of adult brain plasticity that might interfere with the neuroregeneration process, as well as some strategies tested to overcome some of these limitations. It also considers the efforts that have been made by the regulatory authorities to lead to better standardization of preclinical and clinical studies in this field in order to reduce the heterogeneity of the obtained results.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Individual Differences in Verb Bias Sensitivity in Children and Adults With Developmental Language Disorder</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00402</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A number of experiments support the hypothetical utility of statistical information for language learning and processing among both children and adults. However, tasks in these studies are often very general, and only a few include populations with developmental language disorder (DLD). We wanted to determine whether a stronger relationship might be shown when the measure of statistical learning is chosen for its relevance to the language task when including a substantial number of participants with DLD. The language ability we measured was sensitivity to verb bias – the likelihood of a verb to appear with a certain argument or interpretation. A previous study showed adults with DLD were less sensitive to verb bias than their typical peers. Verb bias sensitivity had not yet been tested in children with DLD. In Study 1, 49 children, ages 7–9 years, 17 of whom were classified as having DLD, completed a task designed to measure sensitivity to verb bias through implicit and explicit measures. We found children with and without DLD showed sensitivity to verb bias in implicit but not explicit measures, with no differences between groups. In Study 2, we used a multiverse approach to investigate whether individual differences in statistical learning predicted verb bias sensitivity in these participants as well as in a dataset of adult participants. Our analysis revealed no evidence of a relationship between statistical learning and verb bias sensitivity in children, which was not unexpected given we found no group differences in Study 1. Statistical learning predicted sensitivity to verb bias as measured through explicit measures in adults, though results were not robust. These findings suggest that verb bias may still be relatively unstable in school age children, and thus may not play the same role in sentence processing in children as in adults. It would also seem that individuals with DLD may not be using the same mechanisms during processing as their typically developing (TD) peers in adulthood. Thus, statistical information may differ in relevance for language processing in individuals with and without DLD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Theta Modulated Neural Phase Coherence Facilitates Speech Fluency in Adults Who Stutter</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00394</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Adults who stutter (AWS) display altered patterns of neural phase coherence within the speech motor system preceding disfluencies. These altered patterns may distinguish fluent speech episodes from disfluent ones. Phase coherence is relevant to the study of stuttering because it reflects neural communication within brain networks. In this follow-up study, the oscillatory cortical dynamics preceding fluent speech in AWS and adults who do not stutter (AWNS) were examined during a single-word delayed reading task using electroencephalographic (EEG) techniques. Compared to AWNS, fluent speech preparation in AWS was characterized by a decrease in theta-gamma phase coherence and a corresponding increase in theta-beta coherence level. Higher spectral powers in the beta and gamma bands were also observed preceding fluent utterances by AWS. Overall, there was altered neural communication during speech planning in AWS that provides novel evidence for atypical allocation of feedforward control by AWS even before fluent utterances.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Optogenetic/Chemogenetic Activation of GABAergic Neurons in the Ventral Tegmental Area Facilitates General Anesthesia via Projections to the Lateral Hypothalamus in Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00073</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ventral tegmental area (VTA) reportedly regulates sleep and wakefulness through communication with the lateral hypothalamus (LH). It has also been suggested that adequate anesthesia produced by administration of chloral hydrate, ketamine, or halothane significantly reduces the GABAergic neuronal firing rate within the VTA. However, the exact effects on GABAergic neurons in the VTA and the mechanisms through which these neurons modulate anesthesia through associated neural circuits is still unclear. Here, we used optogenetic and chemogenetic methods to specifically activate or inhibit GABAergic neuronal perikarya in the VTA or their projections to the LH in Vgat-Cre mice. Electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral analyses and burst suppression ratio (BSR) calculations were conducted following administration of 0.8 or 1.0% isoflurane, respectively; and loss of righting reflex (LORR), recovery of righting reflex (RORR), and anesthesia sensitivity were assessed under 1.4% isoflurane anesthesia. The results showed that activation of GABAergic neurons in the VTA increased delta wave power from 40.0 to 46.4% (P = 0.006) and decreased gamma wave power from 15.2 to 11.5% (P = 0.017) during anesthesia maintenance. BSR was increased from 51.8 to 68.3% (P = 0.017). Induction time (LORR) was reduced from 333 to 290 s (P = 0.019), whereas arousal time (RORR) was prolonged from 498 to 661 s (P = 0.007). Conversely, inhibition of VTA GABAergic neurons led to opposite effects. In contrast, optical activation of VTA–LH GABAergic projection neurons increased power of slow delta waves from 44.2 to 48.8% (P = 0.014) and decreased that of gamma oscillations from 10.2 to 8.0%. BSR was increased from 39.9 to 60.2% (P = 0.0002). LORR was reduced from 330 to 232 s (P = 0.002), and RORR increased from 396 to 565 s (P = 0.007). Optical inhibition of the projection neurons caused opposite effects in terms of both the EEG spectrum and the BSR, except that inhibition of this projection did not accelerate arousal time. These results indicate that VTA GABAergic neurons could facilitate the anesthetic effects of isoflurane during induction and maintenance while postponing anesthetic recovery, at least partially, through modulation of their projections to the LH.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: GABA-Glycine Cotransmitting Neurons in the Ventrolateral Medulla: Development and Functional Relevance for Breathing</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00517</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Inhibitory neurons crucially contribute to shaping the breathing rhythm in the brain stem. These neurons use GABA or glycine as neurotransmitter; or co-release GABA and glycine. However, the developmental relationship between GABAergic, glycinergic and cotransmitting neurons, and the functional relevance of cotransmitting neurons has remained enigmatic. Transgenic mice expressing fluorescent markers or the split-Cre system in inhibitory neurons were developed to track the three different interneuron phenotypes. During late embryonic development, the majority of inhibitory neurons in the ventrolateral medulla are cotransmitting cells, most of which differentiate into GABAergic and glycinergic neurons around birth and around postnatal day 4, respectively. Functional inactivation of cotransmitting neurons revealed an increase of the number of respiratory pauses, the cycle-by-cycle variability, and the overall variability of breathing. In summary, the majority of cotransmitting neurons differentiate into GABAergic or glycinergic neurons within the first 2 weeks after birth and these neurons contribute to fine-tuning of the breathing pattern.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00514</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mounting evidence suggests that neuroinflammation is not just a consequence but a vital contributor to the development and progression of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Microglia in particular, may contribute to the induction and modulation of inflammation in PD. Upon stimulation, microglia convert into activated phenotypes, which exist along a dynamic continuum and bear different immune properties depending on the disease stage and severity. Activated microglia release various factors involved in neuroinflammation, such as cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (RNS), and prostaglandins (PGs). Further, activated microglia interact with other cell types (e.g., neurons, astrocytes and mast cells) and are closely associated with α-synuclein (α-syn) pathophysiology and iron homeostasis disturbance. Taken together, microglial activation and microglia-mediated inflammatory responses play essential roles in the pathogenesis of PD and elucidation of the complexity and imbalance of microglial activation may shed light on novel therapeutic approaches for PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Intra- and Extracellular Pillars of a Unifying Framework for Homeostatic Plasticity: A Crosstalk Between Metabotropic Receptors and Extracellular Matrix</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00513</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the face of chronic changes in incoming sensory inputs, neuronal networks are capable of maintaining stable conditions of electrical activity over prolonged periods of time by adjusting synaptic strength, to amplify or dampen incoming inputs [homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP)], or by altering the intrinsic excitability of individual neurons [homeostatic intrinsic plasticity (HIP)]. Emerging evidence suggests a synergistic interplay between extracellular matrix (ECM) and metabotropic receptors in both forms of homeostatic plasticity. Activation of dopaminergic, serotonergic, or glutamate metabotropic receptors stimulates intracellular signaling through calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and inositol trisphosphate receptors, and induces changes in expression of ECM molecules and proteolysis of both ECM molecules (lecticans) and ECM receptors (NPR, CD44). The resulting remodeling of perisynaptic and synaptic ECM provides permissive conditions for HSP and plays an instructive role by recruiting additional signaling cascades, such as those through metabotropic glutamate receptors and integrins. The superimposition of all these signaling events determines intracellular and diffusional trafficking of ionotropic glutamate receptors, resulting in HSP and modulation of conditions for inducing Hebbian synaptic plasticity (i.e., metaplasticity). It also controls cell-surface delivery and activity of voltage- and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-gated ion channels, resulting in HIP. These mechanisms may modify epileptogenesis and become a target for therapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Brainstem-Evoked Transcription of Defensive Genes After Spinal Cord Injury</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00510</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The spinal cord after injury shows altered transcription in numerous genes. We tested in a pilot study whether the nucleus raphé magnus, a descending serotonergic brainstem region whose stimulation improves recovery after incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI), can influence these transcriptional changes. Rats received 2 h of low-frequency electrical stimulation in the raphé magnus 3 days after an impact contusion at segment T8. Comparison groups lacked injuries or activated stimulators or both. Immediately following stimulation, spinal cords were extracted, their RNA transcriptome sequenced, and differential gene expression quantified. Confirming many previous studies, injury primarily increased inflammatory and immune transcripts and decreased those related to lipid and cholesterol synthesis and neuronal signaling. Stimulation plus injury, contrasted with injury alone, caused significant changes in 43 transcripts (39 increases, 4 decreases), all protein-coding. Injury itself decreased only four of these 43 transcripts, all reversed by stimulation, and increased none of them. The non-specific 5-HT7 receptor antagonist pimozide reversed 25 of the 43 changes. Stimulation in intact rats principally caused decreases in transcripts related to oxidative phosphorylation, none of which were altered by stimulation in injury. Gene ontology (biological process) annotations comparing stimulation with either no stimulation or pimozide treatment in injured rats highlighted defense responses to lipopolysaccharides and microorganisms, and also erythrocyte development and oxygen transport (possibly yielding cellular oxidant detoxification). Connectivity maps of human orthologous genes generated in the CLUE database of perturbagen-response transcriptional signatures showed that drug classes whose effects in injured rats most closely resembled stimulation without pimozide include peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists and angiotensin receptor blockers, which are reportedly beneficial in SCI. Thus the initial transcriptional response of the injured spinal cord to raphé magnus stimulation is upregulation of genes that in various ways are mostly protective, some probably located in recently arrived myeloid cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;T helper 17 (Th17) cells represent a distinct population of immune cells, important in the defense of the organism against extracellular infectious agents. Because of their cytokine profile and ability to recruit other immune cell types, they are highly pro-inflammatory and are involved in the induction of several autoimmune disorders. Recent studies show that Th17 cells and their signature cytokine IL-17 have also a role in a wide variety of neurological diseases. This review article will briefly summarize the evidence linking Th17 cells to brain diseases associated with cognitive impairment, including multiple sclerosis (MS), ischemic brain injury and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We will also investigate the mechanisms by which these cells enter the brain and induce brain damage, including direct effects of IL-17 on brain cells and indirect effects mediated through disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), neurovascular dysfunction and gut-brain axis. Finally, therapeutic prospects targeting Th17 cells and IL-17 will be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00092</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hibernating mammals undergo torpor periods characterized by a general decrease in body temperature, metabolic rate, and brain activity accompanied by complex adaptive brain changes that appear to protect the brain from extreme conditions of hypoxia and low temperatures. These processes are accompanied by morphological and neurochemical changes in the brain including those in cortical neurons such as the fragmentation and reduction of the Golgi apparatus (GA), which both reverse a few hours after arousal from the torpor state. In the present study, we characterized – by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy – the GA of cortical astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglial cells in the Syrian hamster, which is a facultative hibernator. We also show that after artificial induction of hibernation, in addition to neurons, the GA of glia in the Syrian hamster undergoes important structural changes, as well as modifications in the intensity of immunostaining and distribution patterns of Golgi structural proteins at different stages of the hibernation cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Melatonin and Rapamycin Attenuate Isoflurane-Induced Cognitive Impairment Through Inhibition of Neuroinflammation by Suppressing the mTOR Signaling in the Hippocampus of Aged Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00314</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Melatonin exerts neuroprotective effects on isoflurane-induced cognitive impairment. However, the underlying mechanism has yet to be elucidated. The present study sought to determine if melatonin confers its beneficial effects by acting on mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and attenuates the neuroinflammation in the hippocampus of aged mice. A total of 72 male C57BL/6 mice, 16-month-old, were randomly and equally divided into six groups: (1) the control group (CON); (2) the rapamycin group (RAP); (3) the melatonin group (MEL); (4) the isoflurane group (ISO); (5) the rapamycin + isoflurane group (RAP + ISO); and (6) the melatonin + isoflurane group (MEL + ISO). RAP, RAP + ISO, MEL, MEL + ISO groups received 1 mg/kg/day mTOR inhibitor rapamycin solution or 10 mg/kg/day melatonin solution, respectively, intraperitoneally at 5:00 p.m. for 14 days consecutively. Mice in the CON and ISO groups were administered an equivalent volume of saline. Subsequently, ISO, RAP + ISO, and MEL + ISO groups were exposed to inhale 2% isoflurane for 4 h; the CON, RAP, and MEL mice received only the vehicle gas. Then, the memory function and spatial learning of the mice were examined via the Morris water maze (MWM) test. mTOR expression was detected via Western blot, whereas the concentration of inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and that of melatonin was quantified with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Melatonin and rapamycin significantly ameliorated the isoflurane-induced cognitive impairment and also led to a decrease in the melatonin levels as well as the expression levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and p-mTOR in the hippocampus. In conclusion, these results showed that melatonin and rapamycin attenuates mTOR expression while affecting the downstream proinflammatory cytokines. Thus, these molecular findings could be associated with an improved cognitive function in mice exposed to isoflurane.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Age-associated macular degeneration (AMD), which leads to loss of vision at its end stage, is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases among the elderly. However, to date, no effective drug therapy is available for the prevention of AMD. Here, we report the occurrence of AMD pathology and its prevention by chronic treatment with the neurotrophic peptidergic compound P021, in aged rats and 3xTg-AD mice. We found photoreceptor degeneration, lipofuscin granules, vacuoles, and atrophy in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) as well as Bruch’s membrane (BM) thickening; in aged rats, we even found rosette-like structure formation. Microgliosis and astrogliosis were observed in different retinal layers. In addition, we also found that total tau, phosphorylated tau, Aβ/APP, and VEGF were widely distributed in the sub-retina of aged rats and 3xTg mice. Importantly, chronic treatment with P021 for 3 months in rats and for 18 months in 3xTg mice ameliorated the pathological changes above. These findings indicate the therapeutic potential of P021 for prevention and treatment of AMD and retinal changes associated with aging and Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A tumour grows when the total division (birth) rate of its cells exceeds their total mortality (death) rate. The capability for uncontrolled growth within the host tissue is acquired via the accumulation of driver mutations which enable the tumour to progress through various hallmarks of cancer. We present a mathematical model of the penultimate stage in such a progression. We assume the tumour has reached the limit of its present growth potential due to cell competition that either results in total birth rate reduction or death rate increase. The tumour can then progress to the final stage by either seeding a metastasis or acquiring a driver mutation. We influence the ensuing evolutionary dynamics by cytotoxic (increasing death rate) or cytostatic (decreasing birth rate) therapy while keeping the effect of the therapy on net growth reduction constant. Comparing the treatments head to head we derive conditions for choosing optimal therapy. We quantify how the choice and the related gain of optimal therapy depends on driver mutation, metastasis, intrinsic cell birth and death rates, and the details of cell competition. We show that detailed understanding of the cell population dynamics could be exploited in choosing the right mode of treatment with substantial therapy gains.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9H-wsRJ20XM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Macrophages respond to signals in the microenvironment by changing their functional phenotypes, a process known as polarization. Depending on the context, they acquire different patterns of transcriptional activation, cytokine expression and cellular metabolism which collectively constitute a continuous spectrum of phenotypes, of which the two extremes are denoted as classical (M1) and alternative (M2) activation. To quantitatively decode the underlying principles governing macrophage phenotypic polarization and thereby harness its therapeutic potential in human diseases, a systems-level approach is needed given the multitude of signaling pathways and intracellular regulation involved. Here we develop the first mechanism-based, multi-pathway computational model that describes the integrated signal transduction and macrophage programming under M1 (IFN-γ), M2 (IL-4) and cell stress (hypoxia) stimulation. Our model was calibrated extensively against experimental data, and we mechanistically elucidated several signature feedbacks behind the M1-M2 antagonism and investigated the dynamical shaping of macrophage phenotypes within the M1-M2 spectrum. Model sensitivity analysis also revealed key molecular nodes and interactions as targets with potential therapeutic values for the pathophysiology of peripheral arterial disease and cancer. Through simulations that dynamically capture the signal integration and phenotypic marker expression in the differential macrophage polarization responses, our model provides an important computational basis toward a more quantitative and network-centric understanding of the complex physiology and versatile functions of macrophages in human diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gN44bEd0UOA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: MicroRNA-137 drives epigenetic reprogramming in the adult amygdala and behavioral changes after adolescent alcohol exposure</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0401-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Adolescent binge drinking is a serious public health concern and a risk factor for alcohol use disorder (AUD) and comorbid anxiety in adulthood. Chromatin remodeling mediated by epigenetic enzymes including lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) due to adolescent alcohol exposure may play a role in adult psychopathology. The mechanism by which adolescent alcohol exposure mechanistically regulates epigenetic reprogramming and behavioral changes in adulthood is unknown. We investigated the role of microRNA-137 (miR-137), which is crucial for normal neurodevelopment and targets LSD1, in adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure-induced anxiety-like and alcohol-drinking behaviors and related epigenetic reprogramming in the amygdala in adulthood. Adolescent rats were exposed to 2g/kg ethanol (2 days on/off; AIE) or intermittent n-saline (AIS) during postnatal days (PND) 28-41 and allowed to grow to adulthood for analysis of behavior, miRNA expression, and epigenetic measures in the amygdala. Interestingly, miR-137 was increased and its target genes &lt;i&gt;Lsd1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Lsd1 + 8a&lt;/i&gt; were decreased in the AIE adult amygdala. Infusion of miR-137 antagomir directly into the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) rescues AIE-induced alcohol drinking and anxiety-like behaviors via normalization of decreased &lt;i&gt;Lsd1&lt;/i&gt; expression, decreased LSD1 occupancy, and decreased &lt;i&gt;Bdnf IV&lt;/i&gt; expression due to increased H3K9 dimethylation in AIE adult rats. Further, concomitant &lt;i&gt;Lsd1&lt;/i&gt; siRNA infusion into the CeA prevents the miR-137-mediated reversal of AIE-induced adult anxiety and chromatin remodeling at the &lt;i&gt;Bdnf IV&lt;/i&gt; promoter. These novel results highlight miR-137 as a potential therapeutic target for anxiety and AUD susceptibility after adolescent alcohol exposure in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Adolescent alcohol exposure is a serious public health problem and contributes to alcohol use and anxiety disorders later in life. In this study, we identify microRNA-137, a small non-coding RNA, in the central nucleus of amygdala (CeA) as a crucial regulator of increased alcohol consumption and anxiety-like behavior in adult rats after adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure. Inhibition of microRNA-137 in the CeA reverses increased alcohol intake and anxiety-like behavior, and this effect is mediated by lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), a microRNA-137 target gene that regulates epigenetic programming. Thus, we have identified microRNA-137 and its target LSD1, in the CeA that play a mechanistic role in the pathogenesis of increased adult anxiety and alcohol consumption after adolescent alcohol exposure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Organisms must ensure that expression of genes is directed to the appropriate tissues at the correct times, while simultaneously ensuring that these gene regulatory systems are robust to perturbation. This idea is captured by a mathematical concept called &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;-robustness, which says that a system is robust to a perturbation in up to &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; − 1 randomly chosen parameters. &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;-robustness implies that the biological system has a small number of sensitive parameters and that this number can be used as a robustness measure. In this work we use this idea to investigate the robustness of gene regulation using a sequence level model of the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; gene &lt;i&gt;even-skipped&lt;/i&gt;. We consider robustness with respect to mutations of the enhancer sequence and with respect to changes of the transcription factor concentrations. We find that gene regulation is &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;-robust with respect to mutations in the enhancer sequence and identify a number of sensitive nucleotides. In both natural and &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; predicted enhancers, the number of nucleotides that are sensitive to mutation correlates negatively with the length of the sequence, meaning that longer sequences are more robust. The exact degree of robustness obtained is dependent not only on DNA sequence, but also on the local concentration of regulatory factors. We find that gene regulation can be remarkably sensitive to changes in transcription factor concentrations at the boundaries of expression features, while it is robust to perturbation elsewhere.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9RePbJHqLrI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Predicting future brain signal is highly sought-after, yet difficult to achieve. To predict the future phase of cortical activity at localized ECoG and MEG recording sites, we exploit its predominant, large-scale, spatiotemporal dynamics. The dynamics are extracted from the brain signal through Fourier analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) only, and cast in a data model that predicts future signal at each site and frequency of interest. The dominant eigenvectors of the PCA that map the large-scale patterns of past cortical phase to future ones take the form of smoothly propagating waves over the entire measurement array. In ECoG data from 3 subjects and MEG data from 20 subjects collected during a self-initiated motor task, mean phase prediction errors were as low as 0.5 radians at local sites, surpassing state-of-the-art methods of within-time-series or event-related models. Prediction accuracy was highest in delta to beta bands, depending on the subject, was more accurate during episodes of high global power, but was not strongly dependent on the time-course of the task. Prediction results did not require past data from the to-be-predicted site. Rather, best accuracy depended on the availability in the model of long wavelength information. The utility of large-scale, low spatial frequency traveling waves in predicting future phase activity at local sites allows estimation of the error introduced by failing to account for irreducible trajectories in the activity dynamics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oV-YJVFdqpw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Differential Effect on Hippocampal Synaptic Facilitation by the Presynaptic Protein Mover</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2019.00030</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurotransmitter release relies on an evolutionarily conserved presynaptic machinery. Nonetheless, some proteins occur in certain species and synapses, and are absent in others, indicating that they may have modulatory roles. How such proteins expand the power or versatility of the core release machinery is unclear. The presynaptic protein Mover/TPRGL/SVAP30 is heterogeneously expressed among synapses of the rodent brain, suggesting that it may add special functions to subtypes of presynaptic terminals. Mover is a synaptic vesicle-attached phosphoprotein that binds to Calmodulin and the active zone scaffolding protein Bassoon. Here we use a Mover knockout mouse line to investigate the role of Mover in the hippocampal mossy fiber (MF) to CA3 pyramidal cell synapse and Schaffer collateral to CA1. While Schaffer collateral synapses were unchanged by the knockout, the MFs showed strongly increased facilitation. The effect of Mover knockout in facilitation was both calcium- and age-dependent, having a stronger effect at higher calcium concentrations and in younger animals. Increasing cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels by forskolin equally potentiated both wildtype and knockout MF synapses, but occluded the increased facilitation observed in the knockout. These discoveries suggest that Mover has distinct roles at different synapses. At MF terminals, it acts to constrain the extent of presynaptic facilitation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00276</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this study, we performed a comprehensive behavioral and anatomical analysis of the Missing in Metastasis (Mtss1/MIM) knockout (KO) mouse brain. We also analyzed the expression of MIM in different brain regions at different ages. MIM is an I-BAR containing membrane curving protein, shown to be involved in dendritic spine initiation and dendritic branching in Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Behavioral analysis of MIM KO mice revealed defects in both learning and reverse-learning, alterations in anxiety levels and reduced dominant behavior, and confirmed the previously described deficiency in motor coordination and pre-pulse inhibition. Anatomically, we observed enlarged brain ventricles and decreased cortical volume. Although MIM expression was relatively low in hippocampus after early development, hippocampal pyramidal neurons exhibited reduced density of thin and stubby dendritic spines. Learning deficiencies can be connected to all detected anatomical changes. Both behavioral and anatomical findings are typical for schizophrenia mouse models.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: DYRK1A Overexpression Alters Cognition and Neural-Related Proteomic Pathways in the Hippocampus That Are Rescued by Green Tea Extract and/or Environmental Enrichment</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00272</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Down syndrome (DS), caused by trisomy of chromosome 21, is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability. We recently discovered that green tea extracts containing epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) improve cognition in mice transgenic for Dyrk1a (TgDyrk1A) and in a trisomic DS mouse model (Ts65Dn). Interestingly, paired with cognitive stimulation, green tea has beneficial pro-cognitive effects in DS individuals. Dual Specificity Tyrosine-Phosphorylation-Regulated Kinase 1A (DYRK1A) is a major candidate to explain the cognitive phenotypes of DS, and inhibiting its activity is a promising pro-cognitive therapy. DYRK1A kinase activity can be normalized in the hippocampus of transgenic DYRK1A mice administering green tea extracts, but also submitting the animals to environmental enrichment (EE). However, many other mechanisms could also explain the pro-cognitive effects of green tea extracts and EE. To underpin the overall alterations arising upon DYRK1A overexpression and the molecular processes underneath the pro-cognitive effects, we used quantitative proteomics. We investigated the hippocampal (phospho)proteome in basal conditions and after treatment with a green tea extract containing EGCG and/or EE in TgDyrk1A and control mice. We found that Dyrk1A overexpression alters protein and phosphoprotein levels of key postsynaptic and plasticity-related pathways and that these alterations were rescued upon the cognitive enhancer treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Investigations Into Bioenergetic Neuroprotection of Cone Photoreceptors: Relevance to Retinitis Pigmentosa</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01234</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent studies suggest cone degeneration in retinitis pigmentosa (RP) may result from intracellular energy depletion. We tested the hypothesis that cones die when depleted of energy by examining the effect of two bioenergetic, nutraceutical agents on cone survival. The study had three specific aims: firstly, we, studied the neuroprotective efficacies of glucose and creatine in an in vitro model of RP. Next, we utilized a well-characterized mouse model of RP to examine whether surviving cones, devoid of their inner segments, continue to express genes vital for glucose, and creatine utilization. Finally, we analyzed the neuroprotective properties of glucose and creatine on cone photoreceptors in a mouse model of RP. Two different bioenergy-based therapies were tested in rd1 mice: repeated local delivery of glucose and systemic creatine. Optomotor responses were tested and cone density was quantified on retinal wholemounts. The results showed that glucose supplementation increased survival of cones in culture subjected to mitochondrial stress or oxidative insult. Despite losing their inner segments, surviving cones in the rd1 retina continued to express the various glycolytic enzymes. Following a single subconjunctival injection, the mean vitreous glucose concentration was significantly elevated at 1 and 8 h, but not at 16 h after injection; however, daily subconjunctival injection of glucose neither enhanced spatial visual performance nor slowed cone cell degeneration in rd1 mice relative to isotonic saline. Creatine dose-dependently increased survival of cones in culture subjected to mitochondrial dysfunction, but not to oxidative stress. Despite the loss of their mitochondrial-rich inner segments, cone somas and axonal terminals in the rd1 retina were strongly positive for both the mitochondrial and cytosolic forms of creatine kinase at each time point examined. Creatine-fed rd1 mice displayed enhanced optomotor responses compared to mice fed normal chow. Moreover, cone density was significantly greater in creatine-treated mice compared to controls. The overall results of this study provide tentative support for the hypothesis that creatine supplementation may delay secondary degeneration of cones in individuals with RP.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background and Purpose&lt;p&gt;Amyloid imaging, gray matter (GM) morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have all been used as predictive biomarkers in dementia. Our objective was to define the imaging profile of healthy elderly controls as a function of their cognitive trajectories and explore whether amyloid burden and white matter (WM) microstructure changes are associated with subtle decrement of neuropsychological performances in old age.&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;We performed a 4.5-year longitudinal study in 133 elderly individuals who underwent cognitive testing at inclusion and follow-up, amyloid PET, MRI including DTI sequences at inclusion, and APOE epsilon 4 genotyping. All cases were assessed using a continuous cognitive score (CCS) taking into account the global evolution of neuropsychological performances. Data processing included region of interest analysis of amyloid PET analysis, GM densities and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS)-DTI. Regression models were built to explore the association between the CCS and imaging parameters controlling for significant demographic and clinical covariates.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Amyloid uptake was not related to the cognitive outcome. In contrast, GM densities in bilateral hippocampus were associated with worst CCS at follow-up. In addition, radial and axial diffusivities in left hippocampus were negatively associated with CCS. Amyloid load was associated with decreased VBM and increased radial and axial diffusivity in the same area. These associations persisted when adjusting for gender and APOE4 genotype. Importantly, they were absent in amygdala and neocortical areas studied.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The progressive decrement of neuropsychological performances in normal aging is associated with volume loss and WM microstructure changes in hippocampus long before the emergence of clinically overt symptoms. Higher amyloid load in hippocampus is compatible with cognitive preservation in cases with better preservation of GM densities and WM microstructure in this area.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01213</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has previously been reported to improve facets of upper limb motor performance such as accuracy and strength. However, the magnitude of motor performance improvement has not been reviewed by contemporaneous systematic review or meta-analysis of sham vs. active tDCS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: To systematically review and meta-analyse the existing evidence regarding the benefits of tDCS on upper limb motor performance in healthy adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A systematic search was conducted to obtain relevant articles from three databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO) yielding 3,200 abstracts. Following independent assessment by two reviewers, a total of 86 articles were included for review, of which 37 were deemed suitable for meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Meta-analyses were performed for four outcome measures, namely: reaction time (RT), execution time (ET), time to task failure (TTF), and force. Further qualitative review was performed for accuracy and error. Statistically significant improvements in RT (effect size −0.01; 95% CI −0.02 to 0.001, p = 0.03) and ET (effect size −0.03; 95% CI −0.05 to −0.01, p = 0.017) were demonstrated compared to sham. In exercise tasks, increased force (effect size 0.10; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.13, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and a trend towards improved TTF was also observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: This meta-analysis provides evidence attesting to the impact of tDCS on upper limb motor performance in healthy adults. Improved performance is demonstrable in reaction time, task completion time, elbow flexion tasks and accuracy. Considerable heterogeneity exists amongst the literature, further confirming the need for a standardised approach to reporting tDCS studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have achieved great success for image classification in medical research. Deep learning with brain imaging is the imaging method of choice for the diagnosis and prediction of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, it is also well known that DCNNs are “black boxes” owing to their low interpretability to humans. The lack of transparency of deep learning compromises its application to the prediction and mechanism investigation in AD. To overcome this limitation, we develop a novel general framework that integrates deep leaning, feature selection, causal inference, and genetic-imaging data analysis for predicting and understanding AD. The proposed algorithm not only improves the prediction accuracy but also identifies the brain regions underlying the development of AD and causal paths from genetic variants to AD via image mediation. The proposed algorithm is applied to the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 151 subjects (51 AD and 100 non-AD) who were measured at four time points of baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months. The algorithm identified brain regions underlying AD consisting of the temporal lobes (including the hippocampus) and the ventricular system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we evaluate the computational performance of the GEneral NEural SImulation System (GENESIS) for large scale simulations of neural networks. While many benchmark studies have been performed for large scale simulations with leaky integrate-and-fire neurons or neuronal models with only a few compartments, this work focuses on higher fidelity neuronal models represented by 50–74 compartments per neuron. After making some modifications to the source code for GENESIS and its parallel implementation, PGENESIS, particularly to improve memory usage, we find that PGENESIS is able to efficiently scale on supercomputing resources to network sizes as large as 9 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; neurons with 18 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; synapses and 2.2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; neurons with 45 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; synapses.

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00409</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Our perception of the world is governed by a combination of bottom-up sensory and top-down cognitive processes. This often begs the question whether a perceptual phenomenon originates from sensory or cognitive processes in the brain. For instance, reference repulsion, a compelling visual illusion in which the subjective estimates about the direction of a motion stimulus are biased away from a reference boundary, is previously thought to be originated at the sensory level. Recent studies, however, suggest that the misperception is not sensory in nature but rather reflects post-perceptual cognitive biases. Here I challenge the post-perceptual interpretations on both empirical and conceptual grounds. I argue that these new findings are not incompatible with the sensory account and can be more parsimoniously explained as reflecting the consequences of motion representations in different reference frames. Finally, I will propose one concrete experiment with testable predictions to shed more insights on the sensory vs. cognitive nature of this visual illusion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00405</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Adaptive training and workload management have the potential to drastically change safety and productivity in high-risk fields—including, air-traffic control, missile defense, and nuclear power-plant operations. Quantifying and classifying cognitive load is important for optimal performance. Brain-based metrics have previously been associated with mental workload. Specifically, attenuation of prefrontal activity has been linked to cognitive overload, a cognitive load state associated with degraded task performance. We hypothesized that a similar nonlinearity would be observed for cognitive underload. When underload and overload effects are combined, they should form a cubic function in lateral prefrontal cortex as a function of working memory load. The first of two studies assessed the relationships between spatial working memory load with subjective, behavioral and hemodynamic measures. A cubic function was observed in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (LDLPFC; Brodmann’s Area 46) relating working memory load to changes in oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO). The second, two-part study tested the effects of workload transitions to different cognitive load states. Part-one replicated the effects observed in study one and identified transition points for individual performers. Part-two assessed the effects of transitioning to different cognitive load states. Cognitive load state transitions caused a deviation between behavioral measures and induced a significant change in the cubic function relating LDLPFC HbO and working memory load. From these observations, we present a hypothesis associating workload transitions with the disruption of cognitive process integration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Brain Connectivity Based Prediction of Alzheimer’s Disease in Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment Based on Multi-Modal Images</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00399</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Structural and metabolic connectivity are advanced features that facilitate the diagnosis of patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Connectivity from a single imaging modality, however, did not show evident discriminative value in predicting MCI-to-AD conversion, possibly because the inter-modal information was not considered when quantifying the relationship between brain regions. Here we introduce a novel approach that extracts connectivity based on both structural and metabolic information to improve AD early diagnosis. Principal component analysis was performed on each imaging modality to extract the key discriminative patterns of each brain region in an independent auxiliary domain composed of AD and normal control (NC) subjects, which were then used to project the two subtypes of MCI to the low-dimensional space. The connectivity between each target brain region and all other regions was quantified via a multi-task regression model using the projected data. The prediction performance was evaluated in 75 stable MCI (sMCI) patients and 51 progressive MCI (pMCI) patients who converted to AD within 3 years. We achieved 79.37% accuracy, with 74.51% sensitivity and 82.67% specificity, in predicting MCI-to-AD progression, superior to other existing algorithms using either structural and metabolic connectivities alone or a combination thereof. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-modal connectivity, serving as robust biomarker for early AD diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Differential Striatal Axonal Arborizations of the Intratelencephalic and Pyramidal-Tract Neurons: Analysis of the Data in the MouseLight Database</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00071</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There exist two major types of striatum-targeting neocortical neurons, specifically, intratelencephalic (IT) neurons and pyramidal-tract (PT) neurons. Regarding their striatal projections, it was once suggested that IT axons are extended whereas PT axons are primarily focal. However, subsequent study with an increased number of well-stained extended axons concluded that such an apparent distinction was spurious due to limited sample size. Recent work using genetically labeled neurons reintroduced the differential spatial extent of the striatal projections of IT and PT neurons through population-level analyses, complemented by observations of single axons. However, quantitative IT vs. PT comparison of a large number of axons remained to be conducted. We analyzed the data of axonal end-points of 161 IT neurons and 33 PT neurons in the MouseLight database (http://ml-neuronbrowser.janelia.org/). The number of axonal end-points in the ipsilateral striatum exhibits roughly monotonically decreasing distributions in both neuron types. Excluding neurons with no ipsilateral end-point, the distributions of the logarithm of the number of ipsilateral end-points are considerably overlapped between IT and PT neurons, although the proportion of neurons having more than 50 ipsilateral end-points is somewhat larger in IT neurons than in PT neurons. Looking at more details, among IT subpopulations in the secondary motor area (MOs), layer 5 neurons and bilateral striatum-targeting layer 2/3 neurons, but not contralateral striatum-non-targeting layer 2/3 neurons, have a larger number of ipsilateral end-points than MOs PT neurons. We also found that IT ipsilateral striatal axonal end-points are on average more widely distributed than PT end-points, especially in the medial-lateral direction. These results indicate that IT and PT striatal axons differ in the frequencies and spatial extent of end-points while there are wide varieties within each neuron type.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00515</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterized by recurrent and unprovoked seizures thought to arise from impaired balance between neuronal excitation and inhibition. Our understanding of the neurophysiological mechanisms that render the brain epileptogenic remains incomplete, reflected by the lack of satisfactory treatments that can effectively prevent epileptic seizures without significant drug-related adverse effects. Type 2 K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; cotransporter (KCC2), encoded by SLC12A5, is important for chloride homeostasis and neuronal excitability. KCC2 dysfunction attenuates Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; extrusion and impairs GABAergic inhibition, and can lead to neuronal hyperexcitability. Converging lines of evidence from human genetics have secured the link between KCC2 dysfunction and the development of epilepsy. Here, we review KCC2 mutations in human epilepsy and discuss potential therapeutic strategies based on the functional impact of these mutations. We suggest that a strategy of augmenting KCC2 activity by antagonizing its critical inhibitory phosphorylation sites may be a particularly efficacious method of facilitating Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; extrusion and restoring GABA inhibition to treat medication-refractory epilepsy and other seizure disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00318</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ability to control balance during activities of daily living (ADL) is impaired in older adults as a result of deterioration in the sensory systems (i.e., vestibular, visual, somatosensory), the cognitive system (central nervous system), and the musculoskeletal system. Consequently, many older adults face a risk of falling during their ADL. In most cases, falls and related injuries impair the quality of life and result in physical limitations, anxiety, loss of confidence, and fear of falling. Among a variety of fall prevention interventions, adapted physical activity programs have been suggested for improving balance control during ADL. These programs challenge the sensory, cognitive, and musculoskeletal systems while addressing balance constraints such as orientation in space, changes in direction, and the speed or height of the center of mass during static and dynamic situations resembling ADL. The above-mentioned elements can be dealt with through a combination of balance and coordination exercises that challenge the postural control systems in multiple dimensions—including vertical and horizontal changes of the center of mass, standing on unstable surfaces with a reduced base of support, and changing body directions. Consequently, such exercises require environmental information-processing. The combination of dual-task, function-oriented challenges while controlling balance stimulates the sensory and neuromuscular control mechanisms. Among older adults, these programs have been found to improve static and dynamic stability, as well as a number of aspects in the quality of life. Recently, they have also been found to improve cognitive functions such as memory and spatial cognition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. It’s a chronic and untreatable neurodegenerative disease with irreversible progression and has important social and economic implications in terms of direct medical and social care costs. Despite prolonged and expensive efforts employed by the scientific community over the last few decades, no effective treatments are still available for patients, and the development of disease-modifying drugs is now a really urgent need. The recent failure of clinical trials based on the immunotherapeutic approach against amyloid-β(Aβ) protein questioned the validity of the “amyloid cascade hypothesis” as the molecular machinery causing the disease. Indeed, most attempts to design effective treatments for AD have been based until now on molecular targets suggested to be implicated in AD pathogenesis by the amyloid cascade hypothesis. However, mounting evidence from scientific literature supports the view of AD as a multifactorial disease that results from the concomitant action of multiple molecular players. This view, together with the lack of success of the disease-modifying single-target approaches, strongly suggests that AD drug design needs to be shifted towards multi-targeted compounds or drug combinations acting synergistically on the main core features of disease pathogenesis. The discovery of drug candidates targeting multiple factors involved in AD would greatly improve drug development. So, it is reasonable that upcoming strategies for the design of preventive and/or therapeutic agents for AD point to a multi-pronged approach including more than one druggable target to definitely defeat the disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00316</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in Parkinson’s disease (PD) is related to inflammation and oxidative stress. Anti-inflammatory agents could reduce the risk or slow the progression of PD. Catalpol, an iridoid glycoside extracted from the roots of Rehmannia radix, has been reported to reduce the release of inflammatory factors and exert neuroprotective effects. 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated mice were used as the PD model and the roles of catalpol on DA neurons and its potential mechanism were investigated in this study. We found that catalpol administration mitigated the loss of DA neurons induced by MPTP and increased exploratory behavior along with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression, which was accompanied by astrocyte and microglia activation. Importantly, catalpol administration significantly inhibited MPTP-triggered oxidative stress, restored growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels. Further, we found that catalpol suppressed the activation of MKK4/JNK/c-Jun signaling, and reduced the pro-inflammatory factors and inflammasome in the mouse model of PD. Our results suggest that catalpol relieves MPTP-triggered oxidative stress, which may benefit to avoid the occurrence of chronic inflammatory reaction. Catalpol alleviates MPTP-triggered oxidative stress and thereby prevents neurodegenerative diseases-related inflammatory reaction, highlighting its therapeutic potential for the management of PD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00315</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Research indicates that after advanced age, the major risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is female sex. Out of every three AD patients, two are females with postmenopausal women contributing to over 60% of all those affected. Sex- and gender-related differences in AD have been widely researched and several emerging lines of evidence point to different vulnerabilities that contribute to dementia risk. Among those being considered, it is becoming widely accepted that gonadal steroids contribute to the gender disparity in AD, as evidenced by the “estrogen hypothesis.” This posits that sex hormones, 17β-estradiol in particular, exert a neuroprotective effect by shielding females’ brains from disease development. This theory is further supported by recent findings that the onset of menopause is associated with the emergence of AD-related brain changes in women in contrast to men of the same age. In this review, we discuss genetic, medical, societal, and lifestyle risk factors known to increase AD risk differently between the genders, with a focus on the role of hormonal changes, particularly declines in 17β-estradiol during the menopause transition (MT) as key underlying mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Although lipopolysaccharides (LPS) have been used to establish animal models of memory loss akin to what is observed in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the exact mechanisms involved have not been substantiated. In this study, we established an animal model of learning and memory impairment induced by LPS and explored the biological processes and pathways involved. Mice were continuously intraperitoneally injected with LPS for 7 days. Learning- and memory-related behavioral performance and the pathological processes involved were assessed using the Morris water maze test and immunostaining, respectively. We detected comprehensive expression of C1q, C3, microglia, and their regulatory cytokines in the hippocampus. After 7 days of LPS administration, we were able to observe LPS-induced learning and memory impairment in the mice, which was attributed to neural impairment and synapse loss in the hippocampus. We elucidated that the immune system was activated, with the classical complement pathway and microglial phagocytosis being involved in the synapse loss. This study demonstrates that an LPS-injected mouse can serve as an early memory impairment model for studies on anti-AD drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

In many sensory systems the neural signal is coded by the coordinated response of heterogeneous populations of neurons. What computational benefit does this diversity confer on information processing? We derive an efficient coding framework assuming that neurons have evolved to communicate signals optimally given natural stimulus statistics and metabolic constraints. Incorporating nonlinearities and realistic noise, we study optimal population coding of the same sensory variable using two measures: maximizing the mutual information between stimuli and responses, and minimizing the error incurred by the optimal linear decoder of responses. Our theory is applied to a commonly observed splitting of sensory neurons into ON and OFF that signal stimulus increases or decreases, and to populations of monotonically increasing responses of the same type, ON. Depending on the optimality measure, we make different predictions about how to optimally split a population into ON and OFF, and how to allocate the firing thresholds of individual neurons given realistic stimulus distributions and noise, which accord with certain biases observed experimentally.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FDosLGxlm1Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Human decisions can be habitual or goal-directed, also known as model-free (MF) or model-based (MB) control. Previous work suggests that the balance between the two decision systems is impaired in psychiatric disorders such as compulsion and addiction, via overreliance on MF control. However, little is known whether the balance can be altered through task training. Here, 20 healthy participants performed a well-established two-step task that differentiates MB from MF control, across five training sessions. We used computational modelling and functional near-infrared spectroscopy to assess changes in decision-making and brain hemodynamic over time. Mixed-effects modelling revealed overall no substantial changes in MF and MB behavior across training. Although our behavioral and brain findings show task-induced changes in learning rates, these parameters have no direct relation to either MF or MB control or the balance between the two systems, and thus do not support the assumption of training effects on MF or MB strategies. Our findings indicate that training on the two-step paradigm in its current form does not support a shift in the balance between MF and MB control. We discuss these results with respect to implications for restoring the balance between MF and MB control in psychiatric conditions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eKPfhfz7iQA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00069</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The distribution of locomotor-activated neurons in the brainstem of the cat was studied by c-Fos immunohistochemistry in combination with antibody-based cellular phenotyping following electrical stimulation of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) – the anatomical constituents of which remain debated today, primarily between the cuneiform (CnF) and the pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei (PPT). Effective MLR sites were co-extensive with the CnF nucleus. Animals subject to the locomotor task showed abundant Fos labeling in the CnF, parabrachial nuclei of the subcuneiform region, periaqueductal gray, locus ceruleus (LC)/subceruleus (SubC), Kölliker–Fuse, magnocellular and lateral tegmental fields, raphe, and the parapyramidal region. Labeled neurons were more abundant on the side of stimulation. In some animals, Fos-labeled cells were also observed in the ventral tegmental area, medial and intermediate vestibular nuclei, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, n. tractus solitarii, and retrofacial nucleus in the ventrolateral medulla. Many neurons in the reticular formation were innervated by serotonergic fibers. Numerous locomotor-activated neurons in the parabrachial nuclei and LC/SubC/Kölliker–Fuse were noradrenergic. Few cholinergic neurons within the PPT stained for Fos. In the medulla, serotonergic neurons within the parapyramidal region and the nucleus raphe magnus were positive for Fos. Control animals, not subject to locomotion, showed few Fos-labeled neurons in these areas. The current study provides positive evidence for a role for the CnF in the initiation of locomotion while providing little evidence for the participation of the PPT. The results also show that MLR-evoked locomotion involves the parallel activation of reticular and monoaminergic neurons in the pons/medulla, and provides the anatomical and functional basis for spinal monoamine release during evoked locomotion. Lastly, the results indicate that vestibular, cardiovascular, and respiratory centers are centrally activated during MLR-evoked locomotion. Altogether, the results show a complex pattern of neuromodulatory influences of brainstem neurons by electrical activation of the MLR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The brain is a genomic mosaic. Cell-to-cell genomic differences, which are the result of somatic mutations during development and aging, contribute to cellular diversity in the nervous system. This genomic diversity has important implications for nervous system development, function, and disease. Brain somatic mosaicism might contribute to individualized behavioral phenotypes and has been associated with several neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, understanding the causes and consequences of somatic mosaicism in neural circuits is of great interest. Recent advances in 3D cell culture technology have provided new means to study human organ development and various human pathologies in vitro. Cerebral organoids (“mini-brains”) are pluripotent stem cell-derived 3D culture systems that recapitulate, to some extent, the developmental processes and organization of the developing human brain. Here, I discuss the application of these neural organoids for modeling brain somatic mosaicism in a lab dish. Special emphasis is given to the potential role of microglial mutations in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;The objective of this study is to observe the effects of mild mechanical stimulation on acupuncture points of spinal motor neurons and active substances of sciatic nerve injury in rats, and to explore the morphological basis for the recovery of motor function in rats with sciatic nerve injury, using mild acupuncture. Acupuncture in the local area of injury may cause further damage to the peripheral nerve injury. We believe that mild mechanical stimulation on the surface, using some specific acupuncture points can also have a positive effect on nerve repair. This method, called Chinese tuina, has existed for more than 2,000 years in China.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;This study establishes a rat model using sciatic nerve crush injury. Rats received Chinese tuina in accordance with the principle of the three methods and three points, once a day, for 20 days. The rats’ status of hindlimb recovery was detected by a sciatic functional index. The labeled neuronal cell body was used to evaluate the fiber recovery after the rats’ sciatic nerve injury, using a neural tracing technique. Our team studied motor neuronal cell bodies, CGRP-positive cells, and the microglia of damaged sciatic nerves which were stained with fluorescent triple staining, adopting a confocal multi-layer scanning technique, and then the changes in neuronal activity distribution and expression, and changes of time and treatment were described, using the method of morphological description.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Sciatic nerve injury decreased the survival rate of motor neurons, affected CGRP-positive cells, and activated microglia in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. Compared with the model group, the survival of spinal ventral horn motor neurons was increased through tuina intervention. The swelling of CGRP-positive cells was alleviated, and the degree of microglia activation was less than that of the model group.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This study used visual morphological findings to assess changes in neurons and active substances with time after injury of the peripheral nerve, and demonstrated that peripheral mild acupuncture intervention improved the capacity of neurofibrillary axoplasmic transport, regulated microglia activation, and significantly promoted the recovery of sciatic nerve injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

With recent advances in machine learning, data-driven techniques such as deep learning have shown great potential for EEG data decoding for brain-computer interfaces, but have not been explored in the context of exercise. Here, we present a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based pipeline for analysis of EEG data to study the brain areas and spectral EEG measures modulated by exercise. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first one to demonstrate the ability of CNNs to be trained in a limited sample size setting. Our approach revealed discriminative spectral features within a refined frequency band (27–29 Hz) as compared to the wider beta bandwidth (15–30 Hz), which is commonly used in data analyses, as well as corresponding brain regions that were modulated by exercise. These results indicate the presence of finer EEG spectral features that could have been overlooked using conventional hypothesis-driven statistical approaches. Our study thus demonstrates the feasibility of using deep network architectures for neuroimaging analysis, even in small-scale studies, to identify robust brain biomarkers and investigate neuroscience-based questions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01181</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) is emerging as a robust treatment alternative for major depressive disorder, with a potential for achieving higher remission rates by providing targeted stimulation to underlying brain networks, such as the salience network (SN). Growing evidence suggests that these therapeutic effects are dependent on the frequency and phase synchrony between SN oscillations and stimulation as well as the task-specific state of the SN during stimulation. However, the development of phase-synchronized non-invasive stimulation has proved challenging until recently. Here, we use a phase-locked pulsed brain stimulation approach to study the effects of two NIBS methods: transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) versus phase-locked transcranial pulsed current stimulation (tPCS), on the SN during an SN activating task. 20 healthy volunteers participated in the study. Each volunteer partook in four sessions, receiving one stimulation type at random (theta-tACS, peak tPCS, trough tPCS or sham) while undergoing a learning game, followed by an unstimulated test based on learned material. Each session lasted approximately 1.5 h, with an interval of at least 2 days to allow for washout and to avoid cross-over effects. Our results showed no statistically significant effect of stimulation on the event related potential (ERP) recordings, resting electroencephalogram (EEG), and the performance of the volunteers. While stimulation effects were not apparent in this study, the nominal performance of the phase-locking algorithm offers a technical foundation for further research in determining effective stimulation paradigms and conditions. Specifically, future work should investigate stronger stimulation and true task-specific stimulation of SN nodes responsible for the task as well as their recording. If refined, NIBS could offer an effective, homebased treatment option.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Neural Processes of Proactive and Reactive Controls Modulated by Motor-Skill Experiences</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00404</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This study investigated the experience of open and closed motor skills on modulating proactive and reactive control processes in task switching. Fifty-four participants who were open-skilled (n = 18) or closed-skilled athletes (n = 18) or non-athletic adults (n = 18) completed a cued task-switching paradigm task. This task tapped into proactive or reactive controls of executive functions under different validity conditions. Electroencephalograms of the participants were captured during the task. In the 100% validity condition, the open-skilled participants showed significantly lower switch cost of response time than the closed-skilled and control participants. Results showed that the open-skilled participants had less positive-going parietal cue-locked P3 in the switch than repeat trials. Participants in the control group showed more positive-going cue-locked P3 in the switch than repeat trials, whereas the closed-skilled participants had no significant differences between the two types of trials. In the 50% validity condition, the open- and closed-skilled participants had less switch cost of response time than the control participants. Participants in the open- and closed-skilled groups showed less positive-going parietal stimulus-locked P3 in the switch than repeat trials, which was not the case for those in the control group. Our findings confirm the dissociation between proactive and reactive controls in relation to their modulations by the different motor-skill experiences. Both proactive and reactive controls of executive functions could be strengthened by exposing individuals to anticipatory or non-anticipatory enriched environments, suggesting proactive and reactive controls involved in motor-skill development seem to be transferable to domain-general executive functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00401</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;With the recent surge of affordable, high-performance virtual reality (VR) headsets, there is unlimited potential for applications ranging from education, to training, to entertainment, to fitness and beyond. As these interfaces continue to evolve, passive user-state monitoring can play a key role in expanding the immersive VR experience, and tracking activity for user well-being. By recording physiological signals such as the electroencephalogram (EEG) during use of a VR device, the user's interactions in the virtual environment could be adapted in real-time based on the user's cognitive state. Current VR headsets provide a logical, convenient, and unobtrusive framework for mounting EEG sensors. The present study evaluates the feasibility of passively monitoring cognitive workload via EEG while performing a classical n-back task in an interactive VR environment. Data were collected from 15 participants and the spatio-spectral EEG features were analyzed with respect to task performance. The results indicate that scalp measurements of electrical activity can effectively discriminate three workload levels, even after suppression of a co-varying high-frequency activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00398</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this EEG study, we used pre-registered and exploratory ERP and time-frequency analyses to investigate the resolution of anaphoric and non-anaphoric noun phrases during discourse comprehension. Participants listened to story contexts that described two antecedents, and subsequently read a target sentence with a critical noun phrase that lexically matched one antecedent (‘old’), matched two antecedents (‘ambiguous’), partially matched one antecedent in terms of semantic features (‘partial-match’), or introduced another referent (non-anaphoric, ‘new’). After each target sentence, participants judged whether the noun referred back to an antecedent (i.e., an ‘old/new’ judgment), which was easiest for ambiguous nouns and hardest for partially matching nouns. The noun-elicited N400 ERP component demonstrated initial sensitivity to repetition and semantic overlap, corresponding to repetition and semantic priming effects, respectively. New and partially matching nouns both elicited a subsequent frontal positivity, which suggested that partially matching anaphors may have been processed as new nouns temporarily. ERPs in an even later time window and ERPs time-locked to sentence-final words suggested that new and partially matching nouns had different effects on comprehension, with partially matching nouns incurring additional processing costs up to the end of the sentence. In contrast to the ERP results, the time-frequency results primarily demonstrated sensitivity to noun repetition, and did not differentiate partially matching anaphors from new nouns. In sum, our results show the ERP and time-frequency effects of referent repetition during discourse comprehension, and demonstrate the potentially demanding nature of establishing the anaphoric meaning of a novel noun.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00511</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The amygdala is an important center of fear learning and memory and plays a critical role in regulating stress disorders. Previous studies have shown that changes in the amygdala caused by stress are an important cause of mental disorders including anxiety, but the specific mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether mental disorders induced by stress are related to γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neuron damage in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and whether endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) is involved in the injury process. Rat models of different durations of stress were established by restraint and forced ice-water swimming. Behavioral tests and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were used to detect anxiety in rats and changes in neurotransmitter levels in the BLA. Morphological approaches and microscopy-based multicolor tissue cytometry (MMTC) were used to detect the damage-induced changes in GABAergic neurons in the BLA. Immunofluorescence double labeling was used to detect the expression of ERS-related proteins before and after the inhibition of protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) pathway. Stress resulted in damage to GABAergic neurons in the BLA, decreased GABA and increased glutamic acid (GLU) levels, perturbation of the excitation/inhibition (E/I) ratio in the BLA, and obvious anxiety disorders in rats. Moreover, ERS-mediated GABAergic neuron injury was an important cause of neurotransmitter level changes in the BLA. These results suggested that ERS-mediated GABAergic neuron injury in the BLA may be an important cause of stress-induced mental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Analgesic Effects of Compression at Trigger Points Are Associated With Reduction of Frontal Polar Cortical Activity as Well as Functional Connectivity Between the Frontal Polar Area and Insula in Patients With Chronic Low Back Pain: A Randomized Trial</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00068</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Compression of myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) in muscles is reported to reduce chronic musculoskeletal pain. Although the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is implicated in development of chronic pain, the mechanisms of how MTrP compression at low back regions affects PFC activity remain under debate. In this study, we investigated effects of MTrP compression on brain hemodynamics and EEG oscillation in subjects with chronic low back pain.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The study was a prospective, randomized, parallel-group trial and an observer and subject-blinded clinical trial. Thirty-two subjects with chronic low back pain were divided into two groups: subjects with compression at MTrPs (n = 16) or those with non-MTrPs (n = 16). Compression at MTrP or non-MTrP for 30 s was applied five times, and hemodynamic activity (near-infrared spectroscopy; NIRS) and EEGs were simultaneously recorded during the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The results indicated that compression at MTrPs significantly (1) reduced subjective pain (P &amp;lt; 0.05) and increased the pressure pain threshold (P &amp;lt; 0.05), (2) decreased the NIRS hemodynamic activity in the frontal polar area (pPFC) (P &amp;lt; 0.05), and (3) increased the current source density (CSD) of EEG theta oscillation in the anterior part of the PFC (P &amp;lt; 0.05). CSD of EEG theta oscillation was negatively correlated with NIRS hemodynamic activity in the pPFC (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Furthermore, functional connectivity in theta bands between the medial pPFC and insula cortex was significantly decreased in the MTrP group (P &amp;lt; 0.05). The functional connectivity between those regions was positively correlated with subjective low back pain (P &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;Discussion&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that MTrP compression at the lumbar muscle modulates pPFC activity and functional connectivity between the pPFC and insula, which may relieve chronic musculoskeletal pain.&lt;/p&gt;Trial registration&lt;p&gt;This trial was registered at University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN000033913) on 27 August 2018, at https://upload.umin.ac.jp/cgi-open-bin/ctr/ctr_view.cgi?recptno=R000038660.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: COALIA: A Computational Model of Human EEG for Consciousness Research</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00059</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the origin of the main physiological processes involved in consciousness is a major challenge of contemporary neuroscience, with crucial implications for the study of Disorders of Consciousness (DOC). The difficulties in achieving this task include the considerable quantity of experimental data in this field, along with the non-intuitive, nonlinear nature of neuronal dynamics. One possibility of integrating the main results from the experimental literature into a cohesive framework, while accounting for nonlinear brain dynamics, is the use of physiologically-inspired computational models. In this study, we present a physiologically-grounded computational model, attempting to account for the main micro-circuits identified in the human cortex, while including the specificities of each neuronal type. More specifically, the model accounts for thalamo-cortical (vertical) regulation of cortico-cortical (horizontal) connectivity, which is a central mechanism for brain information integration and processing. The distinct neuronal assemblies communicate through feedforward and feedback excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections implemented in a template brain accounting for long-range connectome. The EEG generated by this physiologically-based simulated brain is validated through comparison with brain rhythms recorded in humans in two states of consciousness (wakefulness, sleep). Using the model, it is possible to reproduce the local disynaptic disinhibition of basket cells (fast GABAergic inhibition) and glutamatergic pyramidal neurons through long-range activation of vasoactive intestinal-peptide (VIP) interneurons that induced inhibition of somatostatin positive (SST) interneurons. The model (COALIA) predicts that the strength and dynamics of the thalamic output on the cortex control the local and long-range cortical processing of information. Furthermore, the model reproduces and explains clinical results regarding the complexity of transcranial magnetic stimulation TMS-evoked EEG responses in DOC patients and healthy volunteers, through a modulation of thalamo-cortical connectivity that governs the level of cortico-cortical communication. This new model provides a quantitative framework to accelerate the study of the physiological mechanisms involved in the emergence, maintenance and disruption (sleep, anesthesia, DOC) of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01235</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Accurate and practical assessment of the brain circulation is needed to adequately estimate the viability of cerebral blood flow regulatory mechanisms in various physiological conditions. The objective of our study was to examine feasibility of the contactless green-light imaging photoplethysmography (PPG) for assessing cerebral autoregulation by revealing the dynamic relationships between cortical microcirculation assessed by PPG and changes in systemic blood pressure caused by visceral and somatic peripheral stimuli. In anesthetized male Wistar rats, the PPG video images of the open parietal cortex (either with unimpaired or dissected dura mater), electrocardiogram, and systemic arterial blood pressure (ABP) in the femoral artery were continuously recorded before, during and after visceral (colorectal distension) or somatic (tail squeezing) stimulation. In the vast majority of experiments with intact and removed dura mater, both spontaneous and peripheral stimulation-evoked changes in ABP negatively correlated with the accompanying alterations in the amplitude of pulsatile PPG component (APC), i.e., an increase of ABP resulted in a decrease of APC and vice versa. The most pronounced ABP and APC alterations were induced by noxious stimuli. Visceral painful stimulation in all cases caused short-term hypotension with simultaneous increase in cortical APC, whereas somatic noxious stimuli in 8 of 21 trials produced hypertensive effect with decreased APC. Animals with pressure 50-70 mmHg possessed higher negative cerebrovascular response rate of ABP-APC gradients than rats with either lower or higher pressure. Severe hypotension reversed the negative ratio to positive one, which was especially evident under visceral pain stimulation. Amplitude of the pulsatile PPG component probably reflects the regulation of vascular tone of cerebral cortex in response to systemic blood pressure fluctuations. When combined with different kinds of peripheral stimuli, the technique is capable for evaluation of normal and elucidation of impaired cerebrovascular system reactivity to particular physiological events, for example pain. The reported contactless PPG monitoring of cortical circulatory dynamics during neurosurgical interventions in combination with recordings of changes in other physiological parameters, such as systemic blood pressure and ECG, has the appealing potential to monitor viability of the cortex vessels and determine the state of patient’s cerebrovascular autoregulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00078</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synaptic changes induced by neural activity need to be consolidated to maintain memory over a timescale of hours. In experiments, synaptic consolidation can be induced by repeating a stimulation protocol several times and the effectiveness of consolidation depends crucially on the repetition frequency of the stimulations. We address the question: is there an understandable reason why induction protocols with repetitions at some frequency work better than sustained protocols—even though the accumulated stimulation strength might be exactly the same in both cases? In real synapses, plasticity occurs on multiple time scales from seconds (induction), to several minutes (early phase of long-term potentiation) to hours and days (late phase of synaptic consolidation). We use a simplified mathematical model of just two times scales to elucidate the above question in a purified setting. Our mathematical results show that, even in such a simple model, the repetition frequency of stimulation plays an important role for the successful induction, and stabilization, of potentiation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00310</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The importance of diverse lifestyle factors in sustaining cognition during aging and delaying the onset of decline in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias cannot be overstated. We explored the influence of cognitive, social, and physical lifestyle factors on resting-state lagged linear connectivity (LLC) in high-density electroencephalography (EEG) in adults, ages 35–75 years. Diverse lifestyle factors build cognitive reserve (CR), protecting cognition in the presence of physical brain decline. Differences in LLC were examined between high- and low-CR groups formed using cognitive, social, and exercise lifestyle factors. LLC is a measure of lagged coherence that excludes zero phase contributions and limits the effects of volume conduction on connectivity estimates. Significant differences in LLC were identified for cognitive and social factors, but not exercise. Participants high in social CR possessed greater local and long-range connectivity in theta and low alpha for eyes-open and eyes-closed recording conditions. In contrast, participants high in cognitive CR exhibited greater eyes-closed long-range connectivity between the occipital lobe and other cortical regions in low alpha. Greater eyes-closed local LLC in delta was also present in men high in cognitive CR. Cognitive factor scores correlated with sustained attention, whereas social factors scores correlated with spatial working memory. Gender was a significant covariate in our analyses, with women displaying higher local and long-range LLC in low beta. Our findings support distinct relationships between CR and LLC, as well as CR and cognitive function for cognitive and social subcomponents. These patterns reflect the importance of diverse lifestyle factors in building CR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Acetylcholine Mediates Dynamic Switching Between Information Coding Schemes in Neuronal Networks</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00064</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rate coding and phase coding are the two major coding modes seen in the brain. For these two modes, network dynamics must either have a wide distribution of frequencies for rate coding, or a narrow one to achieve stability in phase dynamics for phase coding. Acetylcholine (ACh) is a potent regulator of neural excitability. Acting through the muscarinic receptor, ACh reduces the magnitude of the potassium M-current, a hyperpolarizing current that builds up as neurons fire. The M-current contributes to several excitability features of neurons, becoming a major player in facilitating the transition between Type 1 (integrator) and Type 2 (resonator) excitability. In this paper we argue that this transition enables a dynamic switch between rate coding and phase coding as levels of ACh release change. When a network is in a high ACh state variations in synaptic inputs will lead to a wider distribution of firing rates across the network and this distribution will reflect the network structure or pattern of external input to the network. When ACh is low, network frequencies become narrowly distributed and the structure of a network or pattern of external inputs will be represented through phase relationships between firing neurons. This work provides insights into how modulation of neuronal features influences network dynamics and information processing across brain states.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Peripheral and central neurons in the pain pathway are well equipped to detect and respond to extracellular stimuli such as pro-inflammatory mediators and neurotransmitters through the cell surface expression of receptors that can mediate rapid intracellular signaling. Following injury or infection, activation of cell surface G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) initiates cell signaling processes that lead to the generation of action potentials in neurons or inflammatory responses such as cytokine secretion by immune cells. However, it is now appreciated that cell surface events alone may not be sufficient for all receptors to generate their complete signaling repertoire. Following an initial wave of signaling at the cell surface, active GPCRs can engage with endocytic proteins such as the adaptor protein β-arrestin (βArr) to promote clathrin-mediated internalization. Classically, βArr-mediated internalization of GPCRs was hypothesized to terminate signaling, yet for multiple GPCRs known to contribute to pain, it has been demonstrated that endocytosis can also promote a unique “second wave” of signaling from intracellular membranes, including those of endosomes and the Golgi, that is spatiotemporally distinct from initial cell-surface events. In the context of pain, understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive spatiotemporal signaling of GPCRs is invaluable for understanding how pain occurs and persists, and how current analgesics achieve efficacy or promote side-effects. This review article discusses the importance of receptor localization for signaling outcomes of pro- and anti-nociceptive GPCRs, and new analgesic opportunities emerging through the development of “location-biased” ligands that favor binding with intracellular GPCR populations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Effectiveness of Noise-Attenuating Headphones on Physiological Responses for Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00065</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the proof of concept of an intervention to decrease sympathetic activation as measured by skin conductivity (electrodermal activity, EDA) in children with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and auditory hypersensitivity (hyperacusis). In addition, researchers examined if the intervention provided protection against the negative effects of decibel level of environmental noises on electrodermal measures between interventions. The feasibility of implementation and outcome measures within natural environments were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: A single-subject multi-treatment design was used with six children, aged 8–16 years, with a form of Autism (i.e., Autism, PDD-NOS). Participants used in-ear (IE) and over-ear (OE) headphones for two randomly sequenced treatment phases. Each child completed four phases: (1) a week of baseline data collection; (2) a week of an intervention; (3) a week of no intervention; and (4) a week of the other intervention. Empatica E4 wristbands collected EDA data. Data was collected on 16–20 occasions per participant, with five measurements per phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Separated tests for paired study phases suggested that regardless of intervention type, noise attenuating headphones led to a significance difference in both skin conductance levels (SCL) and frequency of non-specific conductance responses (NS-SCRs) between the baseline measurement and subsequent phases. Overall, SCL and NS-SCR frequency significantly decreased between baseline and the first intervention phase. A protective effect of the intervention was tested by collapsing intervention results into three phases. Slope correlation suggested constant SCL and NS-SCR frequency after initial use of the headphones regardless of the increase in environmental noises. A subsequent analysis of the quality of EDA data identified that later phases of data collection were associated with better data quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Many children with ASD have hypersensitivities to sound resulting in high levels of sympathetic nervous system reactivity, which is associated with problematic behaviors and distress. The findings of this study suggest that the use of noise attenuating headphones for individuals with ASD and hyperacusis may reduce sympathetic activation. Additionally, results suggest that the use of wearable sensors to collect physiological data in natural environments is feasible with established protocols and training procedures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurogenesis section | New and Recent Articles: Aged Opossums Show Alterations in Spatial Learning Behavior and Reduced Neurogenesis in the Dentate Gyrus</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01210</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In many mammalian species including opossums, adult neurogenesis, the function of which is not completely understood, declines with aging. Aging also causes impairment of cognition. To understand whether new neurons contribute to learning and memory, we performed experiments on young and aged laboratory opossums, Monodelphis domestica, and examined the association between spatial memory using the Morris water maze test and the rate of adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG). Modification of this test allowed us to assess how both young and aged opossums learn and remember the location of the platform in the water maze. We found that both young and aged opossums were motivated to perform this task. However, aged opossums needed more time to achieve the test than young opossums. Classical parameters measuring spatial learning in a water maze during a probe test showed that young opossums spent more time in the platform zone crossing it more often than aged opossums. Additionally, hippocampal neurogenesis was lower in the aged opossums than in the young animals but new neurons were still generated in the DG of aged opossums. Our data revealed individual differences in the levels of doublecortin in relation to memory performance across aged opossums. These differences were correlated with distinct behaviors, particularly, aged opossums with high levels of DCX achieved high performance levels in the water maze task. We, therefore suggest that new neurons in the DG of Monodelphis opossums contribute to learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Enhancing Attention by Synchronizing Respiration and Fingertip Pressure: A Pilot Study Using Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01209</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sustained attention is a fundamental ability ensuring effective cognitive processing and can be enhanced by meditation practice. However, keeping a focused meditative state is challenging for novices because involuntary mind-wandering frequently occurs during their practice. Inspired by the potential of force-control tasks in invoking internal somatic attention, we proposed a haptics-assisted meditation (HAM) to help reduce mind-wandering and enhance attention. During HAM, participants were instructed to maintain awareness on the respiration and meanwhile adjust bimanual fingertip pressures to keep synchronized with the respiration. This paradigm required somatosensory attention as a physiological foundation, aiming to help novices meditate starting with the body and gradually gain essential meditation skills. A cross-sectional study on 12 novices indicated that the participants reported less mind-wandering during HAM compared with the classic breath-counting meditation (BCM). In a further longitudinal study, the experimental group with 10 novices showed significantly improved performance in several attentional tests after 5 days’ practice of HAM. They tended to show more significant improvements in a few tests than did the control group performing the 5-day BCM practice. To investigate the brain activities related to HAM, we applied functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to record cerebral hemodynamic responses from the prefrontal and sensorimotor cortices when performing HAM, and we assessed the changes in cerebral activation and functional connectivity (FC) after the 5-day HAM practice. The prefrontal and sensorimotor regions demonstrated a uniform activation when performing HAM, and there was a significant increase in the right prefrontal activation after the practice. We also observed significant changes in the FC between the brain regions related to the attention networks. These behavioral and neural findings together provided preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of HAM on attention enhancement in the early stage of meditation learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Neurites (axons and dendrites) from the same neuron recognize and avoid self, but engage in synaptic interactions with other neurons. Vertebrate neural self-avoidance requires the expression of distinct repertoires of clustered Protocadherin (Pcdh) cell-surface protein isoforms, which act as cell-surface molecular barcodes that mediate highly specific homophilic self-recognition, followed by repulsion. The generation of sufficiently diverse cell-surface barcodes is achieved by the stochastic and combinatorial activation of a subset of clustered Pcdh promoters in individual neurons. This remarkable mechanism leads to the generation of enormous molecular diversity at the cell surface. Here we review recent studies showing that stochastic expression of individual Pcdhα isoforms is accomplished through an extraordinary mechanism involving the activation of ‘antisense strand’ promoter within Pcdhα ‘variable’ exons, antisense transcription of a long non-coding RNA through the upstream ‘sense strand’ promoter, demethylation of this promoter, binding of the CTCF/cohesin complex and DNA looping to a distant enhancer through a mechanism of chromatin ‘extrusion’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Short-Term Attractive Tilt Aftereffects Predicted by a Recurrent Network Model of Primary Visual Cortex</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00067</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Adaptation is a multi-faceted phenomenon that is of interest in terms of both its function and its potential to reveal underlying neural processing. Many behavioral studies have shown that after exposure to an oriented adapter the perceived orientation of a subsequent test is repulsed away from the orientation of the adapter. This is the well-known Tilt Aftereffect (TAE). Recently, we showed that the dynamics of recurrently connected networks may contribute substantially to the neural changes induced by adaptation, especially on short time scales. Here we extended the network model and made the novel behavioral prediction that the TAE should be attractive, not repulsive, on a time scale of a few 100 ms. Our experiments, using a novel adaptation protocol that specifically targeted adaptation on a short time scale, confirmed this prediction. These results support our hypothesis that recurrent network dynamics may contribute to short-term adaptation. More broadly, they show that understanding the neural processing of visual inputs that change on the time scale of a typical fixation requires a detailed analysis of not only the intrinsic properties of neurons, but also the slow and complex dynamics that emerge from their recurrent connectivity. We argue that this is but one example of how even simple recurrent networks can underlie surprisingly complex information processing, and are involved in rudimentary forms of memory, spatio-temporal integration, and signal amplification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Modeling the Ongoing Dynamics of Short and Long-Range Temporal Correlations in Broadband EEG During Movement</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00066</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electroencephalogram (EEG) undergoes complex temporal and spectral changes during voluntary movement intention. Characterization of such changes has focused mostly on narrowband spectral processes such as Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD) in the sensorimotor rhythms because EEG is mostly considered as emerging from oscillations of the neuronal populations. However, the changes in the temporal dynamics, especially in the broadband arrhythmic EEG have not been investigated for movement intention detection. The Long-Range Temporal Correlations (LRTC) are ubiquitously present in several neuronal processes, typically requiring longer timescales to detect. In this paper, we study the ongoing changes in the dynamics of long- as well as short-range temporal dependencies in the single trial broadband EEG during movement intention. We obtained LRTC in 2 s windows of broadband EEG and modeled it using the Autoregressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average (ARFIMA) model which allowed simultaneous modeling of short- and long-range temporal correlations. There were significant (p &amp;lt; 0.05) changes in both broadband long- and short-range temporal correlations during movement intention and execution. We discovered that the broadband LRTC and narrowband ERD are complementary processes providing distinct information about movement because eliminating LRTC from the signal did not affect the ERD and conversely, eliminating ERD from the signal did not affect LRTC. Exploring the possibility of applications in Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI), we used hybrid features with combinations of LRTC, ARFIMA, and ERD to detect movement intention. A significantly higher (p &amp;lt; 0.05) classification accuracy of 88.3 ± 4.2% was obtained using the combination of ARFIMA and ERD features together, which also predicted the earliest movement at 1 s before its onset. The ongoing changes in the long- and short-range temporal correlations in broadband EEG contribute to effectively capturing the motor command generation and can be used to detect movement successfully. These temporal dependencies provide different and additional information about the movement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Performance Evaluation of Visual Noise Imposed Stochastic Resonance Effect on Brain-Computer Interface Application: A Comparison Between Motion-Reversing Simple Ring and Complex Checkerboard Patterns</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01192</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Adding noise to a weak input signal can enhance the response of a non-linear system, a phenomenon known as stochastic resonance (SR). SR has been demonstrated in a variety of diverse sensory systems including the visual system, where visual noise enhances human motion perception and detection performance. The SR effect has not been extensively studied in brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. This study compares the performance of BCIs based on SR-influenced steady-state motion visual evoked potentials. Stimulation paradigms were used between a periodically monochromatic motion-reversing simple ring and complex alternating checkerboard stimuli. To induce the SR effect, dynamic visual noise was masked on both the periodic simple and complex stimuli. Offline results showed that the recognition accuracy of different stimulation targets followed an inverted U-shaped function of noise level, which is a hallmark of SR. With the optimal visual noise level, the proposed visual noise masked checkerboard BCI paradigm achieved faster and more stable detection performance due to the noise-enhanced brain responses. This work demonstrates that the SR effect can be employed in BCI applications and can achieve considerable performance improvements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Robustness of Radiomics for Survival Prediction of Brain Tumor Patients Depending on Resection Status</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00073</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Prediction of overall survival based on multimodal MRI of brain tumor patients is a difficult problem. Although survival also depends on factors that cannot be assessed via preoperative MRI such as surgical outcome, encouraging results for MRI-based survival analysis have been published for different datasets. We assess if and how established radiomic approaches as well as novel methods can predict overall survival of brain tumor patients on the BraTS challenge dataset. This dataset consists of multimodal preoperative images of 211 glioblastoma patients from several institutions with reported resection status and known survival. In the official challenge setting, only patients with a reported gross total resection (GTR) are taken into account. We therefore evaluated previously published methods as well as different machine learning approaches on the BraTS dataset. For different types of resection status, these approaches are compared to a baseline, a linear regression on patient age only. This naive approach won the 3rd place out of 26 participants in the BraTS survival prediction challenge 2018. Previously published radiomic signatures show significant correlations and predictiveness to patient survival for patients with a reported subtotal resection. However, for patients with reported GTR, none of the evaluated approaches was able to outperform the age-only baseline in a cross-validation setting, explaining the poor performance of approaches based on radiomics in the BraTS challenge 2018.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Multimodal Integration of Brain Images for MRI-Based Diagnosis in Schizophrenia</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01203</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been proposed as a source of information for automatic prediction of individual diagnosis in schizophrenia. Optimal integration of data from different MRI modalities is an active area of research aimed at increasing diagnostic accuracy. Based on a sample of 96 patients with schizophrenia and a matched sample of 115 healthy controls that had undergone a single multimodal MRI session, we generated individual brain maps of gray matter vbm, 1back, and 2back levels of activation (nback fMRI), maps of amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (resting-state fMRI), and maps of weighted global brain connectivity (resting-state fMRI). Four unimodal classifiers (Ridge, Lasso, Random Forests, and Gradient boosting) were applied to these maps to evaluate their classification accuracies. Based on the assignments made by the algorithms on test individuals, we quantified the amount of predictive information shared between maps (what we call redundancy analysis). Finally, we explored the added accuracy provided by a set of multimodal strategies that included post-classification integration based on probabilities, two-step sequential integration, and voxel-level multimodal integration through one-dimensional-convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs). All four unimodal classifiers showed the highest test accuracies with the 2back maps (80% on average) achieving a maximum of 84% with the Lasso. Redundancy levels between brain maps were generally low (overall mean redundancy score of 0.14 in a 0–1 range), indicating that each brain map contained differential predictive information. The highest multimodal accuracy was delivered by the two-step Ridge classifier (87%) followed by the Ridge maximum and mean probability classifiers (both with 85% accuracy) and by the 1D-CNN, which achieved the same accuracy as the best unimodal classifier (84%). From these results, we conclude that from all MRI modalities evaluated task-based fMRI may be the best unimodal diagnostic option in schizophrenia. Low redundancy values point to ample potential for accuracy improvements through multimodal integration, with the two-step Ridge emerging as a suitable strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01193</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Animal behavioral paradigms, such as classical conditioning and operant conditioning, are an important tool to study the neural basis of cognition and behavior. These paradigms involve manipulating sensory stimuli in a way that learning processes are induced under controlled experimental conditions. However, the majority of the commercially available equipment did not offer flexibility to manipulate stimuli. Therefore, the development of most versatile devices would allow the study of more complex cognitive functions. The purpose of this work is to present a low-cost, customized and wireless-operated chamber for animal behavior conditioning, based on the joint operation of two microcontroller modules: Arduino Due and ESP8266-12E. Our results showed that the auditory stimulation system allows setting the carrier frequency in the range of 1 Hz up to more than 100 kHz and the sound stimulus can be modulated in amplitude, also over a wide range of frequencies. Likewise, foot-shock could be precisely manipulated regarding its amplitude (from ∼200 μA to ∼1500 μA) and frequency (up to 20 pulses per second). Finally, adult rats exposed to a protocol of cued fear conditioning in our device showed consistent behavioral response and electrophysiological evoked responses in the midbrain auditory pathway. Furthermore, the device developed in the current study represents an open source alternative to develop customized protocols to study fear memory under conditions of varied sensory stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Neural Network Model for Detection of Edges Defined by Image Dynamics</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00076</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Insects can detect the presence of discrete objects in their visual fields based on a range of differences in spatiotemporal characteristics between the images of object and background. This includes but is not limited to relative motion. Evidence suggests that edge detection is an integral part of this capability, and this study examines the ability of a bio-inspired processing model to detect the presence of boundaries between two regions of a one-dimensional visual field, based on general differences in image dynamics. The model consists of two parts. The first is an early vision module inspired by insect visual processing, which implements adaptive photoreception, ON and OFF channels with transient and sustained characteristics, and delayed and undelayed signal paths. This is replicated for a number of photoreceptors in a small linear array. It is followed by an artificial neural network trained to discriminate the presence vs. absence of an edge based on the array output signals. Input data are derived from natural imagery and feature both static and moving edges between regions with moving texture, flickering texture, and static patterns in all possible combinations. The model can discriminate the presence of edges, stationary or moving, at rates far higher than chance. The resources required (numbers of neurons and visual signals) are realistic relative to those available in the insect second optic ganglion, where the bulk of such processing would be likely to take place.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Seizure Susceptibility Corrupts Inferior Colliculus Acoustic Integration</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00063</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests that the pathophysiology associated with epileptic susceptibility may disturb the functional connectivity of neural circuits and compromise the brain functions, even when seizures are absent. Although memory impairment is a common comorbidity found in patients with epilepsy, it is still unclear whether more caudal structures may play a role in cognitive deficits, particularly in those cases where there is no evidence of hippocampal sclerosis. This work used a genetically selected rat strain for seizure susceptibility (Wistar audiogenic rat, WAR) and distinct behavioral (motor and memory-related tasks) and electrophysiological (inferior colliculus, IC) approaches to access acoustic primary integrative network properties. The IC neural assemblies’ response was evaluated by auditory transient (focusing on bottom-up processing) and steady-state evoked response (ASSR, centering on feedforward and feedback forces over neural circuitry). The results show that WAR displayed no disturbance in motor performance or hippocampus-dependent memory tasks. Nonetheless, WAR animals exhibited significative impairment for auditory fear conditioning (AFC) along with no indicative of IC plastic changes between the pre-conditioning and test phases (ASSR coherence analysis). Furthermore, WAR’s IC response to transient stimuli presented shorter latency and higher amplitude compared with Wistar; and the ASSR analysis showed similar results for WAR and Wistar animals under subthreshold dose of pentylenetetrazol (pro-convulsive drug) for seizure-induction. Our work demonstrated alterations at WAR IC neural network processing, which may explain the associated disturbance on AFC memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00062</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the current longitudinal study, we investigated the development of working memory in musically trained and nontrained children and adolescents, aged 9–20. We measured working memory with the Digit Span (DS) forwards and backwards tests (N = 106) and the Trail-Making A and B (TMT-A and B; N = 104) tests three times, in 2011, 2013, and 2016. We expected that musically trained participants would outperform peers with no musical training. Indeed, we found that the younger musically trained participants, in particular, outperformed their nontrained peers in the TMT-A, TMT-B and DS forwards tests. These tests all primarily require active maintenance of a rule in memory or immediate recall. In contrast, we found no group differences in the backwards test that requires manipulation and updating of information in working memory. These results suggest that musical training is more strongly associated with heightened working memory capacity and maintenance than enhanced working memory updating, especially in late childhood and early adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: More Reliable EEG Electrode Digitizing Methods Can Reduce Source Estimation Uncertainty, but Current Methods Already Accurately Identify Brodmann Areas</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01159</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electroencephalography (EEG) and source estimation can be used to identify brain areas activated during a task, which could offer greater insight on cortical dynamics. Source estimation requires knowledge of the locations of the EEG electrodes. This could be provided with a template or obtained by digitizing the EEG electrode locations. Operator skill and inherent uncertainties of a digitizing system likely produce a range of digitization reliabilities, which could affect source estimation and the interpretation of the estimated source locations. Here, we compared the reliabilities of five digitizing methods (ultrasound, structured-light 3D scan, infrared 3D scan, motion capture probe, and motion capture) and determined the relationship between digitization reliability and source estimation uncertainty, assuming other contributors to source estimation uncertainty were constant. We digitized a mannequin head using each method five times and quantified the reliability and validity of each method. We created five hundred sets of electrode locations based on our reliability results and applied a dipole fitting algorithm (DIPFIT) to perform source estimation. The motion capture method, which recorded the locations of markers placed directly on the electrodes had the best reliability with an average electrode variability of 0.001 cm. Then, in order of decreasing reliability were the method using a digitizing probe in the motion capture system, an infrared 3D scanner, a structured-light 3D scanner, and an ultrasound digitization system. Unsurprisingly, uncertainty of the estimated source locations increased with greater variability of EEG electrode locations and less reliable digitizing systems. If EEG electrode location variability was ∽1 cm, a single source could shift by as much as 2 cm. To help translate these distances into practical terms, we quantified Brodmann area accuracy for each digitizing method and found that the average Brodmann area accuracy for all digitizing methods was &amp;gt;80%. Using a template of electrode locations reduced the Brodmann area accuracy to ∽50%. Overall, more reliable digitizing methods can reduce source estimation uncertainty, but the significance of the source estimation uncertainty depends on the desired spatial resolution. For accurate Brodmann area identification, any of the digitizing methods tested can be used confidently.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00072</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent evidence suggests that the cerebellum is related to motor and non-motor cognitive functions, and that several coupled cerebro-cerebellar networks exist, including links with the limbic network. Since several limbic structures are affected by Alzheimer pathology, even in the preclinical stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), we aimed to investigate the cerebral limbic network activity from the perspective of the cerebellum. Twenty patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 18 patients with AD, and 26 healthy controls (HC) were recruited to acquire Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI). We used seed-based approach to construct the cerebro-cerebellar limbic network. Two-sample t-tests were carried out to explore the differences of the cerebellar limbic network connectivity. The first result, a sub-scale network including the bilateral posterior part of the orbitofrontal cortex (POFC) extending to the anterior insular cortex (AIC) and left inferior parietal lobule (L-IPL), showed greater functional connectivity in MCI than in HC and less functional connectivity in AD than in MCI. The location of this sub-scale network was in accordance with components of the ventral attention network. Second, there was decreased functional connectivity to the right mid-cingulate cortex (MCC) in the AD and MCI patient groups relative to the HC group. As the cerebellum is not compromised by Alzheimer pathology in the prodromal stage of AD, this pattern indicates that the sub-scale ventral attention network may play a pivotal role in functional compensation through the coupled cerebro-cerebellar limbic network in MCI, and the cerebellum may be a key node in the modulation of social cognition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01190</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) is being widely used for charting brain connectivity and dynamics in healthy and diseased brains. However, the resting state paradigm allows an unconstrained fluctuation of brain arousal, which may have profound effects on resting-state fMRI signals and associated connectivity/dynamic metrics. Here, we review current understandings of the relationship between resting-state fMRI and brain arousal, in particular the effect of a recently discovered event of arousal modulation on resting-state fMRI. We further discuss potential implications of arousal-related fMRI modulation with a focus on its potential role in mediating spurious correlations between resting-state connectivity/dynamics with physiology and behavior. Multiple hypotheses are formulated based on existing evidence and remain to be tested by future studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Brain–Blood Partition Coefficient and Cerebral Blood Flow in Canines Using Calibrated Short TR Recovery (CaSTRR) Correction Method</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01189</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The brain–blood partition coefficient (BBPC) is necessary for quantifying cerebral blood flow (CBF) when using tracer based techniques like arterial spin labeling (ASL). A recent improvement to traditional MRI measurements of BBPC, called calibrated short TR recovery (CaSTRR), has demonstrated a significant reduction in acquisition time for BBPC maps in mice. In this study CaSTRR is applied to a cohort of healthy canines (n = 17, age = 5.0 – 8.0 years) using a protocol suited for application in humans at 3T. The imaging protocol included CaSTRR for BBPC maps, pseudo-continuous ASL for CBF maps, and high resolution anatomical images. The standard CaSTRR method of normalizing BBPC to gadolinium-doped deuterium oxide phantoms was also compared to normalization using hematocrit (Hct) as a proxy value for blood water content. The results show that CaSTRR is able to produce high quality BBPC maps with a 4 min acquisition time. The BBPC maps demonstrate significantly higher BBPC in gray matter (0.83 ± 0.05 mL/g) than in white matter (0.78 ± 0.04 mL/g, p = 0.006). Maps of CBF acquired with pCASL demonstrate a negative correlation between gray matter perfusion and age (p = 0.003). Voxel-wise correction for BBPC is also shown to improve contrast to noise ratio between gray and white matter in CBF maps. A novel aspect of the study was to show that that BBPC measurements can be calculated based on the known Hct of the blood sample placed in scanner. We found a strong correlation (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.81 in gray matter, R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.59 in white matter) established between BBPC maps normalized to the doped phantoms and BBPC maps normalized using Hct. This obviates the need for doped water phantoms which simplifies both the acquisition protocol and the post-processing methods. Together this suggests that CaSTRR represents a feasible, rapid method to account for BBPC variability when quantifying CBF. As canines have been used widely for aging and Alzheimer’s disease studies, the CaSTRR method established in the animals may further improve CBF measurements and advance our understanding of cerebrovascular changes in aging and neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Divide and Conquer: Stratifying Training Data by Tumor Grade Improves Deep Learning-Based Brain Tumor Segmentation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01182</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It is a general assumption in deep learning that more training data leads to better performance, and that models will learn to generalize well across heterogeneous input data as long as that variety is represented in the training set. Segmentation of brain tumors is a well-investigated topic in medical image computing, owing primarily to the availability of a large publicly-available dataset arising from the long-running yearly Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge. Research efforts and publications addressing this dataset focus predominantly on technical improvements of model architectures and less on properties of the underlying data. Using the dataset and the method ranked third in the BraTS 2018 challenge, we performed experiments to examine the impact of tumor type on segmentation performance. We propose to stratify the training dataset into high-grade glioma (HGG) and low-grade glioma (LGG) subjects and train two separate models. Although we observed only minor gains in overall mean dice scores by this stratification, examining case-wise rankings of individual subjects revealed statistically significant improvements. Compared to a baseline model trained on both HGG and LGG cases, two separately trained models led to better performance in 64.9% of cases (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) for the tumor core. An analysis of subjects which did not profit from stratified training revealed that cases were missegmented which had poor image quality, or which presented clinically particularly challenging cases (e.g., underrepresented subtypes such as IDH1-mutant tumors), underlining the importance of such latent variables in the context of tumor segmentation. In summary, we found that segmentation models trained on the BraTS 2018 dataset, stratified according to tumor type, lead to a significant increase in segmentation performance. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this gain in segmentation performance is evident in the case-wise ranking of individual subjects but not in summary statistics. We conclude that it may be useful to consider the segmentation of brain tumors of different types or grades as separate tasks, rather than developing one tool to segment them all. Consequently, making this information available for the test data should be considered, potentially leading to a more clinically relevant BraTS competition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Comparison of Multi-Compartment Cable Models of Human Auditory Nerve Fibers</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01173</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Multi-compartment cable models of auditory nerve fibers have been developed to assist in the improvement of cochlear implants. With the advancement of computational technology and the results obtained from in vivo and in vitro experiments, these models have evolved to incorporate a considerable degree of morphological and physiological details. They have also been combined with three-dimensional volume conduction models of the cochlea to simulate neural responses to electrical stimulation. However, no specific rules have been provided on choosing the appropriate cable model, and most models adopted in recent studies were chosen without a specific reason or by inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Three of the most cited biophysical multi-compartment cable models of the human auditory nerve, i.e., Rattay et al. (2001b), Briaire and Frijns (2005), and Smit et al. (2010), were implemented in this study. Several properties of single fibers were compared among the three models, including threshold, conduction velocity, action potential shape, latency, refractory properties, as well as stochastic and temporal behaviors. Experimental results regarding these properties were also included as a reference for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: For monophasic single-pulse stimulation, the ratio of anodic vs. cathodic thresholds in all models was within the experimental range despite a much larger ratio in the model by Briaire and Frijns. For biphasic pulse-train stimulation, thresholds as a function of both pulse rate and pulse duration differed between the models, but none matched the experimental observations even coarsely. Similarly, for all other properties including the conduction velocity, action potential shape, and latency, the models presented different outcomes and not all of them fell within the range observed in experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: While all three models presented similar values in certain single fiber properties to those obtained in experiments, none matched all experimental observations satisfactorily. In particular, the adaptation and temporal integration behaviors were completely missing in all models. Further extensions and analyses are required to explain and simulate realistic auditory nerve fiber responses to electrical stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Aftereffect and Reproducibility of Three Excitatory Repetitive TMS Protocols for a Response Inhibition Task</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01155</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A number of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) protocols have been developed for modulating brain function non-invasively. To identify the most powerful one, these protocols have been compared in the context of the motor system. However, to what extent the conclusions could be generalized to high-level functions is largely unknown. In this study, we compared the modulatory effect of three excitatory rTMS protocols on high-level cognition represented by response inhibition ability. Our first experiment revealed that intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) could significantly improve reaction time in a stop signal task, while 5-Hz and 25-Hz stimuli were ineffective. This iTBS effect was significantly higher than that for the sham simulation and only occurred in the second session of the stop signal task after iTBS in the first experiment. However, this aftereffect of iTBS was not reproduced in the second experiment, indicating high variability across subjects. Thus, on the one hand, our findings indicate that iTBS on the pre-SMA could improve inhibitory control, but on the other hand, the reliability and reproducibility of this effect needs further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Beta-Band Resonance and Intrinsic Oscillations in a Biophysically Detailed Model of the Subthalamic Nucleus-Globus Pallidus Network</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00077</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Increased beta-band oscillatory activity in the basal ganglia network is associated with Parkinsonian motor symptoms and is suppressed with medication and deep brain stimulation (DBS). The origins of the beta-band oscillations, however, remains unclear with both intrinsic oscillations arising within the subthalamic nucleus (STN)—external globus pallidus (GPe) network and exogenous beta-activity, originating outside the network, proposed as potential sources of the pathological activity. The aim of this study was to explore the relative contribution of autonomous oscillations and exogenous oscillatory inputs in the generation of pathological oscillatory activity in a biophysically detailed model of the parkinsonian STN-GPe network. The network model accounts for the integration of synaptic currents and their interaction with intrinsic membrane currents in dendritic structures within the STN and GPe. The model was used to investigate the development of beta-band synchrony and bursting within the STN-GPe network by changing the balance of excitation and inhibition in both nuclei, and by adding exogenous oscillatory inputs with varying phase relationships through the hyperdirect cortico-subthalamic and indirect striato-pallidal pathways. The model showed an intrinsic susceptibility to beta-band oscillations that was manifest in weak autonomously generated oscillations within the STN-GPe network and in selective amplification of exogenous beta-band synaptic inputs near the network's endogenous oscillation frequency. The frequency at which this resonance peak occurred was determined by the net level of excitatory drive to the network. Intrinsic or endogenously generated oscillations were too weak to support a pacemaker role for the STN-GPe network, however, they were considerably amplified by sparse cortical beta inputs and were further amplified by striatal beta inputs that promoted anti-phase firing of the cortex and GPe, resulting in maximum transient inhibition of STN neurons. The model elucidates a mechanism of cortical patterning of the STN-GPe network through feedback inhibition whereby intrinsic susceptibility to beta-band oscillations can lead to phase locked spiking under parkinsonian conditions. These results point to resonance of endogenous oscillations with exogenous patterning of the STN-GPe network as a mechanism of pathological synchronization, and a role for the pallido-striatal feedback loop in amplifying beta oscillations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
