	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Anatomical Pattern Analysis for decoding visual stimuli in human brains. (arXiv:1710.02113v1 [stat.ML])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02113</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02113</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: A universal unanswered question in neuroscience and machine
learning is whether computers can decode the patterns of the human brain.
Multi-Voxels Pattern Analysis (MVPA) is a critical tool for addressing this
question. However, there are two challenges in the previous MVPA methods, which
include decreasing sparsity and noise in the extracted features and increasing
the performance of prediction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods: In overcoming mentioned challenges, this paper proposes Anatomical
Pattern Analysis (APA) for decoding visual stimuli in the human brain. This
framework develops a novel anatomical feature extraction method and a new
imbalance AdaBoost algorithm for binary classification. Further, it utilizes an
Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) method for multiclass prediction. APA can
automatically detect active regions for each category of the visual stimuli.
Moreover, it enables us to combine homogeneous datasets for applying advanced
classification.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results and Conclusions: Experimental studies on 4 visual categories (words,
consonants, objects and scrambled photos) demonstrate that the proposed
approach achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art methods.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Acetylcholine-modulated plasticity in reward-driven navigation: a computational study. (arXiv:1710.01951v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.01951</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.01951</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuromodulation plays a fundamental role in the acquisition of new
behaviours. Our experimental findings show that, whereas acetylcholine biases
hippocampal synaptic plasticity towards depression, the subsequent application
of dopamine can retroactively convert depression into potentiation. We
previously demonstrated that incorporating this sequentially neuromodulated
Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) rule in a network model of navigation
yields effective learning of changing reward locations. Here, we further
characterize the effects of cholinergic depression on behaviour. We find that
acetylcholine, by allowing learning from negative outcomes, influences
exploration in a non-trivial manner that highly depends on the specifics of the
model, the environment and the task. Interestingly, sequentially neuromodulated
STDP also yields flexible learning, surpassing the performance of other
reward-modulated plasticity rules.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A unifying Bayesian account of contextual effects in value-based choice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005769</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/LFieRi1R8Vw/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Francesco Rigoli, Christoph Mathys, Karl J. Friston, Raymond J. Dolan&lt;/p&gt;

Empirical evidence suggests the incentive value of an option is affected by other options available during choice and by options presented in the past. These contextual effects are hard to reconcile with classical theories and have inspired accounts where contextual influences play a crucial role. However, each account only addresses one or the other of the empirical findings and a unifying perspective has been elusive. Here, we offer a unifying theory of context effects on incentive value attribution and choice based on normative Bayesian principles. This formulation assumes that incentive value corresponds to a precision-weighted prediction error, where predictions are based upon expectations about reward. We show that this scheme explains a wide range of contextual effects, such as those elicited by other options available during choice (or within-choice context effects). These include both conditions in which choice requires an integration of multiple attributes and conditions where a multi-attribute integration is not necessary. Moreover, the same scheme explains context effects elicited by options presented in the past or between-choice context effects. Our formulation encompasses a wide range of contextual influences (comprising both within- and between-choice effects) by calling on Bayesian principles, without invoking &lt;i&gt;ad-hoc&lt;/i&gt; assumptions. This helps clarify the contextual nature of incentive value and choice behaviour and may offer insights into psychopathologies characterized by dysfunctional decision-making, such as addiction and pathological gambling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LFieRi1R8Vw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Differential temperature sensitivity of synaptic and firing processes in a neural mass model of epileptic discharges explains heterogeneous response of experimental epilepsy to focal brain cooling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005736</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/ZK3SX5hF730/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jaymar Soriano, Takatomi Kubo, Takao Inoue, Hiroyuki Kida, Toshitaka Yamakawa, Michiyasu Suzuki, Kazushi Ikeda&lt;/p&gt;

Experiments with drug-induced epilepsy in rat brains and epileptic human brain region reveal that focal cooling can suppress epileptic discharges without affecting the brain’s normal neurological function. Findings suggest a viable treatment for intractable epilepsy cases via an implantable cooling device. However, precise mechanisms by which cooling suppresses epileptic discharges are still not clearly understood. Cooling experiments &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; presented evidence of reduction in neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminals and loss of dendritic spines at post-synaptic terminals offering a possible synaptic mechanism. We show that termination of epileptic discharges is possible by introducing a homogeneous temperature factor in a neural mass model which attenuates the post-synaptic impulse responses of the neuronal populations. This result however may be expected since such attenuation leads to reduced post-synaptic potential and when the effect on inhibitory interneurons is less than on excitatory interneurons, frequency of firing of pyramidal cells is consequently reduced. While this is observed in cooling experiments &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, experiments &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; exhibit persistent discharges during cooling but suppressed in magnitude. This leads us to conjecture that reduction in the frequency of discharges may be compensated through intrinsic excitability mechanisms. Such compensatory mechanism is modelled using a reciprocal temperature factor in the firing response function in the neural mass model. We demonstrate that the complete model can reproduce attenuation of both magnitude and frequency of epileptic discharges during cooling. The compensatory mechanism suggests that cooling lowers the average and the variance of the distribution of threshold potential of firing across the population. Bifurcation study with respect to the temperature parameters of the model reveals how heterogeneous response of epileptic discharges to cooling (termination or suppression only) is exhibited. Possibility of differential temperature effects on post-synaptic potential generation of different populations is also explored.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZK3SX5hF730&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Guerfali, Colleen Saunders, Ahmed Mansour Alzohairy, Samson P. Salifu, Rehab Ahmed, Ruben Cloete, Jonathan Kayondo, Deogratius Ssemwanga, Nicola Mulder, H3ABioNet Consortium's Education Training and Working Group as members of the H3Africa Consortium &lt;/p&gt;

Africa is not unique in its need for basic bioinformatics training for individuals from a diverse range of academic backgrounds. However, particular logistical challenges in Africa, most notably access to bioinformatics expertise and internet stability, must be addressed in order to meet this need on the continent. H3ABioNet (www.h3abionet.org), the Pan African Bioinformatics Network for H3Africa, has therefore developed an innovative, free-of-charge “Introduction to Bioinformatics” course, taking these challenges into account as part of its educational efforts to provide on-site training and develop local expertise inside its network. A multiple-delivery–mode learning model was selected for this 3-month course in order to increase access to (mostly) African, expert bioinformatics trainers. The content of the course was developed to include a range of fundamental bioinformatics topics at the introductory level. For the first iteration of the course (2016), classrooms with a total of 364 enrolled participants were hosted at 20 institutions across 10 African countries. To ensure that classroom success did not depend on stable internet, trainers pre-recorded their lectures, and classrooms downloaded and watched these locally during biweekly contact sessions. The trainers were available via video conferencing to take questions during contact sessions, as well as via online “question and discussion” forums outside of contact session time. This learning model, developed for a resource-limited setting, could easily be adapted to other settings.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WjESFGyD0a8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Serum tau and neurological outcome in cardiac arrest</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25067</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25067</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: To test serum tau as a predictor of neurological outcome after cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We measured the neuronal protein tau in serum at 24, 48, and 72 h after cardiac arrest in 689 patients in the prospective international Target Temperature Management trial. The main outcome was poor neurological outcome, defined as Cerebral Performance Category 3-5 at 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Increased tau was associated with poor outcome at 6 months after cardiac arrest (median 38.5 [IQR 5.7-245] ng/L in poor versus 1.5 [0.7-2.4] ng/L in good outcome, for tau at 72 h, p&amp;lt;0.0001). Tau improved prediction of poor outcome compared to using clinical information (p&amp;lt;0.0001). Tau cut-offs had low false positive rates (FPR) for good outcome while retaining high sensitivity for poor outcome. For example, tau at 72 h had FPR 2% (95% CI 1-4%) with sensitivity 66% (95% CI 61-70%). Tau had higher accuracy than serum NSE (the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.91 for tau versus 0.86 for NSE at 72 hours, p=0.00024). During follow-up (up to 956 days), tau was significantly associated with overall survival. The accuracy to predict outcome by serum tau was equally high for patients randomized to 33°C and 36°C targeted temperature after cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Serum tau is a promising novel biomarker for prediction of neurological outcome in patients with cardiac arrest. It may be significantly better than serum NSE, which is recommended in guidelines and currently used in clinical practice in several countries to predict outcome after cardiac arrest.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Pooled analysis of the HLA-DRB1 by smoking interaction in Parkinson's disease</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Inflammatory response plays an important role in Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous studies have reported an association between human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-&lt;em&gt;DRB1&lt;/em&gt; and the risk of PD. There has also been growing interest in investigating whether inflammation-related genes interact with environmental factors such as smoking to influence PD risk. We performed a pooled analysis of the interaction between &lt;em&gt;HLA-DRB1&lt;/em&gt; and smoking in PD in three population-based case-control studies from Denmark and France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We included 2,056 cases and 2,723 controls from three PD studies (Denmark, France) that obtained information on smoking through interviews. Genotyping of the rs660895 polymorphism in the &lt;em&gt;HLA-DRB1&lt;/em&gt; region was based on saliva or blood DNA samples. To assess interactions, we used logistic regression with product terms between rs660895 and smoking. We performed random-effects meta-analysis of marginal associations and interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Both carrying rs660895-G (AG vs. AA: OR= 0.81; GG vs. AA: OR= 0.56; p-trend=0.003) and ever smoking (OR=0.56, p&amp;lt;0.001) were inversely associated with PD. A multiplicative interaction was observed between rs660895 and smoking using codominant, additive (interaction parameter=1.37, p=0.005), and dominant (interaction parameter=1.54, p=0.001) genetic models without any heterogeneity (I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0.0%): the inverse association of rs660895-(AG+GG) with PD seen in never smokers (OR=0.64, p&amp;lt;0.001) disappeared among ever smokers (OR=1.00, p=0.99). Similar interactions were observed when we investigated light and heavy smokers separately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Our study provides the first evidence that smoking modifies the previously reported inverse association of rs660895-G with PD, and suggests that smoking and &lt;em&gt;HLA-DRB1&lt;/em&gt; are involved in common pathways, possibly related to neuroinflammation.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flortaucipir (formerly &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-AV1451 or &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-T807) binds to neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but tissue studies assessing binding to tau aggregates in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) have yielded mixed results. We compared &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flortaucipir uptake in patients meeting clinical research criteria for PSP (N=33) to normal controls (N=46) and patients meeting criteria for Parkinson's disease (PD, N=26).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Participants underwent MRI and positron emission tomography for amyloid-β (&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C-PiB or &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-florbetapir) and tau (&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flortaucipir). &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flortaucipir Standardized Uptake Value Ratios were calculated (t=80-100 min, cerebellum gray matter reference). Voxelwise and region-of-interest group comparisons were performed in template space, with Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analyses to assess single-subject discrimination. Qualitative comparisons with postmortem tau are reported in one patient who died nine months after &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flortaucipir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Clinical PSP patients showed bilaterally elevated &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flortaucipir uptake in globus pallidus, putamen, subthalamic nucleus, midbrain and dentate nucleus relative to controls and PD patients (voxelwise p&amp;lt;0.05 family-wise-error-corrected). Globus pallidus binding best distinguished PSP patients from controls and PD (Area Under the Curve (AUC)=0.872 vs. controls, AUC=0.893 vs. PD). PSP clinical severity did not correlate with &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flortaucipir in any region. A patient with clinical PSP and pathological diagnosis of corticobasal degeneration had severe tau-pathology in PSP-related brain structures with good correspondence between &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flortaucipir and postmortem tau neuropathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flortaucipir uptake was elevated in PSP versus controls and PD patients in a pattern consistent with the expected distribution of tau pathology.

	<description>Inhibitory interneurons comprise a diverse subpopulation of cells that are critical to circuit function. How distinct inhibitory microcircuits control long-range projections remains poorly understood. A recent study by Lu and colleagues uncovered a unidirectional microcircuit of prefrontal chandelier cells that preferentially innervate and suppress long-range amygdala-projecting pyramidal cells.</description>

	<description>Self representation is fundamental to mental functions. While the self has mostly been studied in traditional psychophilosophical terms (‘self as subject’), recent laboratory work suggests that the self can be measured quantitatively by assessing biases towards self-associated stimuli (‘self as object’). Here, we summarize new quantitative paradigms for assessing the self, drawn from psychology, neuroeconomics, embodied cognition, and social neuroscience. We then propose a neural model of the self as an emerging property of interactions between a core ‘self network’ (e.g., medial prefrontal cortex; mPFC), a cognitive control network [e.g., dorsolateral (dl)PFC], and a salience network (e.g., insula).</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Computational model of brainstem circuit for state dependent control of hypoglossal motoneurons</title>

	<description>In patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) the pharyngeal muscles become relaxed during sleep, which leads to a partial or complete closure of upper airway. Empirical studies suggest that withdrawal of noradrenergic and serotonergic drives importantly contribute to depression of hypoglossal motoneurons during rapid eye-movement (REM) sleep and, therefore, may contribute to OSA pathophysiology; however, specific cellular and synaptic mechanisms remain unknown. It was recently suggested that, in order to explain experimental observations, the neuronal network for monoaminergic control of excitability of hypoglossal motoneurons has to include excitatory and inhibitory perihypoglossal interneurons that would mediate noradrenergic and serotonergic drives to the motoneurons. In this study, we applied a biophysical network model to validate the rationality of the proposed circuit and to investigate the dynamics of its neuronal populations during REM sleep-induced withdrawal of noradrenergic and serotonergic drives. The model mimicked state-dependent activity of the model hypoglossal motoneurons during simulated REM sleep with or without a virtual application of noradrenergic and serotonergic drugs was in qualitative agreement with in vivo data. The study predicts the dynamics of the perihypoglossal interneurons during these conditions and corroborates the hypothesis that the excitatory interneurons may integrate both noradrenergic and serotonergic drives. The latter drive has to be mediated by the inhibitory interneurons. The study suggests that perihypoglossal interneurons may serve as novel potential targets for pharmacological treatment of OSA.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Directed functional connectivity using dynamic graphical models</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/198887v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>There are a growing number of neuroimaging methods that model spatio-temporal patterns of brain activity to allow more meaningful characterizations of brain networks. However, directed relationships in networks are difficult to estimate, and only very few methods are available. Here, we consider a method for dynamic, directed functional connectivity: Dynamic graphical models (DGM) are a multivariate graphical model with dynamic, time-varying coefficients that describe instantaneous directed relationships between nodes. Parameter estimation and model selection are implemented by using Bayesian methods. A further benefit of DGM is that networks may contain loops. We use network simulations, human resting-state-fMRI (N = 500) and mouse fMRI (N = 16) to investigate the validity and reliability of the estimated networks. We simulated systematic lags of the hemodynamic response at different brain regions to investigate how these potentially bias directionality estimates. In the presence of such lag confounds (0.4-0.8 seconds offset between connected nodes), our method demonstrated sensitivity of 72%-77% and a specificity of 67% to detect the true direction. Stronger lag confounds reduced sensitivity, but did not increase false positives (i.e., directionality estimates of the opposite direction). On real data, we investigated the reliability of network estimates across and within subjects and found the DMN having inputs to cerebellar and limbic networks, as well as the reciprocal relationship between the visual medial and visual lateral network to be the most consistent relationships. Finally, we tested the method in mouse fMRI data and discovered a highly plausible relationship between areas in the hippocampus feeding to the cingulate cortex. We provide a computationally efficient implementation of DGM as a free software package (&quot;multdyn&quot;) for R.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Neural oscillations during conditional associative learning</title>

	<description>Associative learning requires mapping between complex stimuli and behavioural responses. When multiple stimuli are involved, conditional associative learning is a gradual process with learning based on trial and error. It is established that a distributed network of regions track associative learning, however the role of neural oscillations in human learning remains less clear. Here we used scalp EEG to test how neural oscillations change during learning of arbitrary visuo-motor associations. Participants learned to associative 48 different abstract shapes to one of four button responses through trial and error over repetitions of the shapes. To quantify how well the associations were learned for each trial, we used a state-space computational model of learning that provided a probability of each trial being correct given past performance for that stimulus, that we take as a measure of the strength of the association. We used linear modelling to relate single-trial neural oscillations to single-trial measures of association strength. We found frontal midline theta oscillations during the delay period tracked learning, where theta activity was strongest during the early stages of learning and declined as the associations were formed. Further, posterior alpha and low-beta oscillations in the cue period showed strong desynchronised activity early in learning, while stronger alpha activity during the delay period were seen as associations became well learned. Moreover, the magnitude of these effects during early learning, before the associations were learned, related to improvements in memory seen on the next presentation of the stimulus. The current study provides clear evidence that frontal theta and posterior alpha/beta oscillations play a key role during associative memory formation.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Occipital tACS bursts during a visual task impact ongoing neural oscillation power, coherence and LZW complexity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/198788v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Little is known about the precise neural mechanisms by which tACS affects the human cortex. Current hypothesis suggest that transcranial current stimulation (tCS) can directly enhance ongoing brain oscillations and induce long-lasting effects through the activation of synaptic plasticity mechanisms. Entrainment has been demonstrated in in-vitro studies, but its presence in non-invasive human studies is still under debate. Here, we aim to investigate the immediate and short-term effects of tACS bursts on the occipital cortex of participants engaged in a change-of-speed detection task, a task that has previously reported to have a clear physiology-behavior relationship, where trials with faster responses also have increased power in {gamma}-oscillations (50-80 Hz). The dominant brain oscillations related to the visual task are modulated using multichannel tACS at 10 and 70 Hz within occipital cortex. We found that tACS stimulation at 10 Hz (tACS10) enhanced both  (8-13 Hz) and {gamma} oscillations, in hand with an increase in reaction time (RT) in the change-of-speed detection visual task. On the other hand, tACS at 70Hz desynchronized visual cortices, impairing both phase-locked and endogenous {gamma}-power while increasing RT. While both tACS protocols seem to revert the relationship reported in [4], we argue that tACS produces a shift in attentional resources within visual cortex while leaving unaltered the resources required to conduct the task. This theory is supported by the fact that the correlation between fast RT and high {gamma}-power trials is maintained for tACS sessions too. Finally, we measured cortical excitability by analyzing Event-Related-Potentials (ERP) Lempel-Ziv-Welch Complexity (LZW). In control sessions we observe that lower {gamma}-LZW complexity correlates to faster reaction times. Both metrics are altered by tACS stimulation, as tACS10 decreased amplitude of the P300 peak, while increasing {gamma}-LZW complexity. To this end, our study highlights the nonlinear cross-frequency interaction between exogenous stimulation and endogenous brain dynamics, and proposes the use of complexity metrics, as LZW, to characterize excitability patterns of cortical areas in a behaviorally relevant timescale. These insights will hopefully contribute to the design of adaptive and personalized tACS protocols where cortical excitability can be characterized through complexity metrics.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Oscillatory Networks of High-Level Mental Alignment: A Perspective-Taking MEG Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/198747v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Mentally imagining another's perspective is a high-level social process, reliant on manipulating internal representations of the self in an embodied manner. Recently Wang et al., (1) showed that theta-band (3-7Hz) brain oscillations within the right temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ) and brain regions coding for motor/body schema contribute to the process of perspective-taking. Using a task requiring participants to engage in embodied perspective-taking, we set out to unravel the extended functional brain network and its connections in detail. We found that increasing the angle of disparity between self and other perspective was accompanied by longer reaction times and increases in theta power within rTPJ, right lateral pre-frontal cortex (PFC) and right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Using nonparametric Granger-causality, we showed that during later stages of perspective-taking, the lateral PFC and ACC exert top-down influences over rTPJ, indicative of executive control processes required for managing conflicts between self and other perspectives. Finally, we quantified patterns of whole-brain phase coupling (imaginary coherence) in relation to rTPJ during high-level perspective taking. Results suggest that rTPJ increases its theta-band phase synchrony with brain regions involved in mentalizing and regions coding for motor/body schema; whilst decreasing its synchrony to visual regions. Implications for neurocognitive models are discussed, and it is proposed that rTPJ acts as a 'hub' to route bottom-up visual information to internal representations of the self during perspective-taking, co-ordinated by theta-band oscillations. The self is then projected onto the other's perspective via embodied motor/body schema transformations, regulated by top-down cingulo-frontal activity.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A natural variant and an engineered mutation in a GPCR promote DEET resistance in C. elegans</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/198705v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) is a synthetic chemical, identified by the United States Department of Agriculture in 1946 in a screen for repellents to protect soldiers from mosquito-borne diseases. Since its discovery, DEET has become the world's most widely used arthropod repellent, and is effective against many invertebrates, including biting flies, honeybees, ticks, and land leeches. In insects, DEET acts on the olfactory system, and requires the olfactory receptor co-receptor orco, but its specific mechanism of action remains controversial. Here we show that the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is sensitive to DEET, and use this genetically-tractable animal to test repellent hypotheses from insects to understand how this synthetic compound is able to affect the behaviour of invertebrates separated by millions of years of evolution. We found that DEET is not a volatile repellent, but interfered selectively with chemotaxis to a variety of attractant and repellent molecules, and induced pausing to disrupt chemotaxis to some odours. In a forward genetic screen for DEET-resistant animals, we identified a single G-protein-coupled receptor, str-217, which is expressed in a single pair of DEET-responsive chemosensory neurons, ADL. Both engineered str-217 mutants and a wild isolate of C. elegans carrying a deletion in str-217 are DEET-resistant. DEET interferes with chemotaxis in an odour-selective manner by inducing an increase in average pause length during chemotaxis and exploration, and this increase in average pause length requires both str-217 and ADL neurons. Finally, we found that ADL is activated by DEET and optogenetic activation of ADL increased average pause length. This is consistent with the 'confusant' hypothesis, in which DEET is not a simple repellent but modulates multiple olfactory pathways and scrambles the behavioural response to otherwise attractive stimuli. Our results suggest a consistent motif for the effectiveness of DEET across widely divergent taxa: an effect on multiple chemosensory neurons to disrupt the pairing between odorant stimulus and behavioural response.</description>

	<description>Continuous attractor network models of grid formation posit that recurrent connectivity between grid cells controls their patterns of co-activation. Grid cells from a common module exhibit stable offsets in their periodic spatial tuning curves across environments, which may reflect recurrent connectivity or correlated sensory inputs. Here we explore whether cell-cell relationships predicted by attractor models persist during sleep states in which spatially informative sensory inputs are absent. We recorded ensembles of grid cells in superficial layers of medial entorhinal cortex during active exploratory behaviors and overnight sleep. Per pair and collectively, we found preserved patterns of spike-time correlations across waking, REM, and non-REM sleep, which reflected the spatial tuning offsets between these cells during active exploration. The preservation of cell-cell relationships across states was not explained by theta oscillations or CA1 activity. These results suggest that recurrent connectivity within the grid cell network drives grid cell activity across behavioral states.</description>

	<description>In studying the cellular interactions within complex tissues, it is extremely valuable to be able to reproducibly and flexibly target transgene expression to restricted subsets of cells. This approach is particularly valuable in studying the nervous system, with its bewildering diversity of neuronal cell types. We report here the generation of over 18,000 driver lines (the VT collection) that exploit the GAL4, LexA, and split-GAL4 systems to express transgenes in distinct and highly specific cell types in Drosophila. We document the expression patterns of over 14,000 of these lines in the adult male brain.</description>

	<description>The network of grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex forms a fixed reference frame for mapping physical space. The mechanistic origin of the grid representation is unknown, but continuous attractor network (CAN) models explain multiple fundamental features of grid-cell activity. An untested prediction of CAN grid models is that the grid-cell network should exhibit an activity correlation structure that transcends behavioural or brain states. By recording from MEC cell ensembles during navigation and sleep, we found that spatial phase offsets of grid cells predict arousal-state-independent spike rate correlations. Similarly, state-invariant correlations between conjunctive grid-head-direction and pure head-direction cells were predicted by their head-direction tuning offsets. Spike rates of grid cells were only weakly correlated across modules, and module scale relationships disintegrated during slow-save sleep, suggesting that modules function as independent attractor networks. Collectively, our observations suggest that network states in MEC are expressed universally across brain and behaviour states.</description>

	<description>Despite compelling evidence that glial cells could crucially regulate neural network activity, the vast majority of available neural simulators ignores the possible contribution of glia to neuronal physiology. Here, we show how to model glial physiology and neuron-glia interactions in the Brian 2 simulator. Brian 2 offers facilities to explicitly describe any model in mathematical terms with limited and simple simulator-specific syntax, automatically generating high-performance code from the user-provided descriptions. The flexibility of this approach allows us to model not only networks of neurons, but also individual glial cells, electrical coupling of glial cells, and the interaction between glial cells and synapses. We therefore conclude that Brian 2 provides an ideal platform to efficiently simulate glial physiology, and specifically, the influence of astrocytes on neural activity.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Discriminability of numerosity-evoked fMRI activity patterns in human intra-parietal cortex reflects behavioral numerical acuity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/198002v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Areas of the primate intraparietal cortex have been identified as an important substrate of numerical cognition. In human fMRI studies, activity patterns in these and other areas have allowed researchers to read out the numerosity a subject is viewing, but the relation of such decodable information with behavioral numerical proficiency remains unknown. Here, we estimated the precision of behavioral numerosity discrimination (internal Weber fraction) in twelve adult subjects based on psychophysical testing in a delayed numerosity comparison task outside the scanner. FMRI data were then recorded during a similar task, to obtain the accuracy with which the same sample numerosities could be read out from evoked brain activity patterns, as a measure of the precision of the neuronal representation. Sample numerosities were decodable in both early visual and intraparietal cortex with approximately equal accuracy on average. In parietal cortex, smaller numerosities were better discriminated than larger numerosities of the same ratio, paralleling smaller behavioral Weber fractions for smaller numerosities. Furthermore, in parietal but not early visual cortex, fMRI decoding performance was correlated with behavioral number discrimination acuity across subjects (subjects with a more precise behavioral Weber fraction measured prior to scanning showed greater discriminability of fMRI activity patterns in intraparietal cortex, and more specifically, the right LIP region). These results suggest a crucial role for intraparietal cortex in supporting a numerical representation which is explicitly read out for numerical decisions and behavior.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neural Architecture of Selective Stopping Strategies: Distinct Brain Activity Patterns Are Associated with Attentional Capture But Not with Outright Stopping</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/40/9785?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In stimulus-selective stop-signal tasks, the salient stop signal needs attentional processing before genuine response inhibition is completed. Differential prefrontal involvement in attentional capture and response inhibition has been linked to the right inferior frontal junction (IFJ) and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), respectively. Recently, it has been suggested that stimulus-selective stopping may be accomplished by the following different strategies: individuals may selectively inhibit their response only upon detecting a stop signal (independent discriminate then stop strategy) or unselectively whenever detecting a stop or attentional capture signal (stop then discriminate strategy). Alternatively, the discrimination process of the critical signal (stop vs attentional capture signal) may interact with the go process (dependent discriminate then stop strategy). Those different strategies might differentially involve attention- and stopping-related processes that might be implemented by divergent neural networks. This should lead to divergent activation patterns and, if disregarded, interfere with analyses in neuroimaging studies. To clarify this crucial issue, we studied 87 human participants of both sexes during a stimulus-selective stop-signal task and performed strategy-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging analyses. We found that, regardless of the strategy applied, outright stopping displayed indistinguishable brain activation patterns. However, during attentional capture different strategies resulted in divergent neural activation patterns with variable activation of right IFJ and bilateral VLPFC. In conclusion, the neural network involved in outright stopping is ubiquitous and independent of strategy, while different strategies impact on attention-related processes and underlying neural network usage. Strategic differences should therefore be taken into account particularly when studying attention-related processes in stimulus-selective stopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Dissociating inhibition from attention has been a major challenge for the cognitive neuroscience of executive functions. Selective stopping tasks have been instrumental in addressing this question. However, recent theoretical, cognitive and behavioral research suggests that different strategies are applied in successful execution of the task. The underlying strategy-dependent neural networks might differ substantially. Here, we show evidence that, regardless of the strategy used, the neural network involved in outright stopping is ubiquitous. However, significant differences can only be found in the attention-related processes underlying those different strategies. Thus, when studying attentional processing of salient stop signals, strategic differences should be considered. In contrast, the neural networks implementing outright stopping seem less or not at all affected by strategic differences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Reticulospinal Contributions to Gross Hand Function after Human Spinal Cord Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/40/9778?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multiple descending motor pathways likely contribute to the recovery of hand motor function following spinal cord injury (SCI). Reticulospinal neurons project to spinal motor neurons controlling hand muscles and extensively sprout into gray matter structures after SCI; therefore, it has been proposed that the reticulospinal tract is one of the descending motor pathways involved in recovery of hand function after injury. To test this hypothesis, we examined the StartReact response, an involuntary release of a planned movement via a startling stimulus that engages the reticulospinal tract, by measuring reaction times from electromyographic activity in an intrinsic finger muscle during three motor tasks requiring different degrees of hand dexterity: index finger abduction, a precision grip, and a power grip. Males and females with and without incomplete chronic cervical SCI were tested. We found that although SCI participants voluntarily responded to all tasks, reaction times were shorter during a startle cue while performing a power grip but not index finger abduction or precision grip. Control subjects had similarly shorter reaction times during a startle cue in all motor tasks. These results provide the first evidence for a contribution of the reticulospinal tract to hand control in humans with SCI during gross finger manipulations and suggest that this contribution is less pronounced during fine dexterous finger movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It has been long proposed that brainstem pathways contribute to the recovery of hand function in humans with spinal cord injury (SCI). Here, we show that individuals with anatomically incomplete chronic cervical SCI responded to a startle stimulus, a test that engages the reticulospinal tract, while performing a power grip but not during index finger abduction or precision grip. Control subjects responded to a startle stimulus similarly across tasks. These observations suggest that reticulospinal outputs after SCI contribute to hand motor tasks involving gross finger movements. Interestingly, this contribution is less pronounced during fine dexterous finger movements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Content-Specific Codes of Parametric Vibrotactile Working Memory in Humans</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/40/9771?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;To understand how the brain handles mentally represented information flexibly in the absence of sensory stimulation, working memory (WM) studies have been essential. A seminal finding in monkey research is that neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) retain stimulus-specific information when vibrotactile frequencies were memorized. A direct mapping between monkey studies and human research is still controversial. Although oscillatory signatures, in terms of frequency-dependent parametric beta-band modulation, have been observed recently in human EEG studies, the content specificity of these representations in terms of multivariate pattern analysis has not yet been shown. Here, we used fMRI in combination with multivariate classification techniques to determine which brain regions retain information during WM. In a retro-cue delayed-match-to-sample task, human subjects memorized the frequency of vibrotactile stimulation over a 12 s delay phase. Using an assumption-free whole-brain searchlight approach, we tested with support vector regression which brain regions exhibited multivariate parametric WM codes of the maintained frequencies during the WM delay. Interestingly, our analysis revealed an overlap with regions previously identified in monkeys composed of bilateral premotor cortices, supplementary motor area, and the right inferior frontal gyrus as part of the PFC. Therefore, our results establish a link between the WM codes found in monkeys and those in humans and emphasize the importance of the PFC for information maintenance during WM also in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Working memory (WM) research in monkeys has identified a network of regions, including prefrontal regions, to code stimulus-specific information when vibrotactile frequencies are memorized. Here, we performed an fMRI study during which human subjects had to memorize vibratory frequencies in parallel to previous monkey research. Using an assumption-free, whole-brain searchlight decoding approach, we identified for the first time regions in the human brain that exhibit multivariate patterns of activity to code the vibratory frequency parametrically during WM. Our results parallel previous monkey findings and show that the supplementary motor area, premotor, and the right prefrontal cortex are involved in vibrotactile WM coding in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Nigral Glutamatergic Neurons Control the Speed of Locomotion</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) plays a crucial role in locomotor control. In vertebrates, stimulation of the MLR at increasing intensities elicits locomotion of growing speed. This effect has been presumed to result from higher brain inputs activating the MLR like a dimmer switch. Here, we show in lampreys (&lt;i&gt;Petromyzon marinus&lt;/i&gt;) of either sex that incremental stimulation of a region homologous to the mammalian substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) evokes increasing activation of MLR cells with a graded increase in the frequency of locomotor movements. Neurons co-storing glutamate and dopamine were found to project from the primal SNc to the MLR. Blockade of glutamatergic transmission largely diminished MLR cell responses and locomotion. Local blockade of D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in the MLR decreased locomotor frequency, but did not disrupt the SNc-evoked graded control of locomotion. Our findings revealed the presence of a glutamatergic input to the MLR originating from the primal SNc that evokes graded locomotor movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) plays a crucial role in the control of locomotion. It projects downward to reticulospinal neurons that in turn activate the spinal locomotor networks. Increasing the intensity of MLR stimulation produces a growing activation of reticulospinal cells and a progressive increase in the speed of locomotor movements. Since the discovery of the MLR some 50 years ago, it has been presumed that higher brain regions activate the MLR in a graded fashion, but this has not been confirmed yet. Here, using a combination of techniques from cell to behavior, we provide evidence of a new glutamatergic pathway activating the MLR in a graded fashion, and consequently evoking a progressive increase in locomotor output.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Increased GSNOR Expression during Aging Impairs Cognitive Function and Decreases S-Nitrosation of CaMKII{alpha}</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/40/9741?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/40/9741?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;As the population ages, an increasing number of people suffer from age-related cognitive impairment. However, the mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear. Here, we found that S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR), the key enzyme that metabolizes intracellular nitric oxide (NO) and regulates S-nitrosation, was significantly increased in the hippocampus of both aging humans and mice. Transgenic mice overexpressing GSNOR exclusively in neurons showed cognitive impairment in behavioral tests, including the Morris water maze, fear conditioning, and the Y-maze test. We also found that &lt;i&gt;GSNOR&lt;/i&gt; transgenic mice have LTP defects and lower dendrite spine density, whereas &lt;i&gt;GSNOR&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mice rescued the age-related cognitive impairment. Analysis of S-nitrosation showed significantly decreased hippocampal CaMKIIα S-nitrosation in naturally aged mice and &lt;i&gt;GSNOR&lt;/i&gt; transgenic mice. Consistent with the change in CaMKIIα S-nitrosation, the accumulation of CaMKIIα in the hippocampal synaptosomal fraction, as well as its downstream signaling targets p(S831)-GLUR1, was also significantly decreased. All these effects could be rescued in the &lt;i&gt;GSNOR&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mice. We further verified that the S-nitrosation of CaMKIIα was responsible for the CaMKIIα synaptosomal accumulation by mutating CaMKIIα S-nitrosated sites (C280/C289). Upregulation of the NO signaling pathway rescued the cognitive impairment in &lt;i&gt;GSNOR&lt;/i&gt; transgenic mice. In summary, our research demonstrates that GSNOR impairs cognitive function in aging and it could serve as a new potential target for the treatment of age-related cognitive impairment. In contrast to the free radical theory of aging, NO signaling deficiency may be the main mediator of age-related cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study indicated that S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR), a key protein S-nitrosation metabolic enzyme, is a new potential target in age-related cognitive impairment; and in contrast to the free radical theory of aging, NO signaling deficiency may be the main cause of this process. In addition, increased GSNOR expression during aging decreases S-nitrosation of CaMKIIα and reduces CaMKIIα synaptosomal accumulation. To our knowledge, it is for the first time to show the cellular function regulation of CaMKIIα by GSNOR-dependent S-nitrosation as a new post-translational modification after its phosphorylation was explored. These findings elucidate a novel mechanism of age-related cognitive impairment and may provide a new potential target and strategy for slowing down this process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Limited Contribution of Primary Motor Cortex in Eye-Hand Coordination: A TMS Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/40/9730?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to track a moving target with the eye is substantially improved when the target is self-moved compared with when it is moved by an external agent. To account for this observation, it has been postulated that the oculomotor system has access to hand efference copy, thereby allowing to predict the motion of the visual target. Along this scheme, we tested the effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the hand area of the primary motor cortex (M1) when human participants (50% females) are asked to track with their eyes a visual target whose horizontal motion is driven by their grip force. We reasoned that, if the output of M1 is used by the oculomotor system to keep track of the target, on top of inducing short latency disturbance of grip force, single-pulse TMS should also quickly disrupt ongoing eye motion. For comparison purposes, the effect of TMS over M1 was monitored when subjects tracked an externally moved target (while keeping their hand at rest or not). In both cases, results showed no alterations in smooth pursuit, meaning that its velocity was unaffected within the 25–125 ms epoch that followed TMS. Overall, our results imply that the output of M1 has limited contribution in driving the eye motion during our eye-hand coordination task. This study suggests that, if hand motor signals are accessed by the oculomotor system, this is upstream of M1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The ability to coordinate eye and hand actions is central in everyday activity. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this coordination remain to be clarified. A leading hypothesis is that the oculomotor system has access to hand motor signals. Here we explored this possibility by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the hand area of the primary motor cortex (M1) when humans tracked with the eyes a visual target that was moved by the hand. As expected, ongoing hand action was perturbed 25–30 ms after TMS, but our results fail to show any disruption of eye motion, smooth pursuit velocity being unaffected. This work suggests that, if hand motor signals are accessed by the oculomotor system, this is upstream of M1.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Reward-Related Ventral Striatum Activity Buffers against the Experience of Depressive Symptoms Associated with Sleep Disturbances</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/40/9724?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sleep disturbances represent one risk factor for depression. Reward-related brain function, particularly the activity of the ventral striatum (VS), has been identified as a potential buffer against stress-related depression. We were therefore interested in testing whether reward-related VS activity would moderate the effect of sleep disturbances on depression in a large cohort of young adults. Data were available from 1129 university students (mean age 19.71 ± 1.25 years; 637 women) who completed a reward-related functional MRI task to assay VS activity and provided self-reports of sleep using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and symptoms of depression using a summation of the General Distress/Depression and Anhedonic Depression subscales of the Mood and Anxiety Symptoms Questionnaire-short form. Analyses revealed that as VS activity increased the association between sleep disturbances and depressive symptoms decreased. The interaction between sleep disturbances and VS activity was robust to the inclusion of sex, age, race/ethnicity, past or present clinical disorder, early and recent life stress, and anxiety symptoms, as well as the interactions between VS activity and early or recent life stress as covariates. We provide initial evidence that high reward-related VS activity may buffer against depressive symptoms associated with poor sleep. Our analyses help advance an emerging literature supporting the importance of individual differences in reward-related brain function as a potential biomarker of relative risk for depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Sleep disturbances are a common risk factor for depression. An emerging literature suggests that reward-related activity of the ventral striatum (VS), a brain region critical for motivation and goal-directed behavior, may buffer against the effect of negative experiences on the development of depression. Using data from a large sample of 1129 university students we demonstrate that as reward-related VS activity increases, the link between sleep disturbances and depression decreases. This finding contributes to accumulating research demonstrating that reward-related brain function may be a useful biomarker of relative risk for depression in the context of negative experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Suppression of Striatal Prediction Errors by the Prefrontal Cortex in Placebo Hypoalgesia</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Classical learning theories predict extinction after the discontinuation of reinforcement through prediction errors. However, placebo hypoalgesia, although mediated by associative learning, has been shown to be resistant to extinction. We tested the hypothesis that this is mediated by the suppression of prediction error processing through the prefrontal cortex (PFC). We compared pain modulation through treatment cues (placebo hypoalgesia, treatment context) with pain modulation through stimulus intensity cues (stimulus context) during functional magnetic resonance imaging in 48 male and female healthy volunteers. During acquisition, our data show that expectations are correctly learned and that this is associated with prediction error signals in the ventral striatum (VS) in both contexts. However, in the nonreinforced test phase, pain modulation and expectations of pain relief persisted to a larger degree in the treatment context, indicating that the expectations were not correctly updated in the treatment context. Consistently, we observed significantly stronger neural prediction error signals in the VS in the stimulus context compared with the treatment context. A connectivity analysis revealed negative coupling between the anterior PFC and the VS in the treatment context, suggesting that the PFC can suppress the expression of prediction errors in the VS. Consistent with this, a participant's conceptual views and beliefs about treatments influenced the pain modulation only in the treatment context. Our results indicate that in placebo hypoalgesia contextual treatment information engages prefrontal conceptual processes, which can suppress prediction error processing in the VS and lead to reduced updating of treatment expectancies, resulting in less extinction of placebo hypoalgesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In aversive and appetitive reinforcement learning, learned effects show extinction when reinforcement is discontinued. This is thought to be mediated by prediction errors (i.e., the difference between expectations and outcome). Although reinforcement learning has been central in explaining placebo hypoalgesia, placebo hypoalgesic effects show little extinction and persist after the discontinuation of reinforcement. Our results support the idea that conceptual treatment beliefs bias the neural processing of expectations in a treatment context compared with a more stimulus-driven processing of expectations with stimulus intensity cues. We provide evidence that this is associated with the suppression of prediction error processing in the ventral striatum by the prefrontal cortex. This provides a neural basis for persisting effects in reinforcement learning and placebo hypoalgesia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Action Potential Broadening in Capsaicin-Sensitive DRG Neurons from Frequency-Dependent Reduction of Kv3 Current</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/40/9705?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Action potential (AP) shape is a key determinant of cellular electrophysiological behavior. We found that in small-diameter, capsaicin-sensitive dorsal root ganglia neurons corresponding to nociceptors (from rats of either sex), stimulation at frequencies as low as 1 Hz produced progressive broadening of the APs. Stimulation at 10 Hz for 3 s resulted in an increase in AP width by an average of 76 ± 7% at 22°C and by 38 ± 3% at 35°C. AP clamp experiments showed that spike broadening results from frequency-dependent reduction of potassium current during spike repolarization. The major current responsible for frequency-dependent reduction of overall spike-repolarizing potassium current was identified as Kv3 current by its sensitivity to low concentrations of 4-aminopyridine (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt;100 μm) and block by the peptide inhibitor blood depressing substance I (BDS-I). There was a small component of Kv1-mediated current during AP repolarization, but this current did not show frequency-dependent reduction. In a small fraction of cells, there was a component of calcium-dependent potassium current that showed frequency-dependent reduction, but the contribution to overall potassium current reduction was almost always much smaller than that of Kv3-mediated current. These results show that Kv3 channels make a major contribution to spike repolarization in small-diameter DRG neurons and undergo frequency-dependent reduction, leading to spike broadening at moderate firing frequencies. Spike broadening from frequency-dependent reduction in Kv3 current could mitigate the frequency-dependent decreases in conduction velocity typical of C-fiber axons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Small-diameter dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons mediating nociception and other sensory modalities express many types of potassium channels, but how they combine to control firing patterns and conduction is not well understood. We found that action potentials of small-diameter rat DRG neurons showed spike broadening at frequencies as low as 1 Hz and that spike broadening resulted predominantly from frequency-dependent inactivation of Kv3 channels. Spike width helps to control transmitter release, conduction velocity, and firing patterns and understanding the role of particular potassium channels can help to guide new pharmacological strategies for targeting pain-sensing neurons selectively.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Memantine and Ketamine Differentially Alter NMDA Receptor Desensitization</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/40/9686?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/40/9686?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Memantine and ketamine are clinically useful NMDA receptor (NMDAR) open channel blockers that inhibit NMDARs with similar potency and kinetics, but display vastly different clinical profiles. This discrepancy has been hypothesized to result from inhibition by memantine and ketamine of overlapping but distinct NMDAR subpopulations. For example, memantine but not ketamine may inhibit extrasynaptic NMDARs more effectively than synaptic NMDARs. However, the basis for preferential NMDAR inhibition depending on subcellular location has not been investigated systematically. We integrated recordings from heterologously expressed single NMDAR subtypes, kinetic modeling, and recordings of synaptically evoked NMDAR responses in acute brain slices to investigate mechanisms by which channel blockers may distinguish NMDAR subpopulations. We found that memantine and ketamine differentially alter NMDAR desensitization and that memantine stabilizes a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent desensitized state. As a result, inhibition by memantine of GluN1/2A receptors in tsA201 cells and of native synaptic NMDARs in cortical pyramidal neurons from mice of either sex increased in conditions that enhanced intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; accumulation. Therefore, differential inhibition by memantine and ketamine based on NMDAR location is likely to result from location dependence of the intensity and duration of NMDAR activation. Modulation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent NMDAR desensitization is an unexplored mechanism of inhibitory action with the potential to endow drugs with NMDAR selectivity that leads to superior clinical profiles. Our results suggest that designing compounds to target specific receptor states, rather than specific receptor types, may be a viable strategy for future drug development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Memantine and ketamine are NMDA receptor (NMDAR) channel-blocking drugs with divergent clinical effects. Understanding mechanistically their differential actions may advance our understanding of nervous system disorders and suggest strategies for the design of more effective drugs. Here, we show that memantine and ketamine have contrasting effects on NMDAR desensitization. Ketamine binding decreases occupancy of desensitized states of the GluN1/2B NMDAR subtype. In contrast, memantine binding increases occupancy of GluN1/2A and native NMDAR desensitized states entered after accumulation of intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, a novel inhibitory mechanism. These properties may contribute to inhibition of distinct NMDAR subpopulations by memantine and ketamine and help to explain their differential clinical effects. Our results suggest stabilization of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent desensitized states as a new strategy for pharmaceutical neuroprotection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Prior Learning of Relevant Nonaversive Information Is a Boundary Condition for Avoidance Memory Reconsolidation in the Rat Hippocampus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/40/9675?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/40/9675?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Reactivated memories can be modified during reconsolidation, making this process a potential therapeutic target for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a mental illness characterized by the recurring avoidance of situations that evoke trauma-related fears. However, avoidance memory reconsolidation depends on a set of still loosely defined boundary conditions, limiting the translational value of basic research. In particular, the involvement of the hippocampus in fear-motivated avoidance memory reconsolidation remains controversial. Combining behavioral and electrophysiological analyses in male Wistar rats, we found that previous learning of relevant nonaversive information is essential to elicit the participation of the hippocampus in avoidance memory reconsolidation, which is associated with an increase in theta- and gamma-oscillation power and cross-frequency coupling in dorsal CA1 during reactivation of the avoidance response. Our results indicate that the hippocampus is involved in memory reconsolidation only when reactivation results in contradictory representations regarding the consequences of avoidance and suggest that robust nesting of hippocampal theta–gamma rhythms at the time of retrieval is a specific reconsolidation marker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by maladaptive avoidance responses to stimuli or behaviors that represent or bear resemblance to some aspect of a traumatic experience. Disruption of reconsolidation, the process by which reactivated memories become susceptible to modifications, is a promising approach for treating PTSD patients. However, much of what is known about fear-motivated avoidance memory reconsolidation derives from studies based on fear conditioning instead of avoidance-learning paradigms. Using a step-down inhibitory avoidance task in rats, we found that the hippocampus is involved in memory reconsolidation only when the animals acquired the avoidance response in an environment that they had previously learned as safe and showed that increased theta- and gamma-oscillation coupling during reactivation is an electrophysiological signature of this process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Distinct Patterns of Temporal and Directional Connectivity among Intrinsic Networks in the Human Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/40/9667?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/40/9667?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;To determine the spatiotemporal relationships among intrinsic networks of the human brain, we recruited seven neurosurgical patients (four males and three females) who were implanted with intracranial depth electrodes. We first identified canonical resting-state networks at the individual subject level using an iterative matching procedure on each subject's resting-state fMRI data. We then introduced single electrical pulses to fMRI pre-identified nodes of the default network (DN), frontoparietal network (FPN), and salience network (SN) while recording evoked responses in other recording sites within the same networks. We found bidirectional signal flow across the three networks, albeit with distinct patterns of evoked responses within different time windows. We used a data-driven clustering approach to show that stimulation of the FPN and SN evoked a rapid (&amp;lt;70 ms) response that was predominantly higher within the SN sites, whereas stimulation of the DN led to sustained responses in later time windows (85–200 ms). Stimulations in the medial temporal lobe components of the DN evoked relatively late effects (&amp;gt;130 ms) in other nodes of the DN, as well as FPN and SN. Our results provide temporal information about the patterns of signal flow between intrinsic networks that provide insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics that are likely to constrain the architecture of the brain networks supporting human cognition and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Despite great progress in the functional neuroimaging of the human brain, we still do not know the precise set of rules that define the patterns of temporal organization between large-scale networks of the brain. In this study, we stimulated and then recorded electrical evoked potentials within and between three large-scale networks of the brain, the default network (DN), frontoparietal network (FPN), and salience network (SN), in seven subjects undergoing invasive neurosurgery. Using a data-driven clustering approach, we observed distinct temporal and directional patterns between the three networks, with FPN and SN activity predominant in early windows and DN stimulation affecting the network in later windows. These results provide important temporal information about the interactions between brain networks supporting human cognition and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Overdominant Effect of a CHRNA4 Polymorphism on Cingulo-Opercular Network Activity and Cognitive Control</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/40/9657?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The nicotinic system plays an important role in cognitive control and is implicated in several neuropsychiatric conditions. However, the contributions of genetic variability in this system to individuals' cognitive control abilities are poorly understood and the brain processes that mediate such genetic contributions remain largely unidentified. In this first large-scale neuroimaging genetics study of the human nicotinic receptor system (two cohorts, males and females, fMRI total &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 1586, behavioral total &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 3650), we investigated a common polymorphism of the high-affinity nicotinic receptor α4β2 (rs1044396 on the &lt;i&gt;CHRNA4&lt;/i&gt; gene) previously implicated in behavioral and nicotine-related studies (albeit with inconsistent major/minor allele impacts). Based on our prior neuroimaging findings, we expected this polymorphism to affect neural activity in the cingulo-opercular (CO) network involved in core cognitive control processes including maintenance of alertness. Consistent across the cohorts, all cortical areas of the CO network showed higher activity in heterozygotes compared with both types of homozygotes during cognitive engagement. This inverted U-shaped relation reflects an overdominant effect; that is, allelic interaction (cumulative evidence &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 1.33 * 10&lt;sup&gt;–5&lt;/sup&gt;). Furthermore, heterozygotes performed more accurately in behavioral tasks that primarily depend on sustained alertness. No effects were observed for haplotypes of the surrounding &lt;i&gt;CHRNA4&lt;/i&gt; region, supporting a true overdominant effect at rs1044396. As a possible mechanism, we observed that this polymorphism is an expression quantitative trait locus modulating &lt;i&gt;CHRNA4&lt;/i&gt; expression levels. This is the first report of overdominance in the nicotinic system. These findings connect &lt;i&gt;CHRNA4&lt;/i&gt; genotype, CO network activation, and sustained alertness, providing insights into how genetics shapes individuals' cognitive control abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The nicotinic acetylcholine system plays a central role in neuromodulatory regulation of cognitive control processes and is dysregulated in several neuropsychiatric disorders. Despite this functional importance, no large-scale neuroimaging genetics studies have targeted the contributions of genetic variability in this system to human brain activity. Here, we show the impact of a common polymorphism of the high-affinity nicotinic receptor α4β2 that is consistent across brain activity and behavior in two large human cohorts. We report a hitherto unknown overdominant effect (allelic interaction) at this locus, where the heterozygotes show higher activity in the cingulo-opercular network underlying alertness maintenance and higher behavioral alertness performance than both homozygous groups. This gene–brain–behavior relationship informs about the biological basis of interindividual differences in cognitive control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: How Human Amygdala and Bed Nucleus of the Stria Terminalis May Drive Distinct Defensive Responses</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/40/9645?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to adaptively regulate responses to the proximity of potential danger is critical to survival and imbalance in this system may contribute to psychopathology. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is implicated in defensive responding during uncertain threat anticipation whereas the amygdala may drive responding upon more acute danger. This functional dissociation between the BNST and amygdala is however controversial, and human evidence scarce. Here we used data from two independent functional magnetic resonance imaging studies [&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 108 males and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 70 (45 females)] to probe how coordination between the BNST and amygdala may regulate responses during shock anticipation and actual shock confrontation. In a subset of participants from Sample 2 (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 48) we demonstrate that anticipation and confrontation evoke bradycardic and tachycardic responses, respectively. Further, we show that in each sample when going from shock anticipation to the moment of shock confrontation neural activity shifted from a region anatomically consistent with the BNST toward the amygdala. Comparisons of functional connectivity during threat processing showed overlapping yet also consistently divergent functional connectivity profiles for the BNST and amygdala. Finally, childhood maltreatment levels predicted amygdala, but not BNST, hyperactivity during shock anticipation. Our results support an evolutionary conserved, defensive distance-dependent dynamic balance between BNST and amygdala activity. Shifts in this balance may enable shifts in defensive reactions via the demonstrated differential functional connectivity. Our results indicate that early life stress may tip the neural balance toward acute threat responding and via that route predispose for affective disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Previously proposed differential contributions of the BNST and amygdala to fear and anxiety have been recently debated. Despite the significance of understanding their contributions to defensive reactions, there is a paucity of human studies that directly compared these regions on activity and connectivity during threat processing. We show strong evidence for a dissociable role of the BNST and amygdala in threat processing by demonstrating in two large participant samples that they show a distinct temporal signature of threat responding as well as a discriminable pattern of functional connections and differential sensitivity to early life threat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: KLF9 and JNK3 Interact to Suppress Axon Regeneration in the Adult CNS</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/40/9632?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurons in the adult mammalian CNS decrease in intrinsic axon growth capacity during development in concert with changes in Krüppel-like transcription factors (KLFs). KLFs regulate axon growth in CNS neurons including retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Here, we found that knock-down of KLF9, an axon growth suppressor that is normally upregulated 250-fold in RGC development, promotes long-distance optic nerve regeneration in adult rats of both sexes. We identified a novel binding partner, MAPK10/JNK3 kinase, and found that JNK3 (c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3) is critical for KLF9's axon-growth-suppressive activity. Interfering with a JNK3-binding domain or mutating two newly discovered serine phosphorylation acceptor sites, Ser106 and Ser110, effectively abolished KLF9's neurite growth suppression &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and promoted axon regeneration &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. These findings demonstrate a novel, physiologic role for the interaction of KLF9 and JNK3 in regenerative failure in the optic nerve and suggest new therapeutic strategies to promote axon regeneration in the adult CNS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Injured CNS nerves fail to regenerate spontaneously. Promoting intrinsic axon growth capacity has been a major challenge in the field. Here, we demonstrate that knocking down Krüppel-like transcription factor 9 (KLF9) via shRNA promotes long-distance axon regeneration after optic nerve injury and uncover a novel and important KLF9–JNK3 interaction that contributes to axon growth suppression &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and regenerative failure &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. These studies suggest potential therapeutic approaches to promote axon regeneration in injury and other degenerative diseases in the adult CNS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Glucosylsphingosine Promotes {alpha}-Synuclein Pathology in Mutant GBA-Associated Parkinson's Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Glucocerebrosidase 1 (&lt;i&gt;GBA&lt;/i&gt;) mutations responsible for Gaucher disease (GD) are the most common genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). Although the genetic link between GD and PD is well established, the underlying molecular mechanism(s) are not well understood. We propose that glucosylsphingosine, a sphingolipid accumulating in GD, mediates PD pathology in &lt;i&gt;GBA&lt;/i&gt;-associated PD. We show that, whereas GD-related sphingolipids (glucosylceramide, glucosylsphingosine, sphingosine, sphingosine-1-phosphate) promote α-synuclein aggregation &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, glucosylsphingosine triggers the formation of oligomeric α-synuclein species capable of templating in human cells and neurons. Using newly generated GD/PD mouse lines of either sex [&lt;i&gt;Gba&lt;/i&gt; mutant (N370S, L444P, KO) crossed to α-synuclein transgenics], we show that &lt;i&gt;Gba&lt;/i&gt; mutations predispose to PD through a loss-of-function mechanism. We further demonstrate that glucosylsphingosine specifically accumulates in young GD/PD mouse brain. With age, brains exhibit glucosylceramide accumulations colocalized with α-synuclein pathology. These findings indicate that glucosylsphingosine promotes pathological aggregation of α-synuclein, increasing PD risk in GD patients and carriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in the aging population. Glucocerebrosidase 1 mutations, which cause Gaucher disease, are the most common genetic risk factor for PD, underscoring the importance of delineating the mechanisms underlying mutant &lt;i&gt;GBA&lt;/i&gt;-associated PD. We show that lipids accumulating in Gaucher disease, especially glucosylsphingosine, play a key role in PD pathology in the brain. These data indicate that ASAH1 (acid ceramidase 1) and GBA2 (glucocerebrosidase 2) enzymes that mediate glucosylsphingosine production and metabolism are attractive therapeutic targets for treating mutant &lt;i&gt;GBA&lt;/i&gt;-associated PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Spinocerebellar Ataxia 38 (SCA38) is caused by mutations in the &lt;em&gt;ELOVL5&lt;/em&gt; gene, which encodes an elongase involved in the synthesis of polyunsatured fatty acids, including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). As a consequence, DHA is significantly reduced in the serum of SCA38 subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the present study, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of DHA supplementation on clinical symptoms and changes of brain functional imaging in SCA38 patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We enrolled ten SCA38 patients, and we carried out a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled study for 16 weeks, followed by an open-label study with overall 40-week DHA treatment. At baseline, and at follow-up visit, patients underwent standardised clinical assessment, brain 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET), electroneurography (ENG), and &lt;em&gt;ELOVL5&lt;/em&gt; expression analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: After 16 weeks, we showed a significant pre-post clinical improvement in the DHA group vs. placebo (mean difference, MD), using the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) (MD=+2.70, 95%CI: +0.13 to +5.27, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;=0.042). At 40-week treatment, clinical improvement was found significant both in SARA (MD=+2.2, 95%CI: +0.93 to +3.46, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;=0.008) and International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) (MD= +3.8, 95%CI: +1.39 to +6.41, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;=0.02) scores; clinical data were corroborated by significant improvement of cerebellar hypometabolism (statistical parametric mapping analyses, False Discovery Rate corrected). We also showed a decreased expression of &lt;em&gt;ELOVL5&lt;/em&gt; in patients' blood at 40 weeks as compared to baseline. No side effect was recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: DHA supplementation is a safe and effective treatment for SCA38, showing an improvement of clinical symptoms and cerebellar hypometabolism.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) remains both oversuspected on clinical grounds and underconfirmed when based on immediate and sustained response to cerebrospinal fluid diversion. Poor long-term postshunt benefits and findings of neurodegenerative pathology in most patients with adequate follow-up suggest that hydrocephalic disorders appearing in late adulthood may often result from initially unapparent parenchymal abnormalities. We critically review the NPH literature, highlighting the near universal lack of blinding and controls, absence of specific clinical, imaging, or pathological features, and ongoing dependence for diagnostic confirmation on variable cutoffs of gait response to bedside fluid-drainage testing. We also summarize our long-term institutional experience, in which postshunt benefits in patients with initial diagnosis of idiopathic NPH persist in only 32% of patients at 36 months, with known revised diagnosis in over 25% (Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and progressive supranuclear palsy). We postulate that previously reported NPH cases with “dual” pathology (ie, developing a “second” disorder) more likely represent ventriculomegalic presentations of selected neurodegenerative disorders in which benefits from shunting may be short-lived, with a consequently unfavorable risk-benefit ratio.

As an alternative to AEDs, novel therapies based on cell transplantation offer an opportunity for long-lasting modification of epileptic circuits. To develop such a treatment requires careful preclinical studies in a chronic epilepsy model featuring unprovoked seizures, hippocampal histopathology, and behavioral comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25021-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transplantation of progenitor cells from embryonic medial or caudal ganglionic eminence (MGE, CGE) were made in a well-characterized mouse model of status epilepticus-induced epilepsy (systemic pilocarpine). Behavioral testing (handling and open field), continuous video-electroencephalographic (vEEG) monitoring, and slice electrophysiology outcomes were obtained up to 270 days after transplantation (DAT). Post-hoc immunohistochemistry was used to confirm cell identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In these same mice, an 84% to 88% reduction in seizure activity was observed between 180 and 210 DAT. Inhibitory postsynaptic current frequency, measured on pyramidal neurons in acute hippocampal slices at 270 DAT, was reduced in epileptic mice but restored to naïve levels in epileptic mice receiving MGE transplants. No reduction in seizure activity was observed in epileptic mice receiving intrahippocampal CGE progenitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The onset and development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is closely associated
with the failure to eliminate waste from the brain. The mechanisms behind this
waste clearance remain largely unclear, however research suggests a strong link
with the cerebral vasculature. Here we demonstrate computational evidence for a
mechanism for cerebral waste clearance that is driven by functional hyperaemia,
that is, the dilation of cerebral arteries as a consequence of increased
neuronal demand. This mechanism is based on our model for fluid flow through
the vascular basement membrane. It accounts for waste clearance rates observed
in mouse experiments and aligns with pathological observations as well as
recommendations to lower the individual risk of AD, such as keeping mentally
and physically active.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Global Brain Dynamics During Social Exclusion Predict Subsequent Behavioral Conformity. (arXiv:1710.00869v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Individuals react differently to social experiences; for example, people who
are more sensitive to negative social experiences, such as being excluded, may
be more likely to adapt their behavior to fit in with others. We examined
whether functional brain connectivity during social exclusion in the fMRI
scanner can be used to predict subsequent conformity to peer norms. Adolescent
males (N = 57) completed a two-part study on teen driving risk: a social
exclusion task (Cyberball) during an fMRI session and a subsequent driving
simulator session in which they drove alone and in the presence of a peer who
expressed risk-averse or risk-accepting driving norms. We computed the
difference in functional connectivity between social exclusion and social
inclusion from each node in the brain to nodes in two brain networks, one
previously associated with mentalizing (medial prefrontal cortex,
temporoparietal junction, precuneus, temporal poles) and another with social
pain (anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula). Using cross-validated
machine learning, this measure of global network connectivity during exclusion
predicts the extent of conformity to peer pressure during driving in the
subsequent experimental session. These findings extend our understanding of how
global neural dynamics guide social behavior, revealing functional network
activity that captures individual differences.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Developmental increases in white matter network controllability support a growing diversity of brain dynamics. (arXiv:1607.01010v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01010</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;As the human brain develops, it increasingly supports coordinated control of
neural activity. The mechanism by which white matter evolves to support this
coordination is not well understood. We use a network representation of
diffusion imaging data from 882 youth ages 8 to 22 to show that white matter
connectivity becomes increasingly optimized for a diverse range of predicted
dynamics in development. Notably, stable controllers in subcortical areas are
negatively related to cognitive performance. Investigating structural
mechanisms supporting these changes, we simulate network evolution with a set
of growth rules. We find that all brain networks are structured in a manner
highly optimized for network control, with distinct control mechanisms
predicted in child versus older youth. We demonstrate that our results cannot
be simply explained by changes in network modularity. This work reveals a
possible mechanism of human brain development that preferentially optimizes
dynamic network control over static network architecture.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: When Less is More: Enhanced Statistical Learning After Disruption of Bilateral DLPFC</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/198515v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/198515v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Human learning depends on multiple cognitive systems related to dissociable brain structures. These systems interact not only in cooperative but also in competitive ways in optimizing performance. Previous studies have shown that manipulations reducing the engagement of frontal lobe-mediated control and attentional processes can lead to improved performance in striatum-related learning processes. These studies, however, used correlational methods only. The aim of the present study was to directly test the causal role of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in striatum-mediated implicit statistical learning and its consolidation using brain stimulation. Healthy young adults were trained on a probabilistic sequence learning task. 1 Hz transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or sham stimulation of both the left and right dorsolateral PFCs (DLPFC) was applied intermittently during the learning session to disrupt frontal lobe functions. To assess the lasting effects of TMS on learning and consolidation, statistical learning performance (i.e., increased reaction times for sequences with high as compared to low probabilities) was tested ten minutes, two hours, and 24 hours later. In line with the predictions of a competitive relationship between DLPFC functions and statistical learning, the DLPFC stimulation group showed better performance compared to the sham group after the 24-hour consolidation period. This finding suggests that the disruption of DLPFC induced qualitative changes in picking up statistical regularities during learning that became salient in behavior after a stabilization period. Our results support an antagonistic relationship between the brain networks of automatic and controlled processes.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A subcortical circuit linking the cerebellum to the basal ganglia engaged in vocal learning</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/198317v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Speech is a complex sensorimotor skill, and vocal learning involves both the basal ganglia and the cerebellum. These subcortical structures interact indirectly through their respective loops with thalamo-cortical and brainstem networks, and directly via subcortical pathways, but the role of their interaction during sensorimotor learning remains undetermined. While songbirds and their song dedicated basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuitry offer a unique opportunity to study subcortical circuits involved in vocal learning, the cerebellar contribution to avian song learning remains unknown. We demonstrate that the cerebellum provides a strong input to the song-related basal ganglia nucleus in zebra finches. Cerebellar signals are transmitted to the basal ganglia via a disynaptic connection through the thalamus and then conveyed to their cortical target and to the premotor nucleus controlling song production. Finally, cerebellar lesions impair juvenile song learning, opening new opportunities to investigate how subcortical interactions between the cerebellum and basal ganglia contribute to sensorimotor learning.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: On a 'failed' attempt to manipulate conscious perception with transcranial magnetic stimulation to prefrontal cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/198218v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/198218v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>It has been reported that continuous theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) impairs metacognitive awareness in visual perception (Rounis et al., 2010). Bor et al. (2017) recently attempted to replicate this result. However, the authors modified the experimental design of the original study considerably, meaning that this was not strictly a replication. In some cases, the changes are a priori expected to lower the chance of obtaining positive findings. Despite these changes, the researchers in fact still found an effect similar to Rounis et al.'s, but they claimed that it was necessary to adopt certain criteria to discard ~30% of their subjects, after which a null result was reported. Using computer simulations, we evaluated whether the subject exclusion criteria Bor et al. adopted was appropriate or beneficial. We found that, contrary to their intended purpose, excluding subjects by their criteria does not actually reduce false positive rates. Taking into account both their positive result (without subject exclusion) and negative result (after exclusion) in a Bayesian framework, we further found that their results suggest a 75% or greater likelihood that TMS to DLPFC does in fact impair metacognition, directly contradicting their claim of replication failure. That lesion and chemical inactivation studies are known to demonstrate positive effects in similar paradigms further suggests that Bor et al.'s alleged negative finding cannot be taken as evidence against the role of the prefrontal cortex in conscious perception in general.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Defining subtypes of autism spectrum disorder using static and dynamic functional connectivity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/198093v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by impairments in social communication and restricted and repetitive behaviours. Neuroimaging studies of individuals with ASD have shown complex patterns of functional connectivity (FC), with no clear consensus on defining brain-behaviour attributes of different subtypes of the disorder. In these studies, &quot;static FC&quot;, a metric that considers correlations across the entire time series for a given region, was used. Emerging evidence shows that FC changes over time; this &quot;dynamic FC&quot; can allow for unique detection of the temporal variability of functional connections over time. Here, we used k-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to characterize two subtypes of ASD based on distinct patterns of static and dynamic FC. A multivariate statistical approach was then implemented to determine optimal relationships between FC patterns and group membership or behaviour. The main objective was to characterize differences in static and dynamic FC between subtypes of ASD defined in a fully data-driven manner, and between subtypes and typically developing individuals. Subtype 2 was defined by increased FC within resting-state networks and decreased FC across networks for static FC, global increases in temporal stability of dynamic FC, and robust relationships between FC and several behaviours, relative to Subtype 1. Further, both ASD subtypes exhibited different patterns of static and dynamic FC compared to controls, particularly within default mode, sensorimotor, and occipital networks. Static and dynamic FC metrics provided both overlapping and unique information about the nature of FC differences between subtypes, and between both subtypes and controls. Our results demonstrate the value of considering FC-based subtypes of ASD to elucidate different relationships between brain and behaviour among individuals with this disorder, and have important clinical implications for catering treatments and behavioural interventions to specific subtypes.</description>

	<description>Catching movements must be aimed ahead of the moving ball, which may require predictions of when and where to catch. Here, using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation we show for the first time that, although interception movements were clearly aimed at the predicted final target position, the Superior Parietal Occipital Cortex (SPOC) displayed non predictive online spatial coding. Aiming ahead for catching must thus be achieved downstream within the parietofrontal network for reaching.</description>

Using a xenobiotic, we find that permeability of the Drosophila-brain barrier (BBB) is higher at night. The permeability rhythm is driven by circadian regulation of efflux and depends upon a molecular clock in the perineurial glia of the BBB, although efflux transporters are restricted to subperineurial glia (SPG). We show that transmission of circadian signals across the layers requires gap junctions, which are expressed cyclically. Specifically, during nighttime gap junctions reduce intracellular magnesium ([Mg2+]i), a positive regulator of efflux, in SPG. Consistent with lower nighttime efflux, nighttime administration of the anti-epileptic phenytoin is more effective at treating a Drosophila seizure model. These findings identify a novel mechanism of circadian regulation and have therapeutic implications for drugs targeted to the central nervous system.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The evolutionary origins of Lévy walk foraging</title>

We study through a reaction-diffusion algorithm the influence of landscape diversity on the efficiency of search dynamics. Remarkably, the &lt;i&gt;identical&lt;/i&gt; optimal search strategy arises in a wide variety of environments, provided the target density is sparse and the searcher’s information is restricted to its close vicinity. Our results strongly impact the current debate on the &lt;i&gt;emergentist&lt;/i&gt; vs. &lt;i&gt;evolutionary&lt;/i&gt; origins of animal foraging. The inherent character of the optimal solution (i.e., independent on the landscape for the broad scenarios assumed here) suggests an interpretation favoring the &lt;i&gt;evolutionary&lt;/i&gt; view, as originally implied by the Lévy flight foraging hypothesis. The latter states that, under conditions of scarcity of information and sparse resources, some organisms must have evolved to exploit optimal strategies characterized by heavy-tailed truncated power-law distributions of move lengths. These results strongly suggest that Lévy strategies—and hence the selection pressure for the relevant adaptations—are robust with respect to large changes in habitat. In contrast, the usual emergentist explanation seems not able to explain how very similar Lévy walks can emerge from all the distinct non-Lévy foraging strategies that are needed for the observed large variety of specific environments. We also report that deviations from Lévy can take place in plentiful ecosystems, where locomotion truncation is very frequent due to high encounter rates. So, in this case normal diffusion strategies—performing as effectively as the optimal one—can naturally emerge from Lévy. Our results constitute the strongest theoretical evidence to date supporting the evolutionary origins of experimentally observed Lévy walks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xPyS8b1UUR4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Mathematical modelling has become an established tool for studying the dynamics of biological systems. Current applications range from building models that reproduce quantitative data to identifying systems with predefined qualitative features, such as switching behaviour, bistability or oscillations. Mathematically, the latter question amounts to identifying parameter values associated with a given qualitative feature. We introduce a procedure to partition the parameter space of a parameterized system of ordinary differential equations into regions for which the system has a unique or multiple equilibria. The procedure is based on the computation of the Brouwer degree, and it creates a multivariate polynomial with parameter depending coefficients. The signs of the coefficients determine parameter regions with and without multistationarity. A particular strength of the procedure is the avoidance of numerical analysis and parameter sampling. The procedure consists of a number of steps. Each of these steps might be addressed algorithmically using various computer programs and available software, or manually. We demonstrate our procedure on several models of gene transcription and cell signalling, and show that in many cases we obtain a complete partitioning of the parameter space with respect to multistationarity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VgqzApXN7uk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Signatures of criticality arise from random subsampling in simple population models</title>

The rise of large-scale recordings of neuronal activity has fueled the hope to gain new insights into the collective activity of neural ensembles. How can one link the statistics of neural population activity to underlying principles and theories? One attempt to interpret such data builds upon analogies to the behaviour of collective systems in statistical physics. Divergence of the specific heat—a measure of population statistics derived from thermodynamics—has been used to suggest that neural populations are optimized to operate at a “critical point”. However, these findings have been challenged by theoretical studies which have shown that common inputs can lead to diverging specific heat. Here, we connect “signatures of criticality”, and in particular the divergence of specific heat, back to statistics of neural population activity commonly studied in neural coding: firing rates and pairwise correlations. We show that the specific heat diverges whenever the average correlation strength does not depend on population size. This is necessarily true when data with correlations is randomly subsampled during the analysis process, irrespective of the detailed structure or origin of correlations. We also show how the characteristic shape of specific heat capacity curves depends on firing rates and correlations, using both analytically tractable models and numerical simulations of a canonical feed-forward population model. To analyze these simulations, we develop efficient methods for characterizing large-scale neural population activity with maximum entropy models. We find that, consistent with experimental findings, increases in firing rates and correlation directly lead to more pronounced signatures. Thus, previous reports of thermodynamical criticality in neural populations based on the analysis of specific heat can be explained by average firing rates and correlations, and are not indicative of an optimized coding strategy. We conclude that a reliable interpretation of statistical tests for theories of neural coding is possible only in reference to relevant ground-truth models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JM3_Ni6t73U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Crude EEG parameter provides sleep medicine with well-defined continuous hypnograms. (arXiv:1710.00559v1 [stat.AP])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;To evaluate EEG data, one can count local maxima and minima on a fine scale,
in a sliding window analysis. This straightforward calculation, which
simplifies and improves previous work on permutation entropy, directly defines
a good proxy for brain activity in an EEG channel during an epoch of 30
seconds. Different channels and persons can be compared when they are measured
with the same device and prefiltering options. This could lead to a rigorously
defined and suitably standardized biomarker of cortex activity, like blood
pressure or laboratory values. Applied to sleep EEG, the algorithm yields
hypnograms with continuous scale which show amazing coincidence with sleep
stage annotation by trained experts. Although produced by a crude method,
continuous hypnograms provide a lot of details. For example, sleep depth
usually decreases from evening to morning even within the same annotated sleep
stage, except for REM phases where mean sleep depth is rather constant, but
different in frontal and parietal channels. The diagnostic potential of the
method is demonstrated with two hypnograms of narcoleptic patients. In all 10
subjects, infra-slow oscillations of activity with a wavelength between 30s and
two minutes were clearly seen, particularly strong at the onset of sleep and in
S2 phases. The suggested method needs to be checked and improved. In its
present form it seems already an appropriate tool for screening long-term EEG
data.

	<description>In developing brain neuronal migration, dendrite outgrowth and dendritic spine outgrowth are controlled by Cdc42, a small GTPase of the Rho family, and its activators. Cdc42 function in promoting actin polymerization is crucial for glutamatergic synapse regulation. Here, we focus on GABAergic synapse-specific activator of Cdc42, collybistin (CB) and examine functional differences between its splice isoforms CB1 and CB2. We report that CB1 and CB2 differentially regulate GABAergic synapse formation in vitro along proximal-distal axis and adult-born neuron maturation in vivo. The functional specialization between CB1 and CB2 isoforms arises from their differential protein half-life, in turn regulated by ubiquitin conjugation of the unique CB1 C-terminus. We report that CB1 and CB2 negatively regulate Cdc42; however, Cdc42 activation is dependent on CB interaction with gephyrin. During hippocampal adult neurogenesis CB1 regulates neuronal migration, while CB2 is essential for dendrite outgrowth. Finally, using mice lacking Gabra2 subunit, we show that CB1 function is downstream of GABAARs, and we can rescue adult neurogenesis deficit observed in Gabra2 KO. Overall, our results uncover previously unexpected role for CB isoforms downstream of 2-containing GABAARs during neuron maturation in a Cdc42 dependent mechanism.</description>

	<description>Our visual memory percepts of whether we have encountered specific objects or scenes before are hypothesized to manifest as decrements in neural responses in inferotemporal cortex (IT) with stimulus repetition. To evaluate this proposal, we recorded IT neural responses as two monkeys performed a single-exposure visual memory task designed to measure the rates of forgetting with time. We found that a strict interpretation of the repetition suppression hypothesis could not account for the monkeys' behavior, however, a weighted linear read-out of the IT population response accurately predicted forgetting rates, reaction time patterns, and individual differences in task performance. Additionally, the linear weights were largely all the same-sign and consistent with repetition suppression. These results suggest that a subpopulation of IT neurons reflect behaviorally-relevant memory information via changes in overall population response magnitudes, in contrast to visual identify information, which is largely reflected by changes in IT population response patterns.</description>

	<description>Recent studies have suggested that the human posteromedial cortex (PMC), which includes core regions of the default mode network (DMN), plays an important role in episodic memory. Whereas various roles relating to self-relevant processing and memory retrieval have been attributed to different subsystems within this broad network, the nature of representations and the functional roles they support in these brain regions remain unspecified. Here, we describe the whole-brain networks that represent subjective, self-relevant aspects of real-world events during autobiographical recollection. Nine participants wore a device to record images from their lives for a period of two to four weeks (lifelogging phase) and indicated the personally salient attributes (i.e., personal semantics) of each episode by choosing multiple content tags. Two to four weeks after the lifelogging phase, participants relived their experiences in an fMRI scanner cued by images chosen from their own lives. Representational Similarity Analysis revealed a broad network, including parts of the DMN, that represented personal semantics during autobiographical reminiscence. Furthermore, within this network, the right precuneus represented personally relevant content during vivid recollection but not during non-vivid recollection. The precuneus is a hub within the DMN and has been implicated in metacognitive ability for memory retrieval. Our results suggest a more specific mechanism underlying the phenomenology of vivid reminiscence, supported by personal semantic representations in the precuneus.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A single-cell spiking model for the origin of grid-cell patterns</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Tiziano D’Albis, Richard Kempter&lt;/p&gt;

Spatial cognition in mammals is thought to rely on the activity of grid cells in the entorhinal cortex, yet the fundamental principles underlying the origin of grid-cell firing are still debated. Grid-like patterns could emerge via Hebbian learning and neuronal adaptation, but current computational models remained too abstract to allow direct confrontation with experimental data. Here, we propose a single-cell spiking model that generates grid firing fields via spike-rate adaptation and spike-timing dependent plasticity. Through rigorous mathematical analysis applicable in the linear limit, we quantitatively predict the requirements for grid-pattern formation, and we establish a direct link to classical pattern-forming systems of the Turing type. Our study lays the groundwork for biophysically-realistic models of grid-cell activity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OBzyBRe4hNc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Determining how synaptic coupling within and between regions is modulated during sensory processing is an important topic in neuroscience. Electrophysiological recordings provide detailed information about neural spiking but have traditionally been confined to a particular region or layer of cortex. Here we develop new theoretical methods to study interactions between and within two brain regions, based on experimental measurements of spiking activity simultaneously recorded from the two regions. By systematically comparing experimentally-obtained spiking statistics to (efficiently computed) model spike rate statistics, we identify regions in model parameter space that are consistent with the experimental data. We apply our new technique to dual micro-electrode array &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; recordings from two distinct regions: olfactory bulb (OB) and anterior piriform cortex (PC). Our analysis predicts that: i) inhibition within the afferent region (OB) has to be weaker than the inhibition within PC, ii) excitation from PC to OB is generally stronger than excitation from OB to PC, iii) excitation from PC to OB and inhibition within PC have to both be relatively strong compared to presynaptic inputs from OB. These predictions are validated in a spiking neural network model of the OB–PC pathway that satisfies the many constraints from our experimental data. We find when the derived relationships are violated, the spiking statistics no longer satisfy the constraints from the data. In principle this modeling framework can be adapted to other systems and be used to investigate relationships between other neural attributes besides network connection strengths. Thus, this work can serve as a guide to further investigations into the relationships of various neural attributes within and across different regions during sensory processing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bmAz5E-V358&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

With the rapidly increasing volume of deep sequencing data, more efficient algorithms and data structures are needed. Minimizers are a central recent paradigm that has improved various sequence analysis tasks, including hashing for faster read overlap detection, sparse suffix arrays for creating smaller indexes, and Bloom filters for speeding up sequence search. Here, we propose an alternative paradigm that can lead to substantial further improvement in these and other tasks. For integers &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;, we say that a set of &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-mers is a &lt;i&gt;universal hitting set&lt;/i&gt; (UHS) if every possible &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;-long sequence must contain a &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-mer from the set. We develop a heuristic called DOCKS to find a compact UHS, which works in two phases: The first phase is solved optimally, and for the second we propose several efficient heuristics, trading set size for speed and memory. The use of heuristics is motivated by showing the NP-hardness of a closely related problem. We show that DOCKS works well in practice and produces UHSs that are very close to a theoretical lower bound. We present results for various values of &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt; and by applying them to real genomes show that UHSs indeed improve over minimizers. In particular, DOCKS uses less than 30% of the 10-mers needed to span the human genome compared to minimizers. The software and computed UHSs are freely available at github.com/Shamir-Lab/DOCKS/ and acgt.cs.tau.ac.il/docks/, respectively.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-LCuI1mRyPk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Estimating time of HIV-1 infection from next-generation sequence diversity</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Vadim Puller, Richard Neher, Jan Albert&lt;/p&gt;

Estimating the time since infection (TI) in newly diagnosed HIV-1 patients is challenging, but important to understand the epidemiology of the infection. Here we explore the utility of virus diversity estimated by next-generation sequencing (NGS) as novel biomarker by using a recent genome-wide longitudinal dataset obtained from 11 untreated HIV-1-infected patients with known dates of infection. The results were validated on a second dataset from 31 patients. Virus diversity increased linearly with time, particularly at 3rd codon positions, with little inter-patient variation. The precision of the TI estimate improved with increasing sequencing depth, showing that diversity in NGS data yields superior estimates to the number of ambiguous sites in Sanger sequences, which is one of the alternative biomarkers. The full advantage of deep NGS was utilized with continuous diversity measures such as average pairwise distance or site entropy, rather than the fraction of polymorphic sites. The precision depended on the genomic region and codon position and was highest when 3rd codon positions in the entire &lt;i&gt;pol&lt;/i&gt; gene were used. For these data, TI estimates had a mean absolute error of around 1 year. The error increased only slightly from around 0.6 years at a TI of 6 months to around 1.1 years at 6 years. Our results show that virus diversity determined by NGS can be used to estimate time since HIV-1 infection many years after the infection, in contrast to most alternative biomarkers. We provide the regression coefficients as well as web tool for TI estimation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KMtznCSBzrY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Contractions on the descending limb of the total (active + passive) muscle force—length relationship (i. e. when muscle stiffness is negative) are expected to lead to vast half-sarcomere—length inhomogeneities. This is however not observed in experiments—vast half-sarcomere—length inhomogeneities can be absent in myofibrils contracting in this range, and initial inhomogeneities can even decrease. Here we show that the absence of half-sarcomere—length inhomogeneities can be predicted when considering interactions of the semi-active protein titin with the actin filaments. Including a model of actin—titin interactions within a multi-scale continuum-mechanical model, we demonstrate that stability, accurate forces and nearly homogeneous half-sarcomere lengths can be obtained on the descending limb of the static total force—length relation. This could be a key to durable functioning of the muscle because large local stretches, that might harm, for example, the transverse-tubule system, are avoided.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/l4uY3cS3ehc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Pairwise maximum-entropy models have been used in neuroscience to predict the activity of neuronal populations, given only the time-averaged correlations of the neuron activities. This paper provides evidence that the pairwise model, applied to experimental recordings, would produce a bimodal distribution for the population-averaged activity, and for some population sizes the second mode would peak at high activities, that experimentally would be equivalent to 90% of the neuron population active within time-windows of few milliseconds. Several problems are connected with this bimodality: 1. The presence of the high-activity mode is unrealistic in view of observed neuronal activity and on neurobiological grounds. 2. Boltzmann learning becomes non-ergodic, hence the pairwise maximum-entropy distribution cannot be found: in fact, Boltzmann learning would produce an incorrect distribution; similarly, common variants of mean-field approximations also produce an incorrect distribution. 3. The Glauber dynamics associated with the model is unrealistically bistable and cannot be used to generate realistic surrogate data. This bimodality problem is first demonstrated for an experimental dataset from 159 neurons in the motor cortex of macaque monkey. Evidence is then provided that this problem affects typical neural recordings of population sizes of a couple of hundreds or more neurons. The cause of the bimodality problem is identified as the inability of standard maximum-entropy distributions with a uniform reference measure to model neuronal inhibition. To eliminate this problem a modified maximum-entropy model is presented, which reflects a basic effect of inhibition in the form of a simple but non-uniform reference measure. This model does not lead to unrealistic bimodalities, can be found with Boltzmann learning, and has an associated Glauber dynamics which incorporates a minimal asymmetric inhibition.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SMTazwKifmI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Learning causal networks from large-scale genomic data remains challenging in absence of time series or controlled perturbation experiments. We report an information- theoretic method which learns a large class of causal or non-causal graphical models from purely observational data, while including the effects of unobserved latent variables, commonly found in many genomic datasets. Starting from a complete graph, the method iteratively removes dispensable edges, by uncovering significant information contributions from indirect paths, and assesses edge-specific confidences from randomization of available data. The remaining edges are then oriented based on the signature of causality in observational data. The approach and associated algorithm, miic, outperform earlier methods on a broad range of benchmark networks. Causal network reconstructions are presented at different biological size and time scales, from gene regulation in single cells to whole genome duplication in tumor development as well as long term evolution of vertebrates. Miic is publicly available at https://github.com/miicTeam/MIIC.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zqYgkhitkBA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: In reply to Faes et al. and Barnett et al. regarding &quot;A study of problems encountered in Granger causality analysis from a neuroscience perspective&quot;. (arXiv:1709.10248v1 [stat.ME])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This reply is in response to commentaries by Barnett, Barrett, and Seth
(&lt;a href=&quot;http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1708.08001&quot;&gt;arXiv:1708.08001&lt;/a&gt;) and Faes, Stramaglia, and Marinazzo (&lt;a href=&quot;http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1708.06990&quot;&gt;arXiv:1708.06990&lt;/a&gt;) on
our paper entitled &quot;A study of problems encountered in Granger causality
analysis from a neuroscience perspective.&quot; (PNAS 114(34):7063-7072. 2017). In
our paper, we analyzed several properties of Granger-Geweke causality (GGC) and
discussed potential problems in neuroscience applications. We demonstrated: (i)
that GGC, estimated using separate model fits, is either severely biased,
particularly when the true model is known, or a high variance is introduced to
overcome the bias; and (ii) that GGC does not reflect some component dynamics
of the system. The commentaries by both Faes et al. and Barnett et al. point
out that the computational problems of (i) are resolved by using recent
computational methods. We acknowledge that these problems are indeed resolved
by these methods. However, the traditional computation using separate model
fits continues to be presented and applied. More fundamentally, the
interpretational problems stemming from (ii) are not in anyway addressed by the
improved methods because they are inherent to the definition of GGC. These
properties are indeed acknowledged by both commentaries. We have no
misconception of the GGC measure and do not claim that these properties are
facially wrong. But we do discuss at length how these properties make it
inappropriate and misleading for common types of scientific questions, how
presentation of GGC results without model estimates are not decipherable, and
how the absence of clear statements of questions of interest present further
opportunities for misinterpretation.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Inference of topology and the nature of synapses, and the flow of information in neuronal networks. (arXiv:1709.10138v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The characterisation of neuronal connectivity is one of the most important
matters in neuroscience. In this work, we show that a recently proposed
informational quantity, the causal mutual information, employed with an
appropriate methodology, can be used not only to correctly infer the direction
of the underlying physical synapses, but also to identify their excitatory or
inhibitory nature, considering easy to handle and measure bivariate
time-series. The success of our approach relies on a surprising property found
in neuronal networks by which non-adjacent neurons do &quot;understand&quot; each other
(positive mutual information), however this exchange of information is not
capable of causing effect (zero transfer entropy). Remarkably, inhibitory
connections, responsible for enhancing synchronisation, transfer more
information than excitatory connections, known to enhance entropy in the
network. We also demonstrate that our methodology can be used to correctly
infer directionality of synapses even in the presence of dynamic and
observational Gaussian noise, and is also successful in providing the effective
directionality of inter modular connectivity, when only mean fields can be
measured.

	<description>While clues have existed that endosomal trafficking is associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), whether it plays a central role in the disease and if so how has remained unknown. Here we rely on recent genetic and cellular findings to construct a model proposing that traffic jams in the early endosome can act as an upstream pathogenic hub in AD. We also rely on an independent series of findings to suggest how the traffic jams can act as a unified mediator of downstream pathophysiology. The model predicts, therefore, that interventions designed to unjam the endosome carry high therapeutic promise.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Features of spatial and functional segregation and integration of the primate connectome revealed by trade-off between wiring cost and efficiency</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005776</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/oMv2ZR6W4S8/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuhan Chen, Shengjun Wang, Claus C. Hilgetag, Changsong Zhou&lt;/p&gt;

The primate connectome, possessing a characteristic global topology and specific regional connectivity profiles, is well organized to support both segregated and integrated brain function. However, the organization mechanisms shaping the characteristic connectivity and its relationship to functional requirements remain unclear. The primate brain connectome is shaped by metabolic economy as well as functional values. Here, we explored the influence of two competing factors and additional advanced functional requirements on the primate connectome employing an optimal trade-off model between neural wiring cost and the representative functional requirement of processing efficiency. Moreover, we compared this model with a generative model combining spatial distance and topological similarity, with the objective of statistically reproducing multiple topological features of the network. The primate connectome indeed displays a cost-efficiency trade-off and that up to 67% of the connections were recovered by optimal combination of the two basic factors of wiring economy and processing efficiency, clearly higher than the proportion of connections (56%) explained by the generative model. While not explicitly aimed for, the trade-off model captured several key topological features of the real connectome as the generative model, yet better explained the connectivity of most regions. The majority of the remaining 33% of connections unexplained by the best trade-off model were long-distance links, which are concentrated on few cortical areas, termed long-distance connectors (LDCs). The LDCs are mainly non-hubs, but form a densely connected group overlapping on spatially segregated functional modalities. LDCs are crucial for both functional segregation and integration across different scales. These organization features revealed by the optimization analysis provide evidence that the demands of advanced functional segregation and integration among spatially distributed regions may play a significant role in shaping the cortical connectome, in addition to the basic cost-efficiency trade-off. These findings also shed light on inherent vulnerabilities of brain networks in diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oMv2ZR6W4S8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Multi-layer network utilizing rewarded spike time dependent plasticity to learn a foraging task</title>

Neural networks with a single plastic layer employing reward modulated spike time dependent plasticity (STDP) are capable of learning simple foraging tasks. Here we demonstrate advanced pattern discrimination and continuous learning in a network of spiking neurons with multiple plastic layers. The network utilized both reward modulated and non-reward modulated STDP and implemented multiple mechanisms for homeostatic regulation of synaptic efficacy, including heterosynaptic plasticity, gain control, output balancing, activity normalization of rewarded STDP and hard limits on synaptic strength. We found that addition of a hidden layer of neurons employing non-rewarded STDP created neurons that responded to the specific combinations of inputs and thus performed basic classification of the input patterns. When combined with a following layer of neurons implementing rewarded STDP, the network was able to learn, despite the absence of labeled training data, discrimination between rewarding patterns and the patterns designated as punishing. Synaptic noise allowed for trial-and-error learning that helped to identify the goal-oriented strategies which were effective in task solving. The study predicts a critical set of properties of the spiking neuronal network with STDP that was sufficient to solve a complex foraging task involving pattern classification and decision making.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2JhsvzSD8Y4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Effective learning is accompanied by increasingly efficient dimensionality of whole-brain responses. (arXiv:1709.10045v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.10045</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Theories and tools to measure the efficiency of neural codes have been
important in understanding neural responses to external stimuli. However,
similar principles to describe the efficiency of brain responses to tasks
demanding higher-order cognitive processes remain underdeveloped. A key domain
to study such efficiency is learning, where patterns of activity across the
entire brain provide insight into the principles governing the acquisition of
knowledge about objects or concepts. We propose a mathematical framework for
studying the efficiency of spatially embedded whole-brain states reflected in
functional MRI, and demonstrate its utility in describing how human subjects
learn the values of novel objects. We find that quick learners develop both
higher dimensional and more compact responses to stimuli than slow learners,
suggesting a greater efficiency in embedding rich patterns of information.
Using a virtual lesioning approach, we identify which regions form the
strongest neurophysiological drivers of these differences in learning rate. We
complement our region-based approach with a voxel-level approach to uncover
structure in finer-scale responses, providing evidence that higher dimensional
responses also characterize patterns of activation within regions known to
process and represent objects and their values. Finally, for a full
investigation of complementary geometric approaches, we verify that quick
learners develop more assortative responses to stimuli: that is, whole-brain
responses that are more easily distinguishable from one another. Our work
offers a suite of geometric measures to represent a notion of efficient coding
for higher-order cognitive processes, and provide insight into the
dimensionality of neural responses characteristic of the successful
optimization of reward, that are applicable to the study of cognitive
performance more broadly.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We designed a grid world task to study human planning and re-planning
behavior in an unknown stochastic environment. In our grid world, participants
were asked to travel from a random starting point to a random goal position
while maximizing their reward. Because they were not familiar with the
environment, they needed to learn its characteristics from experience to plan
optimally. Later in the task, we randomly blocked the optimal path to
investigate whether and how people adjust their original plans to find a
detour. To this end, we developed and compared 12 different models. These
models were different on how they learned and represented the environment and
how they planned to catch the goal. The majority of our participants were able
to plan optimally. We also showed that people were capable of revising their
plans when an unexpected event occurred. The result from the model comparison
showed that the model-based reinforcement learning approach provided the best
account for the data and outperformed heuristics in explaining the behavioral
data in the re-planning trials.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Synaptic noise induces intermittent oscillatory-quiescent state transitions in a spiking network model. (arXiv:1709.09748v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.09748</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.09748</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spontaneous cortical population activity is often described as synchronous
during slow-wave sleep and under certain anesthetics, and asynchronous during
quiet wakefulness. The underlying mechanisms that control transitions between
these cortical states are not completely known. To study the effect of synaptic
noise on these transitions, we use a cortical network model with mixed neuronal
types, governed by deterministic equations, and introduce noise into the
dynamics of synaptic variables. In absence of noise, the network is known to
display spontaneous collective oscillations which resemble alternating up and
down states observed in synchronous cortical states. Records of noise-affected
activity in the network feature alternation of collective oscillations and
quiescent states, with irregular transitions between them. Systematic analysis
of firing rates, power spectra and voltage series shows that characteristics of
these two states are similar to those of synchronous and asynchronous cortical
states: in the synchronous-like state neurons display collective oscillatory
activity and their membrane voltages fluctuate between hyperpolarized (down)
and depolarized (up) states; in the asynchronous-like state neurons are weakly
correlated and display very low spiking activity with no collective dynamics.
By varying noise intensity and using mean duration at each state as a
prevalence criterion, we observe that noise facilitates transitions from the
asynchronous to the synchronous-like state and hinders the reverse transitions.
Our results suggest that synaptic noise may be an important mechanism
underlying transitions between asynchronous and rhythmic states in cortical
networks.

	<description>Over the past few years our understanding of estrogen signaling in the brain has expanded rapidly. Estrogens are synthesized in the periphery and in the brain, acting on multiple receptors to regulate gene transcription, neural function, and behavior. Various estrogen-sensitive signaling pathways often operate in concert within the same cell, increasing the complexity of the system. In females, estrogen concentrations fluctuate over the estrous/menstrual cycle, dynamically modulating estrogen receptor (ER) expression, activity, and trafficking.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A metabolic core model elucidates how enhanced utilization of glucose and glutamine, with enhanced glutamine-dependent lactate production, promotes cancer cell growth: The WarburQ effect</title>

Cancer cells share several metabolic traits, including aerobic production of lactate from glucose (Warburg effect), extensive glutamine utilization and impaired mitochondrial electron flow. It is still unclear how these metabolic rearrangements, which may involve different molecular events in different cells, contribute to a selective advantage for cancer cell proliferation. To ascertain which metabolic pathways are used to convert glucose and glutamine to balanced energy and biomass production, we performed systematic constraint-based simulations of a model of human central metabolism. Sampling of the feasible flux space allowed us to obtain a large number of randomly mutated cells simulated at different glutamine and glucose uptake rates. We observed that, in the limited subset of proliferating cells, most displayed fermentation of glucose to lactate in the presence of oxygen. At high utilization rates of glutamine, oxidative utilization of glucose was decreased, while the production of lactate from glutamine was enhanced. This emergent phenotype was observed only when the available carbon exceeded the amount that could be fully oxidized by the available oxygen. Under the latter conditions, standard Flux Balance Analysis indicated that: this metabolic pattern is optimal to maximize biomass and ATP production; it requires the activity of a branched TCA cycle, in which glutamine-dependent reductive carboxylation cooperates to the production of lipids and proteins; it is sustained by a variety of redox-controlled metabolic reactions. In a &lt;i&gt;K-ras&lt;/i&gt; transformed cell line we experimentally assessed glutamine-induced metabolic changes. We validated computational results through an extension of Flux Balance Analysis that allows prediction of metabolite variations. Taken together these findings offer new understanding of the logic of the metabolic reprogramming that underlies cancer cell growth.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JgTHxYjvtss&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Flexibility to contingency changes distinguishes habitual and goal-directed strategies in humans</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Julie J. Lee, Mehdi Keramati&lt;/p&gt;

Decision-making in the real world presents the challenge of requiring flexible yet prompt behavior, a balance that has been characterized in terms of a trade-off between a slower, prospective goal-directed model-based (MB) strategy and a fast, retrospective habitual model-free (MF) strategy. Theory predicts that flexibility to changes in both reward values and transition contingencies can determine the relative influence of the two systems in reinforcement learning, but few studies have manipulated the latter. Therefore, we developed a novel two-level contingency change task in which transition contingencies between states change every few trials; MB and MF control predict different responses following these contingency changes, allowing their relative influence to be inferred. Additionally, we manipulated the rate of contingency changes in order to determine whether contingency change volatility would play a role in shifting subjects between a MB and MF strategy. We found that human subjects employed a hybrid MB/MF strategy on the task, corroborating the parallel contribution of MB and MF systems in reinforcement learning. Further, subjects did not remain at one level of MB/MF behaviour but rather displayed a shift towards more MB behavior over the first two blocks that was not attributable to the rate of contingency changes but rather to the extent of training. We demonstrate that flexibility to contingency changes can distinguish MB and MF strategies, with human subjects utilizing a hybrid strategy that shifts towards more MB behavior over blocks, consequently corresponding to a higher payoff.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/208K789yh_A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

A deterministic population dynamics model involving birth and death for a two-species system, comprising a wild-type and more resistant species competing via logistic growth, is subjected to two distinct stress environments designed to mimic those that would typically be induced by temporal variation in the concentration of a drug (antibiotic or chemotherapeutic) as it permeates through the population and is progressively degraded. Different treatment regimes, involving single or periodical doses, are evaluated in terms of the minimal population size (a measure of the extinction probability), and the population composition (a measure of the selection pressure for resistance or tolerance during the treatment). We show that there exist timescales over which the low-stress regime is as effective as the high-stress regime, due to the competition between the two species. For multiple periodic treatments, competition can ensure that the minimal population size is attained during the first pulse when the high-stress regime is short, which implies that a single short pulse can be more effective than a more protracted regime. Our results suggest that when the duration of the high-stress environment is restricted, a treatment with one or multiple shorter pulses can produce better outcomes than a single long treatment. If ecological competition is to be exploited for treatments, it is crucial to determine these timescales, and estimate for the minimal population threshold that suffices for extinction. These parameters can be quantified by experiment.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LOJeo276zlc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.09645</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We explore the main characteristics of big brain network data that offer
unique statistical challenges. The brain networks are biologically expected to
be both sparse and hierarchical. Such unique characterizations put specific
topological constraints onto statistical approaches and models we can use
effectively. We explore the limitations of the current models used in the field
and offer alternative approaches and explains new challenges.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Fitting of dynamic recurrent neural network models to sensory stimulus-response data. (arXiv:1709.09541v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.09541</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.09541</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We present a theoretical study aiming at model fitting for sensory neurons.
Conventional neural network training approaches are not applicable to this
problem due to lack of continuous data. Although the stimulus can be considered
as a smooth time dependent variable, the associated response will be a set of
neural spike timings (roughly the instants of successive action potential
peaks) which have no amplitude information. A recurrent neural network model
can be fitted to such a stimulus-response data pair by using maximum likelihood
estimation method where the likelihood function is derived from Poisson
statistics of neural spiking. The universal approximation feature of the
recurrent dynamical neuron network models allow us to describe
excitatory-inhibitory characteristics of an actual sensory neural network with
any desired number of neurons. The stimulus data is generated by a Phased
Cosine Fourier series having fixed amplitude and frequency but a randomly shot
phase. Various values of amplitude, stimulus component size and sample size are
applied in order to examine the effect of stimulus to the identification
process. Results are presented in tabular form at the end of this text.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A Simple Model of Attentional Blink. (arXiv:1611.08913v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08913</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08913</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The attentional blink (AB) effect is the reduced ability of subjects to
report a second target stimuli (T2) among a rapidly presented series of
non-target stimuli, when it appears within a time window of about 200-500 ms
after a first target (T1). We present a simple dynamical systems model
explaining the AB as resulting from the temporal response dynamics of a
stochastic, linear system with threshold, whose output represents the amount of
attentional resources allocated to the incoming sensory stimuli. The model
postulates that the available attention capacity is limited by activity of the
default mode network (DMN), a correlated set of brain regions related to task
irrelevant processing which is known to exhibit reduced activation following
mental training such as mindfulness meditation. The model provides a
parsimonious account relating key findings from the AB, DMN and meditation
research literature, and suggests some new testable predictions.
