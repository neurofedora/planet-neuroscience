	<title>eNeuro current issue: Closed-Loop Acoustic Stimulation Enhances Sleep Oscillations But Not Memory Performance</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Slow oscillations and spindle activity during non-rapid eye movement sleep have been implicated in memory consolidation. Closed-loop acoustic stimulation has previously been shown to enhance slow oscillations and spindle activity during sleep and improve verbal associative memory. We assessed the effect of closed-loop acoustic stimulation during a daytime nap on a virtual reality spatial navigation task in 12 healthy human subjects in a randomized within-subject crossover design. We show robust enhancement of slow oscillation and spindle activity during sleep. However, no effects on behavioral performance were observed when comparing real versus sham stimulation. To explore whether memory enhancement effects were task specific and dependent on nocturnal sleep, in a second experiment with 19 healthy subjects, we aimed to replicate a previous study that used closed-loop acoustic stimulation to enhance memory for word pairs. The methods used were as close as possible to those used in the original study, except that we used a double-blind protocol, in which both subject and experimenter were unaware of the test condition. Again, we successfully enhanced slow oscillation and spindle power, but again did not strengthen associative memory performance with stimulation. We conclude that enhancement of sleep oscillations may be insufficient to enhance memory performance in spatial navigation or verbal association tasks, and provide possible explanations for lack of behavioral replication.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has provided converging descriptions of group-level functional brain organization.

Biorthogonal wavelet families in extracting five different brainwave sub-bands
for a source localization. For this process, we used the Independent Component
Analysis (ICA) for feature extraction followed by the Boundary Element Model
(BEM) and the Equivalent Current Dipole (ECD) for the forward and inverse
problem solutions. The evaluation results in investigating the optimal mother
wavelet for source localization eventually identified the sym 20 mother wavelet
as the best choice followed by bior 6.8 and coif 5.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Estimating quantities conserved by virtue of scale invariance in timeseries. (arXiv:1911.00775v1 [physics.data-an])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the symmetries of translation in space, rotation in space, and
translation in time, the known laws of physics are not universally invariant
under transformation of scale. However, the action can be invariant under
change of scale in the special case of a scale free dynamical system that can
be described in terms of a Lagrangian, that itself scales inversely with time.
Crucially, this means symmetries under change of scale can exist in dynamical
systems under certain constraints. Our contribution lies in the derivation of a
generalised scale invariant Lagrangian - in the form of a power series
expansion - that satisfies these constraints. This generalised Lagrangian
furnishes a normal form for dynamic causal models (i.e., state space models
based upon differential equations) that can be used to distinguish scale
invariance (scale symmetry) from scale freeness in empirical data. We establish
face validity with an analysis of simulated data and then show how scale
invariance can be identified - and how the associated conserved quantities can
be estimated - in neuronal timeseries.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Do readers use character information when programming return-sweep saccades?. (arXiv:1911.00716v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00716</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00716</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Reading saccades that occur within a single line of text are guided by the
size of letters. However, readers occasionally need to make longer saccades
(known as return-sweeps) that take their eyes from the end of one line of text
to the beginning of the next. In this study, we tested whether return-sweep
saccades are also guided by font size information and whether this guidance
depends on visual acuity constraints. To do this, we manipulated the font size
of letters (0.29 vs 0.39 deg. per character) and the length of the first line
of text (16 vs 26 deg.). The larger font resulted in return-sweeps that landed
further to the right of the line start and in a reduction of corrective
saccades compared to the smaller font. This suggests that font size information
is used when programming return-sweeps and corrective saccades. Return-sweeps
in the longer line condition landed further to the right of the line start and
the proportion of corrective saccades increased compared to the short line
condition. This likely reflects an increase in saccadic range error with the
increase in saccade size. Critically, however, there was no interaction between
font size and line length. This suggests that when programming return-sweeps,
the use of font size information does not depend on visual acuity at the
saccade target. Instead, it appears that readers rely on global typographic
properties of the text in order to maintain an optimal number of characters to
the left of their first fixation on a new line.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Brain is a fantastic organ that helps creature adapting to the
environment. Network is the most essential structure of brain, but the
capability of a simple network is still not very clear. In this study, we try
to expound some brain functions only by the network property. Methods: Every
network can be equivalent to a simplified network, which is expressed by an
equation set. The dynamic of the equation set can be described by some basic
equations, which is based on the mathematical derivation. Results (1) In a
closed network, the stability is based on the excitatory/inhibitory synapse
proportion. Spike probabilities in the assembly can meet the solution of a
nonlinear equation set. (2) Network activity can spontaneously evolve into a
certain distribution under different stimulation, which is closely related to
decision making. (3) Short memory can be formed by coupling of network
assemblies. Conclusion: The essential property of a network may contribute to
some important brain functions.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The human brain's network architecture is genetically encoded by modular pleiotropy. (arXiv:1905.07606v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;For much of biology, the manner in which genotype maps to phenotype remains a
fundamental mystery. The few maps that are known tend to show modular
pleiotropy: sets of phenotypes are determined by distinct sets of genes. One
key map that has evaded discovery is that of the human brain's network
architecture. Here, we determine the form of this map for gene coexpression and
single nucleotide polymorphisms. We discover that mostly non-overlapping sets
of genes encode the connectivity of brain network modules (or so-called
communities), suggesting that brain network communities demarcate genetic
transitions. We find that these clean boundaries break down at connector hubs,
whose integrative connectivity is encoded by pleiotropic genes from mostly
non-overlapping sets. Broadly, this study opens fundamentally new directions in
the study of genetic encoding of brain development, evolution, and disease.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Statistical Model for Dynamically-Changing Correlation Matrices with Application to Brain Connectivity. (arXiv:1812.10050v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10050</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10050</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Recent studies have indicated that functional connectivity is
dynamic even during rest. A common approach to modeling the dynamic functional
connectivity in whole-brain resting-state fMRI is to compute the correlation
between anatomical regions via sliding time windows. However, the direct use of
the sample correlation matrices is not reliable due to the image acquisition
and processing noises in resting-sate fMRI.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New method: To overcome these limitations, we propose a new statistical model
that smooths out the noise by exploiting the geometric structure of correlation
matrices. The dynamic correlation matrix is modeled as a linear combination of
symmetric positive-definite matrices combined with cosine series
representation. The resulting smoothed dynamic correlation matrices are
clustered into disjoint brain connectivity states using the k-means clustering
algorithm.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results: The proposed model preserves the geometric structure of underlying
physiological dynamic correlation, eliminates unwanted noise in connectivity
and obtains more accurate state spaces. The difference in the estimated dynamic
connectivity states between males and females is identified.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparison with existing methods: We demonstrate that the proposed
statistical model has less rapid state changes caused by noise and improves the
accuracy in identifying and discriminating different states.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: We propose a new regression model on dynamically changing
correlation matrices that provides better performance over existing windowed
correlation and is more reliable for the modeling of dynamic connectivity.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Inhibitory Synapse Formation at the Axon Initial Segment</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00266</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00266</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The axon initial segment (AIS) is the site of action potential (AP) initiation in most neurons and is thus a critical site in the regulation of neuronal excitability. Normal function within the discrete AIS compartment requires intricate molecular machinery to ensure the proper concentration and organization of voltage-gated and ligand-gated ion channels; in humans, dysfunction at the AIS due to channel mutations is commonly associated with epileptic disorders. In this review, we will examine the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of the only synapses found at the AIS: synapses containing γ-aminobutyric type A receptors (GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Rs). GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Rs are heteropentamers assembled from 19 possible subunits and are the primary mediators of fast synaptic inhibition in the brain. Although the total GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R population is incredibly heterogeneous, only one specific GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R subtype—the α2-containing receptor—is enriched at the AIS. These AIS synapses are innervated by GABAergic chandelier cells, and this inhibitory signaling is thought to contribute to the tight control of AP firing. Here, we will summarize the progress made in understanding the regulation of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R synapse formation, concentrating on post-translational modifications of subunits and on interactions with intracellular proteins. We will then discuss subtype-specific synapse formation, with a focus on synapses found at the AIS, and how these synapses influence neuronal excitation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) is being widely used for charting brain connectivity and dynamics in healthy and diseased brains. However, the resting state paradigm allows an unconstrained fluctuation of brain arousal, which may have profound effects on resting-state fMRI signals and associated connectivity/dynamic metrics. Here, we review current understandings of the relationship between resting-state fMRI and brain arousal, in particular the effect of a recently discovered event of arousal modulation on resting-state fMRI. We further discuss potential implications of arousal-related fMRI modulation with a focus on its potential role in mediating spurious correlations between resting-state connectivity/dynamics with physiology and behavior. Multiple hypotheses are formulated based on existing evidence and remain to be tested by future studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Brain–Blood Partition Coefficient and Cerebral Blood Flow in Canines Using Calibrated Short TR Recovery (CaSTRR) Correction Method</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01189</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01189</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The brain–blood partition coefficient (BBPC) is necessary for quantifying cerebral blood flow (CBF) when using tracer based techniques like arterial spin labeling (ASL). A recent improvement to traditional MRI measurements of BBPC, called calibrated short TR recovery (CaSTRR), has demonstrated a significant reduction in acquisition time for BBPC maps in mice. In this study CaSTRR is applied to a cohort of healthy canines (n = 17, age = 5.0 – 8.0 years) using a protocol suited for application in humans at 3T. The imaging protocol included CaSTRR for BBPC maps, pseudo-continuous ASL for CBF maps, and high resolution anatomical images. The standard CaSTRR method of normalizing BBPC to gadolinium-doped deuterium oxide phantoms was also compared to normalization using hematocrit (Hct) as a proxy value for blood water content. The results show that CaSTRR is able to produce high quality BBPC maps with a 4 min acquisition time. The BBPC maps demonstrate significantly higher BBPC in gray matter (0.83 ± 0.05 mL/g) than in white matter (0.78 ± 0.04 mL/g, p = 0.006). Maps of CBF acquired with pCASL demonstrate a negative correlation between gray matter perfusion and age (p = 0.003). Voxel-wise correction for BBPC is also shown to improve contrast to noise ratio between gray and white matter in CBF maps. A novel aspect of the study was to show that that BBPC measurements can be calculated based on the known Hct of the blood sample placed in scanner. We found a strong correlation (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.81 in gray matter, R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.59 in white matter) established between BBPC maps normalized to the doped phantoms and BBPC maps normalized using Hct. This obviates the need for doped water phantoms which simplifies both the acquisition protocol and the post-processing methods. Together this suggests that CaSTRR represents a feasible, rapid method to account for BBPC variability when quantifying CBF. As canines have been used widely for aging and Alzheimer’s disease studies, the CaSTRR method established in the animals may further improve CBF measurements and advance our understanding of cerebrovascular changes in aging and neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Divide and Conquer: Stratifying Training Data by Tumor Grade Improves Deep Learning-Based Brain Tumor Segmentation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01182</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01182</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;It is a general assumption in deep learning that more training data leads to better performance, and that models will learn to generalize well across heterogeneous input data as long as that variety is represented in the training set. Segmentation of brain tumors is a well-investigated topic in medical image computing, owing primarily to the availability of a large publicly-available dataset arising from the long-running yearly Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge. Research efforts and publications addressing this dataset focus predominantly on technical improvements of model architectures and less on properties of the underlying data. Using the dataset and the method ranked third in the BraTS 2018 challenge, we performed experiments to examine the impact of tumor type on segmentation performance. We propose to stratify the training dataset into high-grade glioma (HGG) and low-grade glioma (LGG) subjects and train two separate models. Although we observed only minor gains in overall mean dice scores by this stratification, examining case-wise rankings of individual subjects revealed statistically significant improvements. Compared to a baseline model trained on both HGG and LGG cases, two separately trained models led to better performance in 64.9% of cases (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) for the tumor core. An analysis of subjects which did not profit from stratified training revealed that cases were missegmented which had poor image quality, or which presented clinically particularly challenging cases (e.g., underrepresented subtypes such as IDH1-mutant tumors), underlining the importance of such latent variables in the context of tumor segmentation. In summary, we found that segmentation models trained on the BraTS 2018 dataset, stratified according to tumor type, lead to a significant increase in segmentation performance. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this gain in segmentation performance is evident in the case-wise ranking of individual subjects but not in summary statistics. We conclude that it may be useful to consider the segmentation of brain tumors of different types or grades as separate tasks, rather than developing one tool to segment them all. Consequently, making this information available for the test data should be considered, potentially leading to a more clinically relevant BraTS competition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Comparison of Multi-Compartment Cable Models of Human Auditory Nerve Fibers</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01173</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01173</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Multi-compartment cable models of auditory nerve fibers have been developed to assist in the improvement of cochlear implants. With the advancement of computational technology and the results obtained from in vivo and in vitro experiments, these models have evolved to incorporate a considerable degree of morphological and physiological details. They have also been combined with three-dimensional volume conduction models of the cochlea to simulate neural responses to electrical stimulation. However, no specific rules have been provided on choosing the appropriate cable model, and most models adopted in recent studies were chosen without a specific reason or by inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Three of the most cited biophysical multi-compartment cable models of the human auditory nerve, i.e., Rattay et al. (2001b), Briaire and Frijns (2005), and Smit et al. (2010), were implemented in this study. Several properties of single fibers were compared among the three models, including threshold, conduction velocity, action potential shape, latency, refractory properties, as well as stochastic and temporal behaviors. Experimental results regarding these properties were also included as a reference for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: For monophasic single-pulse stimulation, the ratio of anodic vs. cathodic thresholds in all models was within the experimental range despite a much larger ratio in the model by Briaire and Frijns. For biphasic pulse-train stimulation, thresholds as a function of both pulse rate and pulse duration differed between the models, but none matched the experimental observations even coarsely. Similarly, for all other properties including the conduction velocity, action potential shape, and latency, the models presented different outcomes and not all of them fell within the range observed in experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: While all three models presented similar values in certain single fiber properties to those obtained in experiments, none matched all experimental observations satisfactorily. In particular, the adaptation and temporal integration behaviors were completely missing in all models. Further extensions and analyses are required to explain and simulate realistic auditory nerve fiber responses to electrical stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A number of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) protocols have been developed for modulating brain function non-invasively. To identify the most powerful one, these protocols have been compared in the context of the motor system. However, to what extent the conclusions could be generalized to high-level functions is largely unknown. In this study, we compared the modulatory effect of three excitatory rTMS protocols on high-level cognition represented by response inhibition ability. Our first experiment revealed that intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) could significantly improve reaction time in a stop signal task, while 5-Hz and 25-Hz stimuli were ineffective. This iTBS effect was significantly higher than that for the sham simulation and only occurred in the second session of the stop signal task after iTBS in the first experiment. However, this aftereffect of iTBS was not reproduced in the second experiment, indicating high variability across subjects. Thus, on the one hand, our findings indicate that iTBS on the pre-SMA could improve inhibitory control, but on the other hand, the reliability and reproducibility of this effect needs further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;African Americans have double the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), as compared to European Americans. However, the underlying causes of this health disparity are due to a multitude of environmental, lifestyle, and genetic factors that are not yet fully understood. Here, we review the effects of the two largest genetic risk factors for AD in African Americans: Apolipoprotein E (APOE) and ABCA7. We will describe the direct effects of genetic variation on neural correlates of cognitive function and report the indirect modulating effects of genetic variation on modifiable AD risk factors, such as aerobic fitness. As a means of integrating previous findings, we present a novel schematic diagram to illustrate the many factors that contribute to AD risk and impaired cognitive function in older African Americans. Finally, we discuss areas that require further inquiry, and stress the importance of racially diverse and representative study populations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Beta-Band Resonance and Intrinsic Oscillations in a Biophysically Detailed Model of the Subthalamic Nucleus-Globus Pallidus Network</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Increased beta-band oscillatory activity in the basal ganglia network is associated with Parkinsonian motor symptoms and is suppressed with medication and deep brain stimulation (DBS). The origins of the beta-band oscillations, however, remains unclear with both intrinsic oscillations arising within the subthalamic nucleus (STN)—external globus pallidus (GPe) network and exogenous beta-activity, originating outside the network, proposed as potential sources of the pathological activity. The aim of this study was to explore the relative contribution of autonomous oscillations and exogenous oscillatory inputs in the generation of pathological oscillatory activity in a biophysically detailed model of the parkinsonian STN-GPe network. The network model accounts for the integration of synaptic currents and their interaction with intrinsic membrane currents in dendritic structures within the STN and GPe. The model was used to investigate the development of beta-band synchrony and bursting within the STN-GPe network by changing the balance of excitation and inhibition in both nuclei, and by adding exogenous oscillatory inputs with varying phase relationships through the hyperdirect cortico-subthalamic and indirect striato-pallidal pathways. The model showed an intrinsic susceptibility to beta-band oscillations that was manifest in weak autonomously generated oscillations within the STN-GPe network and in selective amplification of exogenous beta-band synaptic inputs near the network's endogenous oscillation frequency. The frequency at which this resonance peak occurred was determined by the net level of excitatory drive to the network. Intrinsic or endogenously generated oscillations were too weak to support a pacemaker role for the STN-GPe network, however, they were considerably amplified by sparse cortical beta inputs and were further amplified by striatal beta inputs that promoted anti-phase firing of the cortex and GPe, resulting in maximum transient inhibition of STN neurons. The model elucidates a mechanism of cortical patterning of the STN-GPe network through feedback inhibition whereby intrinsic susceptibility to beta-band oscillations can lead to phase locked spiking under parkinsonian conditions. These results point to resonance of endogenous oscillations with exogenous patterning of the STN-GPe network as a mechanism of pathological synchronization, and a role for the pallido-striatal feedback loop in amplifying beta oscillations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00500</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;For the last two decades, caspases, a family of cysteine-aspartic proteases, have evolved from being considered solely as regulators of apoptosis or inflammation to having a wider range of functions. In this mini review, we focus on the most recent “non-apoptotic” roles of caspases in the CNS, particularly in neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Non-apoptotic caspase functions in microglia have already been reviewed extensively elsewhere. Here we discuss the involvement of caspases in the activation of the inflammasome, autophagy, and non-apoptotic forms of cell death such as necroptosis and pyroptosis. Also, we review the involvement of caspases in synapses and the processing of aggregates key to neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s diseases. Likewise, we mention the recently described involvement of caspases in mitochondrial biogenesis, which is a function independent of the enzymatic activity. We conclude discussing the relevance that “new” functions of caspases have in the CNS and the future of this field of research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of non-progressive motor impairment syndromes that are secondary to brain injury in the early stages of brain development. Numerous etiologies and risk factors of CP have been reported, and genetic contributions have recently been identified. Autophagy has an important role in brain development and pathological process, and autophagy-related gene 7 (ATG7) is essential for autophagosome biogenesis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the genetic association between ATG7 gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and CP in Han Chinese children. Six SNPs (rs346078, rs1470612, rs11706903, rs2606750, rs2594972, and rs4684787) were genotyped in 715 CP patients and 658 healthy controls using the MassArray platform. Plasma ATG7 protein was determined in 73 CP patients and 79 healthy controls. The differences in the allele and genotype frequencies of the rs1470612 and rs2594972 SNPs were determined between the CP patients and controls (p&lt;sub&gt;allele&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.02 and 0.0004, p&lt;sub&gt;genotype&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.044 and 0.0012, respectively). Subgroup analysis revealed a more significant association of rs1470612 (p&lt;sub&gt;allele&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.004, p&lt;sub&gt;genotype&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.0036) and rs2594972 (p&lt;sub&gt;allele&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.0004, p&lt;sub&gt;genotype&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) with male CP, and more significant differences in allele and genotype frequencies were also noticed between CP patients with spastic diplegia and controls for rs1470612 (p&lt;sub&gt;allele&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.0024, p&lt;sub&gt;genotype&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.008) and rs2594972 (p&lt;sub&gt;allele&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001, p&lt;sub&gt;genotype&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.006). The plasma ATG7 level was higher in CP patients compared to the controls (10.58 ± 0.85 vs. 8.18 ± 0.64 pg/mL, p = 0.024). The luciferase reporter gene assay showed that the T allele of rs2594972 SNP could significantly increase transcriptional activity of the ATG7 promoter compared to the C allele (p = 0.009). These findings suggest that an association exists between genetic variants of ATG7 and susceptibility to CP, which provides novel evidence for the role of ATG7 in CP and contributes to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of this neurodevelopmental disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Age and Sex Influence the Neuro-inflammatory Response to a Peripheral Acute LPS Challenge</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aging is associated with an exaggerated response to peripheral inflammatory challenges together with behavioral and cognitive deficits. Studies considering both age and sex remain limited, despite sex dimorphism of astrocytes and microglial cells is largely recognized. To fill this knowledge gap, we investigated the effect of a single intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration in adult and aged mice. We assessed the expression of different inflammatory mediators, and the microglial response through binding of [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]-VC701 tracer to translocator protein (TSPO) receptors in the male and female brain. Aged female brain showed a higher pro-inflammatory response to LPS compared to adult female and to aged male, as revealed by ex vivo binding to TSPO receptors and pro-inflammatory mediator transcript levels. The highest astroglial reaction was observed in the brain of aged females. Differently to the other groups of animals, in aged males LPS challenge did not affect transcription of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2). In conclusion, our study shows that in the mouse’s brain the neuro-inflammatory response to an acute peripheral insult is sex- and age-dependent. Moreover, our results might set the basis for further studies aimed at identifying sex-related targets involved in the modulation of the aberrant neuro-inflammatory response that characterizes aging. This knowledge could be relevant for the treatment of conditions such as delirium and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Ventricular System Enlarges Abnormally in the Seventies, Earlier in Men, and First in the Frontal Horn: A Study Based on More Than 3,000 Scans</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objectives: To detect on computed tomography (CT) brain scans the trajectories of normal and abnormal ventricular enlargement during aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: For each 1-year age cohort, we assessed in 3,193 axial CT scans the Evans’ index (EI) in the anterior frontal horns and the parieto-occipital (POR) and temporal ratio (TR) in the posterior and inferior horns. Cut-off values for abnormal enlargement were based on previous clinical studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The mean age associated with normal linear measures was 71 years. Values for all three measures increased with age, showing a linear relationship below—but not above—each cut-off value. The mean age of participants with abnormal enlargement on CT progressed from 79 years for EI to 83 years for POR to 87 years for TR. These results suggested that ventricular dilatation progresses in an age–location relationship. First comes enlargement of the frontal horns (13.8% of scans), followed by the parieto-occipital horns (15.1% of scans) and then temporal horn enlargement (6.8% of scans). Scans from men displayed abnormal values earlier than scans from women (on average 6 years). Risk increased 5.1% annually for abnormal EI, 9.0% for abnormal POR, and 11% for abnormal TR (all p &amp;lt; 0.001). The most frequent agreement between categories (normal–abnormal) for values of neuroimaging measures was identified for POR–TR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The results of this large radiological study suggest that the ventricular system enlarges progressively during aging, and in a subset of patients follows an abnormal consecutive geometric dilatation, influenced by age and sex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Cyclin dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) regulates the circadian clock</title>

	<description>Circadian oscillations emerge from transcriptional and post-translational feedback loops. An important step in generating rhythmicity is the translocation of clock components into the nucleus, which is regulated in many cases by kinases. In mammals, the kinase promoting the nuclear import of the key clock component Period 2 (PER2) is unknown. Here we show that the cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) regulates the mammalian circadian clock involving phosphorylation of PER2. Knock-down of &lt;i&gt;Cdk5&lt;/i&gt; in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the main coordinator site of the mammalian circadian system, shortened the free-running period in mice. CDK5 phosphorylated PER2 at serine residue 394 (S394) in a diurnal fashion. This phosphorylation facilitated interaction with Cryptochrome 1 (CRY1) and nuclear entry of the PER2-CRY1 complex. Taken together, we found that CDK5 drives nuclear entry of PER2, which is critical for establishing an adequate circadian period of the molecular circadian cycle. Of note is that CDK5 may not exclusively phosphorylate PER2, but in addition may regulate other proteins that are involved in the clock mechanism. Taken together, it appears that CDK5 is critically involved in the regulation of the circadian clock and may represent a link to various diseases affected by a derailed circadian clock.</description>

	<description>Cortical plasticity is fundamental to motor recovery following cortical perturbation. However, it is still unclear how this plasticity is induced at a functional circuit level. Here, we investigated motor recovery and underlying neural plasticity upon optogenetic suppression of a cortical area for eye movement. Using a visually-guided eye movement task in mice, we suppressed a portion of the secondary motor cortex (MOs) that encodes contraversive eye movement. Optogenetic unilateral suppression severely impaired contraversive movement on the first day. However, on subsequent days the suppression became inefficient and capability for the movement was restored. Longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging revealed that the regained capability was accompanied by an increased number of neurons encoding for ipsiversive movement in the unsuppressed contralateral MOs. Additional suppression of the contralateral MOs impaired the recovered movement again, indicating a compensatory mechanism. Our findings demonstrate that repeated optogenetic suppression leads to functional recovery mediated by the contralateral hemisphere.</description>

	<description>Patterns of synaptic connectivity are remarkably precise and complex. Single-cell RNA sequencing has revealed a vast transcriptional diversity of neurons. Nevertheless, a clear logic underlying the transcriptional control of neuronal connectivity has yet to emerge. Here, we focused on Drosophila T4/T5 neurons, a class of closely related neuronal subtypes with different wiring patterns. Eight subtypes of T4/T5 neurons are defined by combinations of two patterns of dendritic inputs and four patterns of axonal outputs. Single-cell profiling during development revealed distinct transcriptional programs defining each dendrite and axon wiring pattern. These programs were defined by the expression of a few transcription factors and different combinations of cell surface proteins. Gain and loss of function studies provide evidence for independent control of different wiring features. We propose that modular transcriptional programs for distinct wiring features are assembled in different combinations to generate diverse patterns of neuronal connectivity.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: The mammalian LINC complex component SUN1 regulates muscle regeneration by modulating Drosha activity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.49485</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/49485</link>
	<description>Here we show that a major muscle specific isoform of the murine LINC complex protein SUN1 is required for efficient muscle regeneration. The nucleoplasmic domain of the isoform specifically binds to and inhibits Drosha, a key component of the microprocessor complex required for miRNA synthesis. Comparison of the miRNA profiles between wildtype and SUN1 null myotubes identified a cluster of miRNAs encoded by a non-translated retrotransposon-like 1 antisense (&lt;i&gt;Rtl1as&lt;/i&gt;) transcript that are decreased in the WT myoblasts due to SUN1 inhibition of Drosha. One of these miRNAs miR-127 inhibits the translation of the &lt;i&gt;Rtl1 &lt;/i&gt;sense transcript, that encodes the retrotransposon-like 1 protein (RTL1), which is also required for muscle regeneration and is expressed in regenerating/dystrophic muscle. The LINC complex may therefore regulate gene expression during muscle regeneration by controlling miRNA processing. This provides new insights into the molecular pathology underlying muscular dystrophies and how the LINC complex may regulate mechanosignaling.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: RNA from a simple-tandem repeat is required for sperm maturation and male fertility in Drosophila melanogaster</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.48940</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/48940</link>
	<description>Tandemly-repeated DNAs, or satellites, are enriched in heterochromatic regions of eukaryotic genomes and contribute to nuclear structure and function. Some satellites are transcribed, but we lack direct evidence that specific satellite RNAs are required for normal organismal functions. Here, we show satellite RNAs derived from AAGAG tandem repeats are transcribed in many cells throughout &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; development, enriched in neurons and testes, often localized within heterochromatic regions, and important for viability. Strikingly, we find AAGAG transcripts are necessary for male fertility, and that AAGAG RNA depletion results in defective histone-protamine exchange, sperm maturation and chromatin organization. Since these events happen late in spermatogenesis when the transcripts are not detected, we speculate that AAGAG RNA in primary spermatocytes 'primes' post-meiosis steps for sperm maturation. In addition to demonstrating essential functions for AAGAG RNAs, comparisons between closely related &lt;i&gt;Drosophila &lt;/i&gt;species suggest that satellites and their transcription evolve quickly to generate new functions.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Loss of adaptive capacity in asthmatic patients revealed by biomarker fluctuation dynamics after rhinovirus challenge</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/47969</link>
	<description>Asthma is a dynamic disease, in which lung mechanical and inflammatory processes interact in a complex manner, often resulting in exaggerated physiological, in particular, inflammatory responses to exogenous triggers. We hypothesize that this may be explained by respiratory disease-related systems instability and loss of adaptability to changing environmental conditions, manifested in highly fluctuating biomarkers and symptoms. Using time series of inflammatory (eosinophils, neutrophils, FeNO), clinical and lung function biomarkers (PEF, FVC,FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), we estimated this loss of adaptive capacity (AC) during an experimental rhinovirus infection in 24 healthy and asthmatic human volunteers. Loss of AC was estimated by comparing similarities between pre- and post-challenge time series. Unlike healthy participants, the asthmatic's post-viral-challenge state resembled more other rhinovirus-infected asthmatics than their own pre-viral-challenge state (hypergeometric-test: p=0.029). This reveals loss of AC and supports the concept that in asthma, biological processes underlying inflammatory and physiological responses are unstable, contributing to loss of control.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: A single clonal lineage of transmissible cancer identified in two marine mussel species in South America and Europe</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/47788</link>
	<description>Transmissible cancers, in which cancer cells themselves act as an infectious agent, have been identified in Tasmanian devils, dogs, and four bivalves. We investigated a disseminated neoplasia affecting geographically distant populations of two species of mussels (&lt;i&gt;Mytilus chilensis&lt;/i&gt; in South America and &lt;i&gt;M. edulis&lt;/i&gt; in Europe). Sequencing alleles from four loci (two nuclear and two mitochondrial) provided evidence of transmissible cancer in both species. Phylogenetic analysis of cancer-associated alleles and analysis of diagnostic SNPs showed that cancers in both species likely arose in a third species of mussel (&lt;i&gt;M. trossulus&lt;/i&gt;), but these cancer cells are independent from the previously identified transmissible cancer in &lt;i&gt;M. trossulus&lt;/i&gt; from Canada. Unexpectedly, cancers from &lt;i&gt;M. chilensis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;M. edulis&lt;/i&gt; are nearly identical, showing that the same cancer lineage affects both. Thus, a single transmissible cancer lineage has crossed into two new host species and has been transferred across the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and between the Northern and Southern hemispheres.</description>

	<description>The interactions of anterior temporal structures, and especially the amygdala, with the prefrontal cortex are pivotal to learning, decision-making, and socio-emotional regulation. A clear anatomical description of the organization and dissociation of fiber bundles linking anterior temporal cortex/amygdala and prefrontal cortex in humans is still lacking. Using diffusion imaging techniques, we reconstructed fiber bundles between these anatomical regions in human and macaque brains. First, by studying macaques, we assessed which aspects of connectivity known from tracer studies could be identified with diffusion imaging. Second, by comparing diffusion imaging results in humans and macaques, we estimated the patterns of fibers coursing between human amygdala and prefrontal cortex and compared them with those in the monkey. In posterior prefrontal cortex, we observed a prominent and well-preserved bifurcation of bundles into primarily two fiber systems—an amygdalofugal path and an uncinate path—in both species. This dissociation fades away in more rostral prefrontal regions.</description>

	<description>The ability to retrieve memory store in response to the environment is essential for animal behavioral adaptation. Norepinephrine (NE)-containing neurons in the brain play a key role in the modulation of synaptic plasticity underlying various processes of memory formation. However, the role of the central NE system in memory retrieval remains unclear. In this study we developed a neural chemogenetic activation strategy using insect olfactory Ionotropic Receptors (IRs), which we used it for selective stimulation of NE neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) in transgenic mice. Ligand-induced activation of LC NE neurons resulted in enhancement of the retrieval process of conditioned taste aversion, which was mediated through at least partly adrenergic receptors in the amygdala. Pharmacological blockade of LC activity confirmed the facilitative role of these neurons in memory retrieval. Our findings indicate that the LC-amygdalar pathway is required and sufficient for enhancing the recall of taste associative memory.</description>

	<description>Neural prostheses enable users to effect movement through a variety of actuators by translating brain signals into movement control signals. However, to achieve more natural limb movements from these devices, restoration of somatosensory feedback and advances in neural decoding of motor control-related brain signals are required. We used a machine-learning approach to assess signal features for their capacity to enhance decoding performance of neural signals evoked by natural tactile and proprioceptive somatosensory stimuli, recorded from the surface of the dorsal column nuclei in urethane-anaesthetised rats. We determined signal features that are highly informative for decoding somatosensory stimuli, yet these appear underutilised in neuroprosthetic applications. We found that proprioception-dominated stimuli generalise across animals better than tactile-dominated stimuli, and we demonstrate how information that signal features contribute to neural decoding changes over a time-course of dynamic somatosensory events. These findings may improve neural decoding for various applications including novel neuroprosthetic design.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Classical and controlled auditory mismatch responses to multiple physical deviances in anaesthetised and conscious mice</title>

	<description>Human mismatch negativity (MMN) is modelled in rodents and other non-human species to examine its underlying neurological mechanisms, primarily described in terms of deviance-detection and adaptation. Using the mouse model, we aim to elucidate subtle dependencies between the mismatch response (MMR) and different physical properties of sound. Epidural field potentials were recorded from urethane-anaesthetised and conscious mice during oddball and many-standards control paradigms; stimuli varying in duration, frequency, intensity, and inter-stimulus interval. Resulting auditory evoked potentials, classical MMR (oddball - standard), and controlled MMR (oddball - control) waveforms were analysed. Stimulus duration correlated with stimulus-off response peak latency (p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Frequency (p &amp;lt; 0.0001), intensity (p &amp;lt; 0.0001), and inter-stimulus interval (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) correlated with stimulus-on N1 and P1 (conscious only) peak amplitudes. These relationships were instrumental in shaping classical MMR morphology in both anaesthetised and conscious animals, suggesting these waveforms reflect modification of normal auditory processing by different physical properties of stimuli. Controlled MMR waveforms appeared to exhibit habituation to auditory stimulation over time, which was equally observed in response to oddball and standard stimuli. These observations are inconsistent with the mechanisms thought to underlie human MMN, which currently do not address differences due to specific physical features of auditory deviance. Thus, no evidence was found to objectively support the deviance-detection or adaptation hypotheses of MMN in relation to anaesthetised or conscious mice.</description>

	<description>The firing pattern of grid cells in rats has been shown to exhibit elastic distortions that compresses and shears the pattern and suggests that the grid is locally anchored. Anchoring points may need to be learned to account for different environments. We recorded grid cells in animals encountering a novel environment. The grid pattern was not stable but moved between the first few sessions predicted by the animals running behavior. Using a learning continuous attractor network model, we show that learning distributed anchoring points may lead to such grid field movement as well as previously observed shearing and compression distortions. The model further predicted topological defects comprising a pentagonal/heptagonal break in the pattern. Grids recorded in large environments were shown to exhibit such topological defects. Taken together, the final pattern may be a compromise between local network attractor states driven by self-motion signals and distributed anchoring inputs from place cells.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Michael Seifert, Claudia Peitzsch, Ielizaveta Gorodetska, Caroline Börner, Barbara Klink, Anna Dubrovska&lt;/p&gt;

Radiation therapy is an important and effective treatment option for prostate cancer, but high-risk patients are prone to relapse due to radioresistance of cancer cells. Molecular mechanisms that contribute to radioresistance are not fully understood. Novel computational strategies are needed to identify radioresistance driver genes from hundreds of gene copy number alterations. We developed a network-based approach based on lasso regression in combination with network propagation for the analysis of prostate cancer cell lines with acquired radioresistance to identify clinically relevant marker genes associated with radioresistance in prostate cancer patients. We analyzed established radioresistant cell lines of the prostate cancer cell lines DU145 and LNCaP and compared their gene copy number and expression profiles to their radiosensitive parental cells. We found that radioresistant DU145 showed much more gene copy number alterations than LNCaP and their gene expression profiles were highly cell line specific. We learned a genome-wide prostate cancer-specific gene regulatory network and quantified impacts of differentially expressed genes with directly underlying copy number alterations on known radioresistance marker genes. This revealed several potential driver candidates involved in the regulation of cancer-relevant processes. Importantly, we found that ten driver candidates from DU145 (&lt;i&gt;ADAMTS9&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;AKR1B10&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CXXC5&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;FST&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;FOXL1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;GRPR&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ITGA2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;SOX17&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;STARD4&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;VGF&lt;/i&gt;) and four from LNCaP (&lt;i&gt;FHL5&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;LYPLAL1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PAK7&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TDRD6&lt;/i&gt;) were able to distinguish irradiated prostate cancer patients into early and late relapse groups. Moreover, in-depth &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; validations for &lt;i&gt;VGF&lt;/i&gt; (Neurosecretory protein VGF) showed that siRNA-mediated gene silencing increased the radiosensitivity of DU145 and LNCaP cells. Our computational approach enabled to predict novel radioresistance driver gene candidates. Additional preclinical and clinical studies are required to further validate the role of &lt;i&gt;VGF&lt;/i&gt; and other candidate genes as potential biomarkers for the prediction of radiotherapy responses and as potential targets for radiosensitization of prostate cancer.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dAhbTS4BSUQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Large-scale neural recording methods now allow us to observe large populations of identified single neurons simultaneously, opening a window into neural population dynamics in living organisms. However, distilling such large-scale recordings to build theories of emergent collective dynamics remains a fundamental statistical challenge. The neural field models of Wilson, Cowan, and colleagues remain the mainstay of mathematical population modeling owing to their interpretable, mechanistic parameters and amenability to mathematical analysis. Inspired by recent advances in biochemical modeling, we develop a method based on moment closure to interpret neural field models as latent state-space point-process models, making them amenable to statistical inference. With this approach we can infer the intrinsic states of neurons, such as active and refractory, solely from spiking activity in large populations. After validating this approach with synthetic data, we apply it to high-density recordings of spiking activity in the developing mouse retina. This confirms the essential role of a long lasting refractory state in shaping spatiotemporal properties of neonatal retinal waves. This conceptual and methodological advance opens up new theoretical connections between mathematical theory and point-process state-space models in neural data analysis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XgxYx7yRJWI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Drug resistance is a major cause for the failure of cancer chemotherapy or targeted therapy. However, the molecular regulatory mechanisms controlling the dynamic evolvement of drug resistance remain poorly understood. Thus, it is important to develop methods for identifying key gene regulatory mechanisms of the resistance to specific drugs. In this study, we developed a data-driven computational framework, DryNetMC, using a differential regulatory network-based modeling and characterization strategy to quantify and prioritize key genes underlying cancer drug resistance. The DryNetMC does not only infer gene regulatory networks (GRNs) via an integrated approach, but also characterizes and quantifies dynamical network properties for measuring node importance. We used time-course RNA-seq data from glioma cells treated with dbcAMP (a cAMP activator) as a realistic case to reconstruct the GRNs for sensitive and resistant cells. Based on a novel node importance index that comprehensively quantifies network topology, network entropy and expression dynamics, the top ranked genes were verified to be predictive of the drug sensitivities of different glioma cell lines, in comparison with other existing methods. The proposed method provides a quantitative approach to gain insights into the dynamic adaptation and regulatory mechanisms of cancer drug resistance and sheds light on the design of novel biomarkers or targets for predicting or overcoming drug resistance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dIawfvYo2e4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Modern biological tools generate a wealth of data on metabolite and protein concentrations that can be used to help inform new strain designs. However, learning from these data to predict how a cell will respond to genetic changes, a key need for engineering, remains challenging. A promising technique for leveraging omics measurements in metabolic modeling involves the construction of kinetic descriptions of the enzymatic reactions that occur within a cell. Parameterizing these models from biological data can be computationally difficult, since methods must also quantify the uncertainty in model parameters resulting from the observed data. While the field of Bayesian inference offers a wide range of methods for efficiently estimating distributions in parameter uncertainty, such techniques are poorly suited to traditional kinetic models due to their complex rate laws and resulting nonlinear dynamics. In this paper, we employ linear-logarithmic kinetics to simplify the calculation of steady-state flux distributions and enable efficient sampling and inference methods. We demonstrate that detailed information on the posterior distribution of parameters can be obtained efficiently at a variety of problem scales, including nearly genome-scale kinetic models trained on multiomics datasets. These results allow modern Bayesian machine learning tools to be leveraged in understanding biological data and in developing new, efficient strain designs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NGNzbo-8y0U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Novel comparison of evaluation metrics for gene ontology classifiers reveals drastic performance differences</title>

Automated protein annotation using the Gene Ontology (GO) plays an important role in the biosciences. Evaluation has always been considered central to developing novel annotation methods, but little attention has been paid to the evaluation metrics themselves. Evaluation metrics define how well an annotation method performs and allows for them to be ranked against one another. Unfortunately, most of these metrics were adopted from the machine learning literature without establishing whether they were appropriate for GO annotations. We propose a novel approach for comparing GO evaluation metrics called &lt;i&gt;Artificial Dilution Series&lt;/i&gt; (ADS). Our approach uses existing annotation data to generate a series of annotation sets with different levels of correctness (referred to as their signal level). We calculate the evaluation metric being tested for each annotation set in the series, allowing us to identify whether it can separate different signal levels. Finally, we contrast these results with several &lt;i&gt;false positive annotation sets&lt;/i&gt;, which are designed to expose systematic weaknesses in GO assessment. We compared 37 evaluation metrics for GO annotation using ADS and identified drastic differences between metrics. We show that some metrics struggle to differentiate between different signal levels, while others give erroneously high scores to the false positive data sets. Based on our findings, we provide guidelines on which evaluation metrics perform well with the Gene Ontology and propose improvements to several well-known evaluation metrics. In general, we argue that evaluation metrics should be tested for their performance and we provide software for this purpose (https://bitbucket.org/plyusnin/ads/). ADS is applicable to other areas of science where the evaluation of prediction results is non-trivial.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cyB2HoMU5KA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

A recent hemodynamic model is extended and applied to simulate and explore the feasibility of detecting ocular dominance (OD) and orientation preference (OP) columns in primary visual cortex by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The stimulation entails a short oriented bar stimulus being presented to one eye and mapped to cortical neurons with corresponding OD and OP selectivity. Activated neurons project via patchy connectivity to excite other neurons with similar OP in nearby visual fields located preferentially along the direction of stimulus orientation. The resulting blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response is estimated numerically via the model’s spatiotemporal hemodynamic response function. The results are then used to explore the feasibility of detecting spatial OD-OP modulation, either directly measuring BOLD or by using Wiener deconvolution to filter the image and estimate the underlying neural activity. The effect of noise is also considered and it is estimated that direct detection can be robust for fMRI resolution of around 0.5 mm, whereas detection with Wiener deconvolution is possible at a broader range from 0.125 mm to 1 mm resolution. The detection of OD-OP features is strongly dependent on hemodynamic parameters, such as low velocity and high damping reduce response spreads and result in less blurring. The short-bar stimulus that gives the most detectable response is found to occur when neural projections are at 45 relative to the edge of local OD boundaries, which provides a constraint on the OD-OP architecture even when it is not fully resolved.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9xO3EcnAYnA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Genome segmentation approaches allow us to characterize regulatory states in a given cell type using combinatorial patterns of histone modifications and other regulatory signals. In order to analyze regulatory state differences across cell types, current genome segmentation approaches typically require that the same regulatory genomics assays have been performed in all analyzed cell types. This necessarily limits both the numbers of cell types that can be analyzed and the complexity of the resulting regulatory states, as only a small number of histone modifications have been profiled across many cell types. Data imputation approaches that aim to estimate missing regulatory signals have been applied before genome segmentation. However, this approach is computationally costly and propagates any errors in imputation to produce incorrect genome segmentation results downstream. We present an extension to the IDEAS genome segmentation platform which can perform genome segmentation on incomplete regulatory genomics dataset collections without using imputation. Instead of relying on imputed data, we use an expectation-maximization approach to estimate marginal density functions within each regulatory state. We demonstrate that our genome segmentation results compare favorably with approaches based on imputation or other strategies for handling missing data. We further show that our approach can accurately impute missing data after genome segmentation, reversing the typical order of imputation/genome segmentation pipelines. Finally, we present a new 2D genome segmentation analysis of 127 human cell types studied by the Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium. By using an expanded set of chromatin marks that have been profiled in subsets of these cell types, our new segmentation results capture a more complex picture of combinatorial regulatory patterns that appear on the human genome.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/N6lt84v5eJ0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Intracellular thermometry has recently demonstrated temperatures in the nucleus, mitochondria, and centrosome to be significantly higher than those of the cytoplasm and cell membrane. This local thermogenesis and the resulting temperature gradient could facilitate the development of persistent, self-organizing convection currents in the cytoplasm of large eukaryotes. Using 3-dimensional computational simulations of intracellular fluid motion, we quantify the convective velocities that could result from the temperature differences observed experimentally. Based on these velocities, we identify the conditions necessary for this temperature-driven bulk flow to dominate over random thermal diffusive motion at the scale of a single eukaryotic cell. With temperature gradients of the order 1°C and diffusion coefficients comparable to those described in the literature, Péclet numbers ≥ 1 are feasible and permit comparable or greater effects of convection than diffusion in determining intracellular mass flux. In addition to the temperature gradient, the resulting flow patterns would also depend on the spatial localization of the heat source, the shape of the cell membrane, and the complex intracellular structure including the cytoskeleton. While this intracellular convection would be highly context-dependent, in certain settings, convective motion could provide a previously unrecognized mechanism for directed, bulk transport within eukaryotic cells.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_QBuR-tS69s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Gene expression governs cell fate, and is regulated via a complex interplay of transcription factors and molecules that change chromatin structure. Advances in sequencing-based assays have enabled investigation of these processes genome-wide, leading to large datasets that combine information on the dynamics of gene expression, transcription factor binding and chromatin structure as cells differentiate. While numerous studies focus on the effects of these features on broader gene regulation, less work has been done on the mechanisms of gene-specific transcriptional control. In this study, we have focussed on the latter by integrating gene expression data for the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; differentiation of murine ES cells to macrophages and cardiomyocytes, with dynamic data on chromatin structure, epigenetics and transcription factor binding. Combining a novel strategy to identify communities of related control elements with a penalized regression approach, we developed individual models to identify the potential control elements predictive of the expression of each gene. Our models were compared to an existing method and evaluated using the existing literature and new experimental data using embryonic stem cell differentiation reporter assays. Our method is able to identify transcriptional control elements in a gene specific manner that reflect known regulatory relationships and to generate useful hypotheses for further testing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SCR5bY7z7ho&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Rapid advances in single-cell assays have outpaced methods for analysis of those data types. Different single-cell assays show extensive variation in sensitivity and signal to noise levels. In particular, scATAC-seq generates extremely sparse and noisy datasets. Existing methods developed to analyze this data require cells amenable to pseudo-time analysis or require datasets with drastically different cell-types. We describe a novel approach using self-organizing maps (SOM) to link scATAC-seq regions with scRNA-seq genes that overcomes these challenges and can generate draft regulatory networks. Our SOMatic package generates chromatin and gene expression SOMs separately and combines them using a linking function. We applied SOMatic on a mouse pre-B cell differentiation time-course using controlled Ikaros over-expression to recover gene ontology enrichments, identify motifs in genomic regions showing similar single-cell profiles, and generate a gene regulatory network that both recovers known interactions and predicts new Ikaros targets during the differentiation process. The ability of linked SOMs to detect emergent properties from multiple types of highly-dimensional genomic data with very different signal properties opens new avenues for integrative analysis of heterogeneous data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-83mDO3zsf0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with impaired motor function and several non-motor symptoms, with no available disease modifying treatment. Intracellular accumulation of pathological α-synuclein inclusions is a hallmark of idiopathic PD, whereas, dominant mutations in Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are associated with familial PD that is clinically indistinguishable from idiopathic PD. Recent evidence supports the hypothesis that an increase in LRRK2 kinase activity is associated with the development of not only familial LRRK2 PD, but also idiopathic PD. Previous reports have shown preclinical effects of LRRK2 modulation on α-synuclein-induced neuropathology. Increased subthalamic nucleus (STN) burst firing in preclinical neurotoxin models and PD patients is hypothesized to be causally involved in the development of the motor deficit in PD. To study a potential pathophysiological relationship between α-synuclein pathology and LRRK2 kinase activity in PD, we investigated the effect of chronic LRRK2 inhibition in an AAV-α-synuclein overexpression rat model. In this study, we report that chronic LRRK2 inhibition using PFE-360 only induced a marginal effect on motor function. In addition, the aberrant STN burst firing and associated neurodegenerative processes induced by α-synuclein overexpression model remained unaffected by chronic LRRK2 inhibition. Our findings do not strongly support LRRK2 inhibition for the treatment of PD. Therefore, the reported beneficial effects of LRRK2 inhibition in similar α-synuclein overexpression rodent models must be considered with prudence and additional studies are warranted in alternative α-synuclein-based models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Mutations in LRRK2 and α-synuclein are known risk factors for Parkinson’s disease. α-synuclein aggregates at autopsies in both idiopathic and most G2019S cases is suggestive of a common disease pathogenesis. LRRK2 and α-synuclein interaction is hypothesized to play a pivotal role in the pathological mechanisms. Preclinical &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; evidence of a beneficial effect of LRRK2 inhibition is mixed and limited. This study increases our understanding but underlines the complexity of LRRK2 as a mediator of neuronal dysfunction; importantly, the present findings further outline some of the limitations inherent to the PD model used, and warrant additional preclinical studies in animal models with better relevance to the clinical pathophysiology to draw conclusion on the therapeutic potential of LRRK2 modulation in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The role of neuro-inflammation in the mechanisms of epilepsy development is important because inflammatory mediators provide tractable targets for intervention. Inflammation is intrinsically involved in the generation of childhood febrile seizures (FS), and prolonged FS (febrile status epilepticus, FSE) precede a large proportion of adult temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). As TLE is often refractory to therapy and associated with serious cognitive and emotional problems, we investigated if its development can be prevented using anti-inflammatory strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employing an immature rat model of FSE (eFSE), we administered dexamethasone (DEX), a broad anti-inflammatory agent, over three days following eFSE. We assessed eFSE-provoked hippocampal network hyperexcitability by quantifying the presence, frequency and duration of hippocampal spike series, as these precede and herald the development of TLE-like epilepsy. We tested whether eFSE provoked hippocampal microgliosis, astrocytosis and pro-inflammatory cytokine production in male and female rats and investigated blood-brain barrier (BBB) breaches as a potential contributor. We then evaluated if DEX attenuated these eFSE sequelae.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spike series were not observed in control rats given vehicle or DEX, but occurred in 41.6% of eFSE-Vehicle rats, associated with BBB leakage and elevated hippocampal cytokines. eFSE did not induce astrocytosis or microgliosis but provoked BBB disruption in 60% of animals. DEX significantly reduced spike-series prevalence (to 7.6%) and frequency, and abrogated eFSE-induced cytokine production and BBB leakage (to 20%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that a short, post-insult intervention with a clinically available anti-inflammatory agent potently attenuates epilepsy-predicting hippocampal hyperexcitability, potentially by minimizing BBB disruption and related neuro-inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Epilepsy is the third most common brain disorder. Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) involves limbic circuits and commonly provokes serious cognitive and emotional problems. Because TLE is often refractory to therapy, its prevention would be a powerful and clinically important strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;To accurately detect, track progression of, and develop novel treatments for mental illnesses, a diagnostic framework is needed that is grounded in biological features. Here we present the case for utilizing personalized neuroimaging, computational modeling, standardized computing, and ecologically valid neuroimaging to anchor psychiatric nosology in biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; There is a growing recognition that the boundaries of human neuroimaging data acquisition and analysis must be pushed to ground psychiatric diagnosis in biology. For successful clinical translations, we outline several proposals across the four identified domains of human neuroimaging, namely, (a) reliability of findings; (b) effective clinical translation at the individual subject level; (c) capturing mechanistic insights; and (d) enhancing ecological validity of lab findings. Advances across these domains will be necessary for further progress in psychiatric neuroimaging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Functional dissociation of theta oscillations in the frontal and visual cortices and their long-range network during sustained attention</title>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Theta-band (4–12 Hz) activities in the frontal cortex have been thought to be a key mechanism of sustained attention and goal-related behaviors, forming a phase-coherent network with task-related sensory cortices for integrated neuronal ensembles. However, recent visual task studies found that selective attention attenuates stimulus-related theta power in the visual cortex, suggesting a functional dissociation of cortical theta oscillations. To investigate this contradictory behavior of cortical theta, a visual Go/No-Go task was performed with electroencephalogram recording in C57BL/6J mice. During the No-Go period, transient theta oscillations were observed in both the frontal and visual cortices, but theta oscillations of the two areas were prominent in different trial epochs. By separating trial epochs based on subjects’ short-term performance, we found that frontal theta was prominent in good-performance epochs, while visual theta was prominent in bad-performance epochs, exhibiting a functional dissociation of cortical theta rhythms. Furthermore, the two theta rhythms also showed a heterogeneous pattern of phase-amplitude coupling with fast oscillations, reflecting their distinct architecture in underlying neuronal circuitry. Interestingly, in good-performance epochs, where visual theta was relatively weak, stronger fronto-visual long-range synchrony and shorter posterior-to-anterior temporal delay were found. These findings highlight a previously overlooked aspect of long-range synchrony between distinct oscillatory entities in the cerebral cortex and provide empirical evidence of a functional dissociation of cortical theta rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Previous literature emphasized the pro-cognitive role of coherent oscillatory networks between distal brain regions, such as the fronto-visual theta synchrony. However, such a conceptual framework has been challenged as recent findings revealed distinct behavioral correlates of theta oscillations found in different cortical regions, especially in the frontal and visual cortices. Here, we show that frontal and visual theta represent distinct cortical processes and that the functional connectivity between them increases during sustained attention, especially when one of the two theta rhythms is relatively suppressed. The data presented here highlight a novel aspect of neural long-range synchrony between distinct cortical oscillators with distinct functional significance in task performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Impaired reliability and precision of spiking in adults but not juveniles in a mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common source of intellectual disability and autism. Extensive studies have been performed on the network and behavioral correlates of the syndrome but our knowledge about intrinsic conductance changes is still limited. In this study we show a differential effect of FMRP Knock Out (KO) in different sub-sections of hippocampus using whole cell patch clamp in mouse hippocampal slices. We observed no significant change in spike numbers in the CA1 region of hippocampus but a significant increase in CA3, in juvenile mice. However, in adult mice we see a reduction in spike number in the CA1 with no significant difference in CA3. In addition, we see increased variability in spike number in CA1 cells following a variety of steady and modulated current step protocols. This effect emerges in adult (8 weeks) but not juvenile (4 weeks) mice. This increased spiking variability was correlated with reduced spike number and with elevated AHP. The increased AHP arose from elevated SK currents (small conductance calcium activated potassium channels) but other currents involved in mAHP, such as I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; and M, were not significantly different. We obtained a partial rescue of the cellular variability phenotype when we blocked SK current using the specific blocker apamin. Our observations provide a single cell correlate of the network observations of response variability and loss of synchronization, and suggest that elevation of SK currents in FXS may provide a partial mechanistic explanation for this difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Fragile-X syndrome leads to a range of intellectual disability effects and autism. We have found differential effect of FMRP KO in different sub sections of hippocampus where it caused an increased spiking in CA3 in juveniles and reduced spiking in CA1, in adults. We have also found that even individual neurons with this mutation exhibit increased variability in their activity patterns. Importantly, this effect emerges after six weeks of age in mice. We showed that a specific ion channel protein, SK channel, was partially responsible, and blockage of these channels led to a partial restoration of cellular activity. This is interesting as it provides a possible molecular link between activity variability in single cells, and reported irregularity in network activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 59 children, yet except for rare genetic causes, the etiology in most ASD remains unknown. In the ASD brain, inflammatory cytokine and transcript profiling shows increased expression of genes encoding mediators of the innate immune response. We evaluated postmortem brain tissue for adaptive immune cells and immune cell–mediated cytotoxic damage that could drive this innate immune response in the ASD brain.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard neuropathology diagnostic methods including histology and immunohistochemistry were extended with automated image segmentation to quantify identified pathologic features in the postmortem brains.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report multifocal perivascular lymphocytic cuffs contain increased numbers of lymphocytes in ~65% of ASD compared to control brains in males and females, across all ages, in most brain regions, and in white and gray matter, and leptomeninges. CD3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T lymphocytes predominate over CD20&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; B lymphocytes and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; over CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T lymphocytes in ASD brains. Importantly, the perivascular cuff lymphocyte numbers correlate to the quantity of astrocyte‐derived round membranous blebs. Membranous blebs form as a cytotoxic reaction to lymphocyte attack. Consistent with multifocal immune cell–mediated injury at perivascular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)–brain barriers, a subset of white matter vessels have increased perivascular space (with jagged contours) and collagen in ASD compared to control brains. CSF–brain barrier pathology is also evident at cerebral cortex pial and ventricular ependymal surfaces in ASD.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest dysregulated cellular immunity damages astrocytes at foci along the CSF–brain barrier in ASD. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Cortical credit assignment by Hebbian, neuromodulatory and inhibitory plasticity. (arXiv:1911.00307v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The cortex learns to make associations between stimuli and spiking activity
which supports behaviour. It does this by adjusting synaptic weights. The
complexity of these transformations implies that synapses have to change
without access to the full error information, a problem typically referred to
as &quot;credit-assignment&quot;. However, it remains unknown how the cortex solves this
problem. We propose that a combination of plasticity rules, 1) Hebbian, 2)
acetylcholine-dependent and 3) noradrenaline-dependent excitatory plasticity,
together with 4) inhibitory plasticity restoring E/I balance, effectively
solves the credit assignment problem. We derive conditions under-which a neuron
model can learn a number of associations approaching its theoretical capacity.
We confirm our predictions regarding acetylcholine-dependent and inhibitory
plasticity by reanalysing experimental data. Our work suggests that detailed
cortical E/I balance reduces the dimensionality of the problem of associating
inputs with outputs, thereby allowing imperfect &quot;supervision&quot; by
neuromodulatory systems to guide learning effectively.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Spontaneous back-pain alters randomness in functional connections in large scale brain networks: A random matrix perspective. (arXiv:1911.00072v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00072</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00072</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We use randomness as a measure to assess the impact of evoked pain on brain
networks. Randomness is defined here as the intrinsic correlations that exist
between different brain regions when the brain is in a task-free state. We use
fMRI data of three brain states in a set of back pain patients monitored over a
period of 6 months. We find that randomness in the task-free state closely
follows the predictions of Gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrices.
However, the randomness decreases when the brain is engaged in attending to
painful inputs in patients suffering with early stages of back pain. A
persistence of this pattern is observed in the patients that develop chronic
back pain, while the patients who recover from pain after six months, the
randomness no longer varies with the pain task. The study demonstrates the
effectiveness of random matrix theory in differentiating between resting state
and two distinct task states within the same patient. Further, it demonstrates
that random matrix theory is effective in measuring systematic changes
occurring in functional connectivity and offers new insights on how acute and
chronic pain are processed in the brain at a network level.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Short-term and spike-timing-dependent plasticities facilitate the formation of modular neural networks. (arXiv:1911.00052v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00052</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00052</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The brain has the phenomenal ability to reorganize itself by forming new
connections among neurons and by pruning others. The so-called neural or brain
plasticity facilitates the modification of brain structure and function over
different time scales. Plasticity might occur due to external stimuli received
from the environment, during recovery from brain injury, or due to
modifications within the body and brain itself. In this paper, we study the
combined effect of short-term (STP) and spike-timing-dependent plasticities
(STDP) on the synaptic strength of excitatory coupled Hodgkin-Huxley neurons
and show that plasticity can facilitate the formation of modular neural
networks with complex topologies that resemble those of networks with
preferential attachment properties. In particular, we use an STDP rule that
alters the synaptic coupling intensity based on time intervals between spikes
of postsynaptic and presynaptic neurons. Previous works have shown that STDP
may induce the appearance of directed connections from high to low-frequency
spiking neurons. On the other hand, STP is attributed to the release of
neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft of neurons that alter its synaptic
efficiency. Our results suggest that the combined effect of STP and STDP with
high recovery time facilitates the formation of connections among neurons with
similar spike frequencies only, a kind of preferential attachment. We then
pursue this further and show that, when starting with all-to-all neural
configurations, depending on the STP recovery time and distribution of neural
frequencies, modular neural networks can emerge as a direct result of the
combined effect of STP and STDP.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: AHA! an 'Artificial Hippocampal Algorithm' for Episodic Machine Learning. (arXiv:1909.10340v3 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10340</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The majority of ML research concerns slow, statistical learning of i.i.d.
samples from large, labelled datasets. Animals do not learn this way. An
enviable characteristic of animal learning is 'episodic' learning - the ability
to rapidly memorize a specific experience as a composition of existing
concepts, without provided labels. The new knowledge can then be used to
distinguish between similar experiences, to generalize between classes, and to
selectively consolidate to long-term memory. The Hippocampus is known to be
vital to these abilities. AHA is a biologically-plausible computational model
of the Hippocampus. Unlike most machine learning models, AHA is trained without
any external labels and uses only local and immediate credit assignment. We
demonstrate AHA in a superset of the Omniglot classification benchmark. The
extended benchmark covers a wider range of known Hippocampal functions by
testing pattern separation, completion, and reconstruction of original input.
These functions are all performed within a single configuration of the
computational model. Despite these constraints, results are comparable to
state-of-the-art deep convolutional ANNs. In addition to the demonstrated high
degree of functional overlap with the Hippocampal region, AHA is remarkably
aligned to current macro-scale biological models and uses biologically
plausible micro-scale learning rules.

	<description>Pseudokinases are considered to be the inactive counterparts of conventional protein kinases and comprise approximately 10% of the human and mouse kinomes. Here we report the crystal structure of the &lt;i&gt;Legionella pneumophila&lt;/i&gt; effector protein, SidJ, in complex with the eukaryotic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-binding regulator, calmodulin (CaM). The structure reveals that SidJ contains a protein kinase-like fold domain, which retains a majority of the characteristic kinase catalytic motifs. However, SidJ fails to demonstrate kinase activity. Instead, mass spectrometry and in vitro biochemical analyses demonstrate that SidJ modifies another &lt;i&gt;Legionella&lt;/i&gt; effector SdeA, an unconventional phosphoribosyl ubiquitin ligase, by adding glutamate molecules to a specific residue of SdeA in a CaM-dependent manner. Furthermore, we show that SidJ-mediated polyglutamylation suppresses the ADP-ribosylation activity. Our work further implies that some pseudokinases may possess ATP-dependent activities other than conventional phosphorylation.</description>

	<description>Hearing and balance rely on small sensory hair cells that reside in the inner ear. To explore dynamic changes in the abundant proteins present in differentiating hair cells, we used nanoliter-scale shotgun mass spectrometry of single cells, each ~1 picoliter, from utricles of embryonic day 15 chickens. We identified unique constellations of proteins or protein groups from presumptive hair cells and from progenitor cells. The single-cell proteomes enabled the &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; reconstruction of a developmental trajectory using protein expression levels, revealing proteins that greatly increased in expression during differentiation of hair cells (e.g., OCM, CRABP1, GPX2, AK1, GSTO1) and those that decreased during differentiation (e.g., TMSB4X, AGR3). Complementary single-cell transcriptome profiling showed corresponding changes in mRNA during maturation of hair cells. Single-cell proteomics data thus can be mined to reveal features of cellular development that may be missed with transcriptomics.</description>

	<description>The formation and spatial arrangement of chromosome territories (CTs) during interphase has been posited to influence the outcome and frequency of genomic translocations. This is supported by correlations between the frequency of inter-chromosomal contacts and translocation events in myriad systems. However, it remains unclear if CT formation itself influences the translocation potential of cells. We address this question in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; cells by modulating the level of Condensin II, which regulates CT organization. Using whole-chromosome Oligopaints to identify genomic rearrangements, we find that increased contact frequencies between chromosomes due to Condensin II knockdown leads to an increased propensity to form translocations following DNA damage. Moreover, Condensin II over-expression is sufficient to drive spatial separation of CTs and attenuate the translocation potential of cells. Together, these results provide the first causal evidence that proper CT formation can protect the genome from potentially deleterious translocations in the presence of DNA damage.</description>

	<description>IFI16, an innate immune DNA sensor, recognizes the nuclear episomal herpes viral genomes and induces the inflammasome and interferon-β responses. IFI16 also regulates cellular transcription and act as a DNA virus restriction factor. IFI16 knockdown disrupted the latency of Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and induced lytic transcripts. However, the mechanism of IFI16's transcription regulation is unknown. Here, we show that IFI16 is in complex with the H3K9 methyltransferase SUV39H1 and GLP and recruits them to the KSHV genome during &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; infection and latency. The resulting depositions of H3K9me2/me3 serve as a docking site for the heterochromatin inducing HP1α protein leading into the IFI16 dependent epigenetic modifications and silencing of KSHV lytic genes. These studies suggest that IFI16's interaction with H3K9MTases is one of the potential mechanisms by which IFI16 regulates transcription and establish an important paradigm of an innate immune sensor's involvement in epigenetic silencing of foreign DNA.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/48828</link>
	<description>Human Tim8a and Tim8b are members of an intermembrane space chaperone network, known as the small TIM family. Mutations in &lt;i&gt;TIMM8A&lt;/i&gt; cause a neurodegenerative disease, Mohr-Tranebjærg syndrome (MTS), which is characterised by sensorineural hearing loss, dystonia and blindness. Nothing is known about the function of hTim8a in neuronal cells or how mutation of this protein leads to a neurodegenerative disease. We show that hTim8a is required for the assembly of Complex IV in neurons, which is mediated through a transient interaction with Complex IV assembly factors, in particular the copper chaperone COX17. Complex IV assembly defects resulting from loss of hTim8a leads to oxidative stress and changes to key apoptotic regulators, including cytochrome c and Bax, which primes cells for death. Alleviation of oxidative stress by Vitamin E rescues cells from apoptotic vulnerability. We hypothesise that enhanced sensitivity of neuronal cells to apoptosis is the underlying mechanism of MTS.</description>

	<description>Alexander Disease (AxD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which supports the structural integrity of astrocytes. Over 70 GFAP missense mutations cause AxD, but the mechanism linking different mutations to disease-relevant phenotypes remains unknown. We used AxD patient brain tissue and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived astrocytes to investigate the hypothesis that AxD-causing mutations perturb key post-translational modifications (PTMs) on GFAP. Our findings reveal selective phosphorylation of GFAP-Ser13 in patients who died young, independently of the mutation they carried. AxD iPSC-astrocytes accumulated pSer13-GFAP in cytoplasmic aggregates within deep nuclear invaginations, resembling the hallmark Rosenthal fibers observed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Ser13 phosphorylation facilitated GFAP aggregation and was associated with increased GFAP proteolysis by caspase-6. Furthermore, caspase-6 was selectively expressed in young AxD patients, and correlated with the presence of cleaved GFAP. We reveal a novel PTM signature linking different GFAP mutations in infantile AxD.</description>

	<description>Since the early 1970s, numerous behavioral studies have shown that self-generated touch feels less intense than the same touch applied externally. Computational motor control theories have suggested that cerebellar internal models predict the somatosensory consequences of our movements and that these predictions attenuate the perception of the actual touch. Despite this influential theoretical framework, little is known about the neural basis of this predictive attenuation. This is due to the limited number of neuroimaging studies, the presence of conflicting results about the role and the location of cerebellar activity, and the lack of behavioral measures accompanying the neural findings. Here, we combined psychophysics with functional magnetic resonance imaging to detect the neural processes underlying somatosensory attenuation in male and female healthy human participants. Activity in bilateral secondary somatosensory areas was attenuated when the touch was presented during a self-generated movement (self-generated touch) than in the absence of movement (external touch). An additional attenuation effect was observed in the cerebellum that is ipsilateral to the passive limb receiving the touch. Importantly, we further found that the degree of functional connectivity between the ipsilateral cerebellum and the contralateral primary and bilateral secondary somatosensory areas was linearly and positively related to the degree of behaviorally assessed attenuation; that is, the more participants perceptually attenuated their self-generated touches, the stronger this corticocerebellar coupling. Collectively, these results suggest that the ipsilateral cerebellum is fundamental in predicting self-generated touch and that this structure implements somatosensory attenuation via its functional connectivity with somatosensory areas.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Alpha-synuclein antisense oligonucleotides as a disease-modifying therapy for Parkinson\'s disease</title>

	<description>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disease with no approved disease-modifying therapies. Multiplications, mutations, and single nucleotide polymorphisms in the SNCA gene, encoding alpha-synuclein protein (aSyn), either cause or increase risk for PD. Intracellular accumulations of aSyn are pathological hallmarks of PD. Taken together, reduction of aSyn production may provide a disease-modifying therapy for PD. We show that antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) reduce production of aSyn in rodent pre-formed fibril (PFF) models of PD. Reduced aSyn production leads to prevention and removal of established aSyn pathology and prevents dopaminergic cell dysfunction. In addition, we address the translational potential of the approach through characterization of human SNCA targeting ASOs that efficiently suppress the human SNCA transcript in vivo. We demonstrate broad activity and distribution of the human SNCA ASOs throughout the non-human primate brain and a corresponding decrease in aSyn cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) levels. Taken together, these data suggest that by inhibiting production of aSyn it may be possible to reverse established pathology and thus supports the development of SNCA ASOs as a potentially disease modifying therapy for PD and related synucleinopathies.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Robust, general purpose, digital power line hum filter which is free of deformations and which can be applied to large transients</title>

	<description>Power line interference (&quot;hum noise&quot;) is a common source of noise in recorded biological data. It has a highly constant frequency with harmonics and little variation in amplitude and wave shape. In contrast to stochastic noise it is phasic, i.e., the phase relation remains constant across long intervals. In digital recordings, the measurement frequency is typically very close to a multiple of the hum frequency (50 or 60 Hz). Common filters introduce various kinds of distortions and errors. The here proposed subtraction method makes use of the specific properties of power line hum. For this, it computes a moving estimate of the hum noise by taking the periodic median of the high-pass filtered signal. The resulting periodic median subtraction (PMS) filter reliably removes hum of any harmonic composition, even if the ground frequency is lacking. The filter is completely free of border artifacts. It does not introduce distortions, even if around sharp transients such as in force plate recordings of jumping. The filter is validated on recorded and artificial data. The errors are quantified. The results also show that the errors of hum filters generally increase with the high-frequency content of the data. Thus, the removal of hum from a force plate recording generally gives better results than from an EMG recoding. Compared to other filters, the errors of the PMS filter are generally lower than the best hum filters currently known.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Decoding and encoding models reveal how the depth of processing shapes the brain representation of meaning</title>

	<description>How the brain representation of conceptual knowledge vary as a function of processing goals remains unclear. We hypothesized that the brain representation of semantic categories is shaped by the depth of processing. Participants were presented with visual words during functional MRI. During shallow processing, participants had to read the items. During deep processing, they had to mentally simulate the features associated with the words. Multivariate classification, informational connectivity and encoding models were used to reveal how the depth of processing determines the brain representation of word meaning. Decoding accuracy in putative substrates of the semantic network was enhanced when the depth processing was high, and the brain representations were more generalizable in semantic space relative to shallow processing contexts. This pattern was observed even in association areas in inferior frontal and parietal cortex. Deep information processing during mental simulation also increased the informational connectivity within key substrates of the semantic network. To further examine the properties of the words encoded in brain activity, we compared computer vision models - associated with the image referents of the words - and word embeddings. Computer vision models explained more variance of the brain responses across multiple areas of the semantic network. These results indicate that the brain representation of word meaning is highly malleable by the depth of processing imposed by the task, rely on access to visual representations and are indeed highly distributed, including prefrontal areas thought to be primarily implicated in semantic control rather than representation.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Dynamic connectivity maps of pericytes and endothelial cells mediate neurovascular coupling in health and disease</title>

	<description>Functional hyperemia, or matching blood flow to activity, is spatially accurate to direct the oxygen and nutrients to regionally firing neurons. The underlying signaling mechanisms of neurovascular coupling remain unclear, but are critical for brain function and establish the diagnostic power of BOLD-fMRI. Here, we described a mosaic of pericytes, the vasomotor capillary cells in the living retina. We then tested if this symmetric net of pericytes and surrounding neuroglia predicted a connectivity map in response to sensory stimuli. Surprisingly, we found that these connections were not only discriminatory across cell types, but also highly asymmetric spatially. First, pericytes connected predominantly to other neighboring pericytes and endothelial cells, and less to arteriolar smooth muscle cells, and not to surrounding neurons or glia. Second, focal, but not global stimulation evoked a directional vasomotor response by strengthening connections along the feeding vascular branch. This activity required local NO signaling and occurred by means of direct coupling via gap-junctions. By contrast, bath application of NO or diabetes, a common microvascular pathology, not only weakened the vascular signaling but also abolished its directionality. We conclude that the discriminatory nature of neurovascular interactions may thus establish spatial accuracy of blood delivery with the precision of the neuronal receptive field size, and is disrupted early in microvascular disease.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Immediate activation of chemosensory neuron gene expression by bacterial metabolites is selectively induced by distinct cyclic GMP-dependent pathways in C. elegans</title>

	<description>Dynamic gene expression in neurons shapes fundamental processes of the nervous systems of animals. But how different stimuli that activate the same neuron can lead to distinct transcriptional responses remains unclear. We have been studying how microbial metabolites modulate gene expression in chemosensory neurons of Caenorhabditis elegans . Considering the diverse environmental stimuli that can activate chemosensory neurons of C. elegans, we have sought to understand how specific transcriptional responses can be generated in these neurons in response to distinct cues. We have focused on the mechanism of rapid (&amp;lt;6 min) and selective transcriptional induction of daf-7 , a gene encoding a TGF-{beta} ligand that promotes bacterial lawn avoidance, in the ASJ chemosensory neurons in response to the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Here, we define the involvement of two distinct cyclic GMP (cGMP)-dependent pathways that are required for daf-7 expression in the ASJ neuron pair in response to P. aeruginosa . We show that a calcium-independent pathway dependent on the cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG) EGL-4, and a canonical calcium-dependent signaling pathway dependent on the activity of a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel subunit CNG-2, function in parallel to activate rapid, selective transcription of daf-7 in response to P. aeruginosa metabolites. Our data suggest a requirement for PKG in promoting the fast, selective early transcription of neuronal genes in shaping responses to distinct microbial stimuli in a pair of chemosensory neurons of C. elegan s.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Dentate gyrus somatostatin cells are required for contextual discrimination during episodic memory encoding</title>

	<description>Episodic memory establishes and stores relations among the different elements of an experience, which are often similar and difficult to distinguish. Pattern separation, implemented by the dentate gyrus, is a neural mechanism that allows the discrimination of similar experiences by orthogonalizing synaptic inputs. Granule cells support such disambiguation by sparse rate coding, a process tightly controlled by highly diversified GABAergic neuronal populations, such as somatostatin-expressing cells which directly target the dendritic arbor of granule cells, massively innervated by entorhinal inputs reaching the molecular layer and conveying contextual information. Here, we tested the hypothesis that somatostatin neurons regulate the excitability of the dentate gyrus, thus controlling the efficacy of pattern separation during memory encoding in mice. Indeed, optogenetic suppression of dentate gyrus somatostatin neurons increased spiking activity in putative excitatory neurons and triggered dentate spikes. Moreover, optical inhibition of somatostatin neurons impaired both contextual and spatial discrimination of overlapping episodic-like memories during task acquisition. Importantly, effects were specific for similar environments, suggesting that pattern separation was selectively engaged when overlapping conditions ought to be distinguished. Overall, our results suggest that somatostatin cells regulate excitability in the dentate gyrus and are required for effective pattern separation during episodic memory encoding.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Noise-Dampening Ear-Protectors improve performance on the heartbeat tracking task, but do not necessarily enhance interoception.</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/830141v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/830141v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Previous research utilising a between-subjects design indicates that the use of noise-dampening ear-protectors might enhance interoceptive accuracy (IAcc). In the present study, we further examined this effect using a repeated-measures, within-participants design, and investigated potential mechanisms that might explain the effect. 50 participants completed the heartbeat tracking task (HTT) with and without the use of ear-protectors, in a counter-balanced order. Participants were asked to count the number of heartbeats occurring in five discrete time intervals of 25, 35, 45, 55 and 95 seconds, without feeling for a manual pulse. HTT scores were significantly higher when ear-protectors were worn, and the improvement in performance was greatest for participants with lower baseline IAcc. Participants also performed more consistently across the five trials when wearing the ear-protectors. The ear-protectors were associated with significantly increased self-reported heartbeat audibility, concentration, and task-related confidence, and decreased levels of distractibility. Heartbeat audibility was also correlated with HTT performance when the ear-protectors were worn. The exteroceptive nature of the feedback from the ear-protectors therefore precludes the utility of this manipulation to assess causal hypotheses related to changes in IAcc. However, it may serve as a simple, non-invasive paradigm to assess the effects of externalised interoceptive signals.</description>

	<description>A key aspect of human cognitive flexibility concerns the ability to rapidly convert complex symbolic instructions into novel behaviors. Previous research proposes that this fast configuration is supported by two differentiated neurocognitive states, namely, an initial declarative maintenance of task knowledge, and a progressive transformation into a pragmatic, action-oriented state necessary for optimal task execution. Furthermore, current models predict a crucial role of frontal and parietal brain regions in this transformation. However, direct evidence for such frontoparietal formatting of novel task representations is still lacking. Here, we report the results of an fMRI experiment in which participants had to execute novel instructed stimulus-response associations. We then used a multivariate pattern-tracking procedure to quantify the degree of neural activation of instructions in declarative and procedural representational formats. This analysis revealed, for the first time, format-unique representations of relevant task sets in frontoparietal areas, prior to execution. Critically, the degree of procedural (but not declarative) activation predicted subsequent behavioral performance. Our results shed light on current debates on the architecture of cognitive control and working memory systems, suggesting a contribution of frontoparietal regions to output gating mechanisms that drive behavior.</description>

	<description>Skilled reading requires years of practice to learn to associate visual symbols (graphemes) with speech sounds (phonemes). Over the course of the learning process, this association becomes almost effortless and automatic. Here we hypothesize that automatic activation of phonological processing circuits in response to a visually presented word is a hallmark of skilled reading. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to measure cortical evoked responses to printed words while children engaged in an attention-demanding fixation task in which their attention was directed away from the words. We found strong activation in brain regions involved in speech sound processing, namely the superior temporal gyrus (STG). This automatic response to visually presented words in a canonical language region was indicative of good reading skills: the visual stimulus-driven STG response was only present in skilled readers but not in children with dyslexia. Our results suggest that automatic recruitment of phonological processing circuits is a hallmark of skilled reading; with practice, reading becomes effortless as the brain learns to automatically translate letters into sounds and meaning.</description>

	<description>Understanding the moment-to-moment dynamics of functional connectivity (FC) in the human brain during early development is crucial for uncovering neuro-mechanisms of the emerging complex cognitive functions and behaviors. Instead of calculating FC in a static perspective, we leveraged a longitudinal resting-state functional magnetic resonances imaging dataset from fifty-one typically developing infants and, for the first time, thoroughly investigated how the temporal variability of the FC architecture develops at the global (entire brain), meso- (functional system) and local (brain region) levels in the first two years of age. Our results revealed that, in such a pivotal stage, 1) the whole-brain FC dynamics is linearly increased; 2) the high-order functional systems display increased FC dynamics for both within- and between-network connections, while the primary systems show the opposite trajectories; 3) many frontal regions have increasing FC dynamics despite large heterogeneity in developmental trajectories and velocities. All these findings indicate that the brain is gradually reconfigured towards a more flexible, dynamic, and adaptive system with globally increasing but locally heterogeneous trajectories in the first two postnatal years, explaining why infants have emerging and rapidly developing high-order cognitive functions and complex behaviors.</description>

	<description>Increasing evidence implicates cerebral microvascular dysfunction in the pathophysiology of numerous central nervous system pathologies, including stroke. Understanding the molecular alterations in cerebral microvessels in these conditions will provide original opportunities for scientific investigation at the pre-clinical and clinical levels. In this study, we conducted a novel genome-wide transcriptomic analysis of microvessels in a mouse model of transient focal cerebral ischemia. Using a publicly available human ischemic stroke dataset, we identified shared alterations in our microvessel dataset with implications for human pathophysiology. From this unbiased analysis, we report predicted alterations in inter- and intra-cellular signaling, emphasizing perturbations in genes involved in blood brain barrier function, endothelial cell activation and metabolism. Furthermore, our study unveiled previously unreported gene expression changes associated with altered sphingolipid metabolism. Altogether, our results have identified microvessel-specific transcriptomic changes in a number of translationally relevant pathways that support the targeting of these pathways in preclinical studies. The data shared here provide a resource for future investigation of translationally relevant pathways in ischemic stroke.</description>

	<description>Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a major side effect from cancer treatment with no known method for prevention or cure in clinics. CIPN primarily affects unmyelinated nociceptive sensory terminals. Despite the high prevalence of CIPN, molecular and cellular mechanisms that lead to CIPN are still poorly understood. Here, we used a genetically tractable Drosophila model and primary sensory neurons isolated from adult mouse to examine the mechanisms underlying CIPN and identify protective pathways. We found that chronic treatment of Drosophila larvae with paclitaxel caused sensory neuron degeneration, altered the terminal branching pattern of nociceptive neurons, and reduced thermal nociceptive responses. We found that nociceptive neuron-specific overexpression of integrins, which are known to support neuronal maintenance in several systems, conferred protection from paclitaxel-mediated cellular and behavioral phenotypes. Live imaging and superresolution approaches provide evidence that paclitaxel treatment causes cellular changes that are consistent with alterations in endosome-mediated trafficking of integrins. We used primary dorsal root ganglia neuron cultures to test conservation of integrin-mediated protection. We show that overexpression of a human integrin {beta} subunit 1 (ITGB1) also prevented degeneration following paclitaxel treatment. Altogether, our study supports conserved mechanisms of paclitaxel-induced perturbation of integrin trafficking and a therapeutic potential of restoring integrin levels to antagonize paclitaxel-mediated toxicity in sensory neurons.</description>

	<description>Objective: The hippocampus is considered a putative marker in schizophrenia with early volume deficits of select subfields. Certain subregions are thought to be more vulnerable due to a glutamate-driven mechanism of excitotoxicity, hypermetabolism, and then degeneration. Here, we explored whether hippocampal anomalies in first-episode psychosis (FEP) correlate with glutamate receptor density via a serotonin receptor proxy by leveraging structural neuroimaging, spectroscopy (MRS), and gene expression. Methods: High field 7T brain MR images were collected from 27 control, 41 FEP participants, along with 1H-MRS measures of glutamate. Automated methods were used to delineate the hippocampus and atlases of the serotonin receptor system were used to map receptor density across the hippocampus and subfields. We used gene expression data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas to test for correlations between serotonin and glutamate receptor genes. Results: We found reduced hippocampal volumes in FEP, replicating previous findings. Amongst the subfields, CA4-dentate gyrus showed greatest reductions. Gene expression analysis indicated 5-HTR1A and 5-HTR4 receptor subtypes as predictors of AMPA and NMDA receptor expression, respectively. Volumetric differences in the subfields correlated most strongly with 5-HT1A (R=0.64, p=4.09E-03) and 5-HT4 (R=0.54, p=0.02) densities as expected, and replicated using previously published data from two FEP studies. Measures of individual structure-receptor alignment were derived through normative modeling of hippocampal shape and correlations to receptor distributions, termed Receptor-Specific Morphometric Signatures (RSMS). Right-sided 5-HT4 RSMS was correlated with glutamate (R=0.357, p=0.048). Conclusions: We demonstrate glutamate-driven hippocampal remodeling in FEP through a receptor-density gated mechanism, thus providing a mechanistic explanation of how redox dysregulation affects brain structure and symptomatic heterogeneity in schizophrenia.</description>

	<description>Deep neural networks often require very large volume of training examples, whereas children can learn concepts such as hand-written digits with few examples. The goal of this project is to develop a deep spiking neural network that can learn from few training trials. Using known neuronal mechanisms, a spiking neural network model is developed and trained to recognize hand-written digits with presenting one to four training examples for each digit taken from the MNIST database. The model detects and learns geometric features of the images from MNIST database. In this work, a novel biological back-propagation based learning rule is developed and used to a train the network to detect basic features of different digits. For this purpose, randomly initialized synaptic weights between the layers are being updated. By using a neuroscience inspired mechanism named synaptic pruning and a predefined threshold, some of the synapses through the training are deleted. Hence, information channels are constructed that are highly specific for each digit as matrix of synaptic connections between two layers of spiking neural networks. These connection matrices named information channels are used in the test phase to assign a digit class to each test image. As similar to humans' abilities to learn from small training trials, the developed spiking neural network needs a very small data-set for training, compared to conventional deep learning methods checked on MNIST dataset.</description>

	<description>While humans and other animals exhibit adaptation to odorants, the neural mechanisms involved in this process are incompletely understood. One possibility is that it primarily occurs as a result of the interactions between odorants and odorant receptors expressed on the olfactory sensory neurons in the olfactory epithelium. In this scenario, adaptation would arise as a peripheral phenomenon transmitted into the brain. An alternative possibility is that adaptation occurs as a result of processing in the brain. Here we asked whether the olfactory bulb, the first stage of olfactory information processing in the brain, is involved in perceptual adaptation. Multicolor imaging was used to simultaneously measure the olfactory receptor nerve terminals (input) and mitral/tufted cell apical dendrites (output) that innervate the olfactory bulb glomerular layer. Repeated odor stimulation of the same concentration resulted in a decline in the output maps, while the input remained relatively stable. The results indicate that the mammalian olfactory bulb participates in olfactory adaptation.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Competing endogenous RNA crosstalk at system level</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Mattia Miotto, Enzo Marinari, Andrea De Martino&lt;/p&gt;

microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional level by repressing target RNA molecules. Competition to bind miRNAs tends in turn to correlate their targets, establishing effective RNA-RNA interactions that can influence expression levels, buffer fluctuations and promote signal propagation. Such a potential has been characterized mathematically for small motifs both at steady state and away from stationarity. Experimental evidence, on the other hand, suggests that competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) crosstalk is rather weak. Extended miRNA-RNA networks could however favour the integration of many crosstalk interactions, leading to significant large-scale effects in spite of the weakness of individual links. To clarify the extent to which crosstalk is sustained by the miRNA interactome, we have studied its emergent systemic features &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; in large-scale miRNA-RNA network reconstructions. We show that, although generically weak, system-level crosstalk patterns (i) are enhanced by transcriptional heterogeneities, (ii) can achieve high-intensity even for RNAs that are not co-regulated, (iii) are robust to variability in transcription rates, and (iv) are significantly non-local, i.e. correlate weakly with miRNA-RNA interaction parameters. Furthermore, RNA levels are generically more stable when crosstalk is strongest. As some of these features appear to be encoded in the network’s topology, crosstalk may functionally be favoured by natural selection. These results suggest that, besides their repressive role, miRNAs mediate a weak but resilient and context-independent network of cross-regulatory interactions that interconnect the transcriptome, stabilize expression levels and support system-level responses.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3lY_PVh3HUI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: The TRPA1 Ion Channel Contributes to Sensory-Guided Avoidance of Menthol in Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The flavoring agent menthol elicits complex orosensory and behavioral effects including perceived cooling at low concentrations and irritation and ingestive avoidance at higher intensities. Oral menthol engages the cold-activated transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel TRP melastatin 8 (TRPM8) on trigeminal fibers, although its aversive feature was discussed to involve activation of TRP ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) associated with nociceptive processing. Here, we studied the roles of TRPM8 and TRPA1 in orosensory responding to menthol by subjecting mice gene deficient for either channel to brief-access exposure tests, which measure immediate licking responses to fluid stimuli to capture sensory/tongue control of behavior. Stimuli included aqueous concentration series of (–)-menthol [0 (water), 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.3 mM] and the aversive bitter taste stimulus quinine-HCl (0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, and 3 mM). Concentration-response data were generated from daily brief-access tests conducted in lickometers, which recorded the number of licks water-restricted mice emitted to a randomly selected stimulus concentration over a block of several 10-s stimulus presentations. Wild-type mice showed aversive orosensory responses to menthol above 0.7 mM. Oral aversion to menthol was reduced in mice deficient for TRPA1 but not TRPM8. Oral aversion to quinine was similar between TRPA1 mutant and control mice but stronger than avoidance of menthol. This implied menthol avoidance under the present conditions represented a moderate form of oral aversion. These data reveal TRPA1 contributes to the oral sensory valence of menthol and have implications for how input from TRPA1 and TRPM8 shapes somatosensory-guided behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Differential Adaptation in Azimuth and Elevation to Acute Monaural Spatial Hearing after Training with Visual Feedback</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Sound localization in the horizontal plane (azimuth) relies mainly on binaural difference cues in sound level and arrival time. Blocking one ear will perturb these cues, and may strongly affect azimuth performance of the listener. However, single-sided deaf listeners, as well as acutely single-sided plugged normal-hearing subjects, often use a combination of (ambiguous) monaural head-shadow cues, impoverished binaural level-difference cues, and (veridical, but limited) pinna- and head-related spectral cues to estimate source azimuth. To what extent listeners can adjust the relative contributions of these different cues is unknown, as the mechanisms underlying adaptive processes to acute monauralization are still unclear. By providing visual feedback during a brief training session with a high-pass (HP) filtered sound at a fixed sound level, we investigated the ability of listeners to adapt to their erroneous sound-localization percepts. We show that acutely plugged listeners rapidly adjusted the relative contributions of perceived sound level, and the spectral and distorted binaural cues, to improve their localization performance in azimuth also for different sound levels and locations than those experienced during training. Interestingly, our results also show that this acute cue-reweighting led to poorer localization performance in elevation, which was in line with the acoustic–spatial information provided during training. We conclude that the human auditory system rapidly readjusts the weighting of all relevant localization cues, to adequately respond to the demands of the current acoustic environment, even if the adjustments may hamper veridical localization performance in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Rett Syndrome is a neurological disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) and characterized by severe intellectual disability. The cholinergic system is a critical modulator of cognitive ability and is affected in patients with Rett Syndrome. To better understand the importance of MeCP2 function in cholinergic neurons, we studied the effect of selective &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; deletion from cholinergic neurons in mice. Mice with &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; deletion from cholinergic neurons were selectively impaired in assays of recognition memory, a cognitive task largely mediated by the perirhinal cortex (PRH). Deletion of &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; from cholinergic neurons resulted in profound alterations in baseline firing of L5/6 neurons and eliminated the responses of these neurons to optogenetic stimulation of cholinergic input to PRH. Both the behavioral and the electrophysiological deficits of cholinergic &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; deletion were rescued by inhibiting ACh breakdown with donepezil treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Silhouette-Length-Scaled Gait Parameters for Motor Functional Analysis in Mice and Rats</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Gait analysis of transgenic mice and rats modeling human diseases often suffers from the condition that those models exhibit genotype-driven differences in body size, weight, and length. Thus, we hypothesized that scaling by the silhouette length improves the reliability of gait analysis allowing normalization for individual body size differences. Here, we computed video-derived silhouette length and area parameters from a standard markerless gait analysis system using image-processing techniques. By using length- and area-derived data along with body weight and age, we systematically scaled individual gait parameters. We compared these different scaling approaches and report here that normalization for silhouette length improves the validity and reliability of gait analysis in general. The application of this silhouette length scaling to transgenic Huntington disease mice and Parkinson{acute}s disease rats identifies the remaining differences reflecting more reliable, body length-independent motor functional differences. Overall, this emphasizes the need for silhouette-length-based intra-assay scaling as an improved standard approach in rodent gait analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Overt Attention toward Appetitive Cues Enhances Their Subjective Value, Independent of Orbitofrontal Cortex Activity</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Neural representations of value underlie many behaviors that are crucial for survival. Previously, we found that value representations in primate orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) are modulated by attention, specifically, by overt shifts of gaze toward or away from reward-associated visual cues (McGinty et al., 2016). Here, we investigate the influence of overt attention on behavior by asking how gaze shifts correlate with reward anticipatory responses and whether activity in OFC mediates this correlation. Macaque monkeys viewed pavlovian conditioned appetitive cues on a visual display, while the fraction of time they spent looking toward or away from the cues was measured using an eye tracker. Also measured during cue presentation were the reward anticipation, indicated by conditioned licking responses (CRs), and single-neuron activity in OFC. In general, gaze allocation predicted subsequent licking responses: the longer the monkeys spent looking at a cue at a given time point in a trial, the more likely they were to produce an anticipatory CR later in that trial, as if the subjective value of the cue were increased. To address neural mechanisms, mediation analysis measured the extent to which the gaze–CR correlation could be statistically explained by the concurrently recorded firing of OFC neurons. The resulting mediation effects were indistinguishable from chance. Therefore, while overt attention may increase the subjective value of reward-associated cues (as revealed by anticipatory behaviors), the underlying mechanism remains unknown, as does the functional significance of gaze-driven modulation of OFC value signals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;One of the principal functions of the brain is to control movement and rapidly adapt behavior to a changing external environment. Over the last decades our ability to monitor activity in the brain, manipulate it while also manipulating the environment the animal moves through, has been tackled with increasing sophistication. However, our ability to track the movement of the animal in real time has not kept pace. Here, we use a dynamic vision sensor (DVS) based event-driven neuromorphic camera system to implement real-time, low-latency tracking of a single whisker that mice can move at ~25 Hz. The customized DVS system described here converts whisker motion into a series of events that can be used to estimate the position of the whisker and to trigger a position-based output interactively within 2 ms. This neuromorphic chip-based closed-loop system provides feedback rapidly and flexibly. With this system, it becomes possible to use the movement of whiskers or in principal, movement of any part of the body to reward, punish, in a rapidly reconfigurable way. These methods can be used to manipulate behavior, and the neural circuits that help animals adapt to changing values of a sequence of motor actions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Christianson syndrome (CS) is an X-linked neurogenetic disorder resulting from loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in &lt;i&gt;SLC9A6&lt;/i&gt;, which encodes the endosomal Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; exchanger 6 (NHE6). NHE6 regulates proton efflux from endosomes and, thus, participates in regulating cargo processing and trafficking. LoF mutations in NHE6 cause aberrant acidification of endosomes. While CS arises in males generally due to clear LoF mutations, other potentially hypomorphic variants have emerged, yet most of these variants have not been evaluated for functional effects, particularly &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Here we characterize an &lt;i&gt;SLC9A6&lt;/i&gt; variant that has been previously reported in patients, yet now also appears in exome datasets of largely control individuals—c.25G&amp;gt;T, p.A9S. By heterologous expression in cell lines, we show that human NHE6A9S is expressed and localizes in a manner comparable to control NHE6. By genome editing, we generated the equivalent NHE6 mutation in mouse—p.A11S—and determined that male NHE6A11S mice have normal brain size at 6 months of age and do not show cerebellar degeneration or defective neuronal arborization. Neurons from male NHE6A11S mice also did not demonstrate an abnormality in intra-endosomal pH in comparison to controls. These findings are in contrast to findings in NHE6-null mice previously reported and indicate that the NHE6A11S variant functions at a level equivalent to control NHE6 for many of the assays performed. These data stand in support of the population genetic data, which are also evaluated here, indicating that the A9S variant is unlikely to confer disease susceptibility with high penetrance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Loss-of-function mutations in &lt;i&gt;SLC9A6&lt;/i&gt;, encoding Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; exchanger 6 (NHE6), cause Christianson syndrome. Also, missense variants of unknown consequences have emerged. Functional evaluation of these mutations contributes to an understanding of the medical relevance and cellular effects of these variants. We show that human NHE6A9S protein is synthesized and localizes normally. Mice genome edited to the equivalent variant—NHE6A11S—did not show a reduction in brain size or defects in neuronal arborization. Mutant NHE6A11S neurons also did not demonstrate a significant decrease in luminal pH of endosomes. These findings are in contrast to findings in NHE6-null mice previously reported. Combined with the population genetic data, our data indicate that the NHE6A9S variant is unlikely to confer disease susceptibility with high penetrance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: AMPA receptor plasticity sustains severe, fatal status epilepticus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25635?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25635?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generalized convulsive status epilepticus is associated with high mortality. We tested whether AMPA receptor plasticity plays a role in sustaining seizures, seizure generalization, and mortality observed during focal onset status epilepticus. We also determined whether modified AMPA receptors generated during status epilepticus could be targeted with a drug.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrically induced status epilepticus was characterized by EEG and behavior in GluA1‐knockout mice and in transgenic mice with selective knockdown of the GluA1 subunit in hippocampal principal neurons. Excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in CA1 neurons was studied using patch clamp electrophysiology. The dose response of IEM 1460, a calcium‐permeable AMPA receptor antagonist, was determined.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global removal of the GluA1 subunit did not affect seizure susceptibility; however, it reduced susceptibility to status epilepticus. GluA1 subunit knockout also reduced mortality, severity, and duration of status epilepticus. Absence of the GluA1 subunit prevented enhancement of glutamatergic synaptic transmission associated with status epilepticus; however, GABAergic synaptic inhibition was compromised. Selective removal of the GluA1 subunit from hippocampal principal neurons also reduced mortality, severity, and duration of status epilepticus. IEM 1460 rapidly terminated status epilepticus in a dose‐dependent manner.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMPA receptor plasticity mediated by the GluA1 subunit plays a critical role in sustaining and amplifying seizure activity and contributes to mortality. Calcium‐permeable AMPA receptors modified during status epilepticus can be inhibited to terminate status epilepticus.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Why are living systems complex? Why does the biosphere contain living beings
with complexity features beyond those of the simplest replicators? What kind of
evolutionary pressures result in more complex life forms? These are key
questions that pervade the problem of how complexity arises in evolution. One
particular way of tackling this is grounded in an algorithmic description of
life: living organisms can be seen as systems that extract and process
information from their surroundings in order to reduce uncertainty. In this
paper we take this computational approach using a simple bit string model of
coevolving agents and their parasites. While agents try to predict their
worlds, parasites do the same with their hosts. The result of this process is
that, in order to escape their parasites, the host agents expand their
computational complexity despite the cost of maintaining it. This, in turn, is
followed by increasingly complex parasitic counterparts. Such arms races
display several qualitative phases, from monotonous to punctuated evolution or
even ecological collapse. Our minimal model illustrates the relevance of
parasites in providing an active mechanism for expanding living complexity
beyond simple replicators, suggesting that parasitic agents are likely to be a
major evolutionary driver for biological complexity.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper presents a new preprocessing method to correct blinking artifacts
in Electroencephalography (EEG) based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). This
Algorithm for Blink Correction (ABC) directly corrects the signal in the time
domain without the need for additional Electrooculogram (EOG) electrodes. The
main idea is to automatically adapt to the blink's inter- and intra-subject
variability by considering the blink's amplitude as a parameter. A simple
Minimum Distance to Riemannian Mean (MDRM) is applied as the classification
algorithm. Preliminary results on three subjects show a mean classification
accuracy increase of 13.7% using ABC.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Developing electrophysiological recordings of brain neuronal activity and
their analysis provide a basis for exploring the structure of brain function
and nervous system investigation. The recorded signals are typically a
combination of spikes and noise. High amounts of background noise and
possibility of electric signaling recording from several neurons adjacent to
the recording site have led scientists to develop neuronal signal processing
tools such as spike sorting to facilitate brain data analysis. Spike sorting
plays a pivotal role in understanding the electrophysiological activity of
neuronal networks. This process prepares recorded data for interpretations of
neurons interactions and understanding the overall structure of brain
functions. Spike sorting consists of three steps: spike detection, feature
extraction, and spike clustering. There are several methods to implement each
of spike sorting steps. This paper provides a systematic comparison of various
spike sorting sub-techniques applied to real extracellularly recorded data from
a rat brain basolateral amygdala. An efficient sorted data resulted from
careful choice of spike sorting sub-methods leads to better interpretation of
the brain structures connectivity under different conditions, which is a very
sensitive concept in diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders. Here,
spike detection is performed by appropriate choice of threshold level via three
different approaches. Feature extraction is done through PCA and Kernel PCA
methods, which Kernel PCA outperforms. We have applied four different
algorithms for spike clustering including K-means, Fuzzy C-means, Bayesian and
Fuzzy maximum likelihood estimation. As one requirement of most clustering
algorithms, optimal number of clusters is achieved through validity indices for
each method. Finally, the sorting results are evaluated using inter-spike
interval histograms.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientific theory suggests that dopaminergic neurons broadcast global
reward prediction errors to large areas of the brain influencing the synaptic
plasticity of the neurons in those regions. We build on this theory to propose
a multi-agent learning framework with spiking neurons in the generalized linear
model (GLM) formulation as agents, to solve reinforcement learning (RL) tasks.
We show that a network of GLM spiking agents connected in a hierarchical
fashion, where each spiking agent modulates its firing policy based on local
information and a global prediction error, can learn complex action
representations to solve RL tasks. We further show how leveraging principles of
modularity and population coding inspired from the brain can help reduce
variance in the learning updates making it a viable optimization technique.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;How much visual information about the retinal images can be extracted from
the different layers of the visual pathway? This question depends on the
complexity of the visual input, the set of transforms applied to this
multivariate input, and the noise of the sensors in the considered layer.
Separate subsystems (e.g. opponent channels, spatial filters, nonlinearities of
the texture sensors) have been suggested to be organized for optimal
information transmission. However, the efficiency of these different layers has
not been measured when they operate together on colorimetrically calibrated
natural images and using multivariate information-theoretic units over the
joint spatio-chromatic array of responses.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work we present a statistical tool to address this question in an
appropriate (multivariate) way. Specifically, we propose an empirical estimate
of the capacity of the system based on a recent Gaussianization technique that
reduces the (challenging) multivariate PDF estimation problem to a set of
(easy) univariate estimations. Results show that (1) the proposed estimator is
consistent with theoretical predictions for total correlation, (2) the capacity
increases substantially along the layers of the model, and (3) the capacity of
the cortical representation follows the PDF of natural scenes over the
chromatic and achromatic dimensions of the stimulus space.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theoretical neuroscience, the proposed capacity measure based on
Gaussianization is useful to check the Efficient Coding Hypothesis and to
assess the relative relevance of the chromatic and spatial elements of the
models. From an applied perspective, in image compression, the proposed measure
suggest which visual features should be addressed first; and in image quality,
the proposed measure can generalize the visual information fidelity concept.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Interpreting and improving natural-language processing (in machines) with natural language-processing (in the brain). (arXiv:1905.11833v3 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural networks models for NLP are typically implemented without the explicit
encoding of language rules and yet they are able to break one performance
record after another. This has generated a lot of research interest in
interpreting the representations learned by these networks. We propose here a
novel interpretation approach that relies on the only processing system we have
that does understand language: the human brain. We use brain imaging recordings
of subjects reading complex natural text to interpret word and sequence
embeddings from 4 recent NLP models - ELMo, USE, BERT and Transformer-XL. We
study how their representations differ across layer depth, context length, and
attention type. Our results reveal differences in the context-related
representations across these models. Further, in the transformer models, we
find an interaction between layer depth and context length, and between layer
depth and attention type. We finally hypothesize that altering BERT to better
align with brain recordings would enable it to also better understand language.
Probing the altered BERT using syntactic NLP tasks reveals that the model with
increased brain-alignment outperforms the original model. Cognitive
neuroscientists have already begun using NLP networks to study the brain, and
this work closes the loop to allow the interaction between NLP and cognitive
neuroscience to be a true cross-pollination.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The literature is extensive on how hypertension affects the morphology and function of the central nervous system (CNS) and is being focused on multiple organ damage involving the kidneys, heart, endothelium and retina. Hypertension damage to the peripheral nervous system is less explored in the literature. We have previously shown morphometric alterations in large and small caliber myelinated fibers of nerves in the adult spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). However, the functional correlation of these findings has not been explored. We performed an electrophysiological investigation of hind limb nerves in SHR of both genders in different ages. Normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were used as controls. Electrophysiological recordings and determination of motor (MCV) and sensory (SCV) nerve conduction velocity were performed in the same animals at four different ages: 5, 8, 20 and 40 weeks after birth. Comparisons were made between ages, genders and animal strain. We showed a continuous body weight increase in adult life in all animals studied. MCV got stable at 20-week old hypertensive animals and continued to increase in normotensive ones. The SCV was constant between the ages of 20 and 40 weeks old in female SHR and decreased in male SHR while it continued to increase in WKY animals. The electrophysiological investigation of the nerves in WKY and SHR from both genders and different ages, associated with morphological and morphometric data from the literature suggest that hypertension affects the nerve function and might corroborate the development of a peripheral neuropathy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Multiple Functions of KBP in Neural Development Underlie Brain Anomalies in Goldberg-Shprintzen Syndrome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00265</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Kinesin-binding protein (KBP; KIF1BP; KIAA1279) functions as a regulator for a subset of kinesins, many of which play important roles in neural development. Previous studies have shown that KBP is expressed in nearly all tissue with cytoplasmic localization. Autosomal recessive mutations in KIAA1279 cause a rare neurological disorder, Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome (GOSHS), characterized by microcephaly, polymicrogyria, intellectual disability, axonal neuropathy, thin corpus callosum and peripheral neuropathy. Most KIAA1279 mutations found in GOSHS patients are homozygous nonsense mutations that result in KBP loss-of-function. However, it is not fully understood how KBP dysfunction causes these defects. Here, we used in utero electroporation (IUE) to express KBP short hairpin RNA (shRNA) with green fluorescent protein (GFP) in neural progenitor cells of embryonic day (E) 14 mice, and collected brain slices at different developmental stages. By immunostaining of neuronal lineage markers, we found that KBP knockdown does not affect the neural differentiation process. However, at 4 days post IUE, many cells were located in the intermediate zone (IZ). Moreover, at postnatal day (P) 6, about one third of the cells, which have become mature neurons, remained ectopically in the white matter (WM), while cells that have reached Layer II/III of the cortex showed impaired dendritic outgrowth and axonal projection. We also found that KBP knockdown induces apoptosis during the postnatal period. Our findings indicate that loss of KBP function leads to defects in neuronal migration, morphogenesis, maturation, and survival, which may be responsible for brain phenotypes observed in GOSHS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Prion-Like Propagation of Protein Misfolding and Aggregation in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The discovery that prion protein can misfold into a pathological conformation that encodes structural information capable of both propagation and inducing severe neuropathology has revolutionized our understanding of neurodegenerative disease. Many neurodegenerative diseases with a protein misfolding component are now classified as “prion-like” owing to the propagation of both symptoms and protein aggregation pathology in affected individuals. The neuromuscular disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by protein inclusions formed by either TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43), Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1), or fused in sarcoma (FUS), in both upper and lower motor neurons. Evidence from in vitro, cell culture, and in vivo studies has provided strong evidence to support the involvement of a prion-like mechanism in ALS. In this article, we review the evidence suggesting that prion-like propagation of protein aggregation is a primary pathomechanism in ALS, focusing on the key proteins and genes involved in disease (TDP-43, SOD1, FUS, and C9orf72). In each case, we discuss the evidence ranging from biophysical studies to in vivo examinations of prion-like spreading. We suggest that the idiopathic nature of ALS may stem from its prion-like nature and that elucidation of the specific propagating protein assemblies is paramount to developing effective therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease clinically characterized by parkinsonism and cerebellar ataxia, and pathologically by oligodendrocyte α-synuclein inclusions. Genetic variants of COQ2 are associated with an increased risk for MSA in certain populations. Also, deficits in the level of coenzyme Q&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; and its biosynthetic enzymes are associated with MSA. Here, we measured ATP levels and expression of biosynthetic enzymes for coenzyme Q&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, including COQ2, in multiple regions of MSA and control brains. We found a reduction in ATP levels in disease-affected regions of MSA brain that associated with reduced expression of COQ2 and COQ7, supporting the concept that abnormalities in the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; play an important role in the pathogenesis of MSA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive control is essential for flexible, top-down, goal-directed behavior. Individuals with Internet gaming disorder (IGD) are characterized by impaired prefrontal cortex function and cognitive control. This results in an increase in stimulus-driven habitual behavior, particularly related to pathological gaming. In the present study, we investigated the electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in individuals with IGD. Twenty-four individuals with IGD and 35 healthy control (HC) subjects were recruited. We analyzed their EEG activity while the subjects played their favorite game (30–40 min duration). We compared the band power between the two groups. During gaming, the left frontal theta, alpha, and beta band activities were lower in subjects with IGD than in HCs. Moreover, the left frontal theta power negatively correlated with IGD severity. These results indicate that left frontal theta power could be used as a neurophysiological biomarker for the detection of diminished cognitive control patterns in individuals with IGD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The utility of premovement electroencephalography (EEG) for decoding movement intention during a reaching task has been demonstrated. However, the kind of information the brain represents regarding the intended target during movement preparation remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated which movement parameters (i.e., direction, distance, and positions for reaching) can be decoded in premovement EEG decoding. Eight participants performed 30 types of reaching movements that consisted of 1 of 24 movement directions, 7 movement distances, 5 horizontal target positions, and 5 vertical target positions. Event-related spectral perturbations were extracted using independent components, some of which were selected via an analysis of variance for further binary classification analysis using a support vector machine. When each parameter was used for class labeling, all possible binary classifications were performed. Classification accuracies for direction and distance were significantly higher than chance level, although no significant differences were observed for position. For the classification in which each movement was considered as a different class, the parameters comprising two vectors representing each movement were analyzed. In this case, classification accuracies were high when differences in distance were high, the sum of distances was high, angular differences were large, and differences in the target positions were high. The findings further revealed that direction and distance may provide the largest contributions to movement. In addition, regardless of the parameter, useful features for classification are easily found over the parietal and occipital areas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Impairment of Membrane Repolarization Accompanies Axon Transport Deficits in Glaucoma</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01139</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, resulting from degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which form the optic nerve. In glaucoma, axon transport deficits appear to precede structural degeneration of RGC axons. The period of time between the onset of axon transport deficits and the structural degeneration of RGC axons may represent a therapeutic window for the prevention of irreversible vision loss. However, it is unclear how deficits in axon transport relate to the electrophysiological capacity of RGCs to produce and maintain firing frequencies that encode visual stimuli. Here, we examined the electrophysiological signature of individual RGCs in glaucomatous retina with respect to axon transport facility. Utilizing the Microbead Occlusion Model of murine ocular hypertension, we performed electrophysiological recordings of RGCs with and without deficits in anterograde axon transport. We found that RGCs with deficits in axon transport have a reduced ability to maintain spiking frequency that arises from elongation of the repolarization phase of the action potential. This repolarization phenotype arises from reduced cation flux and K+ dyshomeostasis that accompanies pressure-induced decreases in Na/K-ATPase expression and activity. In vitro studies with purified RGCs indicate that elevated pressure induces early internalization of Na/K-ATPase that, when reversed, stabilizes cation flux and prevents K+ dyshomeostasis. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of the Na/K-ATPase is sufficient to replicate pressure-induced cation influx and repolarization phase phenotypes in healthy RGCs. These studies suggest that deficits in axon transport also likely reflect impaired electrophysiological function of RGCs. Our findings further identify a failure to maintain electrochemical gradients and cation dyshomeostasis as an early phenotype of glaucomatous pathology in RGCs that may have significant bearing on efforts to restore RGC health in diseased retina.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Different Heat Shock Proteins Bind α-Synuclein With Distinct Mechanisms and Synergistically Prevent Its Amyloid Aggregation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;α-Synuclein (α-Syn) forms pathological amyloid aggregates deposited in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in the brain of Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients. Heat shock proteins (Hsps) are the major components of the cellular chaperone network, which are responsible for preventing proteins from amyloid aggregation. Different Hsps were reported to interact with α-syn. However, the underlying mechanism of the interplay between α-syn and different Hsps remains unclear. Here, by combing NMR spectroscopy, electron microscope and other biochemical approaches, we systemically investigated the interaction between α-syn and three Hsps from different families including Hsp27, HDJ1, and Hsp104. We found that all three Hsps can weakly bind to α-syn and inhibit it from amyloid aggregation. Intriguingly, different Hsps recognize distinct regions of α-syn monomer, and act synergistically in chaperoning α-syn from fibril formation in sub-stoichiometry. Our results revealed the diverse binding mechanisms employed by different Hsps to tackle α-syn, and suggested that different Hsps form a network for cooperatively chaperoning α-syn from pathological aggregation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Coupling Robot-Aided Assessment and Surface Electromyography (sEMG) to Evaluate the Effect of Muscle Fatigue on Wrist Position Sense in the Flexion-Extension Plane</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Proprioception is a crucial sensory modality involved in the control and regulation of coordinated movements and in motor learning. However, the extent to which proprioceptive acuity is influenced by local muscle fatigue is obscured by methodological differences in proprioceptive and fatiguing protocols. In this study, we used high resolution kinematic measurements provided by a robotic device, as well as both frequency and time domain analysis of signals captured via surface electromyography (sEMG) to examine the effects of local muscle fatigue on wrist proprioceptive acuity in 16 physically and neurologically healthy young adults. To this end, participants performed a flexion/extension ipsilateral joint position matching test (JPM), after which a high-resistive robotic task was used to induce muscle fatigue of the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscle. The JPM test was then repeated in order to analyze potential changes in proprioceptive acuity. Results indicated that the fatigue protocol had a significant effect on movements performed in flexion direction, with participants exhibiting a tendency to undershoot the target before the fatigue protocol (−1.218°), but overshooting after the fatigue protocol (0.587°). In contrast, in the extension direction error bias values were similar before and after the fatigue protocol as expected (pre = −1.852°, post = −1.237°) and reflected a tendency to undershoot the target. Moreover, statistical analysis indicated that movement variability was not influenced by the fatigue protocol or movement direction. In sum, results of the present study demonstrate that an individual’s estimation of wrist joint displacement (i.e., error bias), but not precision (i.e., variability), is affected by muscular fatigue in a sample of neurologically and physically healthy adults.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) Task Induces Changes in Sensory Processing: ERP Evidence</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Numerous cognitive studies have demonstrated experience-induced plasticity in the primary sensory cortex, indicating that repeated decisions could modulate sensory processing. In this context, we investigated whether an auditory version of the monetary incentive delay (MID) task could change the neural processing of the incentive cues that code expected monetary outcomes. To study sensory plasticity, we presented the incentive cues as deviants during oddball sessions recorded before and after training in the two MID task sessions. We found that after 2 days of training in the MID task, incentive cues evoked a larger P3a (compared with the baseline condition), indicating there was an enhancement of the involuntary attention to the stimuli that predict rewards. At the individual level, the training-induced change of mismatch-related negativity was correlated with the amplitude of the feedback-related negativity (FRN) recorded during the first MID task session. Our results show that the MID task evokes plasticity changes in the auditory system associated with better passive discrimination of incentive cues and with enhanced involuntary attention switching towards these cues. Thus, the sensory processing of incentive cues is dynamically modulated by previous outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the mouse whisker system, the contribution of L6 corticothalamic cells (L6 CT) to cortical and thalamic processing of the whisker deflection direction was investigated. A genetically defined population of L6 CT cells project to infragranular GABAergic interneurons that hyperpolarize neurons in somatosensory barrel cortex (BC). Optogenetic activation of these neurons switched BC to an adapted mode in which excitatory cells lost their angular tuning. In contrast, however, this was not the case with a general activation of inhibitory interneurons via optogenetic activation of Gad2-expressing cells. The decrease in angular tuning, when L6 CT cells were activated, was due to changes in cortical inhibition, and not inherited from changes in the thalamic output. Furthermore, L6 CT driven cortical inhibition, but not the general activation of GABAergic interneurons, abolished adaptation to whisker responses. In the present study, evidence is presented that a subpopulation of L6 CT activates a specific circuit of GABAergic interneurons that will predispose neocortex toward processing of tactile information requiring multiple whisker touches, such as in a texture discrimination task.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ubiquitously expressed SUMO proteins regulate a plethora of cellular pathways and processes. While they have a predominantly nuclear localization, extranuclear roles of SUMO isoforms at the synapse have also been described, making SUMOylation one of the major post-translational regulators of nerve functions. These findings have however recently been challenged, at least for SUMO1, by the analysis of knock-in mice expressing His&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-HA-SUMO1, where the authors failed to detect the protein at the synapse. In the ongoing dispute, the subcellular distribution in neurons of SUMO2/3 and of the E2 SUMO ligase Ubc9 has not been examined. To investigate whether SUMO proteins do or do not localize at the synapse, we studied their localization in hippocampal primary neurons by super resolution microscopy. We found that SUMO1, SUMO2/3, and Ubc9 are primarily nuclear proteins, which also colocalize partially with pre- and post-synaptic markers such as synaptophysin and PSD95.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Corticothalamic axons express Contactin-2 (CNTN2/TAG-1), a neuronal recognition molecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily involved in neurogenesis, neurite outgrowth, and fasciculation. TAG-1, which is expressed transiently by cortical pyramidal neurons during embryonic development, has been shown to be fundamental for axonal recognition, cellular migration, and neuronal proliferation in the developing cortex. Although Tag-1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice do not exhibit any obvious defects in the corticofugal system, the role of TAG-1+ neurons during the development of the cortex remains elusive. We have generated a mouse model expressing EGFP under the Tag-1 promoter and encompassing the coding sequence of Diptheria Toxin subunit A (DTA) under quiescence with no effect on the expression of endogenous Tag-1. We show that while the line recapitulates the expression pattern of the molecule, it highlights an extended expression in the forebrain, including multiple axonal tracts and neuronal populations, both spatially and temporally. Crossing these mice to the Emx1-Cre strain, we ablated the vast majority of TAG-1+ cortical neurons. Among the observed defects were a significantly smaller cortex, a reduction of corticothalamic axons as well as callosal and commissural defects. Such defects are common in neurodevelopmental disorders, thus this mouse could serve as a useful model to study physiological and pathophysiological cortical development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural correlates of working memory (WM) training remain a matter of debate, especially in older adults. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) together with an n-back task to measure brain plasticity in healthy middle-aged adults following an 8-week adaptive online verbal WM training. Participants performed 32 sessions of this training on their personal computers. In addition, we assessed direct effects of the training by applying a verbal WM task before and after the training. Participants (mean age 55.85 ± 4.24 years) were pseudo-randomly assigned to the experimental group (n = 30) or an active control group (n = 27). Training resulted in an activity decrease in regions known to be involved in verbal WM (i.e., fronto-parieto-cerebellar circuitry and subcortical regions), indicating that the brain became potentially more efficient after the training. These activation decreases were associated with a significant performance improvement in the n-back task inside the scanner reflecting considerable practice effects. In addition, there were training-associated direct effects in the additional, external verbal WM task (i.e., HAWIE-R digit span forward task), and indicating that the training generally improved performance in this cognitive domain. These results led us to conclude that even at advanced age cognitive training can improve WM capacity and increase neural efficiency in specific regions or networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Bee Venom Soluble Phospholipase A2 Exerts Neuroprotective Effects in a Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Mouse Model of Alzheimer’s Disease via Inhibition of Nuclear Factor-Kappa B</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuroinflammation is important in the pathogenesis and development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In the AD brain, microglial activation and upregulation of pro-inflammatory mediators both induce amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulation. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling have been implicated in AD development through their effects on neuroinflammation and microglial activation. The bee venom soluble phospholipase A2 (bv-sPLA2) enzyme is known to exert anti-inflammatory and anti-immune effects. Here, we investigated the inhibitory effects of bv-sPLA2 on memory deficiency in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse model of AD. We examined whether bv-sPLA2 (0.02, 0.2, and 2 mg/kg by i.p. injection three times for 1 week) could inhibit neuroinflammation and memory impairment in LPS-treated mice (250 μg/kg by i.p. injection daily for 1 week). We also assessed the effects of bv-sPLA2 administration (0.01, 0.1, and 1 μg/ml) on LPS (1 μg/ml)-treated microglial BV-2 cells. In the LPS-injected mouse brain, sPLA2 treatment rescued memory dysfunction and decreased Aβ levels, through the downregulation of amyloidogenic proteins, and decreased the expression of inflammatory proteins and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, the LPS-mediated increase in inflammatory protein expression was attenuated bv-sPLA2 treatment in BV-2 cells. Treatment with bv-sPLA2 also downregulated signaling by NF-κB, which is considered to be an important factor in the regulation of neuroinflammatory and amyloidogenic responses, both in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, co-treatment with NF-κB (5 μM) and bv-sPLA2 (0.1 μg/ml) exerted more marked anti-inflammatory effects, compared to bv-sPLA2 treatment alone. These results indicate that bv-sPLA2 inhibits LPS-induced neuroinflammation and amyloidogenesis via inhibition of NF-κB.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: An efficient CRISPR-based strategy to insert small and large fragments of DNA using short homology arms</title>

	<description>We previously reported a CRISPR-mediated knock-in strategy into introns of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; genes, generating an &lt;i&gt;attP&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;FRT-SA-T2A-GAL4-polyA-3XP3-EGFP-FRT-attP&lt;/i&gt; transgenic library for multiple uses (Lee et al., 2018b). The method relied on double stranded DNA (dsDNA) homology donors with ~1 kb homology arms. Here, we describe three new simpler ways to edit genes in flies. We create single stranded DNA (ssDNA) donors using PCR and add 100 nt of homology on each side of an integration cassette, followed by enzymatic removal of one strand. Using this method, we generated GFP-tagged proteins that mark organelles in S2 cells. We then describe two dsDNA methods using cheap synthesized donors flanked by 100 nt homology arms and gRNA target sites cloned into a plasmid. Upon injection, donor DNA (1 to 5 kb) is released from the plasmid by Cas9. The cassette integrates efficiently and precisely &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. The approach is fast, cheap, and scalable.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: The mechanosensitive ion channel TRAAK is localized to the mammalian node of Ranvier</title>

	<description>TRAAK is a membrane tension-activated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel that has been associated through behavioral studies to mechanical nociception. We used specific monoclonal antibodies in mice to show that TRAAK is localized exclusively to nodes of Ranvier, the action potential propagating elements of myelinated nerve fibers. Approximately 80 percent of myelinated nerve fibers throughout the central and peripheral nervous system contain TRAAK in what is likely an all-nodes or no-nodes per axon fashion. TRAAK is not observed at the axon initial segment where action potentials are first generated. We used polyclonal antibodies, the TRAAK inhibitor RU2 and node clamp amplifiers to demonstrate the presence and functional properties of TRAAK in rat nerve fibers. TRAAK contributes to the ‘leak’ K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current in mammalian nerve fiber conduction by hyperpolarizing the resting membrane potential, thereby increasing Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel availability for action potential propagation. We speculate on why nodes of Ranvier contain a mechanosensitive K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel.</description>

	<description>Efficient searching for resources such as food by animals is key to their survival. It has been proposed that diverse animals from insects to sharks and humans adopt searching patterns that resemble a simple Lévy random walk, which is theoretically optimal for 'blind foragers' to locate sparse, patchy resources. To test if such patterns are generated intrinsically, or arise via environmental interactions, we tracked free-moving &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; larvae with (and without) blocked synaptic activity in the brain, suboesophageal ganglion (SOG) and sensory neurons. In brain-blocked larvae we found that extended substrate exploration emerges as multi-scale movement paths similar to truncated Lévy walks. Strikingly, power-law exponents of brain/SOG/sensory-blocked larvae averaged 1.96, close to a theoretical optimum (µ ≅ 2.0) for locating sparse resources. Thus, efficient spatial exploration can emerge from autonomous patterns in neural activity. Our results provide the strongest evidence so far for the intrinsic generation of Lévy-like movement patterns.</description>

In many areas of the brain, both spontaneous and stimulus-evoked activity can manifest as synchronous activation of neuronal assemblies. The characterization of assembly structure and dynamics provides important insights into how brain computations are distributed across neural networks. The proliferation of experimental techniques for recording the activity of neuronal assemblies calls for a comprehensive statistical method to describe, analyze and characterize these high dimensional datasets. The performance of existing methods for defining assemblies is sensitive to noise and stochasticity in neuronal firing patterns and assembly heterogeneity. To address these problems, we introduce a generative hierarchical model of synchronous activity to describe the organization of neurons into assemblies. Unlike existing methods, our analysis provides a simultaneous estimation of assembly composition, dynamics and within-assembly statistical features, such as the levels of activity, noise and assembly synchrony. We have used our method to characterize population activity throughout the tectum of larval zebrafish, allowing us to make statistical inference on the spatiotemporal organization of tectal assemblies, their composition and the logic of their interactions. We have also applied our method to functional imaging and neuropixels recordings from the mouse, allowing us to relate the activity of identified assemblies to specific behaviours such as running or changes in pupil diameter.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0_IJrY49Zz8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Teaching well is a craft like any other, and success often comes from an accumulation of small improvements rather than from any single large change. This paper describes 10 practices you can use when teaching programming (and other subjects). All are easy to adopt and have proven their value in institutional classrooms, intensive workshops, and other settings.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LWGX4BcyMrY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Fungal feature tracker (FFT): A tool for quantitatively characterizing the morphology and growth of filamentous fungi</title>

Filamentous fungi are ubiquitous in nature and serve as important biological models in various scientific fields including genetics, cell biology, ecology, evolution, and chemistry. A significant obstacle in studying filamentous fungi is the lack of tools for characterizing their growth and morphology in an efficient and quantitative manner. Consequently, assessments of the growth of filamentous fungi are often subjective and imprecise. In order to remedy this problem, we developed Fungal Feature Tracker (FFT), a user-friendly software comprised of different image analysis tools to automatically quantify different fungal characteristics, such as spore number, spore morphology, and measurements of total length, number of hyphal tips and the area covered by the mycelium. In addition, FFT can recognize and quantify specialized structures such as the traps generated by nematode-trapping fungi, which could be tuned to quantify other distinctive fungal structures in different fungi. We present a detailed characterization and comparison of a few fungal species as a case study to demonstrate the capabilities and potential of our software. Using FFT, we were able to quantify various features at strain and species level, such as mycelial growth over time and the length and width of spores, which would be difficult to track using classical approaches. In summary, FFT is a powerful tool that enables quantitative measurements of fungal features and growth, allowing objective and precise characterization of fungal phenotypes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nczpOreaCBk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Energy consumption is one of the primary considerations in animal locomotion. In swimming locomotion, a number of questions related to swimming energetics of an organism and how the energetic quantities scale with body size remain open, largely due to the difficulties with modeling and measuring the power production and consumption. Based on a comprehensive theoretical framework that incorporates cyclic muscle behavior, structural dynamics and swimming hydrodynamics, we perform extensive computational simulations and show that many of the outstanding problems in swimming energetics can be explained by considering the coupling between hydrodynamics and muscle contraction characteristics, as well as the trade-offs between the conflicting performance goals of sustained swimming speed &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt; and cost of transport COT. Our results lead to three main conclusions: (1) in contrast to previous hypotheses, achieving optimal values of &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt; and COT is independent of producing maximal power or efficiency; (2) muscle efficiency in swimming, in contrast to that in flying or running, decreases with increasing body size, consistent with muscle contraction characteristics; (3) the long-standing problem of two disparate patterns of longitudinal power output distributions in swimming fish can be reconciled by relating the two patterns to &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt;-optimal or COT-optimal swimmers, respectively. We also provide further evidence that the use of tendons in caudal regions is beneficial from an energetic perspective. Our conclusions explain and unify many existing observations and are supported by computational data covering nine orders of magnitude in body size.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/l5EIJzp3XSU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Delayed feedback embedded in perception-action coordination cycles results in anticipation behavior during synchronized rhythmic action: A dynamical systems approach</title>

Dancing and playing music require people to coordinate actions with auditory rhythms. In laboratory perception-action coordination tasks, people are asked to synchronize taps with a metronome. When synchronizing with a metronome, people tend to anticipate stimulus onsets, tapping slightly before the stimulus. The anticipation tendency increases with longer stimulus periods of up to 3500ms, but is less pronounced in trained individuals like musicians compared to non-musicians. Furthermore, external factors influence the timing of tapping. These factors include the presence of auditory feedback from one’s own taps, the presence of a partner performing coordinated joint tapping, and transmission latencies (TLs) between coordinating partners. Phenomena like the anticipation tendency can be explained by delay-coupled systems, which may be inherent to the sensorimotor system during perception-action coordination. Here we tested whether a dynamical systems model based on this hypothesis reproduces observed patterns of human synchronization. We simulated behavior with a model consisting of an oscillator receiving its own delayed activity as input. Three simulation experiments were conducted using previously-published behavioral data from 1) simple tapping, 2) two-person alternating beat-tapping, and 3) two-person alternating rhythm-clapping in the presence of a range of constant auditory TLs. In Experiment 1, our model replicated the larger anticipation observed for longer stimulus intervals and adjusting the amplitude of the delayed feedback reproduced the difference between musicians and non-musicians. In Experiment 2, by connecting two models we replicated the smaller anticipation observed in human joint tapping with bi-directional auditory feedback compared to joint tapping without feedback. In Experiment 3, we varied TLs between two models alternately receiving signals from one another. Results showed reciprocal lags at points of alternation, consistent with behavioral patterns. Overall, our model explains various anticipatory behaviors, and has potential to inform theories of adaptive human synchronization.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SQJqrdSDSZA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Systems-level network modeling of Small Cell Lung Cancer subtypes identifies master regulators and destabilizers</title>

Adopting a systems approach, we devise a general workflow to define actionable subtypes in human cancers. Applied to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), the workflow identifies four subtypes based on global gene expression patterns and ontologies. Three correspond to known subtypes (SCLC-A, SCLC-N, and SCLC-Y), while the fourth is a previously undescribed ASCL1+ neuroendocrine variant (NEv2, or SCLC-A2). Tumor deconvolution with subtype gene signatures shows that all of the subtypes are detectable in varying proportions in human and mouse tumors. To understand how multiple stable subtypes can arise within a tumor, we infer a network of transcription factors and develop BooleaBayes, a minimally-constrained Boolean rule-fitting approach. &lt;i&gt;In silico&lt;/i&gt; perturbations of the network identify master regulators and destabilizers of its attractors. Specific to NEv2, BooleaBayes predicts ELF3 and NR0B1 as master regulators of the subtype, and TCF3 as a master destabilizer. Since the four subtypes exhibit differential drug sensitivity, with NEv2 consistently least sensitive, these findings may lead to actionable therapeutic strategies that consider SCLC intratumoral heterogeneity. Our systems-level approach should generalize to other cancer types.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v5wBSwPCWBQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Off-Target Effects in Transgenic Mice: Characterization of Dopamine Transporter (DAT)-Cre Transgenic Mouse Lines Exposes Multiple Non-Dopaminergic Neuronal Clusters Available for Selective Targeting within Limbic Neurocircuitry</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transgenic mouse lines are instrumental in our attempt to understand brain function. Promoters driving transgenic expression of the gene encoding &lt;i&gt;Cre recombinase&lt;/i&gt; are crucial to ensure selectivity in Cre-mediated targeting of floxed alleles using the Cre-Lox system. For the study of dopamine (DA) neurons, promoter sequences driving expression of the &lt;i&gt;Dopamine transporter&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Dat&lt;/i&gt;) gene are often implemented and several DAT-Cre transgenic mouse lines have been found to faithfully direct Cre activity to DA neurons. While evaluating an established DAT-Cre mouse line, reporter gene expression was unexpectedly identified in cell somas within the amygdala. To indiscriminately explore Cre activity in DAT-Cre transgenic lines, systematic whole-brain analysis of two DAT-Cre mouse lines was performed upon recombination with different types of floxed reporter alleles. Results were compared with data available from the Allen Institute for Brain Science. The results identified restricted DAT-Cre-driven reporter gene expression in cell clusters within several limbic areas, including amygdaloid and mammillary subnuclei, septum and habenula, areas classically associated with glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission. While no &lt;i&gt;Dat&lt;/i&gt; gene expression was detected, ample co-localization between DAT-Cre-driven reporter and markers for glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons was found. Upon viral injection of a fluorescent reporter into the amygdala and habenula, distinct projections from non-dopaminergic DAT-Cre neurons could be distinguished. The study demonstrates that DAT-Cre transgenic mice, beyond their usefulness in recombination of floxed alleles in DA neurons, could be implemented as tools to achieve selective targeting in restricted excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations within the limbic neurocircuitry.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Anatomical methods for determining cell type-specific connectivity are essential to inspire and constrain our understanding of neural circuit function. We developed genetically-encoded reagents for fluorescence-synapse labeling and connectivity analysis in brain tissue, using a fluorogen-activating protein (FAP)-coupled or YFP-coupled, postsynaptically-localized neuroligin-1 (NL-1) targeting sequence (FAP/YFPpost). FAPpost expression did not alter mEPSC or mIPSC properties. Sparse AAV-mediated expression of FAP/YFPpost with the cell-filling, red fluorophore dTomato (dTom) enabled high-throughput, compartment-specific detection of putative synapses across diverse neuron types in mouse somatosensory cortex. We took advantage of the bright, far-red emission of FAPpost puncta for multichannel fluorescence alignment of dendrites, FAPpost puncta, and presynaptic neurites in transgenic mice with saturated labeling of parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SST), or vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing neurons using Cre-reporter driven expression of YFP. Subtype-specific inhibitory connectivity onto layer 2/3 (L2/3) neocortical pyramidal (Pyr) neurons was assessed using automated puncta detection and neurite apposition. Quantitative and compartment-specific comparisons show that PV inputs are the predominant source of inhibition at both the soma and the dendrites and were particularly concentrated at the primary apical dendrite. SST inputs were interleaved with PV inputs at all secondary-order and higher-order dendritic branches. These fluorescence-based synapse labeling reagents can facilitate large-scale and cell-type specific quantitation of changes in synaptic connectivity across development, learning, and disease states.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Rhythmic neuronal activity in the gamma range is a signature of cortical processing and its synchronization across distant sites has been proposed as a fundamental mechanism of network interactions. While this has been shown within sensory streams, we tested whether cross talk between the senses relies on similar mechanisms. Direct sensory interactions in humans (male and female) were studied with a visual–tactile amplitude matching paradigm. In this task, congruent stimuli are associated with behavioral benefits, which are proposed to be mediated by increased binding between sensory cortices through coherent gamma oscillations. We tested this hypothesis by applying 4-in-1 multi-electrode transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) with 40 Hz over visual and somatosensory cortices. In phase stimulation (0°) was expected to strengthen binding and thereby enhance the congruence effect, while anti-phase (180°) stimulation was expected to have opposite effects. Gamma tACS was controlled by alpha (10 Hz) and sham stimulation, as well as by applying tACS unilaterally while visual–tactile stimuli were presented lateralized. Contrary to our expectations, gamma tACS over the relevant hemisphere delayed responses to congruent trials. Additionally, reanalysis of EEG data revealed decoupling of sensory gamma oscillations during congruent trials. We propose that gamma tACS prevented sensory decoupling and thereby limited the congruence effect. Together, our results favor the perspective that processing multisensory congruence involves corticocortical communication rather than feature binding. Furthermore, we found control stimulation over the irrelevant hemisphere to speed responses under alpha stimulation and to delay responses under gamma stimulation, consistent with the idea that contralateral alpha/gamma dynamics regulate cortical excitability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Electroencephalographic Signatures of the Neural Representation of Speech during Selective Attention</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The ability to selectively attend to speech in the presence of other competing talkers is critical for everyday communication; yet the neural mechanisms facilitating this process are poorly understood. Here, we use electroencephalography (EEG) to study how a mixture of two speech streams is represented in the brain as subjects attend to one stream or the other. To characterize the speech-EEG relationships and how they are modulated by attention, we estimate the statistical association between each canonical EEG frequency band (delta, theta, alpha, beta, low-gamma, and high-gamma) and the envelope of each of ten different frequency bands in the input speech. Consistent with previous literature, we find that low-frequency (delta and theta) bands show greater speech-EEG coherence when the speech stream is attended compared to when it is ignored. We also find that the envelope of the low-gamma band shows a similar attention effect, a result not previously reported with EEG. This is consistent with the prevailing theory that neural dynamics in the gamma range are important for attention-dependent routing of information in cortical circuits. In addition, we also find that the greatest attention-dependent increases in speech-EEG coherence are seen in the mid-frequency acoustic bands (0.5–3 kHz) of input speech and the temporal-parietal EEG sensors. Finally, we find individual differences in the following: (1) the specific set of speech-EEG associations that are the strongest, (2) the EEG and speech features that are the most informative about attentional focus, and (3) the overall magnitude of attentional enhancement of speech-EEG coherence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: A Novel Birthdate-Labeling Method Reveals Segregated Parallel Projections of Mitral and External Tufted Cells in the Main Olfactory System</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;A fundamental strategy in sensory coding is parallel processing, whereby unique, distinct features of sensation are computed and projected to the central target in the form of sub-modal maps. It remains unclear, however, whether such parallel processing strategy is employed in the main olfactory system, which codes the complex hierarchical odor and behavioral scenes. A potential scheme is that distinct subsets of projection neurons in the olfactory bulb form parallel projections to the targets. Taking advantage of the observation that the distinct projection neurons develop at different times, we developed a Cre-loxP-based method that allows for birthdate-specific labeling of cell bodies and their axon projections in mice. This birthdate tag analysis revealed that the mitral cells born in an early developmental stage and the external tufted cells born a few days later form segregated parallel projections. Specifically, the latter subset converges the axons onto only two small specific targets, one of which, located at the anterolateral edge of the olfactory tubercle, excludes widespread mitral cell projections. This target is made up of neurons that express dopamine D1 but not D2 receptor and corresponds to the most anterolateral isolation of the CAP compartments that were defined previously. This finding of segregated projections suggests that olfactory sensing does indeed involve parallel processing of functionally distinct sub-modalities. Importantly, the birthdate tag method used here may pave the way for deciphering the functional meaning of these individual projection pathways in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Odorant receptors form an ordered odorant map on the main olfactory bulb. This spatial representation disappears in most subsequent targets by &quot;diffuse divergence and random convergence&quot; of olfactory bulb projections. We revisited these projections using a novel method that can genetically dissect distinct subsets of olfactory bulb projection neurons based on their neuronal birthdates. Our birthdate tag analysis exposed parallel segregated projections formed by early-born mitral and late-born external tufted cells in otherwise apparently random olfactory networks. The results show that the birthdate tag approach is effective for uncovering a hidden circuit structure formed by intermingling neuronal subsets in the olfactory as well as other nervous systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Antiepileptic Drugs and Suicide: Role of Prior Suicidal Behavior and Parental Psychiatric Disorder</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25623?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25623?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To examine whether prior suicidal behavior and familial predisposition to psychiatric disorders modify the association between antiepileptic drug use and completed suicide.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the Danish National Prescription Register, we identified all incident users of antiepileptic drugs aged 15 years or older in Denmark between July 1997 and December 2015. We carried out a nested case–control study and defined exposure to antiepileptic drugs at the index date (ie, time of suicide). Conditional logistic regressions were used to estimate mortality rate ratios (MRRs) of suicide in current versus previous users of antiepileptic drugs. We also analyzed suicide risk associated with the 9 most commonly used antiepileptic drugs.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified 1,759 individuals completing suicide. Current versus previous use of any antiepileptic drug was associated with an increased risk of suicide (MRR = 1.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.13–1.40). This excess risk was observed in individuals with a history of suicidal behavior (MRR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.07–1.54) and in those without (MRR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.11–1.43), and in individuals with a familial predisposition to psychiatric disorders (MRR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.18–1.87) and in those without (MRR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.07–1.35).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use of antiepileptic drugs was associated with an increased risk of suicide. The findings do not support that the risk of suicide following treatment with antiepileptic drugs identified in randomized trials is explained by prior suicidality or familial predisposition to psychiatric disorders. The additional risk of suicide associated with use of antiepileptic drugs was generally low and should be balanced against benefits of treatment. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor 1 (NMDAR)-linked Ca&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; current represents a significant percentage of post-synaptic transient that modulates synaptic strength and is pertinent to dendritic spine plasticity. In the hippocampus, Ca&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; transient produced by glutamatergic ionotropic neurotransmission facilitates Ca&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt;-Calmodulin-dependent kinase 2 (CaMKII) Thr286 phosphorylation and promote long-term potentiation (LTP) expression. At CA1 post-synaptic densities, Ca&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; transients equally activate small conductance (SK2) channel which regulates excitability by suppressing Ca&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; movement. Here, we demonstrate that upstream attenuation of GluN1 function in the hippocampus led to a decrease in Thr286 CaMKIIα phosphorylation, and increased SK2 expression. Consistent with the loss of GluN1 function, potentiation of SK channel in wild type hippocampus reduced CaMKIIα expression and abrogate synaptic localization of T286 pCaMKIIα. Our results demonstrate that positive modulation of SK channel at hippocampal synapses likely refine GluN1-linked plasticity by tuning dendritic localization of CaMKIIα.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Generalization of Object Localization From Whiskers to Other Body Parts in Freely Moving Rats</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Rats can be trained to associate relative spatial locations of objects with the spatial location of rewards. Here we ask whether rats can localize static silent objects with other body parts in the dark, and if so with what resolution. We addressed these questions in trained rats, whose interactions with the objects were tracked at high-resolution before and after whisker trimming. We found that rats can use other body parts, such as trunk and ears, to localize objects. Localization resolution with non-whisking body parts (henceforth, ‘body’) was poorer than that obtained with whiskers, even when left with a single whisker at each side. Part of the superiority of whiskers was obtained via the use of multiple contacts. Transfer from whisker to body localization occurred within one session, provided that body contacts with the objects occurred before whisker trimming, or in the next session otherwise. This transfer occurred whether temporal cues were used for discrimination or when discrimination was based on spatial cues alone. Rats’ decision in each trial was based on the sensory cues acquired in that trial and on decisions and reward locations in previous trials. When sensory cues were acquired by body contacts, rat decisions relied more on the reward location in previous trials. Overall, the results suggest that rats can generalize the idea of relative object location across different body parts, while preferring to rely on whiskers-based localization, which occurs earlier and conveys higher resolution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), are devastating age-associated brain disorders. Significant efforts have been made to uncover the molecular and cellular pathogenic mechanisms that underlie NDDs. However, our understanding of the neural circuit mechanisms that mediate NDDs and associated symptomatic features have been hindered by technological limitations. Our inability to identify and track individual neurons longitudinally in subcortical brain regions that are preferentially targeted in NDDs has left gaping holes in our knowledge of NDDs. Recent development and advancement of the miniature fluorescence microscope (miniscope) has opened up new avenues for examining spatially and temporally coordinated activity from hundreds of cells in deep brain structures in freely moving rodents. In the present mini-review, we examine the capabilities of current and future miniscope tools and discuss the innovative applications of miniscope imaging techniques that can push the boundaries of our understanding of neural circuit mechanisms of NDDs into new territories.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurons perform computations by integrating inputs from thousands of synapses—mostly in the dendritic tree—to drive action potential firing in the axon. One fruitful approach to studying this process is to record from neurons using patch-clamp electrodes, fill the recorded neurons with a substance that allows subsequent staining, reconstruct the three-dimensional architectures of the dendrites, and use the resulting functional and structural data to develop computer models of dendritic integration. Accurately producing quantitative reconstructions of dendrites is typically a tedious process taking many hours of manual inspection and measurement. Here we present ShuTu, a new software package that facilitates accurate and efficient reconstruction of dendrites imaged using bright-field microscopy. The program operates in two steps: (1) automated identification of dendritic processes, and (2) manual correction of errors in the automated reconstruction. This approach allows neurons with complex dendritic morphologies to be reconstructed rapidly and efficiently, thus facilitating the use of computer models to study dendritic structure-function relationships and the computations performed by single neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) modulates neural networks. Computer simulations, while used to identify how currents behave within tissues of different conductivity properties, still need to be complemented by physical models.&lt;/p&gt;Objective/Hypothesis&lt;p&gt;To better understand tDCS effects on biology-mimicking tissues by developing and testing the feasibility of a high-fidelity 3D head phantom model that has sensing capabilities at different compartmental levels.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Models obtained from MRI images generated 3D printed molds. Agar phantoms were fabricated, and 18 monitoring electrodes were placed on specific phantom brain areas.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;When using rectangular electrodes, the measured and simulated voltages at the monitoring electrodes agreed reasonably well, except at excitation locations. The electric field distribution in different phantom layers appeared better confined with circular electrodes compared to rectangular electrodes.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The high-fidelity 3D head model was found to be feasible and comparable with computer-based electrical simulations, with high correlation between simulated and measured brain voltages. This feasibility study supports testing to further assess the reliability of this model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Synchronization, harmonization, vibrations, or simply resonance in its most general sense seems to have an integral relationship with consciousness itself. One of the possible “neural correlates of consciousness” in mammalian brains is a specific combination of gamma, beta and theta electrical synchrony. More broadly, we see similar kinds of resonance patterns in living and non-living structures of many types. What clues can resonance provide about the nature of consciousness more generally? This paper provides an overview of resonating structures in the fields of neuroscience, biology and physics and offers a possible solution to what we see as the “easy part” of the “Hard Problem” of consciousness, which is generally known as the “combination problem.” The combination problem asks: how do micro-conscious entities combine into a higher-level macro-consciousness? The proposed solution in the context of mammalian consciousness suggests that a shared resonance is what allows different parts of the brain to achieve a phase transition in the speed and bandwidth of information flows between the constituent parts. This phase transition allows for richer varieties of consciousness to arise, with the character and content of that consciousness in each moment determined by the particular set of constituent neurons. We also offer more general insights into the ontology of consciousness and suggest that consciousness manifests as a continuum of increasing richness in all physical processes, distinguishing our view from emergentist materialism. We refer to this approach, a meta-synthesis, as a (general) resonance theory of consciousness. We offer some suggestions for testing the theory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Resting state networks (RSNs) extracted from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans are believed to reflect the intrinsic organization and network structure of brain regions. Most traditional methods for computing RSNs typically assume these functional networks are static throughout the duration of a scan lasting 5–15 min. However, they are known to vary on timescales ranging from seconds to years; in addition, the dynamic properties of RSNs are affected in a wide variety of neurological disorders. Recently, there has been a proliferation of methods for characterizing RSN dynamics, yet it remains a challenge to extract reproducible time-resolved networks. In this paper, we develop a novel method based on dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to extract networks from short windows of noisy, high-dimensional fMRI data, allowing RSNs from single scans to be resolved robustly at a temporal resolution of seconds. After validating the method on a synthetic dataset, we analyze data from 120 individuals from the Human Connectome Project and show that unsupervised clustering of DMD modes discovers RSNs at both the group (gDMD) and the single subject (sDMD) levels. The gDMD modes closely resemble canonical RSNs. Compared to established methods, sDMD modes capture individualized RSN structure that both better resembles the population RSN and better captures subject-level variation. We further leverage this time-resolved sDMD analysis to infer occupancy and transitions among RSNs with high reproducibility. This automated DMD-based method is a powerful tool to characterize spatial and temporal structures of RSNs in individual subjects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Long-range regulation by distal enhancers is crucial for many biological processes. The existing methods for enhancer-target gene prediction often require many genomic features. This makes them difficult to be applied to many cell types, in which the relevant datasets are not always available. Here, we design a tool EAGLE, an enhancer and gene learning ensemble method for identification of Enhancer-Gene (EG) interactions. Unlike existing tools, EAGLE used only six features derived from the genomic features of enhancers and gene expression datasets. Cross-validation revealed that EAGLE outperformed other existing methods. Enrichment analyses on special transcriptional factors, epigenetic modifications, and eQTLs demonstrated that EAGLE could distinguish the interacting pairs from non- interacting ones. Finally, EAGLE was applied to mouse and human genomes and identified 7,680,203 and 7,437,255 EG interactions involving 31,375 and 43,724 genes, 138,547 and 177,062 enhancers across 89 and 110 tissue/cell types in mouse and human, respectively. The obtained interactions are accessible through an interactive database enhanceratlas.org. The EAGLE method is available at https://github.com/EvansGao/EAGLE and the predicted datasets are available in http://www.enhanceratlas.org/.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PPoXB50QwMk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Long-term potentiation and depression of synaptic activity in response to stimuli is a key factor in reinforcement learning. Strengthening of the corticostriatal synapses depends on the second messenger cAMP, whose synthesis is catalysed by the enzyme adenylyl cyclase 5 (AC5), which is itself regulated by the stimulatory Gα&lt;sub&gt;olf&lt;/sub&gt; and inhibitory Gα&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; proteins. AC isoforms have been suggested to act as coincidence detectors, promoting cellular responses only when convergent regulatory signals occur close in time. However, the mechanism for this is currently unclear, and seems to lie in their diverse regulation patterns. Despite attempts to isolate the ternary complex, it is not known if Gα&lt;sub&gt;olf&lt;/sub&gt; and Gα&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; can bind to AC5 simultaneously, nor what activity the complex would have. Using protein structure-based molecular dynamics simulations, we show that this complex is stable and inactive. These simulations, along with Brownian dynamics simulations to estimate protein association rates constants, constrain a kinetic model that shows that the presence of this ternary inactive complex is crucial for AC5’s ability to detect coincident signals, producing a synergistic increase in cAMP. These results reveal some of the prerequisites for corticostriatal synaptic plasticity, and explain recent experimental data on cAMP concentrations following receptor activation. Moreover, they provide insights into the regulatory mechanisms that control signal processing by different AC isoforms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7gNip9UWX-Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Weight loss is an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease that can precede the cognitive decline, raising the possibility that amyloid-β (Aβ) disrupts hypothalamic neurons critical for the regulation of body weight. We previously reported that, in young transgenic mice overexpressing mutated amyloid precursor protein (Tg2576), Aβ causes dysfunction in neuropeptide Y (NPY)-expressing hypothalamic arcuate neurons before plaque formation. In this study, we examined whether Aβ causes arcuate NPY neuronal dysfunction by disrupting intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis. Here, we found that the L-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel blocker nimodipine could hyperpolarize the membrane potential, decrease the spontaneous activity, and reduce the intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels in arcuate NPY neurons from Tg2576 brain slices. In these neurons, there was a shift from high to low voltage-threshold activated L-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; currents, resulting in increased Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx closer to the resting membrane potential, an effect recapitulated by Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; and reversed by nimodipine. These low voltage-threshold activated L-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; currents were dependent in part on calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; pathways. Furthermore, the effects on intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling by both a positive (ghrelin) and negative (leptin) modulator were blunted in these neurons. Nimodipine pretreatment restored the response to ghrelin-mediated feeding in young (3–5 months), but not older (10 months), female Tg2576 mice, suggesting that intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dysregulation is only reversible early in Aβ pathology. Collectively, these findings provide evidence for a key role for low-threshold activated voltage gated L-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels in Aβ-mediated neuronal dysfunction and in the regulation of body weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Weight loss is one of the earliest manifestations of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying cellular mechanisms remain unknown. Disruption of intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis by amyloid-β is hypothesized to be critical for the early neuronal dysfunction driving AD pathogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that amyloid-β causes a shift from high to low voltage-threshold activated L-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; currents in arcuate neuropeptide Y neurons. This leads to increased Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx closer to the resting membrane potential, resulting in intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dyshomeostasis and neuronal dysfunction, an effect reversible by the L-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel blocker nimodipine early in amyloid-β pathology. These findings highlight a novel mechanism of amyloid-β-mediated neuronal dysfunction through L-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels and the importance of these channels in the regulation of body weight.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Circuit-Specific Early Impairment of Proprioceptive Sensory Neurons in the SOD1G93A Mouse Model for ALS</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease in which motor neurons degenerate, resulting in muscle atrophy, paralysis, and fatality. Studies using mouse models of ALS indicate a protracted period of disease development with progressive motor neuron pathology, evident as early as embryonic and postnatal stages. Key missing information includes concomitant alterations in the sensorimotor circuit essential for normal development and function of the neuromuscular system. Leveraging unique brainstem circuitry, we show &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; evidence for reflex circuit-specific postnatal abnormalities in the jaw proprioceptive sensory neurons in the well-studied SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; mouse. These include impaired and arrhythmic action potential burst discharge associated with a deficit in Nav1.6 Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. However, the mechanoreceptive and nociceptive trigeminal ganglion neurons and the visual sensory retinal ganglion neurons were resistant to excitability changes in age-matched SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Computational modeling of the observed disruption in sensory patterns predicted asynchronous self-sustained motor neuron discharge suggestive of imminent reflexive defects, such as muscle fasciculations in ALS. These results demonstrate a novel reflex circuit-specific proprioceptive sensory abnormality in ALS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neurodegenerative diseases have prolonged periods of disease development and progression. Identifying early markers of vulnerability can therefore help devise better diagnostic and treatment strategies. In this study, we examined postnatal abnormalities in the electrical excitability of muscle spindle afferent proprioceptive neurons in the well-studied SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; mouse model for neurodegenerative motor neuron disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our findings suggest that these proprioceptive sensory neurons are exclusively afflicted early in the disease process relative to sensory neurons of other modalities. Moreover, they presented Nav1.6 Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel deficiency, which contributed to arrhythmic burst discharge. Such sensory arrhythmia could initiate reflexive defects, such as muscle fasciculations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as suggested by our computational model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Higher CSF Tau Levels Are Related to Hippocampal Hyperactivity and Object Mnemonic Discrimination in Older Adults</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/44/8788?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mnemonic discrimination, the ability to distinguish similar events in memory, relies on subregions in the human medial temporal lobes (MTLs). Tau pathology is frequently found within the MTL of older adults and therefore likely to affect mnemonic discrimination, even in healthy older individuals. The MTL subregions that are known to be affected early by tau pathology, the perirhinal-transentorhinal region (area 35) and the anterior-lateral entorhinal cortex (alEC), have recently been implicated in the mnemonic discrimination of objects rather than scenes. Here we used an object-scene mnemonic discrimination task in combination with fMRI recordings and analyzed the relationship between subregional MTL activity, memory performance, and levels of total and phosphorylated tau as well as Aβ42/40 ratio in CSF. We show that activity in alEC was associated with mnemonic discrimination of similar objects but not scenes in male and female cognitively unimpaired older adults. Importantly, CSF tau levels were associated with increased fMRI activity in the hippocampus, and both increased hippocampal activity as well as tau levels were associated with mnemonic discrimination of objects, but again not scenes. This suggests that dysfunction of the alEC-hippocampus object mnemonic discrimination network might be a marker for tau-related cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Subregions in the human medial temporal lobe are critically involved in episodic memory and, at the same time, affected by tau pathology. Impaired object mnemonic discrimination performance as well as aberrant activity within the entorhinal-hippocampal circuitry have been reported in earlier studies involving older individuals, but it has thus far remained elusive whether and how tau pathology is implicated in this specific impairment. Using task-related fMRI in combination with measures of tau pathology in CSF, we show that measures of tau pathology are associated with increased hippocampal activity and reduced mnemonic discrimination of similar objects but not scenes. This suggests that object mnemonic discrimination tasks could be promising markers for tau-related cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Toward Robust Functional Neuroimaging Genetics of Cognition</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/44/8778?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A commonly held assumption in cognitive neuroscience is that, because measures of human brain function are closer to underlying biology than distal indices of behavior/cognition, they hold more promise for uncovering genetic pathways. Supporting this view is an influential fMRI-based study of sentence reading/listening by Pinel et al. (2012), who reported that common DNA variants in specific candidate genes were associated with altered neural activation in language-related regions of healthy individuals that carried them. In particular, different single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of &lt;i&gt;FOXP2&lt;/i&gt; correlated with variation in task-based activation in left inferior frontal and precentral gyri, whereas a SNP at the &lt;i&gt;KIAA0319/TTRAP/THEM2&lt;/i&gt; locus was associated with variable functional asymmetry of the superior temporal sulcus. Here, we directly test each claim using a closely matched neuroimaging genetics approach in independent cohorts comprising 427 participants, four times larger than the original study of 94 participants. Despite demonstrating power to detect associations with substantially smaller effect sizes than those of the original report, we do not replicate any of the reported associations. Moreover, formal Bayesian analyses reveal substantial to strong evidence in support of the null hypothesis (no effect). We highlight key aspects of the original investigation, common to functional neuroimaging genetics studies, which could have yielded elevated false-positive rates. Genetic accounts of individual differences in cognitive functional neuroimaging are likely to be as complex as behavioral/cognitive tests, involving many common genetic variants, each of tiny effect. Reliable identification of true biological signals requires large sample sizes, power calculations, and validation in independent cohorts with equivalent paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; A pervasive idea in neuroscience is that neuroimaging-based measures of brain function, being closer to underlying neurobiology, are more amenable for uncovering links to genetics. This is a core assumption of prominent studies that associate common DNA variants with altered activations in task-based fMRI, despite using samples (10–100 people) that lack power for detecting the tiny effect sizes typical of genetically complex traits. Here, we test central findings from one of the most influential prior studies. Using matching paradigms and substantially larger samples, coupled to power calculations and formal Bayesian statistics, our data strongly refute the original findings. We demonstrate that neuroimaging genetics with task-based fMRI should be subject to the same rigorous standards as studies of other complex traits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cannabidiol Counteracts the Psychotropic Side-Effects of {Delta}-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol in the Ventral Hippocampus through Bidirectional Control of ERK1-2 Phosphorylation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/44/8762?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/44/8762?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests that the phytocannabinoids -9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) differentially regulate salience attribution and psychiatric risk. The ventral hippocampus (vHipp) relays emotional salience via control of dopamine (DA) neuronal activity states, which are dysregulated in psychosis and schizophrenia. Using &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiology in male Sprague Dawley rats, we demonstrate that intra-vHipp THC strongly increases ventral tegmental area (VTA) DA neuronal frequency and bursting rates, decreases GABA frequency, and amplifies VTA beta, gamma and  oscillatory magnitudes via modulation of local extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation (pERK1–2). Remarkably, whereas intra-vHipp THC also potentiates salience attribution in morphine place-preference and fear conditioning assays, CBD coadministration reverses these changes by downregulating pERK1–2 signaling, as pharmacological reactivation of pERK1–2 blocked the inhibitory properties of CBD. These results identify vHipp pERK1–2 signaling as a critical neural nexus point mediating THC-induced affective disturbances and suggest a potential mechanism by which CBD may counteract the psychotomimetic and psychotropic side effects of THC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Strains of marijuana with high levels of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and low levels of cannabidiol (CBD) have been shown to underlie neuropsychiatric risks associated with high-potency cannabis use. However, the mechanisms by which CBD mitigates the side effects of THC have not been identified. We demonstrate that THC induces cognitive and affective abnormalities resembling neuropsychiatric symptoms directly in the hippocampus, while dysregulating dopamine activity states and amplifying oscillatory frequencies in the ventral tegmental area via modulation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. In contrast, CBD coadministration blocked THC-induced ERK phosphorylation, and prevented THC-induced behavioral and neural abnormalities. These findings identify a novel molecular mechanism that may account for how CBD functionally mitigates the neuropsychiatric side effects of THC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Coordination of Human Hippocampal Sharpwave Ripples during NREM Sleep with Cortical Theta Bursts, Spindles, Downstates, and Upstates</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/44/8744?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In rodents, waking firing patterns replay in NREM sleep during hippocampal sharpwave ripples (HC-SWRs), correlated with neocortical graphoelements (NC-GEs). NC-GEs include theta bursts, spindles, downstates, and upstates. In humans, consolidation during sleep is correlated with scalp-recorded spindles and downstates/upstates, but HC-SWRs cannot be recorded noninvasively. Here we show in humans of both sexes that HC-SWRs are highly correlated with NC-GEs during NREM, with significantly more related HC-SWRs/NC-GEs for downstates or upstates than theta bursts or spindles, in N2 than N3, in posterior than anterior HC, in frontal than occipital cortex, and ipsilaterally than contralaterally. The preferences interacted (e.g., frontal spindles co-occurred frequently with posterior HC-SWRs in N2). These preferred GEs, stages, and locations for HC-SWR/NC-GE interactions may index selective consolidation activity, although that was not tested in this study. SWR recorded in different HC regions seldom co-occurred, and were related to GE in different cortical areas, showing that HC-NC interact in multiple transient, widespread but discrete, networks. NC-GEs tend to occur with consistent temporal relationships to HC-SWRs, and to each other. Cortical theta bursts usually precede HC-SWRs, where they may help define cortical input triggering HC-SWR firing. HC-SWRs often follow cortical downstate onsets, surrounded by locally decreased broadband power, suggesting a mechanism synchronizing cortical, thalamic, and hippocampal activities. Widespread cortical upstates and spindles follow HC-SWRs, consistent with the hypothesized contribution by hippocampal firing during HC-SWRs to cortical firing-patterns during upstates and spindles. Overall, our results describe how hippocampal and cortical oscillations are coordinated in humans during events that are critical for memory consolidation in rodents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Hippocampal sharpwave ripples, essential for memory consolidation, mark when hippocampal neurons replay waking firing patterns. In rodents, cortical sleep waves coordinate the transfer of temporary hippocampal to permanent cortical memories, but their relationship with human hippocampal sharpwave ripples remains unclear. We show that human hippocampal sharpwave ripples co-occur with all varieties of cortical sleep waves, in all cortical regions, and in all stages of NREM sleep, but with overall preferences for each of these. We found that sharpwave ripples in different parts of the hippocampus usually occurred independently of each other, and preferentially interacted with different cortical areas. We found that sharpwave ripples typically occur after certain types of cortical waves, and before others, suggesting how the cortico-hippocampo-cortical interaction may be organized in time and space.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Drosophila Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase Regulates Habituation Latency and Facilitation in Distinct Mushroom Body Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/44/8730?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Habituation is the adaptive behavioral outcome of processes engaged in timely devaluation of non-reinforced repetitive stimuli, but the neuronal circuits and molecular mechanisms that underlie them are not well understood. To gain insights into these processes we developed and characterized a habituation assay to repetitive footshocks in mixed sex &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; groups and demonstrated that acute neurotransmission from adult α/β mushroom body (MB) neurons prevents premature stimulus devaluation. Herein we demonstrate that activity of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase dBtk protein is required within these neurons to prevent premature habituation. Significantly, we also demonstrate that the complementary process of timely habituation to the repetitive stimulation is facilitated by α'/β' MB neurons and also requires dBtk activity. Hence our results provide initial insights into molecular mechanisms engaged in footshock habituation within distinct MB neurons. Importantly, dBtk attenuation specifically within α'/β' neurons leads to defective habituation, which is readily reversible by administration of the antipsychotics clozapine and risperidone suggesting that the loss of the kinase may dysregulate monoamine receptors within these neurons, whose activity underlies the failure to habituate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Habituation refers to processes underlying decisions to attend or ignore stimuli, which are pivotal to brain function as they underlie selective attention and learning, but the circuits involved and the molecular mechanisms engaged by the process therein are poorly understood. We demonstrate that habituation to repetitive footshock involves two phases mediated by distinct neurons of the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; mushroom bodies and require the function of the dBtk non-receptor tyrosine kinase. Moreover, habituation failure upon dBtk abrogation in neurons where it is required to facilitate the process is readily reversible by antipsychotics, providing conceptual links to particular symptoms of schizophrenia in humans, also characterized by habituation defects and ameliorated by these pharmaceuticals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Insular Cortex Projections to Nucleus Accumbens Core Mediate Social Approach to Stressed Juvenile Rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/44/8717?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Social interactions are shaped by features of the interactants, including age, emotion, sex, and familiarity. Age-specific responses to social affect are evident when an adult male rat is presented with a pair of unfamiliar male conspecifics, one of which is stressed via two foot shocks and the other naive to treatment. Adult test rats prefer to interact with stressed juvenile (postnatal day 30, PN30) conspecifics but avoid stressed adult (PN50) conspecifics. This pattern depends upon the insular cortex (IC), which is anatomically connected to the nucleus accumbens core (NAc). The goal of this work was to test the necessity of IC projections to NAc during social affective behavior. Here, bilateral pharmacological inhibition of the NAc with tetrodotoxin (1 μm; 0.5 μl/side) abolished the preference for stressed PN30, but did not alter interactions with PN50 conspecifics. Using a combination of retrograding tracing and c-Fos immunohistochemistry, we report that social interactions with stressed PN30 conspecifics elicit greater Fos immunoreactivity in IC -&amp;gt; NAc neurons than interactions with naive PN30 conspecifics. Chemogenetic stimulation of IC terminals in the NAc increased social exploration with juvenile, but not adult, conspecifics, whereas chemogenetic inhibition of this tract blocked the preference to investigate stressed PN30 conspecifics, which expands upon our previous finding that optogenetic inhibition of IC projection neurons mediated approach and avoidance. These new findings suggest that outputs of IC to the NAc modulate social approach, which provides new insight to the neural circuitry underlying social decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Social decision-making underlies an animal's behavioral response to others in a range of social contexts. Previous findings indicate the insular cortex (IC) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc) play important roles in social behaviors, and human neuroimaging implicates both IC and NAc in autism and other psychiatric disorders characterized by aberrant social cognition. To test whether IC projections to the NAc are involved in social decision-making, circuit-specific chemogenetic manipulations demonstrated that the IC -&amp;gt; NAc pathway mediates social approach toward distressed juvenile, but not adult, conspecifics. This finding is the first to implicate this circuit in rodent socioemotional behaviors and may be a neuroanatomical substrate for integration of emotion with social reward.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Network Degeneracy and the Dynamics of Task Switching in the Feeding Circuit in Aplysia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/44/8705?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/44/8705?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The characteristics of a network are determined by parameters that describe the intrinsic properties of the component neurons and their synapses. Degeneracy occurs when more than one set of parameters produces the same (or very similar) output. It is not clear whether network degeneracy impacts network function or is simply a reflection of the fact that, although it is important for a network to be able to generate a particular output, it is not important how this is achieved. We address this issue in the feeding network of the mollusc &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt;. In this system, there are two stimulation paradigms that generate egestive motor programs: repetition priming and positive biasing. We demonstrate that circuit parameters differ in the 2 cases (e.g., egestive repetition priming requires activity in an interneuron, B20, which is not essential for positive biasing). We show that degeneracy has consequences for task switching. If egestive repetition priming is immediately followed by stimulation of an ingestive input to the feeding central pattern generator, the first few cycles of activity are egestive (not ingestive). In this situation, there is a task switch cost. This &quot;cost&quot; is in part due to the potentiating effect of egestive repetition priming on B20. In contrast, there is no switch cost after positive biasing. Stimulation of the ingestive central pattern generator input immediately triggers ingestive activity. Our results indicate that the mechanisms used to pattern activity can impact network function in that they can determine how readily a network can switch from one configuration to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; A particular pattern of neural activity can be generated by more than one set of circuit parameters. How or whether this impacts network function is unclear. We address this issue in the feeding network of &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt; and demonstrate that degeneracy in network function can have consequences for task switching. Namely, we show that, when egestive activity is generated via one set of circuit modifications, an immediate switch to ingestive activity is not possible. In contrast, rapid transitions to ingestive activity are possible if egestive activity is generated via a different set of circuit modifications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Separate But Interactive Parallel Olfactory Processing Streams Governed by Different Types of GABAergic Feedback Neurons in the Mushroom Body of a Basal Insect</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The basic organization of the olfactory system has been the subject of extensive studies in vertebrates and invertebrates. In many animals, GABA-ergic neurons inhibit spike activities of higher-order olfactory neurons and help sparsening of their odor representations. In the cockroach, two different types of GABA-immunoreactive interneurons (calyceal giants [CGs]) mainly project to the base and lip regions of the calyces (input areas) of the mushroom body (MB), a second-order olfactory center. The base and lip regions receive axon terminals of two different types of projection neurons, which receive synapses from different classes of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), and receive dendrites of different classes of Kenyon cells, MB intrinsic neurons. We performed intracellular recordings from pairs of CGs and MB output neurons (MBONs) of male American cockroaches, the latter receiving synapses from Kenyon cells, and we found that a CG receives excitatory synapses from an MBON and that odor responses of the MBON are changed by current injection into the CG. Such feedback effects, however, were often weak or absent in pairs of neurons that belong to different streams, suggesting parallel organization of the recurrent pathways, although interactions between different streams were also evident. Cross-covariance analysis of the spike activities of CGs and MBONs suggested that odor stimulation produces synchronized spike activities in MBONs and then in CGs. We suggest that there are separate but interactive parallel streams to process odors detected by different OSNs throughout the olfactory processing system in cockroaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Organizational principles of the olfactory system have been the subject of extensive studies. In cockroaches, signals from olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) in two different classes of sensilla are sent to two different classes of projection neurons, which terminate in different areas of the mushroom body (MB), each area having dendrites of different classes of MB intrinsic neurons (Kenyon cells) and terminations of different classes of GABAergic neurons. Physiological and morphological assessments derived from simultaneous intracellular recordings/stainings from GABAergic neurons and MB output neurons suggested that GABAergic neurons play feedback roles and that odors detected by OSNs are processed in separate but interactive processing streams throughout the central olfactory system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Sound-Sensitive Source of Alpha Oscillations in Human Non-Primary Auditory Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/44/8679?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/44/8679?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The functional organization of human auditory cortex can be probed by characterizing responses to various classes of sound at different anatomical locations. Along with histological studies this approach has revealed a primary field in posteromedial Heschl's gyrus (HG) with pronounced induced high-frequency (70–150 Hz) activity and short-latency responses that phase-lock to rapid transient sounds. Low-frequency neural oscillations are also relevant to stimulus processing and information flow, however, their distribution within auditory cortex has not been established. Alpha activity (7–14 Hz) in particular has been associated with processes that may differentially engage earlier versus later levels of the cortical hierarchy, including functional inhibition and the communication of sensory predictions. These theories derive largely from the study of occipitoparietal sources readily detectable in scalp electroencephalography. To characterize the anatomical basis and functional significance of less accessible temporal-lobe alpha activity we analyzed responses to sentences in seven human adults (4 female) with epilepsy who had been implanted with electrodes in superior temporal cortex. In contrast to primary cortex in posteromedial HG, a non-primary field in anterolateral HG was characterized by high spontaneous alpha activity that was strongly suppressed during auditory stimulation. Alpha-power suppression decreased with distance from anterolateral HG throughout superior temporal cortex, and was more pronounced for clear compared to degraded speech. This suppression could not be accounted for solely by a change in the slope of the power spectrum. The differential manifestation and stimulus-sensitivity of alpha oscillations across auditory fields should be accounted for in theories of their generation and function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; To understand how auditory cortex is organized in support of perception, we recorded from patients implanted with electrodes for clinical reasons. This allowed measurement of activity in brain regions at different levels of sensory processing. Oscillations in the alpha range (7–14 Hz) have been associated with functions including sensory prediction and inhibition of regions handling irrelevant information, but their distribution within auditory cortex is not known. A key finding was that these oscillations dominated in one particular non-primary field, anterolateral Heschl's gyrus, and were suppressed when subjects listened to sentences. These results build on our knowledge of the functional organization of auditory cortex and provide anatomical constraints on theories of the generation and function of alpha oscillations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Adaptive Efficient Coding of Correlated Acoustic Properties</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Natural sounds such as vocalizations often have covarying acoustic attributes, resulting in redundancy in neural coding. The efficient coding hypothesis proposes that sensory systems are able to detect such covariation and adapt to reduce redundancy, leading to more efficient neural coding. Recent psychoacoustic studies have shown the auditory system can rapidly adapt to efficiently encode two covarying dimensions as a single dimension, following passive exposure to sounds in which temporal and spectral attributes covaried in a correlated fashion. However, these studies observed a cost to this adaptation, which was a loss of sensitivity to the orthogonal dimension. Here we explore the neural basis of this psychophysical phenomenon by recording single-unit responses from the primary auditory cortex in awake ferrets exposed passively to stimuli with two correlated attributes, similar in stimulus design to the psychoacoustic experiments in humans. We found: (1) the signal-to-noise ratio of spike-rate coding of cortical responses driven by sounds with correlated attributes remained unchanged along the exposure dimension, but was reduced along the orthogonal dimension; (2) performance of a decoder trained with spike data to discriminate stimuli along the orthogonal dimension was equally reduced; (3) correlations between neurons tuned to the two covarying attributes decreased after exposure; and (4) these exposure effects still occurred if sounds were correlated along two acoustic dimensions, but varied randomly along a third dimension. These neurophysiological results are consistent with the efficient coding hypothesis and may help deepen our understanding of how the auditory system encodes and represents acoustic regularities and covariance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The efficient coding (EC) hypothesis (Attneave, 1954; Barlow, 1961) proposes that the neural code in sensory systems efficiently encodes natural stimuli by minimizing the number of spikes to transmit a sensory signal. Results of recent psychoacoustic studies in humans are consistent with the EC hypothesis in that, following passive exposure to stimuli with correlated attributes, the auditory system rapidly adapts so as to more efficiently encode the two covarying dimensions as a single dimension. In the current neurophysiological experiments, using a similar stimulus design and the experimental paradigm to the psychoacoustic studies of Stilp et al. (2010) and Stilp and Kluender (2011, 2012, 2016), we recorded responses from single neurons in the auditory cortex of the awake ferret, showing adaptive efficient neural coding of two correlated acoustic attributes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Postnatal Development of Functional Projections from Parasubiculum and Presubiculum to Medial Entorhinal Cortex in the Rat</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/44/8645?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurons in parasubiculum (PaS), presubiculum (PrS), and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) code for place (grid cells) and head direction. Directional input has been shown to be important for stable grid cell properties in MEC, and PaS and PrS have been postulated to provide this information to MEC. In line with this, head direction cells in those brain areas are present at postnatal day 11 (P11), having directional tuning that stabilizes shortly after eye opening, which is before premature grid cells emerge in MEC at P16. Whether functional connectivity between these structures exists at those early postnatal stages is unclear. Using anatomical tracing, voltage-sensitive dye imaging and single-cell patch recordings in female and male rat brain slices between P2 and P61, we determined when the pathways from PaS and PrS to MEC emerge, become functional, and how they develop. Anatomical connections from PaS and PrS to superficial MEC emerge between P4 and P6. Monosynaptic connectivity from PaS and PrS to superficial MEC was measurable from P9 to P10 onward, whereas connectivity with deep MEC was measurable from P11 to P12. From P14/P15 on, reactivity of MEC neurons to parasubicular and presubicular inputs becomes adult-like and continues to develop until P28-P30. The maturation of the efficacy of both inputs between P9 and P21 is paralleled by maturation of morphological properties, changes in intrinsic properties of MEC principal neurons, and changes in the GABAergic network of MEC. In conclusion, synaptic projections from PaS and PrS to MEC become functional and adult-like before the emergence of grid cells in MEC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Head direction information, crucial for grid cells in medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), is thought to enter MEC via parasubiculum (PaS) and presubiculum (PrS). Unraveling the development of functional connections between PaS, PrS, and MEC is key to understanding how spatial navigation, an important cognitive function, may evolve. To gain insight into the development, we used anatomical tracing techniques, voltage-sensitive dye imaging, and single-cell recordings. The combined data led us to conclude that synaptic projections from PaS and PrS to MEC become functional and adult-like before eye opening, allowing crucial head direction information to influence place encoding before the emergence of grid cells in rat MEC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Isoform Specificity of PKMs during Long-Term Facilitation in Aplysia Is Mediated through Stabilization by KIBRA</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/44/8632?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Persistent activity of protein kinase M (PKM), the truncated form of protein kinase C (PKC), can maintain long-term changes in synaptic strength in many systems, including the hermaphrodite marine mollusk, &lt;i&gt;Aplysia californica&lt;/i&gt;. Moreover, different types of long-term facilitation (LTF) in cultured &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt; sensorimotor synapses rely on the activities of different PKM isoforms in the presynaptic sensory neuron and postsynaptic motor neuron. When the atypical PKM isoform is required, the kidney and brain expressed adaptor protein (KIBRA) is also required. Here, we explore how this isoform specificity is established. We find that PKM overexpression in the motor neuron, but not the sensory neuron, is sufficient to increase synaptic strength and that this activity is not isoform-specific. KIBRA is not the rate-limiting step in facilitation since overexpression of KIBRA is neither sufficient to increase synaptic strength, nor to prolong a form of PKM-dependent intermediate synaptic facilitation. However, the isoform specificity of dominant-negative-PKMs to erase LTF is correlated with isoform-specific competition for stabilization by KIBRA. We identify a new conserved region of KIBRA. Different splice isoforms in this region stabilize different PKMs based on the isoform-specific sequence of an α-helix &quot;handle&quot; in the PKMs. Thus, specific stabilization of distinct PKMs by different isoforms of KIBRA can explain the isoform specificity of PKMs during LTF in &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Long-lasting changes in synaptic plasticity associated with memory formation are maintained by persistent protein kinases. We have previously shown in the &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt; sensorimotor model that distinct isoforms of persistently active protein kinase Cs (PKMs) maintain distinct forms of long-lasting synaptic changes, even when both forms are expressed in the same motor neuron. Here, we show that, while the effects of overexpression of PKMs are not isoform-specific, isoform specificity is defined by a &quot;handle&quot; helix in PKMs that confers stabilization by distinct splice forms in a previously undefined domain of the adaptor protein KIBRA. Thus, we define new regions in both KIBRA and PKMs that define the isoform specificity for maintaining synaptic strength in distinct facilitation paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: RIMB-1/RIM-Binding Protein and UNC-10/RIM Redundantly Regulate Presynaptic Localization of the Voltage-Gated Calcium Channel in Caenorhabditis elegans</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/44/8617?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/44/8617?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Presynaptic active zones (AZs) contain many molecules essential for neurotransmitter release and are assembled in a highly organized manner. A network of adaptor proteins known as cytomatrix at the AZ (CAZ) is important for shaping the structural characteristics of AZ. Rab3-interacting molecule (RIM)-binding protein (RBP) family are binding partners of the CAZ protein RIM and also bind the voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) in mice and flies. Here, we investigated the physiological roles of RIMB-1, the homolog of RBPs in the nematode &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;. RIMB-1 is expressed broadly in neurons and predominantly localized at presynaptic sites. Loss-of-function animals of &lt;i&gt;rimb-1&lt;/i&gt; displayed slight defects in motility and response to pharmacological inhibition of synaptic transmission, suggesting a modest involvement of &lt;i&gt;rimb-1&lt;/i&gt; in synapse function. We analyzed genetic interactions of &lt;i&gt;rimb-1&lt;/i&gt; by testing candidate genes and by an unbiased forward genetic screen for &lt;i&gt;rimb-1&lt;/i&gt; enhancer. Both analyses identified the RIM homolog UNC-10 that acts together with RIMB-1 to regulate presynaptic localization of the P/Q-type VGCC UNC-2/Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;2. We also find that the precise localization of RIMB-1 to presynaptic sites requires presynaptic UNC-2/Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;2. RIMB-1 has multiple FN3 and SH3 domains. Our transgenic rescue analysis with RIMB-1 deletion constructs revealed a functional requirement of a C-terminal SH3 in regulating UNC-2/Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;2 localization. Together, these findings suggest a redundant role of RIMB-1/RBP and UNC-10/RIM to regulate the abundance of UNC-2/Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;2 at the presynaptic AZ in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;, depending on the bidirectional interplay between CAZ adaptor and channel proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Presynaptic active zones (AZs) are highly organized structures for synaptic transmission with characteristic networks of adaptor proteins called cytomatrix at the AZ (CAZ). In this study, we characterized a CAZ protein RIMB-1, named for RIM-binding protein (RBP), in the nematode &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;. Through systematic analyses of genetic interactions and an unbiased genetic enhancer screen of &lt;i&gt;rimb-1&lt;/i&gt;, we revealed a redundant role of two CAZ proteins RIMB-1/RBP and UNC-10/RIM in regulating presynaptic localization of UNC-2/Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;2, a voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) critical for proper neurotransmitter release. Additionally, the precise localization of RIMB-1/RBP requires presynaptic UNC-2/Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;2. These findings provide new mechanistic insight about how the interplay among multiple CAZ adaptor proteins and VGCC contributes to the organization of presynaptic AZ.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Low‐Frequency Brain Oscillations Track Motor Recovery in Human Stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25615?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25615?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of patients with stroke survive the acute episode and live with enduring disability. Effective therapies to support recovery of motor function after stroke are yet to be developed. Key to this development is the identification of neurophysiologic signals that mark recovery and are suitable and susceptible to interventional therapies. Movement preparatory low‐frequency oscillations (LFOs) play a key role in cortical control of movement. Recent animal data point to a mechanistic role of motor cortical LFOs in stroke motor deficits and demonstrate neuromodulation intervention with therapeutic benefit. Their relevance in human stroke pathophysiology is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We studied the relationship between movement‐preparatory LFOs during the performance of a visuomotor grip task and motor function in a longitudinal (&amp;lt;5 days, 1 and 3 months) cohort study of 33 patients with motor stroke and in 19 healthy volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute stroke–lesioned brains fail to generate the LFO signal. Whereas in healthy humans, a transient occurrence of LFOs preceded movement onset at predominantly contralateral frontoparietal motor regions, recordings in patients revealed that movement‐preparatory LFOs were substantially diminished to a level of 38% after acute stroke. LFOs progressively increased at 1 and 3 months. This re‐emergence closely tracked the recovery of motor function across several movement qualities including grip strength, fine motor skills, and synergies and was frequency band specific.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results provide the first human evidence for a link between movement‐preparatory LFOs and functional recovery after stroke, promoting their relevance for movement control. These results suggest that it may be interesting to explore targeted, LFOs‐restorative brain stimulation therapy in human stroke patients. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Mapping holmes tremor circuit using the human brain connectome</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holmes tremor is a debilitating movement disorder with limited treatment options. Lesions causing Holmes tremor can occur in multiple different brain locations, leaving the neuroanatomical substrate unclear. Here, we test whether lesion locations that cause Holmes tremor map to a connected brain circuit and whether this circuit might serve as a useful therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case reports of Holmes tremor caused by focal brain lesions were identified through a systematic literature search. Connectivity between each lesion location and the rest of the brain was computed using resting state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging data from 1,000 healthy volunteers. Commonalities across lesion locations were identified. This Holmes tremor circuit was then compared to neurosurgical treatment targets and clinical efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified 36 lesions causing Holmes tremor, which were scattered across multiple different brain regions. However, all lesion locations were connected to a common brain circuit with nodes in the red nucleus, thalamus, globus pallidus, and cerebellum. In cases with effective neurosurgical treatment, the treatment target was connected with the lesion location, indicating that a second hit to the same circuit might be beneficial. Commonly used deep brain stimulation targets such as the ventral intermediate nucleus and subthalamic nucleus fell outside our Holmes tremor circuit, whereas the globus pallidus target was close, consistent with published clinical response rates for these targets.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesions causing Holmes tremor are part of a single connected brain circuit that may serve as an improved therapeutic target. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Here we review advances in theory and experiments that highlight how noise correlations are implicated in perceptual processes. We focus on the structure of correlations and variations in it to reveal the computations performed by the cortex. We argue that to discover the functional role of correlations in cortical computations, and make predictions about them, we need to harness hierarchical encoding models. We propose that in hierarchical models the source of noise correlations is dual: inference of both task-related and higher-level perceptual variables contribute to their emergence, which is reflected in the task- and stimulus-dependence of the correlation structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: October 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 58&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Sander W Keemink, Christian K Machens&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A central tenet of neuroscience is that the brain works through large populations of interacting neurons. With recent advances in recording techniques, the inner working of these populations has come into full view. Analyzing the resulting large-scale data sets is challenging because of the often complex and ‘mixed’ dependency of neural activities on experimental parameters, such as stimuli, decisions, or motor responses. Here we review recent insights gained from analyzing these data with dimensionality reduction methods that ‘demix’ these dependencies. We demonstrate that the mappings from (carefully chosen) experimental parameters to population activities appear to be typical and stable across tasks, brain areas, and animals, and are often identifiable by linear methods. By considering when and why dimensionality reduction and demixing work well, we argue for a view of population coding in which populations represent (demixed) latent signals, corresponding to stimuli, decisions, motor responses, and so on. These latent signals are encoded into neural population activity via non-linear mappings and decoded via linear readouts. We explain how such a scheme can facilitate the propagation of information across cortical areas, and we review neural network architectures that can reproduce the encoding and decoding of latent signals in population activities. These architectures promise a link from the biophysics of single neurons to the activities of neural populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

When incorporated into reinforcement-based machine learning algorithms, visual novelty can act as an intrinsic reward signal that vastly increases the efficiency of exploration and expedites learning, particularly in situations where external rewards are difficult to obtain. Here we review parallels between recent developments in novelty-driven machine learning algorithms and our understanding of how visual novelty is computed and signaled in the primate brain. We propose that in the visual system, novelty representations are not configured with the principal goal of detecting novel objects, but rather with the broader goal of flexibly generalizing novelty information across different states in the service of driving novelty-based learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

The two domains have been typically treated in complete separation both in terms of the underlying computational mechanisms and the brain areas and processes implementing those computations. However, a number of recent findings in both domains call in question this strict separation. We interpret classical and more recent results in the general framework of probabilistic computation, provide a unifying view of how various aspects of the two domains are interlinked, and suggest how the probabilistic approach can also alleviate the problem of dealing with widely different types of neural correlates of learning. Finally, we outline several directions along which our proposed approach fosters new types of experiments that can promote investigations of natural learning in humans and other species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

This skill is important for a range of behaviours from navigating a new city to learning music and language. Classical approaches that investigate our ability to extract the principles of organisation that govern complex environments focus on reward-based learning. Yet, the human brain is shown to be expert at learning generative structure based on mere exposure and without explicit reward. Individuals are shown to adapt to–unbeknownst to them–changes in the environment’s temporal statistics and predict future events. Further, we present evidence for a common brain architecture for unsupervised structure learning and reward-based learning, suggesting that the brain is built on the premise that ‘learning is its own reward’ to support adaptive behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Here we will review our current understanding of RTT, the landscape of pathogenic mutations and function of MeCP2, and culminate with recent advances elucidating the distinct DNA methylation landscape in the brain that may explain why disease symptoms are delayed and selective to the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Analysis of complex dynamical systems is also at the heart of control engineering, where it is central to the design of robust control strategies. Although a rich engineering literature has grown over decades to facilitate the analysis of such systems, little of it has percolated into neuroscience so far. Here, we give a brief introduction to a number of core control-theoretic concepts that provide useful perspectives on neural circuit dynamics. We introduce important mathematical tools related to these concepts, and establish connections to neural circuit analysis, focusing on a number of themes that have arisen from the modern ‘state-space’ view on neural population dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Recent work has highlighted this state-dependent functional flexibility of cortical circuits and provided initial insights into underlying circuit-level mechanisms. Transitions from quiescent to aroused or task-engaged behavioral states are associated with common motifs of network activity, including changes in correlations and enhanced sensory encoding. Evidence points to a key role for selective activation of specific GABAergic interneuron populations in mediating mode-switching in cortical networks. Finally, inhibitory interneurons may function as a critical target for convergent state-dependent neuromodulatory sculpting of cortical circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

In the past decade, the advent of new tools, such as functional imaging of populations of identified single neurons, high-density electrophysiology, virus-assisted circuit mapping, and precisely timed, cell-type specific manipulations, has advanced our understanding of the neuronal microcircuits underlying visual behavior. Studies in head-fixed mice, where such tools can routinely be applied, begin to provide new insights into the neural code of primary visual cortex (V1) underlying visual perception, and the micro-circuits of attention, predictive processing, and learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Recent experiments reveal that neuronal representations of learned sensorimotor tasks continually change over days and weeks, even after animals have achieved expert behavioral performance. How is learned information stored to allow consistent behavior despite ongoing changes in neuronal activity? What functions could ongoing reconfiguration serve? We highlight recent experimental evidence for such representational drift in sensorimotor systems, and discuss how this fits into a framework of distributed population codes. We identify recent theoretical work that suggests computational roles for drift and argue that the recurrent and distributed nature of sensorimotor representations permits drift while limiting disruptive effects. We propose that representational drift may create error signals between interconnected brain regions that can be used to keep neural codes consistent in the presence of continual change. These concepts suggest experimental and theoretical approaches to studying both learning and maintenance of distributed and adaptive population codes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

In models, the critical state offers a number of computational advantages. Thus this hypothesis, and in particular the experimental work by Beggs and Plenz (2003), has triggered an avalanche of research, with thousands of studies referring to it. Nonetheless, experimental results are still contradictory. How is it possible, that a hypothesis has attracted active research for decades, but nonetheless remains controversial? We discuss the experimental and conceptual controversy, and then present a parsimonious solution that (i) unifies the contradictory experimental results, (ii) avoids disadvantages of a critical state, and (iii) enables rapid, adaptive tuning of network properties to task requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Here, we review emerging conceptual and technological advances that begin to address this challenge, garnering insights from both biological and artificial neural networks. We argue that neural data should be recorded during rich behavioral tasks, to model cognitive processes and estimate latent behavioral variables. Careful quantification of animal movements can also provide a more complete picture of how movements shape neural dynamics and reflect changes in brain state, such as arousal or stress. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) could serve as artificial model organisms to connect neural dynamics and rich behavioral data. ANNs have already begun to reveal how a wide range of different behaviors can be implemented, generating hypotheses about how observed neural activity might drive behavior and explaining diversity in behavioral strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Once thought to play a housekeeping function of removing misfolded proteins or compromised organelles, neuronal autophagy is now regarded as a finely tuned, real time surveillance and clearance system crucial to synaptic integrity and function. Here we review the role of autophagy in synaptic plasticity and its regulation by epigenetic mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Traditional theories of object recognition have focused on how crucial form features, for example, the orientation of edges, may be extracted in early visual cortex and utilized to recognize objects. An alternative view argues that much of early and mid-level visual processing focuses on encoding surface characteristics, for example, texture. Neurophysiological evidence from primate area V4 supports a third alternative — the joint, but independent, encoding of form and texture — that would be advantageous for segmenting objects from the background in natural scenes and for object recognition that is independent of surface texture. Future studies that leverage deep convolutional network models, especially focusing on network failures to match biology and behavior, can advance our insights into how such a joint representation of form and surface properties might emerge in visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Here, we discuss this challenge in the context of choice correlations in sensory neurons, that is, trial-by-trial correlations, unexplained by the stimulus, between the activity of sensory neurons and an animal’s perceptual choice. Do these choice-correlations reflect feedforward, feedback signalling, both, or neither? We highlight recent results of correlational and causal examinations of choice and choice-history signals in sensory, and in part sensorimotor, cortex and address formal statistical frameworks to infer causal interactions from data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

While the implied existence of a one-to-one mapping between external referents and neural firing has been useful, the prevalence of adaptation challenges this. Adaptation provides neural responses with dynamics on timescales that range from milliseconds up to many seconds. These timescales are highly relevant for sensory experience in the natural world, in which local statistical properties of inputs change continuously, and are additionally altered by active sensing. Adaptation has a number of consequences for coding: it creates short-term history dependence; it engenders complex feature selectivity that is time-varying; and it can serve to enhance information representation in dynamic environments. Considering how to best incorporate adaptation into neural models exposes a fundamental dichotomy in approaches to the description of neural systems: ones that take an explicitly ‘coding’ perspective versus ones that describe the system’s dynamics. Here we discuss the pros and cons of different approaches to the modeling of adaptive dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Neural activity propagates within this network on a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. At the micro scale, neurophysiological recordings reveal coordinated dynamics in local neural populations, which support behaviorally relevant computations. At the macro scale, neuroimaging modalities measure global activity fluctuations organized into spatiotemporal patterns across the entire brain. Here we review recent advances linking the local and global scales of cortical dynamics and their relationship to behavior. We argue that diverse experimental observations on the dimensionality and variability of neural activity can be reconciled by considering how activity propagates in space and time on multiple spatial scales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Despite their success, these models fall short to capture spike synchronization effects, to link to biophysical parameters and to describe finite-size fluctuations. In this opinion article, we propose that the refractory density method (RDM), also known as age-structured population dynamics or quasi-renewal theory, yields a powerful theoretical framework to build rate-based models for mesoscopic neural populations from realistic neuron dynamics at the microscopic level. We review recent advances achieved by the RDM to obtain efficient population density equations for networks of generalized integrate-and-fire (GIF) neurons — a class of neuron models that has been successfully fitted to various cell types. The theory not only predicts the nonstationary dynamics of large populations of neurons but also permits an extension to finite-size populations and a systematic reduction to low-dimensional rate dynamics. The new types of rate models will allow a re-examination of models of cortical computations under biological constraints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Multilevel evolutionary developmental optimization (MEDO): A theoretical framework for understanding preferences and selection dynamics. (arXiv:1910.13443v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;What is motivation and how does it work? Where do goals come from and how do
they vary within and between species and individuals? Why do we prefer some
things over others? MEDO is a theoretical framework for understanding these
questions in abstract terms, as well as for generating and evaluating specific
hypotheses that seek to explain goal-oriented behavior. MEDO views preferences
as selective processes influencing the likelihood of particular outcomes, which
are more or less consistent with the dynamics underlying those influences. With
respect to biological organisms, these patterns must compete and cooperate in
shaping system evolution. To the extent that shaping processes are themselves
altered by experience, this enables feedback relationships where histories of
reward and punishment can impact future motivation. In this way, various biases
can undergo either amplification or attenuation, potentially resulting in
enduring preferences and orientations. MEDO is unique in that it specifically
models all shaping dynamics in terms of natural selection operating on multiple
levels--genetic, neural, and cultural--and even considers aspects of
development to themselves be evolutionary processes. Thus, MEDO reflects a kind
of generalized Darwinism, in that it assumes that natural selection provides a
common principle for understanding the emergence of complexity within all
dynamical systems in which replication, variation, and selection occur.
However, MEDO combines this evolutionary perspective with economic decision
theory, which describes both the preferences underlying individual choices, as
well as the preferences underlying choices made by engineers in designing
optimized systems. In this way, MEDO uses economic decision theory to explain
goal-oriented behaviors as well as the interacting evolutionary optimization
processes from which they emerge.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent Brain-Machine Interfaces have shifted towards miniature devices that
are constructed from nanoscale components. While these devices can be implanted
into the brain, their functionalities can be limited, and will require
communication and networking to enable cooperation. One form of communication
for neuron stimulation is the use of light. A number of considerations needs to
be taken into account for the propagation and this includes diffraction,
scattering, absorption, as well as attenuation. These properties are not only
affected by the medium, but also by the cell's geometric shape. These factor
affects both the direction and amplitude of the light wave. This paper analyzes
the propagation path loss and geometrical gain, channel impulse and frequency
response for light propagation along the neural tissue. The total attenuation
depends on the propagation medium loss and geometrical gain, and the channel
response is highly dependent on the quantity of cells along the path.
Additionally, the optical properties of the medium also impacts on the time
delay at the receiver and the width the location of the detectors. Based on the
numerical analysis, spherical cells attenuate approximately 20% of the
transmitted power, which is less than the fusiform and pyramidal cells (35% and
65%, respectively).

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Determining the positions of neurons in an extracellular recording is useful
for investigating functional properties of the underlying neural circuitry. In
this work, we present a Bayesian modelling approach for localizing the source
of individual spikes on high-density, microelectrode arrays. To allow for
scalable inference, we implement our model as a variational autoencoder and
perform amortized variational inference. We evaluate our method on both
biophysically realistic simulated and real extracellular datasets,
demonstrating that it is more accurate than and can improve spike sorting
performance over heuristic localization methods such as center of mass.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Much of our present understanding of the function and operation of the basal ganglia rests on models of anatomical connectivity derived from tract-tracing approaches in rodents and primates. However, the last years have been characterized by promising step forwards in the in vivo investigation and comprehension of brain connectivity in humans. The aim of this review is to revise the current knowledge on basal ganglia circuits, highlighting similarities and differences across species, in order to widen the current perspective on the intricate model of the basal ganglia system. This will allow us to explore the implications of additional direct pathways running from cortex to basal ganglia and between basal ganglia and cerebellum recently described in animals and humans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Anxiety and depression are major public health concerns worldwide. Although genome-wide association studies have identified several genes robustly associated with susceptibility for these disorders, the molecular and cellular mechanisms associated with anxiety and depression is largely unknown. Reduction of microRNA-137 (miR-137) level has been implicated in the etiology of major depressive disorder. However, little is known about the in vivo impact of the loss of miR-137 on the biology of anxiety and depression. Here, we generated a forebrain-specific miR-137 knockout mouse line, and showed that miR-137 is critical for dendritic and synaptic growth in the forebrain. Mice with miR-137 loss-of-function exhibit anxiety-like behavior, and impaired spatial learning and memory. We then observe an elevated expression of EZH2 in the forebrain of miR-137 knockout mice, and provide direct evidence that knockdown of EZH2 can rescue anxious phenotypes associated with the loss of miR-137. Together our results suggest that loss of miR-137 contributes to the etiology of anxiety, and EZH2 might be a potential therapeutic target for anxiety and depressive phenotypes associated with the dysfunction of miR-137.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Rapid Action of Retinoic Acid on the Hypothalamic Pituitary Adrenal Axis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Retinoic acid (RA) is the active metabolite of vitamin A but is also used as a medication, primarily for acne in which the treatment regime lasts several months. A number of studies have indicated that treatment with RA over this time period impacts the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and may contribute to a number of the side-effects of the drug. No studies though have investigated the short-term, early effects RA may have on the HPA axis via the transcriptional pathways activated by the RA receptor. This study investigated the action of RA over 3 days on regulatory components of the HPA axis. Several key genes involved in glucocorticoid feedback pathways in the hippocampus, hypothalamus and pituitary were unchanged after 3-days exposure to RA. Key elements though in the adrenal gland involved in corticosterone and aldosterone synthesis were altered in particular with the Cyp11b2 gene downregulated in vivo and ex vivo. The rapid, 5 h, change in Cyp11b2 expression suggested this activation may be direct. These results highlight the adrenal gland as a target of short-term action of RA and potentially a trigger component in the mechanisms by which the long-term adverse effects of RA treatment occur.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is associated with numerous neurodevelopmental disorders. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex coupled with electromyography (EMG) enables biomarkers that provide measures of cortical excitation and inhibition that are particularly relevant to epilepsy and related disorders. The motor threshold (MT), cortical silent period (CSP), short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), intracortical facilitation (ICF), and long interval intracortical inhibition (LICI) are among TMS-derived metrics that are modulated by antiepileptic drugs. TMS may have a practical role in optimization of antiepileptic medication regimens, as studies demonstrate dose-dependent relationships between TMS metrics and acute medication administration. A close association between seizure freedom and normalization of cortical excitability with long-term antiepileptic drug use highlights a plausible utility of TMS in measures of anti-epileptic drug efficacy. Finally, TMS-derived biomarkers distinguish patients with various epilepsies from healthy controls and thus may enable development of disorder-specific biomarkers and therapies both within and outside of the epilepsy realm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Accelerated Intermittent Theta-Burst Stimulation as a Treatment for Cocaine Use Disorder: A Proof-of-Concept Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01147</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;There are no effective treatments for cocaine use disorder (CUD), a chronic, relapsing brain disease characterized by dysregulated circuits related to cue reactivity, reward processing, response inhibition, and executive control. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has the potential to modulate circuits and networks implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders, including addiction. Although acute applications of TMS have reduced craving in urine-negative cocaine users, the tolerability and safety of administering accelerated TMS to cocaine-positive individuals is unknown. As such, we performed a proof-of-concept study employing an intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) protocol in an actively cocaine-using sample. Although our main goal was to assess the tolerability and safety of administering three iTBS sessions daily, we also hypothesized that iTBS would reduce cocaine use in this non-treatment seeking cohort. We recruited 19 individuals with CUD to receive three open-label iTBS sessions per day, with approximately a 60-min interval between sessions, for 10 days over a 2-week period (30 total iTBS sessions). iTBS was delivered to left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) with neuronavigation guidance. Compliance and safety were assessed throughout the trial. Cocaine use behavior was assessed before, during, and after the intervention and at 1- and 4-week follow-up visits. Of the 335 iTBS sessions applied, 73% were performed on participants with cocaine-positive urine tests. Nine of the 14 participants who initiated treatment received at least 26 of 30 iTBS sessions and returned for the 4-week follow-up visit. These individuals reduced their weekly cocaine consumption by 78% in amount of dollars spent and 70% in days of use relative to pre-iTBS cocaine use patterns. Similarly, individuals reduced their weekly consumption of nicotine, alcohol, and THC, suggesting iTBS modulated a common circuit across drugs of abuse. iTBS was well-tolerated, despite the expected occasional headaches. A single participant developed a transient neurological event of uncertain etiology on iTBS day 9 and cocaine-induced psychosis 2 weeks after discontinuation. It thus appears that accelerated iTBS to left dlPFC administered in active, chronic cocaine users is both feasible and tolerable in actively using cocaine participants with preliminary indications of efficacy in reducing both the amount and frequency of cocaine (and other off target drug) use. The neural underpinnings of these behavioral changes could help in the future development of effective treatment of CUD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Dietary Supplementation With the Ketogenic Diet Metabolite Beta-Hydroxybutyrate Ameliorates Post-TBI Aggression in Young-Adult Male Drosophila</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI), caused by repeated concussive head trauma can induce chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative disease featuring behavioral symptoms ranging from cognitive deficits to elevated aggression. In a Drosophila model, we used a high-impact trauma device (Katzenberger et al., 2013, 2015) to induce TBI-like symptoms and to study post-TBI behavioral outcomes. Following TBI, aggression in banged male flies was significantly elevated as compared with that in unbanged flies. These increases in aggressive behavior were not the result of basal motility changes, as measured by a negative geotaxis assay. In addition, the increase in post-TBI aggression appeared to be specific to concussive trauma: neither cold exposure nor electric shock—two alternate types of trauma—significantly elevated aggressive behavior in male-male pairs. Various forms of dietary therapy, especially the high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD), have recently been explored for a wide variety of neuropathies. We thus hypothesized that putatively neuroprotective dietary interventions might be able to suppress post-traumatic elevations in aggressive behavior in animals subjected to head-trauma-inducing strikes, or “bangs”. We supplemented a normal high-carbohydrate Drosophila diet with the KD metabolite beta-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB)—a ketone body (KB). Banged flies raised on a KB-supplemented diet exhibited a marked reduction in aggression, whereas aggression in unbanged flies was equivalent whether dieted with KB supplements or not. Pharmacological blockade of the ATP-sensitive potassium (K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt;) channel abrogated KB effects reducing post-TBI aggression while pharmacological activation mimicked them, suggesting a mechanism by which KBs act in this model. KBs did not significantly extend lifespan in banged flies, but markedly extended lifespan in unbanged flies. We have thus developed a functional model for the study of post-TBI elevations of aggression. Further, we conclude that dietary interventions may be a fruitful avenue for further exploration of treatments for TBI- and CTE-related cognitive-behavioral symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Challenge for Affective Brain-Computer Interfaces: Non-stationary Spatio-spectral EEG Oscillations of Emotional Responses</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based affective brain-computer interfaces (aBCIs) have been attracting ever-growing interest and research resources. Whereas most previous neuroscience studies have focused on single-day/-session recording and sensor-level analysis, less effort has been invested in assessing the fundamental nature of non-stationary EEG oscillations underlying emotional responses across days and individuals. This work thus aimed to use a data-driven blind source separation method, i.e., independent component analysis (ICA), to derive emotion-relevant spatio-spectral EEG source oscillations and assess the extent of non-stationarity. To this end, this work conducted an 8-day music-listening experiment (i.e., roughly interspaced over 2 months) and recorded whole-scalp 30-ch EEG data from 10 subjects. Given the large size of the data (i.e., from 80 sessions), results indicated that EEG non-stationarity was clearly revealed in the numbers and locations of brain sources of interest as well as their spectral modulation to the emotional responses. Less than half of subjects (two to four) showed the same relatively day-stationary (source reproducibility &amp;gt;6 days) spatio-spectral tendency towards one of the binary valence and arousal states. This work substantially advances the previous work by exploiting intra- and inter-individual EEG variability in an ecological multiday scenario. Such EEG non-stationarity may inevitably present a great challenge for the development of an accurate, robust, and generalized emotion-classification model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A challenge in motor control research is to understand the mechanisms underlying the transformation of sensory information into arm motor commands. Here, we investigated these transformation mechanisms for movements whose targets were defined by information issued from body rotations in the dark (i.e., idiothetic information). Immediately after being rotated, participants reproduced the amplitude of their perceived rotation using their arm (Experiment 1). The cortical activation during movement planning was analyzed using electroencephalography and source analyses. Task-related activities were found in regions of interest (ROIs) located in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), dorsal premotor cortex, dorsal region of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the sensorimotor cortex. Importantly, critical regions for the cognitive encoding of space did not show significant task-related activities. These results suggest that arm movements were planned using a sensorimotor-type of spatial representation. However, when a 8 s delay was introduced between body rotation and the arm movement (Experiment 2), we found that areas involved in the cognitive encoding of space [e.g., ventral premotor cortex (vPM), rostral ACC, inferior and superior posterior parietal cortex (PPC)] showed task-related activities. Overall, our results suggest that the use of a cognitive-type of representation for planning arm movement after body motion is necessary when relevant spatial information must be stored before triggering the movement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: A Biologically-Inspired Model to Predict Perceived Visual Speed as a Function of the Stimulated Portion of the Visual Field</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spatial orientation relies on a representation of the position and orientation of the body relative to the surrounding environment. When navigating in the environment, this representation must be constantly updated taking into account the direction, speed, and amplitude of body motion. Visual information plays an important role in this updating process, notably via optical flow. Here, we systematically investigated how the size and the simulated portion of the field of view (FoV) affect perceived visual speed of human observers. We propose a computational model to account for the patterns of human data. This model is composed of hierarchical cells' layers that model the neural processing stages of the dorsal visual pathway. Specifically, we consider that the activity of the MT area is processed by populations of modeled MST cells that are sensitive to the differential components of the optical flow, thus producing selectivity for specific patterns of optical flow. Our results indicate that the proposed computational model is able to describe the experimental evidence and it could be used to predict expected biases of speed perception for conditions in which only some portions of the visual field are visible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Dye Tracking Following Posterior Semicircular Canal or Round Window Membrane Injections Suggests a Role for the Cochlea Aqueduct in Modulating Distribution</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The inner ear houses the sensory epithelium responsible for vestibular and auditory function. The sensory epithelia are driven by pressure and vibration of the fluid filled structures in which they are embedded so that understanding the homeostatic mechanisms regulating fluid dynamics within these structures is critical to understanding function at the systems level. Additionally, there is a growing need for drug delivery to the inner ear for preventive and restorative treatments to the pathologies associated with hearing and balance dysfunction. We compare drug delivery to neonatal and adult inner ear by injection into the posterior semicircular canal (PSCC) or through the round window membrane (RWM). PSCC injections produced higher levels of dye delivery within the cochlea than did RWM injections. Neonatal PSCC injections produced a gradient in dye distribution; however, adult distributions were relatively uniform. RWM injections resulted in an early base to apex gradient that became more uniform over time, post injection. RWM injections lead to higher levels of dye distributions in the brain, likely demonstrating that injections can traverse the cochlea aqueduct. We hypothesize the relative position of the cochlear aqueduct between injection site and cochlea is instrumental in dictating dye distribution within the cochlea. Dye distribution is further compounded by the ability of some chemicals to cross inner ear membranes accessing the blood supply as demonstrated by the rapid distribution of gentamicin-conjugated Texas red (GTTR) throughout the body. These data allow for a direct evaluation of injection mode and age to compare strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Associations Between Cognitive Functions and Physical Frailty in Patients With Parkinson’s Disease</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00283</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease manifested by both motor and non-motor dysfunctions and co-existence of cognitive impairment and physical frailty is common. Given that research in this area is limited, a better understanding of associated factors with physical frailty could provide a focused screening method and facilitate early intervention in PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Seventy-six patients with idiopathic PD were recruited and Fried’s criteria of physical frailty were used to group all participants. Comprehensive cognitive tests and clinical characteristics were measured, and univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to explore the relationship between clinical factors or neuropsychological functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Twenty-nine patients with PD (38%) exhibited physical frailty. Compared to PD patients without frailty, PD patients with frailty were older in age and demonstrated worse disease severity and poorer cognitive functions, including attention, executive function, memory, speech and language, and visuospatial function (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Further, stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that disease severity by the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) total score (OR: 1.065; 95% CI: 1.033–1.099) and executive function (OR: 0.724; 95% CI: 0.581–0.877) were independent risk factors for predicting physical frailty (p = 0.003 and 0.002). The best cut-off points are 46 in UPDRS (sensitivity: 62.1%; specificity: 91.5%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Executive function impairment is an independent risk factor for the development of physical frailty with disease progression. Awareness of such comorbidity might provide a screening tool to facilitate investigation in their underlying etiology and early intervention for frailty prevention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Identifying parabrachial neurons selectively regulating satiety for highly palatable food in mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0252-19.2019v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Food consumption is necessary for organisms to maintain metabolic homeostasis. Both extrinsic and intrinsic processes, relayed via intricate neural circuitry, orchestrate the initiation and termination of food intake. More specifically, there are functionally distinct neural circuits that mediate either homeostatic or hedonic suppression of feeding. Notably, being satiated is a positive feeling whereas food aversion is a negative feeling. While significant progress has been made toward elucidating neural circuitry underlying aversive appetite suppression in mice, the circuitry underlying homeostatic satiety is not fully understood. The lateral parabrachial nucleus (PB&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) is known as a node that regulates various sensory and visceral processes. Here we identified and selectively labeled neurons in the caudal lateral region of PB&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (PB&lt;sub&gt;cl&lt;/sub&gt;) that are activated by consumption of condensed milk, chocolate Ensure or peanut butter, which we refer to as PB&lt;sub&gt;cl&lt;/sub&gt;-palatable-food activated neurons (PANs). Specific optogenetic activation of PANs induced positive place preference but decreased the consumption of high-caloric foods such as condensed milk, whereas silencing these cells significantly increased condensed milk consumption in feeding assays. Thus, the PB&lt;sub&gt;cl&lt;/sub&gt; PANs revealed here represent a novel neural substrate regulating caloric-sufficiency mediated satiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The lateral parabrachial nucleus (PB&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) is a critical for regulating somatic and visceral processes including thermoregulation, taste preference, thirst, and appetite. Recent work on satiety-promoting circuits has implicated the PB&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; as an important node. Previous studies identified the PB&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Global vs. Network-Specific Regulations as the Source of Intrinsic Coactivations in Resting-State Networks</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spontaneous neural activities are endowed with specific patterning characterized by synchronizations within functionally relevant distant regions that are termed as resting-state networks (RSNs). Although the mechanisms that organize the large-scale neural systems are still largely unknown, recent studies have proposed a hypothesis that network-specific coactivations indeed emerge as the result of globally propagating neural activities with specific paths of transmission. However, the extent to which such a centralized global regulation, rather than network-specific control, contributes to the RSN synchronization remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated the contribution from each mechanism by directly identifying the global as well as local component of resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data provided by human connectome project, using temporal independent component analysis (ICA). Based on the spatial distribution pattern, each ICA component was classified as global or local. Time lag mapping of each IC revealed several paths of global or semi-global propagations that are partially overlapping yet spatially distinct to each other. Consistent with previous studies, the time lag of global oscillation, although being less spatially homogenous than what was assumed to be, contributed to the RSN synchronization. However, an equivalent contribution was also shown on the part of the more locally confined activities that are independent to each other. While allowing the view that network-specific coactivation occurs as part of the sequences of global neural activities, these results further confirm an equally important role of the network-specific regulation for its coactivation, regardless of whether vascular artifacts contaminate the global component in fMRI measures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The cerebellum is involved in sensorimotor, cognitive, and emotional functions through cerebello-cerebral connectivity. Cerebellar neurostimulation thus likely affects cortical circuits, as has been shown in studies using cerebellar stimulation to treat neurological disorders through modulation of frontal EEG oscillations. Here we studied the effects of different frequencies of cerebellar stimulation on oscillations and coherence in the cerebellum and prefrontal cortex in the urethane-anesthetized rat. Local field potentials were recorded in the right lateral cerebellum (Crus I/II) and bilaterally in the prefrontal cortex (frontal association area, FrA) in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Stimulation was delivered to the cerebellar vermis (lobule VII) using single pulses (0.2 Hz for 60 s), or repeated pulses at 1 Hz (30 s), 5 Hz (10 s), 25 Hz (2 s), and 50 Hz (1 s). Effects of stimulation were influenced by the initial state of EEG activity which varies over time during urethane-anesthesia; 1 Hz stimulation was more effective when delivered during the slow-wave state (Stage 1), while stimulation with single-pulse, 25, and 50 Hz showed stronger effects during the activated state (Stage 2). Single-pulses resulted in increases in oscillatory power in the delta and theta bands for the cerebellum, and in frequencies up to 80 Hz in cortical sites. 1 Hz stimulation induced a decrease in 0–30 Hz activity and increased activity in the 30–200 Hz range, in the right FrA. 5 Hz stimulation reduced power in high frequencies in Stage 1 and induced mixed effects during Stage 2.25 Hz stimulation increased cortical power at low frequencies during Stage 2, and increased power in higher frequency bands during Stage 1. Stimulation at 50 Hz increased delta-band power in all recording sites, with the strongest and most rapid effects in the cerebellum. 25 and 50 Hz stimulation also induced state-dependent effects on cerebello-cortical and cortico-cortical coherence at high frequencies. Cerebellar stimulation can therefore entrain field potential activity in the FrA and drive synchronization of cerebello-cortical and cortico-cortical networks in a frequency-dependent manner. These effects highlight the role of the cerebellar vermis in modulating large-scale synchronization of neural networks in non-motor frontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This study investigated the corticospinal excitability of reciprocal muscles during tasks involving sensory difference between proprioceptive and visual inputs. Participants were instructed to relax their muscles and to observe a screen during vibratory stimulation. A video screen was placed on the board covering the right hand and forearm. Participants were randomly tested in four conditions: resting, control, static, and dynamic. The resting condition involved showing a black screen, the control condition, a mosaic patterned static videoclip; the static condition, a static videoclip of wrist flexion 0°; and the dynamic condition, a videoclip that corresponded to each participant’s closely-matched illusory wrist flexion angle and speed by vibration. Vibratory stimulation (frequency 80 Hz and duration 4 s) was applied to the distal tendon of the dominant right extensor carpi radialis (ECR) using a tendon vibrator in the control, static, and dynamic conditions. Four seconds after the vibratory stimulation (end of vibration), the primary motor cortex at the midpoint between the centers of gravity of the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and ECR muscles was stimulated by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The ECR motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes significantly increased in the control condition compared to the resting condition, whereas the FCR MEP amplitudes did not change between the resting and control conditions. In addition, the ECR MEP amplitudes significantly increased in the static condition compared to the dynamic condition. However, the FCR MEP amplitudes significantly increased in the dynamic condition compared to the static condition. These results imply that the difference between visuo-proprioceptive information had an effect on corticospinal excitability for the muscle. In conclusion, we found that proprioceptive and visual information differentially altered the corticospinal excitability of reciprocal muscles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurogenesis section | New and Recent Articles: BAF45D Downregulation in Spinal Cord Ependymal Cells Following Spinal Cord Injury in Adult Rats and Its Potential Role in the Development of Neuronal Lesions</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The endogenous spinal cord ependymal cells (SCECs), which form the central canal (CC), are critically involved in proliferation, differentiation and migration after spinal cord injury (SCI) and represents a repair cell source in treating SCI. Previously, we reported that BAF45D is expressed in the SCECs and the spinal cord neurons in adult mice and knockdown of BAF45D fail to induce expression of PAX6, a neurogenic fate determinant, during early neural differentiation of human embryonic stem cells. However, the effects of SCI on expression of BAF45D have not been reported. The aim of this study is to explore the expression and potential role of BAF45D in rat SCI model. In this study, adult rats were randomly divided into intact, sham, and SCI groups. We first explored expression of BAF45D in the SCECs in intact adult rats. We then explored SCI-induced loss of motor neurons and lesion of neurites in the anterior horns induced by the SCI. We also investigated whether the SCI-induced lesions in SCECs are accompanied by the motor neuron lesions. Finally, we examined the effect of BAF45D knockdown on cell growth in neuro2a cells. Our data showed that BAF45D is expressed in SCECs, neurons, and oligodendrocytes but not astrocytes in the spinal cords of intact adult rats. After SCI, the structure of CC was disrupted and the BAF45D-positive SCEC-derivatives were decreased. During the early stages of SCI, when shape of CC was affected but there was no disruption in circular structure of the SCECs, it was evident that there was a significant reduction in the number of neurites and motor neurons in the anterior horns compared with those of intact rats. In comparison, a complete loss of SCECs accompanied by further loss of motor neurons but not neurites was observed at the later stage. BAF45D knockdown was also found to inhibit cell growth in neuro2a cells. These results highlight the decreased expression of BAF45D in SCI-injured SCECs and the potential role of BAF45D downregulation in development of neuronal lesion after SCI in adult rats.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: The Delta-Subunit Selective GABAA Receptor Modulator, DS2, Improves Stroke Recovery via an Anti-inflammatory Mechanism</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01133</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Inflammatory processes are known to contribute to tissue damage in the central nervous system (CNS) across a broad range of neurological conditions, including stroke. Gamma amino butyric acid (GABA), the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS, has been implicated in modulating peripheral immune responses by acting on GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors on antigen-presenting cells and lymphocytes. Here, we investigated the effects and mechanism of action of the delta-selective compound, DS2, to improve stroke recovery and modulate inflammation. We report a decrease in nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation in innate immune cells over a concentration range in vitro. Following a photochemically induced motor cortex stroke, treatment with DS2 at 0.1 mg/kg from 1 h post-stroke significantly decreased circulating tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-17, and IL-6 levels, reduced infarct size and improved motor function in mice. Free brain concentrations of DS2 were found to be lower than needed for robust modulation of central GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors and were not affected by the presence and absence of elacridar, an inhibitor of both P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Finally, as DS2 appears to dampen peripheral immune activation and only shows limited brain exposure, we assessed the role of DS2 to promote functional recovery after stroke when administered from 3-days after the stroke. Treatment with DS2 from 3-days post-stroke improved motor function on the grid-walking, but not on the cylinder task. These data highlight the need to further develop subunit-selective compounds to better understand change in GABA receptor signaling pathways both centrally and peripherally. Importantly, we show that GABA compounds such as DS2 that only shows limited brain exposure can still afford significant protection and promote functional recovery most likely via modulation of peripheral immune cells and could be given as an adjunct treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Network Representations of Facial and Bodily Expressions: Evidence From Multivariate Connectivity Pattern Classification</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01111</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Emotions can be perceived from both facial and bodily expressions. Our previous study has found the successful decoding of facial expressions based on the functional connectivity (FC) patterns. However, the role of the FC patterns in the recognition of bodily expressions remained unclear, and no neuroimaging studies have adequately addressed the question of whether emotions perceiving from facial and bodily expressions are processed rely upon common or different neural networks. To address this, the present study collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from a block design experiment with facial and bodily expression videos as stimuli (three emotions: anger, fear, and joy), and conducted multivariate pattern classification analysis based on the estimated FC patterns. We found that in addition to the facial expressions, bodily expressions could also be successfully decoded based on the large-scale FC patterns. The emotion classification accuracies for the facial expressions were higher than that for the bodily expressions. Further contributive FC analysis showed that emotion-discriminative networks were widely distributed in both hemispheres, containing regions that ranged from primary visual areas to higher-level cognitive areas. Moreover, for a particular emotion, discriminative FCs for facial and bodily expressions were distinct. Together, our findings highlight the key role of the FC patterns in the emotion processing, indicating how large-scale FC patterns reconfigure in processing of facial and bodily expressions, and suggest the distributed neural representation for the emotion recognition. Furthermore, our results also suggest that the human brain employs separate network representations for facial and bodily expressions of the same emotions. This study provides new evidence for the network representations for emotion perception and may further our understanding of the potential mechanisms underlying body language emotion recognition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Association Between Food Patterns and Gray Matter Volume</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Diet and nutrition play a key role in the promotion and maintenance of good health, as they are important modifiable risk factors for chronic diseases. A growing number of studies indicate that optimal food intake and optimal physical activity are essential for the gray matter volume (GMV). However, the precise definition of “optimal” is extremely difficult and a topic of several studies. In the current research, we used the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based normalized GMV (nGMV), for monitoring brain conditions based on GMV. By analyzing the relationship between the nGMV of 171 healthy Japanese participants and the results of a brief self-administered diet history questionnaire (BDHQ), we found that while nGMV was high in the participants with high intake of milk and yogurt, it was low in the participants of “alcohol and animal foods dietary pattern” (high intake of alcohol and animal foods). On the other hand, another food pattern “vegetable-animal balanced dietary pattern” (balanced intake of vegetables and animal foods) has no significant association with nGMV, indicating that although a diet consisting of a good balance of vegetables and animal foods may not lead to brain atrophy, it might not positively contribute to a higher nGMV. nGMV, as an objective measure of the association between food intake and the brain, might provide useful information for “optimal” food intake for GMV.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Error-Related Dynamics of Reaction Time and Frontal Midline Theta Activity in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) During a Subliminal Motor Priming Task</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Post-error slowing (PES) is an established performance monitoring readout. Several previous studies have found that PES is reduced in children and adolescents with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We analyzed reaction time data, along with electroencephalography (EEG) data, from a response priming experiment in children and adolescents with ADHD (N = 28) and typically developing (TD) controls (N = 15) between 10 and 17 years of age. We report dynamic reaction time changes before and after errors: whereas TD controls readjusted their response speed to their individual average speed after committing an error, this reaction time adjustment appeared to be delayed and decreased in ADHD patients. In the EEG, error trials were accompanied by increased frontal midline theta activity, which was attenuated in ADHD compared to TD. We conclude that PES has a different time course rather than being fully absent in ADHD and discuss relationships with our EEG findings and potential implications for performance monitoring in ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Age-Related Differences in Functional and Structural Connectivity in the Spatial Navigation Brain Network</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spatial navigation involves multiple cognitive processes including multisensory integration, visuospatial coding, memory, and decision-making. These functions are mediated by the interplay of cerebral structures that can be broadly separated into a posterior network (subserving visual and spatial processing) and an anterior network (dedicated to memory and navigation planning). Within these networks, areas such as the hippocampus (HC) are known to be affected by aging and to be associated with cognitive decline and navigation impairments. However, age-related changes in brain connectivity within the spatial navigation network remain to be investigated. For this purpose, we performed a neuroimaging study combining functional and structural connectivity analyses between cerebral regions involved in spatial navigation. Nineteen young (μ = 27 years, σ = 4.3; 10 F) and 22 older (μ = 73 years, σ = 4.1; 10 F) participants were examined in this study. Our analyses focused on the parahippocampal place area (PPA), the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), the occipital place area (OPA), and the projections into the visual cortex of central and peripheral visual fields, delineated from independent functional localizers. In addition, we segmented the HC and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) from anatomical images. Our results show an age-related decrease in functional connectivity between low-visual areas and the HC, associated with an increase in functional connectivity between OPA and PPA in older participants compared to young subjects. Concerning the structural connectivity, we found age-related differences in white matter integrity within the navigation brain network, with the exception of the OPA. The OPA is known to be involved in egocentric navigation, as opposed to allocentric strategies which are more related to the hippocampal region. The increase in functional connectivity between the OPA and PPA may thus reflect a compensatory mechanism for the age-related alterations around the HC, favoring the use of the preserved structural network mediating egocentric navigation. Overall, these findings on age-related differences of functional and structural connectivity may help to elucidate the cerebral bases of spatial navigation deficits in healthy and pathological aging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Processing Bodies Oscillate in Neuro 2A Cells</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Circadian rhythms are biological variables that oscillate with periods close to 24 h that are generated internally by biological clocks. Depending on the tissue/cell type, about 5–20% of genes are expressed rhythmically. Unexpectedly, the correlation between the oscillations of messengers and the proteins they encode is low. We hypothesize that these discrepancies could be because in certain phases of the circadian cycle some messengers could be translationally silenced and stored. Processing bodies (PBs) are membraneless organelles formed by ribonucleoprotein aggregates located in the cytoplasm. They contain silenced messengers and factors involved in mRNA processing. A previous work showed that the number of cells containing these mRNA granules varies when comparing two time-points in U2OS cell cultures and that these differences disappear when an essential clock gene is silenced. Here we evaluate whether PBs oscillate in Neuro2A cells. We analyzed in cell cultures synchronized with dexamethasone the variations in the number, the signal intensity of the markers used (GE-1/HEDLS and DDX6), and the area of PBs between 8 and 68 h post-synchronization. All three parameters oscillated with periods compatible with a circadian regulated process. The most robust rhythm was the number of PBs. These rhythms could be generated by oscillations in proteins that have been involved in the nucleation of these foci such as LSM1, TTP, and BRF1. The described phenomenon would allow to explain the differences observed in the temporal profiles of some messengers and their proteins and to understand how circadian clocks can control post-transcriptionally cellular functions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The p75 Neurotrophin Receptor Facilitates TrkB Signaling and Function in Rat Hippocampal Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurotrophins activate Trk receptor signaling to support neuronal survival and many aspects of neuronal function. Early studies demonstrated that TrkA formed a complex with the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt;), which increased the affinity and selectivity of NGF binding, however, whether interaction of p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt; with other Trk receptors performs a similar function to enhance ligand binding has not been demonstrated. We investigated the interaction of TrkB with full length p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt; in hippocampal neurons in response to BDNF and found that the association of these receptors occurs after ligand binding and requires phosphorylation of TrkB, indicating that formation of this receptor complex was not necessary for ligand binding. Moreover, the interaction of these receptors required internalization and localization to early endosomes. We found that association of TrkB with p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt; was necessary for optimal downstream signaling of the PI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;K-Akt pathway, but not the Erk pathway, in hippocampal neurons. The absence of p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt; impaired the ability of BDNF to rescue hippocampal neurons in a trophic deprivation model, suggesting that p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt; facilitates the ability of TrkB to activate specific pathways to promote neuronal survival.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Genetically-encoded indicators of neuronal activity enable the labeling of a genetically defined population of neurons to optically monitor their activities. However, researchers often find difficulties in identifying relevant signals from excessive background fluorescence. A photoactivatable version of a genetically encoded calcium indicator, sPA-GCaMP6f is a good example of circumventing such an obstacle by limiting the fluorescence to a region of interest defined by the user. Here, we apply this strategy to genetically encoded voltage (GEVI) and pH (GEPI) indicators. Three photoactivatable GEVI candidates were considered. The first one used a circularly-permuted fluorescent protein, the second design involved a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair, and the third approach employed a pH-sensitive variant of GFP, ecliptic pHluorin. The candidate with a variant of ecliptic pHluorin exhibited photoactivation and a voltage-dependent fluorescence change. This effort also yielded a pH-sensitive photoactivatable GFP that varies its brightness in response to intracellular pH changes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Introduction&lt;p&gt;The utility of subjective memory impairment (SMI) as a risk marker for preclinical Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains unclear; however, recent studies have identified a correlation between retinal biomarkers and onset of preclinical disease. This study examines the relationship between retinal biomarkers that have been associated with cerebral amyloid, an early hallmark of AD, and SMI scores in patients at risk for developing AD.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Forty-nine cognitively normal subjects were followed over 27 months and evaluated using a combination of neuropsychological, psychological, and retinal imaging instruments. Subjective memory testing was conducted using the memory assessment clinic questionnaire (MACQ) and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS). Multivariate linear analysis was conducted using STATA software.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Positive correlations were found between retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) volume and scores obtained from the MAC-Q at 27 months (MAC-Q_27), the DASS questionnaire for anxiety at 27 months (DASS-A_27), and the change in DASS-A over 27 months (dDASSA). There was also a significant positive correlation between these variables and the change in RNFL thickness over 27 months (dRNFL). MACQ_27, DASSA_27, and dDASS-A accounted for 35.7% of RFNL variance at 27 months and 21.5% of dRFNL variance.&lt;/p&gt;Discussion&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that worse subjective memory complaints and anxiety scores may be associated with one of the most commonly used structural anatomical retinal markers of early disease burden in AD. If so, these results lend support to SMI as a valid risk marker for later cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Prediction of off-target specificity and cell-specific fitness of CRISPR-Cas System using attention boosted deep learning and network-based gene feature</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Qiao Liu, Di He, Lei Xie&lt;/p&gt;

CRISPR-Cas is a powerful genome editing technology and has a great potential for &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; gene therapy. Successful translational application of CRISPR-Cas to biomedicine still faces many safety concerns, including off-target side effect, cell fitness problem after CRISPR-Cas treatment, and on-target genome editing side effect in undesired tissues. To solve these issues, it is needed to design sgRNA with high cell-specific efficacy and specificity. Existing single-guide RNA (sgRNA) design tools mainly depend on a sgRNA sequence and the local information of the targeted genome, thus are not sufficient to account for the difference in the cellular response of the same gene in different cell types. To incorporate cell-specific information into the sgRNA design, we develop novel interpretable machine learning models, which integrate features learned from advanced transformer-based deep neural network with cell-specific gene property derived from biological network and gene expression profile, for the prediction of CRISPR-Cas9 and CRISPR-Cas12a efficacy and specificity. In benchmark studies, our models significantly outperform state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, we find that the network-based gene property is critical for the prediction of cell-specific post-treatment cellular response. Our results suggest that the design of efficient and safe CRISPR-Cas needs to consider cell-specific information of genes. Our findings may bolster developing more accurate predictive models of CRISPR-Cas across a broad spectrum of biological conditions as well as provide new insight into developing efficient and safe CRISPR-based gene therapy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mujuedi3HYI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: POPDC3 Gene Variants Associate with a New Form of Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Popeye domain containing 3 (&lt;i&gt;POPDC3)&lt;/i&gt; gene encodes a membrane protein involved in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling. Besides gastric cancer, no disease association has been described. We describe a new muscular dystrophy associated with this gene.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We screened 1,500 patients with unclassified limb girdle weakness or hyperCKemia for pathogenic &lt;i&gt;POPDC3&lt;/i&gt; variants. Five patients carrying &lt;i&gt;POPDC3&lt;/i&gt; variants were examined by muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), muscle biopsy, and cardiac examination. We performed functional analyses in a zebrafish &lt;i&gt;popdc3&lt;/i&gt; knockdown model and heterologous expression of the mutant proteins in &lt;i&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/i&gt; oocytes to measure TREK‐1 current.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified homozygous &lt;i&gt;POPDC3&lt;/i&gt; missense variants (p.Leu155His, p.Leu217Phe, and p.Arg261Gln) in 5 patients from 3 ethnically distinct families. Variants affected highly conserved residues in the Popeye (p.Leu155 and p.Leu217) and carboxy‐terminal (p.Arg261) domains. The variants were almost absent from control populations. Probands’ muscle biopsies were dystrophic, and serum creatine kinase levels were 1,050 to 9,200U/l. Muscle weakness was proximal with adulthood onset in most patients and affected lower earlier than upper limbs. Muscle MRI revealed fat replacement of paraspinal and proximal leg muscles; cardiac investigations were unremarkable. Knockdown of &lt;i&gt;popdc3&lt;/i&gt; in zebrafish, using 2 different splice‐site blocking morpholinos, resulted in larvae with tail curling and dystrophic muscle features. All 3 mutants cloned in &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; oocytes caused an aberrant modulation of the mechano‐gated potassium channel, TREK‐1.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings point to an important role of POPDC3 for skeletal muscle function and suggest that pathogenic variants in &lt;i&gt;POPDC3&lt;/i&gt; are responsible for a novel type of autosomal recessive limb girdle muscular dystrophy. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;TMEM175/GAK/DGKQ&lt;/i&gt; locus is the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; strongest risk locus in genome‐wide association studies (GWAS) of Parkinson disease (PD). We aimed to identify the specific disease‐associated variants in this locus, and their potential implications.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full sequencing of &lt;i&gt;TMEM175/GAK/DGKQ,&lt;/i&gt; followed by genotyping of specific associated variants was performed in PD (n=1,575) and rapid eye movement (REM)‐sleep behavior disorder (RBD) patients (n=533) and in controls (n=1,583). Adjusted regression models and a meta‐analysis were performed. Association between variants and glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity was analyzed in 715 individuals with available data. Homology modelling, molecular dynamics simulations, and lysosomal localization experiments were performed on &lt;i&gt;TMEM175&lt;/i&gt; variants to determine their potential effects on structure and function.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two coding variants, &lt;i&gt;TMEM175&lt;/i&gt; p.M393T (OR=1.37, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=0.0003) and p.Q65P (OR=0.72, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=0.005) were associated with PD, and p.M393T was also associated with RBD (OR=1.59, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=0.001). &lt;i&gt;TMEM175&lt;/i&gt; p.M393T was associated with reduced GCase activity. Homology modelling and normal mode analysis demonstrated that &lt;i&gt;TMEM175&lt;/i&gt; p.M393T creates a polar side‐chain in the hydrophobic core of the transmembrane, which could destabilize the domain and thus impair either its assembly, maturation, or trafficking. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that the p.Q65P variant may increase stability and ion conductance of the transmembrane protein, and lysosomal localization was not affected by these variants.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coding variants in &lt;i&gt;TMEM175&lt;/i&gt; are likely to be responsible for the association in the &lt;i&gt;TMEM175/GAK/DGKQ&lt;/i&gt; locus, which could be mediated by affecting GCase activity.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Layer and cell specific recruitment dynamics during epileptic seizures in‐vivo</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate the network dynamics mechanisms underlying differential initiation of epileptic inter‐ictal spikes and seizures.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed combined &lt;i&gt;in‐vivo&lt;/i&gt; two‐photon calcium imaging from different targeted neuronal subpopulations and extracellular electrophysiological recordings during 4‐aminopyridine induced neocortical spikes and seizures.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both spikes and seizures were associated with intense synchronized activation of excitatory layer‐2/3 pyramidal neurons (PNs) and to a lesser degree layer‐4 neurons, as well as inhibitory parvalbumin‐expressing interneurons. In sharp contrast, layer‐5 PNs and somatostatin‐expressing interneurons were gradually and asynchronously recruited into the ictal activity during the course of seizures. Within layer‐2/3, the main difference between onset of spikes and seizures lied in the relative recruitment dynamics of excitatory PNs compared to parvalbumin‐ and somatostatin‐expressing inhibitory interneurons. While spikes exhibited balanced recruitment of PNs and parvalbumin‐expressing interneurons, during seizures interneurons responses were reduced and less synchronized than in layer‐2/3 PNs. Similar imbalance was not observed in layers 4 or 5 of the neocortex. Machine learning based algorithms we developed were able to distinguish spikes form seizures based solely on activation dynamics of layer‐2/3 PNs at discharge onset.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During onset of seizures the recruitment dynamics markedly differed between neuronal subpopulations, with rapid synchronous recruitment of layer‐2/3 PNs, layer‐4 neurons and parvalbumin‐expressing INs and gradual asynchronous recruitment of layer‐5 PNs and somatostatin‐expressing INs. Seizures initiated in layer‐2/3 due to a dynamic mismatch between local PNs and inhibitory INs, and only later spread to layer‐5 by gradually and asynchronously recruiting PNs in this layer.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Naturalistic Approach to the Hard Problem of Consciousness</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00058</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00058</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Following a brief review of current efforts to identify the neuronal correlates of conscious processing (NCCP) an attempt is made to bridge the gap between the material neuronal processes and the immaterial dimensions of subjective experience. It is argued that this “hard problem” of consciousness research cannot be solved by only considering the neuronal underpinnings of cognition. The proposal is that the hard problem can be treated within a naturalistic framework if one considers not only the biological but also the socio-cultural dimensions of evolution. The argument is based on the following premises: perceptions are the result of a constructivist process that depends on priors. This applies both for perceptions of the outer world and the perception of oneself. Social interactions between agents endowed with the cognitive abilities of humans generated immaterial realities, addressed as social or cultural realities. This novel class of realities assumed the role of priors for the perception of oneself and the embedding world. A natural consequence of these extended perceptions is a dualist classification of observables into material and immaterial phenomena nurturing the concept of ontological substance dualism. It is argued that perceptions shaped by socio-cultural priors lead to the construction of a self-model that has both a material and an immaterial dimension. As priors are implicit and not amenable to conscious recollection the perceived immaterial dimension is experienced as veridical and not derivable from material processes—which is the hallmark of the hard problem. These considerations let the hard problem appear as the result of cognitive constructs that are amenable to naturalistic explanations in an evolutionary framework.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Role of Microglia and Astrocytes in Huntington’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Huntington’s disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease. HD patients present with movement disorders, behavioral and psychiatric symptoms and cognitive decline. This review summarizes the contribution of microglia and astrocytes to HD pathophysiology. Neuroinflammation in the HD brain is characterized by a reactive morphology in these glial cells. Microglia and astrocytes are critical in regulating neuronal activity and maintaining an optimal milieu for neuronal function. Previous studies provide evidence that activated microglia and reactive astrocytes contribute to HD pathology through transcriptional activation of pro-inflammatory genes to perpetuate a chronic inflammatory state. Reactive astrocytes also display functional changes in glutamate and ion homeostasis and energy metabolism. Astrocytic and microglial changes may further contribute to the neuronal death observed with the progression of HD. Importantly, the degree to which these neuroinflammatory changes are detrimental to neurons and contribute to the progression of HD pathology is not well understood. Furthermore, recent observations provide compelling evidence that activated microglia and astrocytes exert a variety of beneficial functions that are essential for limiting tissue damage and preserving neuronal function in the HD brain. Therefore, a better understanding of the neuroinflammatory environment in the brain in HD may lead to the development of targeted and innovative therapeutic opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Histone H3K9 Trimethylation Downregulates the Expression of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor in the Dorsal Hippocampus and Impairs Memory Formation During Anaesthesia and Surgery</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00246</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00246</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is essential for cognitive and memory functions. Abnormal BDNF expression in the central nervous system may impair these functions. Anaesthesia and surgery can induce perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND). Clinical studies show that BDNF expression is decreased in patients presenting with cognitive impairment after anaesthesia and surgery. However, the molecular mechanism is still unclear. Epigenetic regulation plays an important role in cognition. The hypermethylation of H3K9 is crucial for transcriptional silencing and the onset of cognitive disorders. Here, we hypothesised that H3K9 trimethylation repressed BDNF expression and impaired memory formation or recall during anaesthesia and surgery. Laparotomy under isoflurane inhalation anaesthesia, behavioural tests, Western blotting, quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and immunohistochemistry were used in this study. BDNF expression was decreased in the hippocampus after anaesthesia and surgery. Cognitive impairment affected memory formation but not recall. The trimethylation of H3K9 downregulated BDNF expression. The overexpression of BDNF or use of exogenous BDNF improved the impairment of memory formation caused by anaesthesia and surgery. Therefore, inhibiting H3K9 trimethylation and increasing the expression of BDNF may help prevent PND in the clinical setting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Effects of Noisy Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation During a Bimanual Tracking Robotic Task</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01132</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01132</link>
	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation (nGVS) has been shown to improve motor performance in people with and without disabilities. Previous investigations on the use of nGVS to improve upper-limb motor performance have focused on unimanual fine motor movements, nevertheless, bimanual gross movements are also essential for conducting activities of daily living and can be affected as a result of cerebral dysfunction. Consequently, in this study we investigated the effects of nGVS on bimanual gross motor performance.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Twelve healthy participants completed a visuomotor task in which they performed bimanual upper-limb movements using two robots. During the task, participants tracked a target that oscillated following a sinusoidal amplitude-modulated trajectory. In half of the trials, participants received subthreshold nGVS, in the other half, they received sham stimulation. Primary outcome measure: percent improvement in root mean square error (RMSE) between the target’s and cursors’ trajectories. Secondary outcome measures: percent improvement in lag between the cursors and target; and percent improvement in RMSE between the cursors’ trajectories. A post-test questionnaire was administered to evaluate the experience of participants.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Tracking error was not affected by nGVS: left −2.6(5.5)%, p = 0.128; right −0.9(6.2)%, p = 0.639; nor was bimanual coordination −1.5(9.6)%, p = 0.590. When comparing if one hand was affected more than the other, we did not find a statistically significant difference (−1.7(3.3)%, p = 0.098). Similar results were found for the lag. Questionnaire results indicated that the robotic devices did not limit participants’ movements, did not make participants feel unsafe, nor were they difficult to control. Furthermore, participants did not feel unsafe with the nGVS device, nor did they report any discomfort due to nGVS.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Results suggest that nGVS applied to people without disabilities do not affect bimanual gross motor performance. However, as this was the first study to investigate such effects, stimulation parameters were based on previous unimanual fine motor studies. Future studies should investigate optimal stimulation parameters for improving upper-limb gross motor performance. Overall, participants felt safe using the robotic devices and receiving the noisy electrical stimulation. As such, a similar setup could potentially be employed for subsequent studies investigating the relation between upper-limb performance and nGVS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: ApoA-I Mimetic Peptide Reduces Vascular and White Matter Damage After Stroke in Type-2 Diabetic Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Diabetes leads to an elevated risk of stroke and worse functional outcome compared to the general population. We investigate whether L-4F, an economical ApoA-I mimetic peptide, reduces neurovascular and white-matter damage in db/db type-2 diabetic (T2DM) stroke mice. L-4F (16 mg/kg, subcutaneously administered initially 2 h after stroke and subsequently daily for 4 days) reduced hemorrhagic transformation, decreased infarct-volume and mortality, and treated mice exhibited increased cerebral arteriole diameter and smooth muscle cell number, decreased blood-brain barrier leakage and white-matter damage in the ischemic brain as well as improved neurological functional outcome after stroke compared with vehicle-control T2DM mice (p &amp;lt; 0.05, n = 11/group). Moreover, administration of L-4F mitigated macrophage infiltration, and reduced the level of proinflammatory mediators tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), high-mobility group box-1 (HMGB-1)/advanced glycation end-product receptor (RAGE) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in the ischemic brain in T2DM mice (p &amp;lt; 0.05, n = 6/group). In vitro, L-4F treatment did not increase capillary-like tube formation in mouse-brain endothelial cells, but increased primary artery explant cell migration derived from C57BL/6-aorta 1 day after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo), and enhanced neurite-outgrowth after 2 h of oxygen-glucose deprivation and axonal-outgrowth in primary cortical neurons derived from the C57BL/6-embryos subjected to high-glucose condition. This study suggests that early treatment with L-4F provides a potential strategy to reduce neuroinflammation and vascular and white-matter damage in the T2DM stroke population.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: The Relationship Between Local Field Potentials and the Blood-Oxygenation-Level Dependent MRI Signal Can Be Non-linear</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01126</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01126</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is currently one of the most important neuroimaging methods in neuroscience. The image contrast in fMRI relies on the blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signal, which indirectly reflects neural activity through neurovascular coupling. Because the mechanism that links the BOLD signal to neural activities involves multiple complicated processes, where neural activity, regional metabolism, hemodynamics, and the BOLD signal are all inter-connected, understanding the quantitative relationship between the BOLD signal and the underlying neural activities is crucial for interpreting fMRI data. Simultaneous local field potential (LFP) and fMRI recordings provide a method to study neurovascular coupling. There were a few studies that have shown non-linearities in stimulus related responses, but whether there is any non-linearity in LFP—BOLD relationship at rest has not been specifically quantified. In this study, we analyzed the simultaneous LFP and resting state-fMRI data acquired from rodents, and found that the relationship between LFP and BOLD is non-linear under isoflurane (ISO) anesthesia, but linear under dexmedetomidine (DMED) anesthesia. Subsequent analysis suggests that such non-linearity may come from the non-Gaussian distribution of LFP power and switching from LFP power to LFP amplitude can alleviate the problem to a degree. We also confirmed that, despite the non-linearity in the mean LFP—BOLD curve, the Pearson correlation between the two signals is relatively unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: The Impact of the Geometric Correction Scheme on MEG Functional Topology at Rest</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spontaneous activity is correlated across brain regions in large scale networks (RSN) closely resembling those recruited during several behavioral tasks and characterized by functional specialization and dynamic integration. Specifically, MEG studies revealed a set of central regions (dynamic core) possibly facilitating communication among differently specialized brain systems. However, source projected MEG signals, due to the fundamentally ill-posed inverse problem, are affected by spatial leakage, leading to the estimation of spurious, blurred connections that may affect the topological properties of brain networks and their integration. To reduce leakage effects, several correction schemes have been proposed including the Geometric Correction Scheme (GCS) whose theory, simulations and empirical results on topography of a few RSNs were already presented. However, its impact on the estimation of fundamental graph measures used to describe the architecture of interactions among brain regions has not been investigated yet. Here, we estimated dense, MEG band-limited power connectomes in theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands from 13 healthy subjects (all young adults). We compared the connectivity and topology of MEG uncorrected and GCS-corrected connectomes. The use of GCS considerably reorganized the topology of connectivity, reducing the local, within-hemisphere interactions mainly in the beta and gamma bands and increasing across-hemisphere interactions mainly in the alpha and beta bands. Moreover, the number of hubs decreased in the alpha and beta bands, but the centrality of some fundamental regions such as the Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC), Supplementary Motor Area (SMA) and Middle Prefrontal Cortex (MPFC) remained strong in all bands, associated to an increase of the Global Efficiency and a decrease of Modularity. As a comparison, we applied orthogonalization on connectomes and ran the same topological analyses. The correlation values were considerably reduced, and orthogonalization mainly decreased local within-hemisphere interactions in all bands, similarly to GCS. Notably, the centrality of the PCC, SMA and MPFC was preserved in all bands, as for GCS, together with other hubs in the posterior parietal regions. Overall, leakage correction removes spurious local connections, but confirms the role of dynamic hub regions, specifically the anterior and posterior cingulate, in integrating information in the brain at rest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Negatively Linking Connector Networks in Cognitive Control of Affective Pictures</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive control of emotions depends on intermodular long-distance communications. However, negative connections between connector hubs are removed by traditional hard-thresholding approach in graph-theoretical research. Using soft-thresholding approach to reserve negative links, we explore time-varying features of connector hubs in intermodular communications during cognitive control of affective pictures. We develop a novel approach to sparse functional networks and construct negatively linking connector networks for positive, negative, and neutral pictures. We find that consisting of flexible hubs, the frontoparietal system dynamically top–down inhibits neural activities through negative connections from the salience subnetwork and visual processing area. Moreover, the shared connectors form functional backbones that dynamically reconfigure according to differently-valenced pictures in order to coordinate both stability and flexibility of cognitive connector networks. These results reveal the necessity of conserving negative links between intermodular communications in chronnectome research and deepen the understanding of how connector networks dynamically evolute during cognitive control of affective processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Common Neural System for Sentence and Picture Comprehension Across Languages: A Chinese–Japanese Bilingual Study</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;While common semantic representations for individual words across languages have been identified, a common meaning system at sentence-level has not been determined. In this study, fMRI was used to investigate whether an across-language sentence comprehension system exists. Chinese–Japanese bilingual participants (n = 32) were asked to determine whether two consecutive stimuli were related (coherent) or not (incoherent) to the same event. Stimuli were displayed with three different modalities (Chinese written sentences, Japanese written sentences, and pictures). The behavioral results showed no significant difference in accuracy and response times among the three modalities. Multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) of fMRI data was used to classify the semantic relationship (coherent or incoherent) across the stimulus modalities. The classifier was first trained to determine coherency within Chinese sentences and then tested with Japanese sentences, and vice versa. A whole-brain searchlight analysis revealed significant above-chance classification accuracy across Chinese and Japanese sentences in the supramarginal gyrus (BA 40), extending into the angular gyrus (BA 39) as well as the opercular (BA 44) and triangular (BA 45) parts of the inferior frontal gyrus in the left hemisphere (cluster-level FWE corrected p &amp;lt; 0.05). Significant above-chance classification accuracy was also found across Japanese sentences and pictures in the supramarginal (BA 40) and angular gyrus (BA 39). These results indicate that a common meaning system for sentence processing across languages and modalities exists, and it involves the left inferior parietal gyrus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Single-Trial Mechanisms Underlying Changes in Averaged P300 ERP Amplitude and Latency in Military Service Members After Combat Deployment</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00377</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Attenuation in P300 amplitude has been characterized in a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders such as dementia, schizophrenia, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, it is unclear whether the attenuation observed in the averaged event-related potential (ERP) is due to the reduction of neural resources available for cognitive processing, the decreased consistency of cognitive resource allocation, or the increased instability of cognitive processing speed. In this study, we investigated this problem by estimating single-trial P300 amplitude and latency using a modified Woody filter and examined the relation between amplitudes and latencies from the single-trial level to the averaged ERP level. ERPs were recorded from 30 military service members returning from combat deployment at two time points separated by 6 or 12 months. A conventional visual oddball task was used to elicit P300. We observed that the extent of changes in the within-subject average P300 amplitude over time was significantly correlated with the amount of change in three single-trial measures: (1) the latency variance of the single-trial P300 (r = −0.440, p = 0.0102); (2) the percentage of P300-absent trials (r = −0.488, p = 0.005); and (3) the consistent variation of the single-trial amplitude (r = 0.571, p = 0.0022). These findings suggest that there are multiple underlying mechanisms on the single-trial level that contribute to the changes in amplitudes seen at the averaged ERP level. The changes between the first and second assessments were quantified with the intraclass correlation coefficient, the standard error of measurement and the minimal detectable difference. The unique population, the small sample size and the large fraction of participants lost to follow up precludes generalizations of these measures of change to other populations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Stereoscopic Rendering via Goggles Elicits Higher Functional Connectivity During Virtual Reality Gaming</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00365</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Virtual reality (VR) simulates real-world scenarios by creating a sense of presence in its users. Such immersive scenarios lead to behavior that is more similar to that displayed in real world settings, which may facilitate the transfer of knowledge and skills acquired in VR to similar real world situations. VR has already been used in education, psychotherapy, rehabilitation and it comes as an appealing choice for training intervention purposes. The aim of the present study was to investigate to what extent VR technology for games presented via goggles can be used in a magnetic resonance imaging scanner (MRI), addressing the question of whether brain connectivity differs between VR stimulation via goggles and a presentation from a screen via mirror projection. Moreover, we wanted to investigate whether stereoscopic goggle stimulation, where both eyes receive different visual input, would elicit stronger brain connectivity than a stimulation in which both eyes receive the same visual input (monoscopic). To our knowledge, there is no previous research using games and functional connectivity (FC) in MRI to address this question. Multiple analyses approaches were taken so that different aspects of brain connectivity could be covered: fractional low-frequency fluctuation, independent component analysis (ICA), seed-based FC (SeedFC) and graph analysis. In goggle presentation (mono and stereoscopic) as contrasted to screen, we found differences in brain activation in left cerebellum and postcentral gyrus as well as differences in connectivity in the visual cortex and frontal inferior cortex [when focusing on the visual and default mode network (DMN)]. When considering connectivity in specific areas of interest, we found higher connectivity between bilateral superior frontal cortex and the temporal lobe, as well as bilateral inferior parietal cortex with right calcarine and right lingual cortex. Furthermore, we found superior frontal cortex and insula/putamen to be more strongly connected in goggle stereoscopic vs. goggle monoscopic, in line with our hypothesis. We assume that the condition that elicits higher brain connectivity values should be most suited for long-term brain training interventions given that, extended training under these conditions could permanently improve brain connectivity on a functional as well as on a structural level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Interaction of the Psychiatric Risk Gene Cacna1c With Post-weaning Social Isolation or Environmental Enrichment Does Not Affect Brain Mitochondrial Bioenergetics in Rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00483</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00483</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders involves complex interactions between genetic and environmental risk factors. Confirmed by several genome-wide association studies, Cacna1c represents one of the most robustly replicated psychiatric risk genes. Besides genetic predispositions, environmental stress such as childhood maltreatment also contributes to enhanced disease vulnerability. Both, Cacna1c gene variants and stressful life events are associated with morphological alterations in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. Emerging evidence suggests impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics as a possible underlying mechanism of these regional brain abnormalities. In the present study, we simulated the interaction of psychiatric disease-relevant genetic and environmental factors in rodents to investigate their potential effect on brain mitochondrial function using a constitutive heterozygous Cacna1c rat model in combination with a four-week exposure to either post-weaning social isolation, standard housing, or social and physical environmental enrichment. Mitochondria were isolated from the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus to evaluate their bioenergetics, membrane potential, reactive oxygen species production, and respiratory chain complex protein levels. None of these parameters were considerably affected in this particular gene-environment setting. These negative results were very robust in all tested conditions demonstrating that Cacna1c depletion did not significantly translate into altered bioenergetic characteristics. Thus, further investigations are required to determine the disease-related effects on brain mitochondria.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Alteration of Musashi1 Intra-cellular Distribution During Regeneration Following Gentamicin-Induced Hair Cell Loss in the Guinea Pig Crista Ampullaris</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The mechanism underlying hair cell (HC) regeneration in the mammalian inner ear is still under debate. Understanding what molecules regulate the HC regeneration in mature mammals will be the key to the treatment of the inner ear disorder. Musashi1 (MSI1) is an RNA binding protein associated with asymmetric division and maintenance of stem cell function as a modulator of the Notch-1 signaling pathway. In this study, we investigated the cellular proliferative activity and changes in spatiotemporal pattern of MSI1 expression in the gentamicin (GM)-treated crista ampullaris (CA) in guinea pigs. Although the vestibular HCs in the CA almost disappeared at 14 days after injecting GM in the inner ear, the density of vestibular HCs spontaneously increased by up to 50% relative to controls at 56 days post-GM treatment (PT). The number of the type II HCs was significantly increased at 28 days PT relative to 14 days PT (p &amp;lt; 0.01) while that of type I HCs or supporting cells (SCs) did not change. The number of SCs did not change through the observational period. Administration of bromodeoxyuridine with the same GM treatment showed that the cell proliferation activity was high in SCs between 14 and 28 days PT. The changes in spatiotemporal patterns of MSI1 expression during spontaneous HC regeneration following GM treatment showed that MSI1-immunoreactivity was diffusely spread into the cytoplasm of the SCs during 7–21 days PT whereas the expression of MSI1 was confined to the nucleus of SCs in the other period. The MSI1/MYO7A double-positive cells were observed at 21 days PT. These results suggest that regeneration of vestibular HCs might originate in the asymmetric cell division and differentiation of SCs and that MSI1 might be involved in controlling the process of vestibular HC regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Reward-Related Behavioral, Neurochemical and Electrophysiological Changes in a Rat Model of Autism Based on Prenatal Exposure to Valproic Acid</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00479</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Prenatal exposure to the antiepileptic drug valproic acid (VPA) induces autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in humans and autistic-like behaviors in rodents, which makes it a good model to study the neural underpinnings of ASD. Rats prenatally exposed to VPA show profound deficits in the social domain. The altered social behavior displayed by VPA-exposed rats may be due to either a deficit in social reward processing or to a more general inability to properly understand and respond to social signals. To address this issue, we performed behavioral, electrophysiological and neurochemical experiments and tested the involvement of the brain reward system in the social dysfunctions displayed by rats prenatally exposed to VPA (500 mg/kg). We found that, compared to control animals, VPA-exposed rats showed reduced play responsiveness together with impaired sociability in the three-chamber test and altered social discrimination abilities. In addition, VPA-exposed rats showed altered expression of dopamine receptors together with inherent hyperexcitability of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). However, when tested for socially-induced conditioned place preference, locomotor response to amphetamine and sucrose preference, control and VPA-exposed rats performed similarly, indicating normal responses to social, drug and food rewards. On the basis of the results obtained, we hypothesize that social dysfunctions displayed by VPA-exposed rats are more likely caused by alterations in cognitive aspects of the social interaction, such as the interpretation and reciprocation of social stimuli and/or the ability to adjust the social behavior of the individual to the changing circumstances in the social and physical environment, rather than to inability to enjoy the pleasurable aspects of the social interaction. The observed neurochemical and electrophysiological alterations in the NAc may contribute to the inability of VPA-exposed rats to process and respond to social cues, or, alternatively, represent a compensatory mechanism towards VPA-induced neurodevelopmental insults.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Microglial Morphometric Parameters Correlate With the Expression Level of IL-1β, and Allow Identifying Different Activated Morphotypes</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Microglia are the resident macrophages in the brain. Traditionally, two forms of microglia have been described: one considered as a resting/surveillant state in which cells have a highly branched morphology, and another considered as an activated state in which they acquire a de-ramified or amoeboid form. However, many studies describe intermediate microglial morphologies which emerge during pathological processes. Since microglial form and function are closely related, it is of interest to correlate microglial morphology with the extent of its activation. To address this issue, we used a rat model of neuroinflammation consisting in a single injection of the enzyme neuraminidase (NA) within the lateral ventricle. Sections from NA-injected animals were co-immunolabeled with the microglial marker IBA1 and the cytokine IL-1β, which highlight features of the cell’s shape and inflammatory activation, respectively. Activated (IL-1β positive) microglial cells were sampled from the dorsal hypothalamus nearby the third ventricle. Images of single microglial cells were processed in two different ways to obtain (1) an accurate measure of the level of expression of IL-1β (indicating the degree of activation), and (2) a set of 15 morphological parameters to quantitatively and objectively describe the cell’s shape. A simple regression analysis revealed a dependence of most of the morphometric parameters on IL-1β expression, demonstrating that the morphology of microglial cells changes progressively with the degree of activation. Moreover, a hierarchical cluster analysis pointed out four different morphotypes of activated microglia, which are characterized not only by morphological parameters values, but also by specific IL-1β expression levels. Thus, these results demonstrate in an objective manner that the activation of microglial cells is a gradual process, and correlates with their morphological change. Even so, it is still possible to categorize activated cells according to their morphometric parameters, each category presenting a different activation degree. The physiological relevance of those activated morphotypes is an issue worth to be assessed in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Crowd Control: Effects of Physical Crowding on Cargo Movement in Healthy and Diseased Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;High concentration of cytoskeletal filaments, organelles, and proteins along with the space constraints due to the axon’s narrow geometry lead inevitably to intracellular physical crowding along the axon of a neuron. Local cargo movement is essential for maintaining steady cargo transport in the axon, and this may be impeded by physical crowding. Molecular motors that mediate active transport share movement mechanisms that allow them to bypass physical crowding present on microtubule tracks. Many neurodegenerative diseases, irrespective of how they are initiated, show increased physical crowding owing to the greater number of stalled organelles and structural changes associated with the cytoskeleton. Increased physical crowding may be a significant factor in slowing cargo transport to synapses, contributing to disease progression and culminating in the dying back of the neuronal process. This review explores the idea that physical crowding can impede cargo movement along the neuronal process. We examine the sources of physical crowding and strategies used by molecular motors that might enable cargo to circumvent physically crowded locations. Finally, we describe sub-cellular changes in neurodegenerative diseases that may alter physical crowding and discuss the implications of such changes on cargo movement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Inhibition of HDAC4 Attenuated JNK/c-Jun-Dependent Neuronal Apoptosis and Early Brain Injury Following Subarachnoid Hemorrhage by Transcriptionally Suppressing MKK7</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-Jun cascade-dependent neuronal apoptosis has been identified as a central element for early brain injury (EBI) following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), but the molecular mechanisms underlying this process are still thoroughly undefined to date. In this study, we found that pan-histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition by TSA, SAHA, VPA, and M344 led to a remarkable decrease in the phosphorylation of JNK and c-Jun, concomitant with a significant abrogation of apoptosis caused by potassium deprivation in cultured cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs). Further investigation showed that these effects resulted from HDAC inhibition-induced transcriptional suppression of MKK7, a well-known upstream kinase of JNK. Using small interference RNAs (siRNAs) to silence the respective HDAC members, HDAC4 was screened to be required for MKK7 transcription and JNK/c-Jun activation. LMK235, a specific HDAC4 inhibitor, dose-dependently suppressed MKK7 transcription and JNK/c-Jun activity. Functionally, HDAC4 inhibition via knockdown or LMK235 significantly rescued CGN apoptosis induced by potassium deprivation. Moreover, administration of LMK235 remarkably ameliorated the EBI process in SAH rats, associated with an obvious reduction in MKK7 transcription, JNK/c-Jun activity, and neuronal apoptosis. Collectively, the findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of neuronal apoptosis regarding HDAC4 in the selective regulation of MKK7 transcription and JNK/c-Jun activity. HDAC4 inhibition could be a potential alternative to prevent MKK7/JNK/c-Jun axis-mediated nervous disorders, including SAH-caused EBI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Gpr158 Deficiency Impacts Hippocampal CA1 Neuronal Excitability, Dendritic Architecture, and Affects Spatial Learning</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;G-protein-coupled receptor 158 (Gpr158) is highly expressed in striatum, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. It gained attention as it was implicated in physiological responses to stress and depression. Recently, Gpr158 has been shown to act as a pathway-specific synaptic organizer in the hippocampus, required for proper mossy fiber-CA3 neurocircuitry establishment, structure, and function. Although rodent Gpr158 expression is highest in CA3, considerable expression occurs in CA1 especially after the first postnatal month. Here, we combined hippocampal-dependent behavioral paradigms with subsequent electrophysiological and morphological analyses from the same group of mice to assess the effects of Gpr158 deficiency on CA1 physiology and function. We demonstrate deficits in spatial memory acquisition and retrieval in the Morris water maze paradigm, along with deficits in the acquisition of extinction memory in the passive avoidance test in Gpr158 KO mice. Electrophysiological recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons revealed normal basal excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, however, Schaffer collateral stimulation yielded dramatically reduced post-synaptic currents. Interestingly, intrinsic excitability of CA1 pyramidals was found increased, potentially acting as a compensatory mechanism to the reductions in Schaffer collateral-mediated drive. Both ex vivo and in vitro, neurons deficient for or with lowered levels of Gpr158 exhibited robust reductions in dendritic architecture and complexity, i.e., reduced length, surface, bifurcations, and branching. This effect was localized in the apical but not basal dendrites of adult CA1 pyramidals, indicative of compartment-specific alterations. A significant positive correlation between spatial memory acquisition and extent of complexity of CA1 pyramidals was found. Taken together, we provide first evidence of significant disruptions in hippocampal CA1 neuronal dendritic architecture and physiology, driven by Gpr158 deficiency. Importantly, the hippocampal neuronal morphology deficits appear to support the impairments in spatial memory acquisition observed in Gpr158 KO mice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite its extensive use in clinical studies, the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) remain to be elucidated. We previously described subacute effects of tDCS on immune- and stem cells in the rat brain. To investigate the more immediate effects of tDCS regulating those cellular responses, we treated rats with a single session of either anodal or cathodal tDCS, and analyzed the gene expression by microarray; sham-stimulated rats served as control. Anodal tDCS increased expression of several genes coding for the major histocompatibility complex I (MHC I), while cathodal tDCS increased the expression of the immunoregulatory protein osteopontin (OPN). We confirmed the effects of gene upregulation by immunohistochemistry at the protein level. Thus, our data show a novel mechanism for the actions of tDCS on immune- and inflammatory processes, providing a target for future therapeutic studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Rare variants in triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) have been identified as risk factors for AD. Soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a potential and novel biomarker of neuroinflammation implicated in the onset and progression of AD. To explore the roles of CSF sTREM2 on the pathogenesis of AD, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) by using the data from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We found CSF sTREM2 levels were elevated with the disease stages, but there was no significant difference between that of AD patients and normal participants. CSF sTREM2 was positively correlated with CSF total tau and phosphorylated-tau levels (ρ &amp;gt; 0.35, p &amp;lt; 1e-06; ρ &amp;gt; 0.32, p &amp;lt; 1e-05, respectively) for all disease states. We identified the most significant CSF sTREM2 related locus was rs7232 (FDR = 3.01e-08), a missense variant in MS4A6A gene of chromosome 11. Moreover, we also detected rs7232 was highly associated with MS4A6A gene expression (FDR = 1.37e-18). In addition, our pathway analysis for our significant GWAS results showed that biological processes for regulation of viruses and immune response were highly overrepresented or enriched. Our study suggests that CSF sTREM2 plays an informative role in AD progression. Moreover, CSF sTREM2 and AD is highly related to viral infections and immune response.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Effect of Systemic Inflammation on Rat Attentional Function and Neuroinflammation: Possible Protective Role for Food Restriction</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00296</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Aging is characterized by subtle cognitive decline, which correlates with increased peripheral inflammation. Acute activation of the peripheral immune system, via lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection, elicits deficits in hippocampal-dependent spatial memory. Little is known concerning the effect of chronic inflammation on prefrontal cortex (PFC)-dependent vigilance. We examined the impact of repeated LPS injections in young and middle-age rats on the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT), expecting repeated LPS treatment to induce attentional deficits with greater disruption in middle-age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Male Fischer-344 rats, 4- and 12-months-old, were food restricted and trained on the 5-CSRTT. Once rats reached criterion, they were injected with LPS (1 mg/kg, i.p.) weekly for 4 weeks and testing started 48 h after each injection. To examine the possibility that mild food restriction inherent to the behavioral task influenced inflammation markers, a second group of food-restricted or ad-lib-fed rats was assessed for cytokine changes 48 h after one injection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Performing LPS-treated rats exhibited a sickness response, manifesting as reduced initiated and completed trials during the first week but recovered by the second week of testing. After the first week, LPS-treated rats continued to exhibit longer response latencies, despite no change in food retrieval latency, suggestive of LPS-induced cognitive slowing. Similarly, LPS-induced impairment of attention was observed as increased omissions with heightened cognitive demand and increased age. Repeated LPS-treatment increased the level of PFC IL-1α, and PFC IL-6 was marginally higher in middle-age rats. No effect of age or treatment was observed for plasma cytokines in performing rats. Histological examination of microglia indicated increased colocalization of Iba1+ and CD68+ cells from middle-age relative to young rats. Examination of food restriction demonstrated an attenuation of age- and LPS-related increases in plasma cytokine levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Systemic inflammation, induced through LPS treatment, impaired attentional function, which was independent of sickness and exacerbated by increased cognitive demand and increased age. Additional studies revealed that food restriction, associated with the task, attenuated markers of neuroinflammation and plasma cytokines. The results emphasize the need for improved methods for modeling low-level chronic systemic inflammation to effectively examine its impact on attention during aging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Spectrum of KV2.1 Dysfunction in KCNB1‐Associated Neurodevelopmental Disorders</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25607?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pathogenic variants in &lt;i&gt;KCNB1&lt;/i&gt;, encoding the voltage‐gated potassium channel K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1, are associated with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE). Previous functional studies on a limited number of &lt;i&gt;KCNB1&lt;/i&gt; variants indicated a range of molecular mechanisms by which variants affect channel function, including loss of voltage sensitivity, loss of ion selectivity, and reduced cell‐surface expression.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We evaluated a series of 17 &lt;i&gt;KCNB1&lt;/i&gt; variants associated with DEE or other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) to rapidly ascertain channel dysfunction using high‐throughput functional assays. Specifically, we investigated the biophysical properties and cell‐surface expression of variant K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 channels expressed in heterologous cells using high‐throughput automated electrophysiology and immunocytochemistry–flow cytometry.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pathogenic variants exhibited diverse functional defects, including altered current density and shifts in the voltage dependence of activation and/or inactivation, as homotetramers or when coexpressed with wild‐type K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1. Quantification of protein expression also identified variants with reduced total K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 expression or deficient cell‐surface expression.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study establishes a platform for rapid screening of K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 functional defects caused by &lt;i&gt;KCNB1&lt;/i&gt; variants associated with DEE and other NDDs. This will aid in establishing &lt;i&gt;KCNB1&lt;/i&gt; variant pathogenicity and the mechanism of dysfunction, which will enable targeted strategies for therapeutic intervention based on molecular phenotype.

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the present study was to evaluate deep learning-based image-guided surgical planning for deep brain stimulation (DBS). We developed deep learning semantic segmentation-based DBS targeting and prospectively applied the method clinically.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;T2&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; fast gradient-echo images from 102 patients were used for training and validation. Manually drawn ground truth information was prepared for the subthalamic and red nuclei with an axial cut ∼4 mm below the anterior–posterior commissure line. A fully convolutional neural network (FCN-VGG-16) was used to ensure margin identification by semantic segmentation. Image contrast augmentation was performed nine times. Up to 102 original images and 918 augmented images were used for training and validation. The accuracy of semantic segmentation was measured in terms of mean accuracy and mean intersection over the union. Targets were calculated based on their relative distance from these segmented anatomical structures considering the Bejjani target.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Mean accuracies and mean intersection over the union values were high: 0.904 and 0.813, respectively, for the 62 training images, and 0.911 and 0.821, respectively, for the 558 augmented training images when 360 augmented validation images were used. The Dice coefficient converted from the intersection over the union was 0.902 when 720 training and 198 validation images were used. Semantic segmentation was adaptive to high anatomical variations in size, shape, and asymmetry. For clinical application, two patients were assessed: one with essential tremor and another with bradykinesia and gait disturbance due to Parkinson’s disease. Both improved without complications after surgery, and microelectrode recordings showed subthalamic nuclei signals in the latter patient.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The accuracy of deep learning-based semantic segmentation may surpass that of previous methods. DBS targeting and its clinical application were made possible using accurate deep learning-based semantic segmentation, which is adaptive to anatomical variations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Fornix Stimulation Induces Metabolic Activity and Dopaminergic Response in the Nucleus Accumbens</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Papez circuit, including the fornix white matter bundle, is a well-known neural network that is involved in multiple limbic functions such as memory and emotional expression. We previously reported a large-animal study of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the fornix that found stimulation-induced hemodynamic responses in both the medial limbic and corticolimbic circuits on functional resonance imaging (fMRI) and evoked dopamine responses in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), as measured by fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV). The effects of DBS on the fornix are challenging to analyze, given its structural complexity and connection to multiple neuronal networks. In this study, we extend our earlier work to a rodent model wherein we characterize regional brain activity changes resulting from fornix stimulation using fludeoxyglucose (&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG) micro positron emission tomography (PET) and monitor neurochemical changes using FSCV with pharmacological confirmation. Both global functional changes and local changes were measured in a rodent model of fornix DBS. Functional brain activity was measured by micro-PET, and the neurochemical changes in local areas were monitored by FSCV. Micro-PET images revealed increased glucose metabolism within the medial limbic and corticolimbic circuits. Neurotransmitter efflux induced by fornix DBS was monitored at NAc by FSCV and identified by specific neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitors. We found a significant increase in the metabolic activity in several key regions of the medial limbic circuits and dopamine efflux in the NAc following fornix stimulation. These results suggest that electrical stimulation of the fornix modulates the activity of brain memory circuits, including the hippocampus and NAc within the dopaminergic pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Functional MRI Readouts From BOLD and Diffusion Measurements Differentially Respond to Optogenetic Activation and Tissue Heating</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01104</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01104</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Functional blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) MRI provides a brain-wide readout that depends on the hemodynamic response to neuronal activity. Diffusion fMRI has been proposed as an alternative to BOLD fMRI and has been postulated to directly rely on neuronal activity. These complementary functional readouts are versatile tools to be combined with optogenetic stimulation to investigate networks of the brain. The cell-specificity and temporal precision of optogenetic manipulations promise to enable further investigation of the origin of fMRI signals. The signal characteristics of the diffusion fMRI readout vice versa may better resolve network effects of optogenetic stimulation. However, the light application needed for optogenetic stimulation is accompanied by heat deposition within the tissue. As both diffusion and BOLD are sensitive to temperature changes, light application can lead to apparent activations confounding the interpretation of fMRI data. The degree of tissue heating, the appearance of apparent activation in different fMRI sequences and the origin of these phenomena are not well understood. Here, we disentangled apparent activations in BOLD and diffusion measurements in rats from physiological activation upon sensory or optogenetic stimulation. Both, BOLD and diffusion fMRI revealed similar signal shapes upon sensory stimulation that differed clearly from those upon heating. Apparent activations induced by high-intensity light application were dominated by T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;-effects and resulted in mainly negative signal changes. We estimated that even low-intensity light application used for optogenetic stimulation reduces the BOLD response close to the fiber by up to 0.4%. The diffusion fMRI signal contained T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; and diffusion components. The apparent diffusion coefficient, which reflects the isolated diffusion component, showed negative changes upon both optogenetic and electric forepaw stimulation. In contrast, positive changes were detected upon high-intensity light application and thus ruled out heating as a major contributor to the diffusion fMRI signal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Age-Related Changes in the Plasticity of Neural Networks Assessed by Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation With Electromyography: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00469</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00469</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: The excitability of cerebral cortical cells, neural pathway, and neural networks, as well as their plasticity, are key to our exploration of age-related changes in brain structure and function. The combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with electromyography (EMG) can be applied to the primary motor cortex; it activates the underlying neural group and passes through the corticospinal pathway, which can be quantified using EMG. This meta-analysis aimed to analyze changes in cortical excitability and plasticity in healthy elderly individuals vs. young individuals through TMS-EMG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The Cochrane Library, Medline, and EMBASE databases were searched to identify eligible trials published from database inception to June 3, 2019. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and improved Jadad scale were used to assess the methodological quality. A meta-analysis of the comparative effects was conducted using the Review Manager 5.3 software and Stata 14.0 software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The pooled results revealed that the resting motor threshold values in the elderly group were markedly higher than those reported in the young group (mean difference [MD]: −2.35; 95% confidence interval [CI]: −3.69 to −1.02]; p &amp;lt; (0.00001). The motor evoked potential amplitude significantly reduced in the elderly group vs. the young group (MD: 0.18; 95% CI: 0.09–0.27; p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Moreover, there was significantly longer motor evoked potential latency in the elderly group (MD: −1.07; 95% CI: −1.77 to −0.37]; p =(0.003). There was no significant difference observed in the active motor threshold between the elderly and young groups (MD: −1.52; 95% CI: −3.47 to −0.42]; p =(0.13). Meanwhile, only two studies reported the absence of adverse events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: We found that the excitability of the cerebral cortex declined in elderly individuals vs. young individuals. The findings of the present analysis should be considered with caution owing to the methodological limitations in the included trials. Additional high-quality studies are warranted to validate our findings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: Environmental Enrichment From Birth Impacts Parvalbumin Expressing Cells and Wisteria Floribunda Agglutinin Labelled Peri-Neuronal Nets Within the Developing Murine Striatum</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00090</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Environmental enrichment can dramatically affect both the development and function of neural circuits. This is accomplished, at least in part, by the regulation of inhibitory cellular networks and related extracellular matrix glycoprotein structures known as perineuronal nets. The degree to which enhanced housing can influence brain areas involved in the planning and execution of actions is not well known. We examined the effect of enriching mice from birth on parvalbumin expression and perineuronal net formation in developing and adult striatum. This input nucleus of the basal ganglia consists of topographically discernible regions that serve different functions, providing a means of simultaneously examining the influence of environmental factors on discrete, but related networks. Greater densities of striatal parvalbumin positive cells and wisteria floribunda agglutinin labelled perineuronal nets were present in enriched pups during the second postnatal week, primarily within the lateral portion of the nucleus. Housing conditions continued to have an impact into adulthood, with enriched mice exhibiting higher parvalbumin positive cell densities in both medial and lateral striatum. Curiously, no differences due to housing conditions were detected in striatal perineuronal net densities of mature animals. The degree of overlap between striatal parvalbumin expression and perineuronal net formation was also increased, suggesting that heightened neural activity associated with enrichment may have contributed to greater engagement of networks affiliated with cells that express the calcium binding protein. Brain derived neurotrophic factor, an important regulator of inhibitory network maturation, is also subtly, but significantly affected within the striatum of enriched cohorts. Together, these findings suggest that environmental enrichment can exert cell specific effects within different divisions of an area vital for the regulation of action.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Cognitive training helps to promote healthy aging and ease activities of daily living for older adults. Recently, experiments have been conducted using robots to perform this cognitive training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A review was conducted to examine the effects of computer-based cognitive interventions for older adults who were either healthy or experiencing mild cognitive impairment (MCI). A second study also examined the evolution of socially assistive robots (SAR) and their effectiveness at administering cognitive training for older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Eighty-one studies published between 2009 and 2019 were identified for review, 56 of which focused on computerized cognitive training (CCT) while 25 examined the use of robotics. Twenty-four of the 56 CCT studies met the inclusion criteria. These were further classified into two groups: studies which used self-designed programs, and studies using commercially available ones. Of the 25 studies examining the use of robotics in cognitive intervention 7 met the inclusion criteria. Review shows that CCT improves cognitive function but that robots are more effective tools for improving cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: It can be concluded that CCT is beneficial for older adults and though there are drawbacks to this approach they are overcome by the introduction of robots into the training process. Culture, language, and socio-economic considerations vis-a-vis robot design and training methodology should be included in future research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Conformational Dynamics of Transmembrane Domain 3 of Presenilin 1 Is Associated with the Trimming Activity of {gamma}-Secretase</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/43/8600?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/43/8600?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;-Secretase is an intramembrane-cleaving protease that generates the toxic species of the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) that is responsible for the pathology of Alzheimer disease. The catalytic subunit of -secretase is presenilin 1 (PS1), which is a polytopic membrane protein with a hydrophilic catalytic pore. The length of the C terminus of Aβ is proteolytically determined by its processive trimming by -secretase, although the precise mechanism still remains largely unknown. Here, we identified that transmembrane domain (TMD) 3 of human PS1 is involved in the formation of the intramembranous hydrophilic pore. Notably, the water accessibility of TMD3 was greatly altered by point mutations and compounds, which modify -secretase activity. The changes in the water accessibility of TMD3 was also correlated with Aβ42 production. Moreover, crosslinking between TMD3 and TMD7 resulted in a loss of sensitivity to a -secretase modulator that reduces Aβ42 production. Therefore, our findings indicate that the conformational dynamics of TMD3 is a prerequisite for regulation of the Aβ trimming activity of -secretase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Modulation of -secretase activity to reduce the level of toxic amyloid-β species is thought to be a therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer disease. However, the detailed mechanism of the regulation of amyloid-β production, as well as the structure-and-activity relationship of -secretase remains unclear. Here we identified that the water accessibility around transmembrane domain 3 in presenilin 1 was increased along with a reduction in toxic amyloid-β production. Our findings demonstrate how the structure of presenilin 1 dynamically changes during amyloid-β production, and provides insights toward the development of treatments against Alzheimer disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Risperidone Ameliorates Prefrontal Cortex Neural Atrophy and Oxidative/Nitrosative Stress in Brain and Peripheral Blood of Rats with Neonatal Ventral Hippocampus Lesion</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Reduction of the dendritic arbor length and the lack of dendritic spines in the pyramidal cells of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are prevalent pathological features in schizophrenia (SZ). Neonatal ventral hippocampus lesion (NVHL) in male rats reproduces these neuronal characteristics and here we describe how this is a consequence of BDNF/TrkB pathway disruption. Moreover, COX-2 proinflammatory state, as well as Nrf-2 antioxidant impairment, triggers oxidative/nitrosative stress, which also contributes to dendritic spine impairments in the PFC. Interestingly, oxidative/nitrosative stress was also detected in the periphery of NVHL animals. Furthermore, risperidone treatment had a neurotrophic effect on the PFC and antioxidant effects on the brain and periphery of NVHL animals; these cellular effects were related to behavioral improvement. Our data highlight the link between brain development and immune response, as well as several other factors to understand mechanisms related to the pathophysiology of SZ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Prefrontal cortex dysfunction in schizophrenia can be a consequence of morphological abnormalities and oxidative/nitrosative stress, among others. Here, we detailed how impaired plasticity-related pathways and oxidative/nitrosative stress are part of the dendritic spine pathology and their modulation by atypical antipsychotic risperidone treatment in rats with neonatal ventral hippocampus lesion. Moreover, we found that animals with neonatal ventral hippocampus lesion had oxidative/nitrosative stress in the brain as well as in the peripheral blood, an important issue for the translational approaches of this model. Then, risperidone restored plasticity and reduced oxidative/nitrosative stress of prefrontal cortex pyramidal cells, and ultimately improved the behavior of lesioned animals. Moreover, risperidone had differential effects than the brain on peripheral blood oxidative/nitrosative stress.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD)-based chemogenetic tools are extensively used to manipulate neuronal activity in a cell-type specific manner. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings indicate membrane depolarization, coupled with increased neuronal firing rate, following administration of the DREADD ligand, Clozapine-N-Oxide (CNO) to activate the Gq-coupled DREADD, hM3Dq. Although hM3Dq has been used to enhance neuronal firing in order to manipulate diverse behaviors, often within thirty minutes to an hour post-CNO administration, the physiological effects on excitatory neurotransmission remain poorly understood. We investigated the influence of CNO-mediated hM3Dq DREADD activation on distinct aspects of hippocampal excitatory neurotransmission at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse in hippocampal slices derived from mice expressing hM3Dq in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin dependent protein kinase α (CamKIIα)-positive excitatory neurons. Our results indicate a clear dose-dependent effect on fEPSP slope, with no change noted at the lower dose of CNO (1 µM) and a significant, long-term decline in fEPSP slope observed at higher doses (5-20 µM). Further, we noted a robust theta burst stimulus (TBS) induced long-term potentiation (LTP) in the presence of the lower CNO (1 µM) dose, which was significantly attenuated at the higher CNO (20 µM) dose. Whole-cell patch-clamp recording revealed both complex dose-dependent regulation of excitability, and spontaneous and evoked activity of CA1 pyramidal neurons in response to hM3Dq activation across CNO concentrations. Our data indicate that CNO-mediated activation of the hM3Dq DREADD results in dose-dependent regulation of excitatory hippocampal neurotransmission, and highlight the importance of careful interpretation of behavioral experiments involving chemogenetic manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD) are tools to manipulate neuronal activity in specific circuits within the nervous system. Although these tools are routinely used to decipher the neuronal circuits responsible for a wide range of behaviors, effects of DREADD-mediated neuronal activation on excitatory neurotransmission remain poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate using local field and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, the complex dose-dependent effects of Clozapine-N-Oxide (CNO)-mediated activation of excitatory DREADD hM3Dq in hippocampal excitatory neurons on distinct aspects of neurotransmission. Our results underscore the importance of careful interpretation in the use of DREADD-mediated activation of neuronal circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test the hypothesis that Alzheimer's disease and related neuropathologies contribute to the association between hospitalization and cognitive decline in old age.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of a longitudinal clinical–pathologic cohort study, 526 older persons (mean age at death = 90.9 years, 71% female) without dementia at baseline completed annual cognitive testing and were autopsied at death. Hospitalization information was obtained from linked Medicare claims records. Neuropathologic examination assessed β‐amyloid burden, tau tangle density, neocortical Lewy bodies, hippocampal sclerosis, chronic gross and microscopic cerebral infarcts, and transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a mean of 5.1 years, a total of 1,383 hospitalizations occurred, and the mean annual rate of hospitalization was 0.5 (standard deviation = 0.6, median = 0.4). Higher rate of hospitalization was not directly related to higher burden for any of the neuropathologic markers. Higher rate of hospitalization was associated with more rapid cognitive decline (estimate = −0.042, standard error [SE] = 0.012, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), and after controlling for all 7 neuropathologic markers, the association was essentially the same (estimate = −0.040, SE = 0.013, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002). In a multivariable model with 3‐way interactions of neuropathologic markers with hospitalization rate and time, the association between hospitalization rate and faster cognitive decline was greater in persons with more tangle pathology (estimate for interaction = −0.007, SE = 0.002, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002) and in persons with neocortical Lewy bodies (estimate for interaction = −0.117, SE = 0.042, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.005).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older persons with more hospitalizations experienced faster rates of cognitive decline, and this association was more pronounced in persons with more tau tangle density and with neocortical Lewy body pathologies. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Evidence of Hyperacusis in Adult Rats Following Non-traumatic Sound Exposure</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Manipulations that enhance neuroplasticity may inadvertently create opportunities for maladaptation. We have previously used passive exposures to non-traumatic white noise to open windows of plasticity in the adult rat auditory cortex and induce frequency-specific functional reorganizations of the tonotopic map. However, similar reorganizations in the central auditory pathway are thought to contribute to the generation of hearing disorders such as tinnitus and hyperacusis. Here, we investigate whether noise-induced reorganizations are accompanied by electrophysiological or behavioral evidence of tinnitus or hyperacusis in adult Long-Evans rats. We used a 2-week passive exposure to moderate-intensity (70 dB SPL) broadband white noise to reopen a critical period for spectral tuning such that a second 1-week exposure to 7 kHz tone pips produced an expansion of the 7 kHz frequency region in the primary auditory cortex (A1). We demonstrate for the first time that this expansion also takes place in the ventral auditory field (VAF). Sound exposure also led to spontaneous and sound-evoked hyperactivity in the anterior auditory field (AAF). Rats were assessed for behavioral evidence of tinnitus or hyperacusis using gap and tone prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response. We found that sound exposure did not affect gap-prepulse inhibition. However, sound exposure led to an improvement in prepulse inhibition when the prepulse was a 7 kHz tone, showing that exposed rats had enhanced sensorimotor gating for the exposure frequency. Together, our electrophysiological and behavioral results provide evidence of hyperacusis but not tinnitus in sound-exposed animals. Our findings demonstrate that periods of prolonged noise exposure may open windows of plasticity that can also be understood as windows of vulnerability, potentially increasing the likelihood for maladaptive plasticity to take place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The purification of pluripotent stem cell-derived cortico-fugal projection neurons (PSC-CFuPNs) is useful for disease modeling and cell therapies related to the dysfunction of cortical motor neurons, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or stroke. However, no CFuPN-specific surface markers for the purification are known. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported as alternatives to surface markers. Here, we investigated this possibility by applying the miRNA switch, an mRNA technology, to enrich PSC-CFuPNs. An array study of miRNAs in mouse fetal brain tissue revealed that CFuPNs highly express miRNA-124-3p at E14.5 and E16.5. In response, we designed a miRNA switched that responds to miRNA-124-3p and applied it to mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived cortical neurons. Flow cytometry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analyses showed the miRNA-124-3p switch enriched CFuPN-like cells from this population. Immunocytechemical analysis confirmed vGlut1/Emx1/Bcl11b triple positive CFuPN-like cells were increased from 6.5 to 42%. Thus, our miRNA-124-3p switch can uniquely enrich live CFuPN-like cells from mouse ESC-derived cortical neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Origins of the Resting-State Functional MRI Signal: Potential Limitations of the “Neurocentric” Model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01136</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01136</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) is emerging as a research tool for systems and clinical neuroscience. The mechanism underlying resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) signal, however, remains incompletely understood. A widely held assumption is that the spontaneous fluctuations in blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal reflect ongoing neuronal processes (herein called “neurocentric” model). In support of this model, evidence from human and animal studies collectively reveals that the spatial synchrony of spontaneously occurring electrophysiological signal recapitulates BOLD rsFC networks. Two recent experiments from independent labs designed to specifically examine neuronal origins of rsFC, however, suggest that spontaneously occurring neuronal events, as assessed by multiunit activity or local field potential (LFP), although statistically significant, explain only a small portion (∼10%) of variance in resting-state BOLD fluctuations. These two studies, although each with its own limitations, suggest that the spontaneous fluctuations in rsfMRI, may have complex cellular origins, and the “neurocentric” model may not apply to all brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Habituation of the Interlimb Reflex (ILR) Over the Biceps Brachii Muscle After Electrical Stimuli Over the Sural Nerve</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01130</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01130</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Up to now relatively little is known about interlimb reflexes (ILR). Especially it is not well known whether ILR may habituate or not to subsequent stimuli. The main aim of the present investigation was to explore the short term habituation behavior of ILR. The electromyogram was recorded over the tonically active biceps brachii (BB) muscle in 11 healthy subjects contralateral and ipsilateral to supramaximum electrical stimuli (9–12 mA) that were delivered at 1.0 and 0.4 Hz over the left sural nerve. In addition, a selective averaging method was used to investigate the influence of preceding stimuli on the ILR. Thus, 30 blocks of 3 subsequent stimuli were used. All 1st ILR of each block were averaged together. Averages were also obtained for 2nd and 3rd ILR. While ILR amplitudes gained significantly both ipsilateral and contralateral to the stimulus (p &amp;lt; 0.05) after train stimuli as compared with single stimuli, ILR amplitudes showed a significant decrease at 1.0 Hz versus 0.4 Hz stimuli. ILR amplitudes decreased significantly after the 2nd and 3rd stimulus relative to the 1st (p &amp;lt; 0.05). ILR can be recorded bilaterally remote from the stimulus site. Furthermore, ILR show clear short term habituation behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Objectives&lt;p&gt;To investigate the diagnostic value of MRI-based texture analysis in discriminating common posterior fossa tumors, including medulloblastoma, brain metastatic tumor, and hemangioblastoma.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A total number of 185 patients were enrolled in the current study: 63 of them were diagnosed with medulloblastoma, 56 were diagnosed with brain metastatic tumor, and 66 were diagnosed with hemangioblastoma. Texture features were extracted from contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (T1C) images and fluid-attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) images within two matrixes. Mann–Whitney U test was conducted to identify whether texture features were significantly different among subtypes of tumors. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess if they could be taken as independent predictors and to establish the integrated models. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was conducted to evaluate their performances in discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;There were texture features from both T1C images and FLAIR images found to be significantly different among the three types of tumors. The integrated model represented that the promising diagnostic performance of texture analysis depended on a series of features rather than a single feature. Moreover, the predictive model that combined texture features and clinical feature implied feasible performance in prediction with an accuracy of 0.80.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;MRI-based texture analysis could potentially be served as a radiological method in discrimination of common tumors located in posterior fossa.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Towards a Multimodal Model of Cognitive Workload Through Synchronous Optical Brain Imaging and Eye Tracking Measures</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent advances in neuroimaging technologies have rendered multimodal analysis of operators’ cognitive processes in complex task settings and environments increasingly more practical. In this exploratory study, we utilized optical brain imaging and mobile eye tracking technologies to investigate the behavioral and neurophysiological differences among expert and novice operators while they operated a human-machine interface in normal and adverse conditions. In congruence with related work, we observed that experts tended to have lower prefrontal oxygenation and exhibit gaze patterns that are better aligned with the optimal task sequence with shorter fixation durations as compared to novices. These trends reached statistical significance only in the adverse condition where the operators were prompted with an unexpected error message. Comparisons between hemodynamic and gaze measures before and after the error message indicated that experts’ neurophysiological response to the error involved a systematic increase in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) activity accompanied with an increase in fixation durations, which suggests a shift in their attentional state, possibly from routine process execution to problem detection and resolution. The novices’ response was not as strong as that of experts, including a slight increase only in the left dlPFC with a decreasing trend in fixation durations, which is indicative of visual search behavior for possible cues to make sense of the unanticipated situation. A linear discriminant analysis model capitalizing on the covariance structure among hemodynamic and eye movement measures could distinguish experts from novices with 91% accuracy. Despite the small sample size, the performance of the linear discriminant analysis combining eye fixation and dorsolateral oxygenation measures before and after an unexpected event suggests that multimodal approaches may be fruitful for distinguishing novice and expert performance in similar neuroergonomic applications in the field.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Orexin-A Excites Airway Vagal Preganglionic Neurons via Activation of Orexin Receptor Type 1 and Type 2 in Rats</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Airway vagal nerves play a predominant role in the neural control of the airway, and augmented airway vagal activity is known to play important roles in the pathogenesis of some chronic inflammatory airway diseases. Several lines of evidence indicate that dysfunctional central orexinergic system is closely related to the severity of airway diseases, however, whether orexins affect airway vagal activity is unknown. This study investigates whether and how orexin-A regulates the activity of medullary airway vagal preganglionic neurons (AVPNs). The expression of orexin receptor type 1 (OX&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R) and type 2 (OX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R) was examined using immunofluorescent staining. The effects of orexin-A on functionally identified inspiratory-activated AVPNs (IA-AVPNs), which are critical in the control of airway smooth muscle, were examined using patch-clamp in medullary slices of neonatal rats. Airway vagal response to injection of orexin-A into the magna cisterna was examined using plethysmography in juvenile rats. The results show that retrogradely labeled AVPNs were immunoreactive to anti-OX&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R antibody and anti-OX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R antibody. Orexin-A dose-dependently depolarized IA-AVPNs and increased their firing rate. In synaptically isolated IA-AVPNs, the depolarization induced by orexin-A was blocked partially by OX&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R antagonist SB-334867 or OX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R antagonist TCS OX2 29 alone, and completely by co-application of both antagonists. The orexin-A-induced depolarization was also mostly blocked by Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; exchanger inhibitor KB-R7943. Orexin-A facilitated the glutamatergic, glycinergic and GABAergic inputs to IA-AVPNs, and the facilitation of each type of input was blocked partially by SB-334867 or TCS OX2 29 alone, and completely by co-application of both antagonists. Injection of orexin-A into the magna cisterna of juvenile rats significantly increased the inspiratory and expiratory resistance of the airway and consequently decreased the dynamic compliance of the lungs, all of which were prevented by atropine sulfate or bilateral vagotomy. These results demonstrate that orexin-A excites IA-AVPNs via activation of both OX&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R and OX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R, and suggest that increased central synthesis/release of orexins might participate in the pathogenesis of airway diseases via over-activation of AVPNs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Mutual Suppression of Proximal and Distal Axonal Spike Initiation Determines the Output Patterns of a Motor Neuron</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00477</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Axonal spike initiation at sites far from somatodendritic integration occurs in a range of systems, but its contribution to neuronal output activity is not well understood. We studied the interactions of distal and proximal spike initiation in an unmyelinated motor axon of the stomatogastric nervous system in the lobster, Homarus americanus. The peripheral axons of the pyloric dilator (PD) neurons generate tonic spiking in response to dopamine application. Centrally generated bursting activity and peripheral spike initiation had mutually suppressive effects. The two PD neurons and the electrically coupled oscillatory anterior burster (AB) neuron form the pacemaker ensemble of the pyloric central pattern generator, and antidromic invasion of central compartments by peripherally generated spikes caused spikelets in AB. Antidromic spikes suppressed burst generation in an activity-dependent manner: slower rhythms were diminished or completely disrupted, while fast rhythmic activity remained robust. Suppression of bursting was based on interference with the underlying slow wave oscillations in AB and PD, rather than a direct effect on spike initiation. A simplified multi-compartment circuit model of the pacemaker ensemble replicated this behavior. Antidromic activity disrupted slow wave oscillations by resetting the inward and outward current trajectories in each spike interval. Centrally generated bursting activity in turn suppressed peripheral spike initiation in an activity-dependent manner. Fast bursting eliminated peripheral spike initiation, while slower bursting allowed peripheral spike initiation to continue during the intervals between bursts. The suppression of peripheral spike initiation was associated with a small after-hyperpolarization in the sub-millivolt range. A realistic model of the PD axon replicated this behavior and showed that a sub-millivolt cumulative after-hyperpolarization across bursts was sufficient to eliminate peripheral spike initiation. This effect was based on the dynamic interaction between slow activity-dependent hyperpolarization caused by the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-pump and inward rectification through the hyperpolarization-activated inward current, I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;. These results demonstrate that interactions between different spike initiation sites based on spike propagation can shift the relative contributions of different types of activity in an activity-dependent manner. Therefore, distal axonal spike initiation can play an important role in shaping neural output, conditional on the relative level of centrally generated activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding how neuronal activity patterns in the brain correlate with complex behavior is one of the primary goals of modern neuroscience. Chemical transmission is the major way of communication between neurons, however, traditional methods of detection of neurotransmitter and neuromodulator transients in mammalian brain lack spatiotemporal precision. Modern fluorescent biosensors for neurotransmitters and neuromodulators allow monitoring chemical transmission in vivo with millisecond precision and single cell resolution. Changes in the fluorescent biosensor brightness occur upon neurotransmitter binding and can be detected using fiber photometry, stationary microscopy and miniaturized head-mounted microscopes. Biosensors can be expressed in the animal brain using adeno-associated viral vectors, and their cell-specific expression can be achieved with Cre-recombinase expressing animals. Although initially fluorescent biosensors for chemical transmission were represented by glutamate biosensors, nowadays biosensors for GABA, acetylcholine, glycine, norepinephrine, and dopamine are available as well. In this review, we overview functioning principles of existing intensiometric and ratiometric biosensors and provide brief insight into the variety of neurotransmitter-binding proteins from bacteria, plants, and eukaryotes including G-protein coupled receptors, which may serve as neurotransmitter-binding scaffolds. We next describe a workflow for development of neurotransmitter and neuromodulator biosensors. We then discuss advanced setups for functional imaging of neurotransmitter transients in the brain of awake freely moving animals. We conclude by providing application examples of biosensors for the studies of complex behavior with the single-neuron precision.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aging is a major risk factor for cerebrovascular disease; however, the molecular mechanisms of cerebrovascular aging remain to be clarified. The aim of this study was to reveal the molecular signaling pathways involved in cerebrovascular aging. This study used high-resolution liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), in combination with quantitative 6-plex tandem mass tag labeling, to profile protein changes in brain vessels from three groups of healthy rhesus macaques (3-years, 6-years, and 20-years). Western blot analyses were used to validate the proteomic data. A total of 2,934 proteins were identified and analyzed. Twenty-two proteins were continuously downregulated with increasing age, while three proteins were continuously upregulated. When comparing Group C vs. Group B, 270 proteins were downregulated, while 73 proteins were upregulated. All these 368 significantly changed proteins were used for further analysis. Bioinformatic analysis showed that the changed proteins were involved in several signaling pathways during cerebrovascular aging. Proteins in the NRF2 pathway, such as Glutathione S-transferase Mu (GSTM), were consistently downregulated especially after 6-years old, whereas proteins related to miRNA targets in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and membrane receptors were upregulated. Protein-protein interaction networks demonstrated that disorders of energy pathways and serine/threonine kinases were critical during cerebrovascular aging. Data are available via ProteomeXchange under the identifier PXD012306. Our results indicated that during aging, the disorders of energy metabolism and dysfunction of antioxidant activity caused over-production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) may exacerbate cerebrovascular aging. In addition, accumulation of ECM proteins during aging might be closely associated with age-related arterial stiffening and decreased compliance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) still remains an enigma for researchers and clinicians. The onset of AD is insidious, gradually progressive and multifactorial. The recent accumulated scientific evidences suggests that the pathological changes resemble the autoimmune-driven self-sustaining inflammatory process as a result of prolonged oxidative stress and immune dyshomeostasis. Apart from aging, during life span various other factors—mainly environmental, lifestyle, chronic stress, polymicrobial infections and neuroendocrine functions—affect the immune system. Here, we provide crosstalk among “trigger insults/inflammatory stimulus” i.e., polymicrobial infection, chronic stress, pro-inflammatory diet and cholinergic signaling to put forward a “Systemic Immune Dyshomeostasis” model as to connect the events leading to AD development and progression. Our model implicates altered cholinergic signaling and suggests pathological stages with various modifiable risk factors and triggers at different chronological age and stage of cognitive decline. The search of specific autoantibodies for AD which may serve as the suitable blood/CSF biomarkers should be actively pursued for the early diagnosis of AD. The preventive and therapeutic strategies should be directed towards maintaining the normal functioning of the immune system throughout the life span and specific modulation of the immune responses in the brain depending on the stage of changes in brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Leukoencephalopathies comprise a broad spectrum of disorders, but the genetic background of adult leukoencephalopathies has rarely been assessed. In this study, we analyzed 101 Japanese patients with genetically unresolved adult leukoencephalopathy using whole‐exome sequencing and repeat‐primed polymerase chain reaction for detecting GGC expansion in &lt;i&gt;NOTCH2NLC&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;NOTCH2NLC&lt;/i&gt; was recently identified as the cause of neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease. We found 12 patients with GGC expansion in &lt;i&gt;NOTCH2NLC&lt;/i&gt; as the most frequent cause of adult leukoencephalopathy followed by &lt;i&gt;NOTCH3&lt;/i&gt; variants in our cohort. Furthermore, we found 1 case with de novo GGC expansion, which might explain the underlying pathogenesis of sporadic cases. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Clustering the Brain With “CluB”: A New Toolbox for Quantitative Meta-Analysis of Neuroimaging Data</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01037</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01037</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper we describe and validate a new coordinate-based method for meta-analysis of neuroimaging data based on an optimized hierarchical clustering algorithm: CluB (Clustering the Brain). The CluB toolbox permits both to extract a set of spatially coherent clusters of activations from a database of stereotactic coordinates, and to explore each single cluster of activation for its composition according to the cognitive dimensions of interest. This last step, called “cluster composition analysis,” permits to explore neurocognitive effects by adopting a factorial-design logic and by testing the working hypotheses using either asymptotic tests, or exact tests either in a classic inference, or in a Bayesian-like context. To perform our validation study, we selected the fMRI data from 24 normal controls involved in a reading task. We run a standard random-effects second level group analysis to obtain a “Gold Standard” of reference. In a second step, the subject-specific reading effects (i.e., the linear t-contrast “reading &amp;gt; baseline”) were extracted to obtain a coordinates-based database that was used to run a meta-analysis using both CluB and the popular Activation Likelihood Estimation method implemented in the software GingerALE. The results of the two meta-analyses were compared against the “Gold Standard” to compute performance measures, i.e., sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. The GingerALE method obtained a high level of accuracy (0.967) associated with a high sensitivity (0.728) and specificity (0.971). The CluB method obtained a similar level of accuracy (0.956) and specificity (0.969), notwithstanding a lower level of sensitivity (0.14) due to the lack of prior Gaussian transformation of the data. Finally, the two methods obtained a good-level of concordance (AC&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.93). These results suggested that methods based on hierarchical clustering (and post-hoc statistics) and methods requiring prior Gaussian transformation of the data can be used as complementary tools, with the GingerALE method being optimal for neurofunctional mapping of pooled data according to simpler designs, and the CluB method being preferable to test more specific, and localized, neurocognitive hypotheses according to factorial designs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Neural Networks Supporting Phoneme Monitoring Are Modulated by Phonology but Not Lexicality or Iconicity: Evidence From British and Swedish Sign Language</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00374</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00374</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sign languages are natural languages in the visual domain. Because they lack a written form, they provide a sharper tool than spoken languages for investigating lexicality effects which may be confounded by orthographic processing. In a previous study, we showed that the neural networks supporting phoneme monitoring in deaf British Sign Language (BSL) users are modulated by phonology but not lexicality or iconicity. In the present study, we investigated whether this pattern generalizes to deaf Swedish Sign Language (SSL) users. British and SSLs have a largely overlapping phoneme inventory but are mutually unintelligible because lexical overlap is small. This is important because it means that even when signs lexicalized in BSL are unintelligible to users of SSL they are usually still phonologically acceptable. During fMRI scanning, deaf users of the two different sign languages monitored signs that were lexicalized in either one or both of those languages for phonologically contrastive elements. Neural activation patterns relating to different linguistic levels of processing were similar across SLs; in particular, we found no effect of lexicality, supporting the notion that apparent lexicality effects on sublexical processing of speech may be driven by orthographic strategies. As expected, we found an effect of phonology but not iconicity. Further, there was a difference in neural activation between the two groups in a motion-processing region of the left occipital cortex, possibly driven by cultural differences, such as education. Importantly, this difference was not modulated by the linguistic characteristics of the material, underscoring the robustness of the neural activation patterns relating to different linguistic levels of processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Observation of Both Skilled and Erroneous Object Lifting Can Improve Predictive Force Scaling in the Observer</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00373</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00373</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent studies have highlighted that the observation of hand-object interactions can influence perceptual weight judgments made by an observer. Moreover, observing salient motor errors during object lifting allows individuals to update their internal sensorimotor representation about object weight. Embodying observed visuomotor cues for the planning of a motor command further enables individuals to accurately scale their fingertip forces when subsequently lifting the same object. However, it is still unknown whether the observation of a skilled lift is equally able to mediate predictive motor control in the observer. Here, we tested this hypothesis by asking participants to grasp and lift a manipulandum after observing an actor’s lift. The object weight changed unpredictably (light or heavy) every fourth to sixth trial performed by the actor. Participants were informed that they would always lift the same weight as the actor and that, based on the experimental condition, they would have to observe skilled or erroneously performed lifts. Our results revealed that the observation of both skilled and erroneously performed lifts allows participants to update their internal sensorimotor object representation, in turn enabling them to predict force scaling accurately. These findings suggest that the observation of salient motor errors, as well as subtle features of skilled motor performance, are embodied in the observer’s motor repertoire and can drive changes in predictive motor control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Pulsed Electrical Stimulation of the Human Eye Enhances Retinal Vessel Reaction to Flickering Light</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent studies indicate therapeutic benefits of electrical stimulation in cases of specific ophthalmic diseases that are associated with dysfunctional ocular microcirculation. This suggests effects of electrical stimulation on vascular functions. In the present study, we investigated the effects of electrical stimulation on retinal vessel reactions using dynamic vessel analysis (DVA). Eighty healthy subjects were randomly assigned to one of three groups receiving electrical stimulation with different current intensities: 400 μA (n = 26); 800 μA (n = 27); 1200 μA (n = 27). The electrode montage for electrical stimulation consisted of a ring-shaped active electrode surrounding one eye and a square return electrode at the occiput. Rectangular, monophasic, positive current pulses were applied at 10 Hz for a duration of 60 s per stimulation period. DVA was used to observe the stimulation-induced reactions of retinal vessel diameters in response to different provocations. In three DVA measurements, three stimulus conditions were investigated: flicker light stimulation (FLS); electrical stimulation (ES); simultaneous electrical and flicker light stimulation (ES+FLS). Retinal vasodilation caused by these stimuli was compared using paired t-test. The subjects receiving electrical stimulation with 800 μA showed significantly increased retinal vasodilation for ES+FLS compared to FLS (p &amp;lt; 0.05). No significant differences in retinal vessel reactions were found between ES+FLS and FLS in the 400 and 1200 μA groups. No retinal vasodilation was observed for ES for all investigated current intensities. The results indicate that positive pulsed electrical stimulation of an adequate intensity enhances the flicker light-induced retinal vasodilation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The somatic nervous system of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans is a model for understanding the physical characteristics of the neurons and their interconnections. Its neurons show high variation in morphological attributes. This study investigates the relationship of neuronal morphology to the number of synapses per neuron. Morphology is also examined for any detectable association with neuron cell type or ganglion membership.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Solving an Old Dogma: Is it an Arteriole or a Venule?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00289</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;There are very few reliable methods in the literature to discern with certainty between cerebral arterioles and venules. Smooth muscle cells (SMC) and pericytes are present in both arterioles and venules, so immunocytochemistry for markers specific to intramural cells (IMC) is unreliable. This study employed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and a canine brain to produce robust criteria for the correct identification of cerebral arterioles and venules based on lumen:vessel wall area, tested against the less accurate lumen diameter:vessel wall thickness. We first used morphology of IMC to identify two distinct groups of vessels; group 1 with morphology akin to venules and group 2 with morphology akin to arterioles. We then quantitatively assessed these vessels for lumen:vessel wall area ratio and lumen diameter:wall thickness ratio. After assessing 112 vessels, we show two distinct groups of vessels that can be separated using lumen:vessel wall area (group 1, 1.89 −10.96 vs. group 2, 0.27–1.57; p &amp;lt; 0.001) but not using lumen diameter:vessel wall thickness where a substantial overlap in ranges between groups occurred (group 1, 1.58–22.66 vs. group 2, 1.40–11.63). We, therefore, conclude that lumen:vessel wall area is a more sensitive and preferred method for distinguishing cerebral arterioles from venules. The significance of this study is wide, as cerebral small vessel disease is a key feature of vascular dementia and understanding the pathogenesis relies on correct identification of vessels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We aimed to explore the expression of systemic inflammatory factors and selected intracellular miRNAs that regulate inflammatory signaling pathways potentially involved in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) pathogenesis. A total of 179 patients with wet AMD, 175 with dry AMD and 121 controls were enrolled in the study. Soluble inflammatory factors were analyzed in plasma samples using Luminex technology. Expression of selected miRNAs was analyzed in isolated nucleated peripheral blood cells (PBNCs) using real-time qPCR. Wet AMD was an independent factor associated with higher concentrations of IL-6 (β = +0.24, p = 0.0004), GM-CSF (β = +0.31, p &amp;lt; 0.001), IFN-γ (β = +0.58, p &amp;lt; 0.001), higher expression of miRNA-23a-3p (β = +0.60, p &amp;lt; 0.0001), miRNA-30b (β = +0.32, p &amp;lt; 0.0001), miRNA-191-5p (β = +0.28, p &amp;lt; 0.0001) and lower concentration of IL-1β (β = −0.25, p = 0.0003), IL-5 (β = −0.45, p &amp;lt; 0.001), IL-10 (β = −0.45, p &amp;lt; 0.001), IL-12 (β = −0.35, p &amp;lt; 0.001), lower expression of miRNA-16-5p (β = −0.31, p &amp;lt; 0.0001), miRNA-17-3p (β = −0.18, p = 0.01), miRNA-150-5p (β = −0.18, p = 0.01) and miRNA-155-5p (β = −0.47, p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Multivariate analysis revealed that dry AMD was an independent factor associated with higher concentration of GM-CSF (β = +0.34, p &amp;lt; 0.001), IL-6 (β = +0.13, p = 0.05), higher expression of miRNA-23a-3p (β = +0.60, p &amp;lt; 0.0001), miRNA-126-3p (β = +0.23, p = 0.0005), miRNA-126-5p (β = +0.16, p = 0.01), miRNA 146a (β = +0.14, p = 0.03), and mRNA191-5p (β = +0.15, p = 0.03) and lower concentrations of TNF-α (β = +0.24, p = 0.0004), IL-1β (β = −0.39, p &amp;lt; 0.001), IL-2 (β = −0.20, p = 0.003), IL-5 (β = −0.54, p &amp;lt; 0.001), IL-10 (β = −0.56, p &amp;lt; 0.001), IL-12 (β = −0.51, p &amp;lt; 0.001), lower expression of miRNA-16-5p (β = −0.23, p = 0.0004), miRNA-17-3p (β = −0.20, p = 0.003) and miRNA-17-5p (β = −0.19, p = 0.004). Negative correlations between visual acuity and WBC, lymphocyte count, TNF-α, IL-1 β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 concentrations and miRNA-191-5p, as well as positive correlations between visual acuity and miRNA-126-3p, -126-5p, and -155-5p PBNCs expression were found in AMD patients. No such correlations were found in the control group. Our results may suggest the role of both intra- and extracellular mechanisms implicated in inflammatory response regulation in multifactorial AMD pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Wearable Sensor-Based Daily Life Walking Assessment of Gait for Distinguishing Individuals With Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00285</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objectives: To characterize gait disorders in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCIs) and determine the association between the performance of the gait function and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methodology: In this study, we enrolled 38 patients with aMCI and 30 cognitively normal individuals normal controls (NC). Neuropsychological assessments included tests of memory, executive function, language, and attention. Using an inertial-sensor-based wearable instrument, we collected the gait data dynamically for at least 1 h/day for 2 weeks. The gait parameters included walking velocity, stride length, stride time, cadence, and stride time variability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The aMCI patients had reduced walking velocity and stride length and increased stride time variability compared with the NCs. The total number of steps, stride time, and cadence did not differ between the two groups. For all the subjects, walking velocity and stride length was positively associated with memory and executive function. Stride time variability was negatively correlated with the cognitive domains including memory, executive function and attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This study suggested that cognitive impairment-related gait disorders occur (reduced gait speed, gait length, and gait stability) in daily life walking among the aMCI patients. A sensor-based wearable device for gait measurement may be an alternative and convenient tool for screening cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: The “maternal effect” on epilepsy risk: analysis of familial epilepsies and reassessment of prior evidence</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25625?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have observed that epilepsy risk is higher among offspring of affected women than offspring of affected men. We tested whether this “maternal effect” was present in familial epilepsies, which are enriched for genetic factors that contribute to epilepsy risk.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We assessed evidence of a maternal effect in a cohort of families containing ≥3 persons with epilepsy using three methods: (1) “downward‐looking” analysis, comparing the rate of epilepsy in offspring of affected women versus men; (2) “upward‐looking” analysis, comparing the rate of the epilepsy among mothers versus fathers of affected individuals; (3) lineage analysis, comparing the the proportion of affected individuals with family history of epilepsy on the maternal versus paternal side.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downward‐looking analysis revealed no difference in epilepsy rates among offspring of affected mothers versus fathers (prevalence ratio 1.0, 95% CI 0.8, 1.2). Upward‐looking analysis revealed more affected mothers than affected fathers; this effect was similar for affected and unaffected sibships (odds ratio 0.8, 95% CI 0.5, 1.2) and was explained by a combination of differential fertility and participation rates. Lineage analysis revealed no significant difference in the likelihood of maternal versus paternal family history of epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found no evidence of a maternal effect on epilepsy risk in this familial epilepsy cohort. Confounding sex imbalances can create the appearance of a maternal effect in upward‐looking analyses and may have impacted prior studies. We discuss possible explanations for the lack of evidence, in familial epilepsies, of the maternal effect observed in population‐based studies.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Adult-onset autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) is a lately described rare form of leukodystrophy with only one family report from China. As the only disease associated with increased lamina B1 encoded by LMNB1, ADLDs have different clinical presentations, ranging from autonomic to pyramidal tract and cerebellar ataxia. Here, we report a case of ADLD that presented with positional tremor as the initial symptom. T2-weighted brain MRI showed brain atrophy and diffuse high signal intensity of the cerebral white matter and the brain stem. The precise diagnosis was made by identification of the mutated gene. To the best of our knowledge, this is perhaps the first case report of ADLD presenting as tremor in China.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Neuronal Circuit Activity during Neonatal Hypoxic–Ischemic Seizures in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25601?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25601?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To identify circuits active during neonatal hypoxic–ischemic (HI) seizures and seizure propagation using electroencephalography (EEG), behavior, and whole‐brain neuronal activity mapping.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mice were exposed to HI on postnatal day 10 using unilateral carotid ligation and global hypoxia. EEG and video were recorded for the duration of the experiment. Using immediate early gene reporter mice, active cells expressing &lt;i&gt;cfos&lt;/i&gt; were permanently tagged with reporter protein tdTomato during a 90‐minute window. After 1 week, allowing maximal expression of the reporter protein, whole brains were processed, lipid cleared, and imaged with confocal microscopy. Whole‐brain reconstruction and analysis of active neurons (colocalized tdTomato/NeuN) were performed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HI resulted in seizure behaviors that were bilateral or unilateral tonic–clonic and nonconvulsive in this model. Mice exhibited characteristic EEG background patterns such as burst suppression and suppression. Neuronal activity mapping revealed bilateral motor cortex and unilateral, ischemic somatosensory cortex, lateral thalamus, and hippocampal circuit activation. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed regional differences in myelination, which coincide with these activity patterns. Astrocytes and blood vessel endothelial cells also expressed &lt;i&gt;cfos&lt;/i&gt; during HI.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a combination of EEG, seizure semiology analysis, and whole‐brain neuronal activity mapping, we suggest that this rodent model of neonatal HI results in EEG patterns similar to those observed in human neonates. Activation patterns revealed in this study help explain complex seizure behaviors and EEG patterns observed in neonatal HI injury. This pattern may be, in part, secondary to regional differences in development in the neonatal brain. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Peripheral immune biomarkers and neurodegenerative diseases: A prospective cohort study with 20 years of follow‐up</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess the associations of several blood immune biomarkers with the future risks of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson disease in a prospective cohort study with 20 years of follow‐up.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Swedish Apolipoprotein‐Related Mortality Risk study is a longitudinal cohort study including 812,073 participants with repeated blood biomarker measurements between 1985 and 1996 and a follow‐up until 2011. Using a Cox model, we first estimated hazard ratios of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson disease in relation to leukocytes, immunoglobulin G, haptoglobin, and uric acid. We further described the temporal changes of these biomarkers during the 20 years prior to the diagnosis of these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 585 incident cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 3,769 incident cases of Parkinson disease were identified during the follow‐up. Increasing concentrations of leukocytes, haptoglobin, and uric acid were associated with a lower risk of Parkinson disease. No statistically significant association was, however, noted between the studied biomarkers and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Parkinson disease patients appeared to have lower levels of leukocytes and haptoglobin between 20 and 10 years before diagnosis and lower levels of uric acid during the 20 years before diagnosis, compared to controls, although statistically significant differences were only noted during parts of the respective time intervals after multivariable adjustment. No clear differences were noted between patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and controls.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If verified in studies of independent populations, our findings may suggest a different role of systemic inflammation on the risk of Parkinson disease compared to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Intraoperative Low Alpha Power in the Electroencephalogram Is Associated With Postoperative Subsyndromal Delirium</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00056</guid>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Postoperative delirium (PD) and subsyndromal delirium (PSSD) are frequent complications in older patients associated with poor long-term outcome. It has been suggested that certain electroencephalogram features may be capable of identifying patients at risk during surgery. Thus, the goal of this study was to characterize intraoperative electroencephalographic markers to identify patients prone to develop PD or PSSD.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We conducted an exploratory observational study in older patients scheduled for elective major abdominal surgery. Intraoperative 16 channels electroencephalogram was recorded, and PD/PSSD were diagnosed after surgery with the confusion assessment method (CAM). The total power spectra and relative power of alpha band were calculated.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;PD was diagnosed in 2 patients (6.7%), and 11 patients (36.7%) developed PSSD. All of them (13 patients, PD/PSSD group) were compared with patients without any alterations in CAM (17 patients, control group). There were no detectable power spectrum differences before anesthesia between both groups of patients. However, PD/PSSD group in comparison with control group had a lower intraoperative absolute alpha power during anesthesia (4.4 ± 3.8 dB vs. 9.6 ± 3.2 dB, p = 0.0004) and a lower relative alpha power (0.09 ± 0.06 vs. 0.21 ± 0.08, p &amp;lt; 0.0001). These differences were independent of the anesthetic dose. Finally, relative alpha power had a good ability to identify patients with CAM alterations in the ROC analysis (area under the curve 0.90 (CI 0.78-1), p &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;Discussion&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, a low intraoperative alpha power is a novel electroencephalogram marker to identify patients who will develop alterations in CAM – i.e., with PD or PSSD – after surgery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Indomethacin Enhances Type 1 Cannabinoid Receptor Signaling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00257</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00257</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In addition to its known actions as a non-selective cyclooxygenase (COX) 1 and 2 inhibitor, we hypothesized that indomethacin can act as an allosteric modulator of the type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) because of its shared structural features with the known allosteric modulators of CB1R. Indomethacin enhanced the binding of [&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H]CP55940 to hCB1R and enhanced AEA-dependent [&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;S]GTPγS binding to hCB1R in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell membranes. Indomethacin (1 μM) also enhanced CP55940-dependent βarrestin1 recruitment, cAMP inhibition, ERK1/2 and PLCβ3 phosphorylation in HEK293A cells expressing hCB1R, but not in cells expressing hCB2R. Finally, indomethacin enhanced the magnitude and duration of CP55940-induced hypolocomotion, immobility, hypothermia, and anti-nociception in C57BL/6J mice. Together, these data support the hypothesis that indomethacin acted as a positive allosteric modulator of hCB1R. The identification of structural and functional features shared amongst allosteric modulators of CB1R may lead to the development of novel compounds designed for greater CB1R or COX selectivity and compounds designed to modulate both the prostaglandin and endocannabinoid systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Is There a Role for GPCR Agonist Radiotracers in PET Neuroimaging?</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Positron emission tomography (PET) is a molecular imaging modality that enables in vivo exploration of metabolic processes and especially the pharmacology of neuroreceptors. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) play an important role in numerous pathophysiologic disorders of the central nervous system. Thus, they are targets of choice in PET imaging to bring proof concept of change in density in pathological conditions or in pharmacological challenge. At present, most radiotracers are antagonist ligands. In vitro data suggest that properties differ between GPCR agonists and antagonists: antagonists bind to receptors with a single affinity, whereas agonists are characterized by two different affinities: high affinity for receptors that undergo functional coupling to G-proteins, and low affinity for those that are not coupled. In this context, agonist radiotracers may be useful tools to give functional images of GPCRs in the brain, with high sensitivity to neurotransmitter release. Here, we review all existing PET radiotracers used from animals to humans and their role for understanding the ligand-receptor paradigm of GPCR in comparison with corresponding antagonist radiotracers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Cognitive Enhancement by Transcranial Photobiomodulation Is Associated With Cerebrovascular Oxygenation of the Prefrontal Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transcranial infrared laser stimulation (TILS) is a novel, safe, non-invasive method of brain photobiomodulation. Laser stimulation of the human prefrontal cortex causes cognitive enhancement. To investigate the hemodynamic effects in prefrontal cortex by which this cognitive enhancement occurs, we used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), which is a safe, non-invasive method of monitoring hemodynamics. We measured concentration changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin, total hemoglobin and differential effects in 18 healthy adults during sustained attention and working memory performance, before and after laser of the right prefrontal cortex. We also measured 16 sham controls without photobiomodulation. fNIRS revealed large effects on prefrontal oxygenation during cognitive enhancement post-laser and provided the first demonstration that cognitive enhancement by transcranial photobiomodulation is associated with cerebrovascular oxygenation of the prefrontal cortex. Sham control data served to rule out that the laser effects were due to pre-post task repetition or other non-specific effects. A laser-fNIRS combination may be useful to stimulate and monitor cerebrovascular oxygenation associated with neurocognitive enhancement in healthy individuals and in those with prefrontal hypometabolism, such as in cognitive aging, dementia and many neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Synchronization of neuronal activity in the brain underlies the emergence of neuronal oscillations termed “brain waves”, which serve various physiological functions and correlate with different behavioral states. It has been postulated that at least ten distinct mechanisms are involved in the formulation of these brain waves, including variations in the concentration of extracellular neurotransmitters and ions, as well as changes in cellular excitability. In this mini review we highlight the contribution of astrocytes, a subtype of glia, in the formation and modulation of brain waves mainly due to their close association with synapses that allows their bidirectional interaction with neurons, and their syncytium-like activity via gap junctions that facilitate communication to distal brain regions through Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; waves. These capabilities allow astrocytes to regulate neuronal excitability via glutamate uptake, gliotransmission and tight control of the extracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; levels via a process termed K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; clearance. Spatio-temporal synchrony of activity across neuronal and astrocytic networks, both locally and distributed across cortical regions, underpins brain states and thereby behavioral states, and it is becoming apparent that astrocytes play an important role in the development and maintenance of neural activity underlying these complex behavioral states.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The pathogenesis of brain impairment caused by chronic hyperglycemia is complex and includes mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, neurotransmitters’ alteration, and vascular disease, which lead to cognitive impairment, neurodegeneration, loss of synaptic plasticity, brain aging, and dementia. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), a gut released hormone, is attracting attention as a possible link between metabolic and brain impairment. Several studies have shown the influence of GPL-1 on neuronal functions such as thermogenesis, blood pressure control, neurogenesis, neurodegeneration, retinal repair, and energy homeostasis. Moreover, modulation of GLP-1 activity can influence amyloid β peptide aggregation in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and dopamine (DA) levels in Parkinson’s disease (PD). GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) showed beneficial actions on brain ischemia in animal models, such as the reduction of cerebral infarct area and the improvement of neurological deficit, acting mainly through inhibition of oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. They might also exert a beneficial effect on the cognitive impairment induced by diabetes or obesity improving learning and memory by modulating synaptic plasticity. Moreover, GLP-1RAs reduced hippocampal neurodegeneration. Besides this, there are growing evidences on neuroprotective effects of these agonists in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, regardless of diabetes. In PD animal models, GPL-1RAs were able to protect motor activity and dopaminergic neurons whereas in AD models, they seemed to improve nearly all neuropathological features and cognitive functions. Although further clinical studies of GPL-1RAs in humans are needed, they seem to be a promising therapy for diabetes-associated cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease, and the pathogenesis is still quite challenging. Emerging evidence has shown that the brain–gut–microbiota axis served a pivotal role in neurological diseases; however, researches utilizing metagenomic sequencing to analyze the alteration in gut microbiota of MSA patients were quite rare. Here, we carried out metagenomic sequencing in feces of 15 MSA patients and 15 healthy controls, to characterize the alterations in gut microbial composition and function of MSA patients in mainland China. The results showed that gut microbial community of MSA patients was significantly different from healthy controls, characterized by increased genus Akkermansia and species Roseburia hominis, Akkermansia muciniphila, Alistipes onderdonkii, Streptococcus parasanguinis, and Staphylococcus xylosus, while decreased genera Megamonas, Bifidobacterium, Blautia, and Aggregatibacter and species Bacteroides coprocola, Megamonas funiformis, Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, Clostridium nexile, Bacteroides plebeius, and Granulicatella adiacens. Further, functional analysis based on the KEGG database revealed aberrant functional pathways in fecal microbiome of MSA patients. In conclusion, our findings provided evidence for dysbiosis in gut microbiota of Chinese MSA cohorts and helped develop new testable hypotheses on pathophysiology of MSA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Effects of Non-invasive Brain Stimulation on Stimulant Craving in Users of Cocaine, Amphetamine, or Methamphetamine: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dopamine system plays a pivotal role in specific kinds of substance use disorders (SUD, i. e., cocaine and methamphetamine use disorders). Many studies addressed whether dopamine-involved craving could be alleviated by non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques. Nevertheless, the outcomes were highly inconsistent and the stimulating parameters were highly variable. In the current study, we ran a meta-analysis to identify an overall effect size of NIBS and try to find stimulating parameters of special note. We primarily find 2,530 unduplicated studies in PubMed, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar database involving “Cocaine”/“Amphetamine”/“Methamphetamine” binded with “TMS”/“tDCS”/“non-invasive stimulation” in either field. After visual screening, 26 studies remained. While 16 studies were further excluded due to the lack of data, invalid craving scoring or the absence of sham condition. At last, 16 units of analysis in 12 eligible studies were coded and forwarded to a random-effect analysis. The results showed a large positive main effect of stimulation (Hedge's g = 1.116, CI = [0.597, 1.634]). Further subgroup analysis found that only high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) could elicit a significant decrease in craving, while the outcome of low-frequency stimulation was relatively controversial. Moreover, univariate meta regression revealed that the number of pulses per session could impose negative moderation toward the intervention. No significant moderation effect was found in types of abuse, overall days of stimulation and other variables of stimulating protocol. In conclusion, this meta-analysis offered a persuasive evidence for the feasibility of using NIBS to remit substance addictive behavior directly based on dopamine system. We also give clear methodological guidance that researchers are expected to use high-frequency, sufficiently segmented rTMS to improve the efficacy in future treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Considerations and Implications in the Purification of Extracellular Vesicles – A Cautionary Tale</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01067</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nano-sized particles constitutively released from cells into all biological fluids. Interestingly, these vesicles contain genetic cargoes including proteins, RNA and bioactive lipids that can be functionally delivered and affect recipient cells. As a result, there is growing interest in studying EVs in pathological conditions, including central nervous system (CNS)-related diseases, as EVs may be used for diagnostic purposes or as therapeutic agents. However, one major bottleneck is the need for better EV purification strategies when considering complex biological sources such as serum/protein-rich media or plasma. In this study, we have performed a systematic comparison study between the current gold-standard method: ultracentrifugation, to an alternative: size-exclusion chromatography (LC), using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived complex media as a model system. We demonstrate that LC allows for derivation of purer EVs from iPSCs, which was previously impossible with the original UC method. Importantly, our study further highlights the various drawbacks when using the conventional UC approach that lead to misinterpretation of EV data. Lastly, we describe novel data on our iPSC-EVs; how they could relate to stem cell biology and discuss their potential use as EV therapeutics for CNS diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Alterations of Regional Homogeneity and Functional Connectivity Following Short-Term Mindfulness Meditation in Healthy Volunteers</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00376</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness is described as the non-judgmental awareness of experiences in the present moment. The sustained practice of mindfulness may also have beneficial effects on an individual’s well-being. For instance, mindfulness meditation is an effective approach for improving emotion regulation. Specifically, the early stage of mindfulness meditation training enhances emotional monitoring systems related to attention regulation and executive function. Reduced activity in the default mode network (DMN) would probably be observed corresponding to the attenuated mind wandering. In the present study, we hypothesized that alterations in functional activity in the frontal-parietal cortex and DMN may be induced by short-term mindfulness meditation. In this study, before and after 8 weeks of weekly Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) training, healthy participants were evaluated using a mindfulness questionnaire and an affect schedule, as well as via resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Sixteen right-handed non-meditators were enrolled. Another 16 demographically matched healthy adults without any meditation experience were recruited as controls. Pre- and post-MBSR assessments were compared. Increased regional homogeneity in the right superior parietal lobule and left postcentral gyrus (PoCG), as well as altered functional connectivity in PoCG-related networks, were observed post-MBSR. The mindfulness questionnaire scores also improved and negative affect was significantly decreased after MBSR. Together with reduced involvement of the posterior brain, our results suggest a tendency toward stronger involvement of the parietal cortex in mindfulness beginners. This study provides novel evidence regarding the optimization of emotional processing with short-term mindfulness meditation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Atypical Amygdala–Neocortex Interaction During Dynamic Facial Expression Processing in Autism Spectrum Disorder</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00351</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Atypical reciprocal social interactions involving emotional facial expressions are a core clinical feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have demonstrated that some social brain regions, including subcortical (e.g., amygdala) and neocortical regions (e.g., fusiform gyrus, FG) are less activated during the processing of facial expression stimuli in individuals with ASD. However, the functional networking patterns between the subcortical and cortical regions in processing emotional facial expressions remain unclear. We investigated this issue in ASD (n = 31) and typically developing (TD; n = 31) individuals using fMRI. Participants viewed dynamic facial expressions of anger and happiness and their corresponding mosaic images. Regional brain activity analysis revealed reduced activation of several social brain regions, including the amygdala, in the ASD group compared with the TD group in response to dynamic facial expressions vs. dynamic mosaics (p &amp;lt; 0.05, ηp2 = 0.19). Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) analyses were then used to compare models with forward, backward, and bi-directional effective connectivity between the amygdala and neocortical networks. The results revealed that: (1) the model with effective connectivity from the amygdala to the neocortex best fit the data of both groups; and (2) the same model best accounted for group differences. Coupling parameter (i.e., effective connectivity) analyses showed that the modulatory effects of dynamic facial processing were substantially weaker in the ASD group than in the TD group. These findings suggest that atypical modulation from the amygdala to the neocortex underlies impairment in social interaction involving dynamic facial expressions in individuals with ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: The Growing Evidence for the Importance of the Otoliths in Spatial Memory</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many studies have demonstrated that vestibular sensory input is important for spatial learning and memory. However, it has been unclear what contributions the different parts of the vestibular system – the semi-circular canals and otoliths – make to these processes. The advent of mutant otolith-deficient mice has made it possible to isolate the relative contributions of the otoliths, the utricle and saccule. A number of studies have now indicated that the loss of otolithic function impairs normal spatial memory and also impairs the normal function of head direction cells in the thalamus and place cells in the hippocampus. Epidemiological studies have also provided evidence that spatial memory impairment with aging, may be linked to saccular function. The otoliths may be important in spatial cognition because of their evolutionary age as a sensory detector of orientation and the fact that velocity storage is important to the way that the brain encodes its place in space.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Neuroinflammation and the Gut Microbiota: Possible Alternative Therapeutic Targets to Counteract Alzheimer’s Disease?</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a complex, multi-factorial disease affecting various brain systems. This complexity implies that successful therapies must be directed against several core neuropathological targets rather than single ones. The scientific community has made great efforts to identify the right AD targets beside the historic amyloid-β (Aβ). Neuroinflammation is re-emerging as determinant in the neuropathological process of AD. A new theory, still in its infancy, highlights the role of gut microbiota (GM) in the control of brain development, but also in the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Bidirectional communication between the central and the enteric nervous systems, called gut-brain axes, is largely influenced by GM and the immune system is a potential key mediator of this interaction. Growing evidence points to the role of GM in the maturation and activation of host microglia and peripheral immune cells. Several recent studies have found abnormalities in GM (dysbiosis) in AD populations. These observations raise the intriguing question whether and how GM dysbiosis could contribute to AD development through action on the immune system and whether, in a therapeutic prospective, the development of strategies preserving a healthy GM might become a valuable approach to prevent AD. Here, we review the evidence from animal models and humans of the role of GM in neuroinflammation and AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;At present, with the development of an aging society and an increase in the number of elderly people, in order to ensure the ability and enthusiasm of the elderly to live independently, it is necessary to ensure that they can understand the world in a normal way. More and more elderly people have cognitive impairment, and virtual reality (VR) technology is more effective in cognitive diagnosis and treatment than traditional methods. This review article describes some studies on cognitive diagnosis and training for the elderly, and puts forward some suggestions for current studies, in the hopes that VR technology can be better applied to cognitive diagnosis and training.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>The year 2019 marks the 100-year anniversary of the discovery of microglia by Pío del Río-Hortega. We will recount the state of neuroscience research at the beginning of the 20th century and the heated scientific dispute regarding microglial identity. We will then walk through some of the milestones of microglial research in the decades since then. In the last 20 years, the field has grown exponentially. Researchers have shown that microglia are unlike any other resident macrophages: they have a unique origin and distinguishing features.</description>

	<description>The ventral surface of the rostral medulla oblongata has been suspected since the 1960s to harbor central respiratory chemoreceptors [i.e., acid-activated neurons that regulate breathing to maintain a constant arterial PCO2 (PaCO2)]. The key neurons, a.k.a. the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), have now been identified. In this review we describe their transcriptome, developmental lineage, and anatomical projections. We also review their contribution to CO2 homeostasis and to the regulation of breathing automaticity during sleep and wake.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The discovery of extracellular RNA (exRNA) has shifted our understanding of the role of RNA in complex cellular functions such as cell-to-cell communication and a variety of pathologies. ExRNAs constitute a heterogenous group of RNAs ranging from small (such as microRNAs) and long non-coding to coding RNAs or ribosomal RNAs. ExRNAs can be liberated from cells in a free form or bound to proteins as well as in association with microvesicles (MVs), exosomes, or apoptotic bodies. Their composition and quantity depend heavily on the cellular or non-cellular component, the origin, and the RNA species being investigated; ribosomal RNA provides the majority of exRNA and miRNAs are predominantly associated with exosomes or MVs. Several studies showed that ribosomal exRNA (rexRNA) constitutes a proinflammatory and prothrombotic alarmin. It is released by various cell types upon inflammatory stimulation and by damaged cells undergoing necrosis or apoptosis and contributes to innate immunity responses. This exRNA has the potential to directly promote the release of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor factor-α (TNF-α) or interleukin-6 from immune cells, thereby leading to a proinflammatory environment and promoting cardiovascular pathologies. The potential role of exRNA in different pathologies of the central nervous system (CNS) has become of increasing interest in recent years. Although various exRNA species including both ribosomal exRNA as well as miRNAs have been associated with CNS pathologies, their precise roles remain to be further elucidated. In this review, the different entities of exRNA and their postulated roles in CNS pathologies including tumors, vascular pathologies and neuroinflammatory diseases will be discussed. Furthermore, the potential role of exRNAs as diagnostic markers for specific CNS diseases will be outlined, as well as possible treatment strategies addressing exRNA inhibition or interference.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alterations in the homeostasis of either cortical progenitor pool, namely the apically located radial glial (RG) cells or the basal intermediate progenitors (IPCs) can severely impair cortical neuron production. Such changes are reflected by microcephaly and are often associated with cognitive defects. Genes encoding epigenetic regulators are a frequent cause of intellectual disability and many have been shown to regulate progenitor cell growth, including our inactivation of the Smarca1 gene encoding Snf2l, which is one of two ISWI mammalian orthologs. Loss of the Snf2l protein resulted in dysregulation of Foxg1 and IPC proliferation leading to macrocephaly. Here we show that inactivation of the closely related Smarca5 gene encoding the Snf2h chromatin remodeler is necessary for embryonic IPC expansion and subsequent specification of callosal projection neurons. Telencephalon-specific Smarca5 cKO embryos have impaired cell cycle kinetics and increased cell death, resulting in fewer Tbr2+ and FoxG1+ IPCs by mid-neurogenesis. These deficits give rise to adult mice with a dramatic reduction in Satb2+ upper layer neurons, and partial agenesis of the corpus callosum. Mice survive into adulthood but molecularly display reduced expression of the clustered protocadherin genes that may further contribute to altered dendritic arborization and a hyperactive behavioral phenotype. Our studies provide novel insight into the developmental function of Snf2h-dependent chromatin remodeling processes during brain development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is an adult onset, fatal disease, characterized by an accumulation of alpha-synuclein (α-syn) in oligodendroglial cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs involved in post-translational regulation and several biological processes. Disruption of miRNA-related pathways in the central nervous system (CNS) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including MSA. While the exact mechanisms underlying miRNAs in the pathogenesis of MSA remain unclear, it is known that miRNAs can repress the translation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that regulate the following pathogenesis associated with MSA: autophagy, neuroinflammation, α-syn accumulation, synaptic transmission, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. In this review, the metabolism of miRNAs and their functional roles in the pathogenesis of MSA are discussed, thereby highlighting miRNAs as potential new biomarkers for the diagnosis of MSA and in increasing our understanding of the disease process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Determining the structure of a network is of central importance to understanding its function in both neuroscience and applied mathematics. However, recovering the structural connectivity of neuronal networks remains a fundamental challenge both theoretically and experimentally. While neuronal networks operate in certain dynamical regimes, which may influence their connectivity reconstruction, there is widespread experimental evidence of a balanced neuronal operating state in which strong excitatory and inhibitory inputs are dynamically adjusted such that neuronal voltages primarily remain near resting potential. Utilizing the dynamics of model neurons in such a balanced regime in conjunction with the ubiquitous sparse connectivity structure of neuronal networks, we develop a compressive sensing theoretical framework for efficiently reconstructing network connections by measuring individual neuronal activity in response to a relatively small ensemble of random stimuli injected over a short time scale. By tuning the network dynamical regime, we determine that the highest fidelity reconstructions are achievable in the balanced state. We hypothesize the balanced dynamics observed in vivo may therefore be a result of evolutionary selection for optimal information encoding and expect the methodology developed to be generalizable for alternative model networks as well as experimental paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: GST-4-Dependent Suppression of Neurodegeneration in C. elegans Models of Parkinson’s and Machado-Joseph Disease by Rapeseed Pomace Extract Supplementation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Genetic mutations and aging-associated oxidative damage underlie the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, like Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Machado-Joseph disease (MJD). Natural products derived from plants have been regarded as important sources of novel bioactive compounds to counteract neurodegeneration. Here, we tested the neuroprotective effect of an ethanolic extract of rapeseed pomace (RSP), a rapeseed (canola) oil production by-product, in C. elegans models of MJD and PD. The extract, containing sinapine and other phenolics, restored motor function of mutant ataxin-3 (ATXN3) animals (MJD) and prevented degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in one toxin-induced and two genetic models of PD. Whole-organism sensors of antioxidant and xenobiotic response activation revealed the induction of phase II detoxification enzymes, including glutathione S- transferase (GST-4) upon RSP extract supplementation. Furthermore in vivo pharmacogenetic studies confirmed gst-4 is required for the therapeutic effect of RSP extract in the two disease models. The results suggest that GST-4-mediated antioxidant pathways may constitute promising therapeutic co-targets for neurodegenerative diseases and confirm the utility of searching for bioactive compounds in novel sources, including food and agricultural waste/by-products, such as RSP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;As the capacity to isolate distinct neuronal cell types has advanced over the past several decades, new two- and three-dimensional in vitro models of the interactions between different brain regions have expanded our understanding of human neurobiology and the origins of disease. These cultures develop distinctive patterns of activity, but the extent that these patterns are determined by the molecular identity of individual cell types versus the specific pattern of network connectivity is unclear. To address the question of how individual cell types interact in vitro, we developed a simplified culture using two excitatory neuronal subtypes known to participate in the in vivo reticulospinal circuit: HB9&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; spinal motor neurons and Chx10&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; hindbrain V2a neurons. Here, we report the emergence of cell type-specific patterns of activity in culture; on their own, Chx10&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons developed regular, synchronized bursts of activity that recruited neurons across the entire culture, whereas HB9&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neuron activity consisted of an irregular pattern. When these two subtypes were cocultured, HB9&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons developed synchronized network bursts that were precisely correlated with Chx10&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neuron activity, thereby recreating an aspect of Chx10&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons’ role in driving motor activity. These bursts were dependent on AMPA receptors. Our results demonstrate that the molecular classification of the neurons comprising in vitro networks is a crucial determinant of their activity. It is therefore possible to improve both the reproducibility and the applicability of in vitro neurobiological and disease models by carefully controlling the constituent mixtures of neuronal subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: ASCs-Exosomes Recover Coupling Efficiency and Mitochondrial Membrane Potential in an in vitro Model of ALS</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01070</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motoneurons death. Mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) protein have been identified to be related to the disease. Beyond the different altered pathways, the mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the major features that leads to the selective death of motoneurons in ALS. The NSC-34 cell line, overexpressing human SOD1(G93A) mutant protein [NSC-34(G93A)], is considered an optimal in vitro model to study ALS. Here we investigated the energy metabolism in NSC-34(G93A) cells and in particular the effect of the mutated SOD1(G93A) protein on the mitochondrial respiratory capacity (complexes I-IV) by high resolution respirometry (HRR) and cytofluorimetry. We demonstrated that NSC-34(G93A) cells show a reduced mitochondrial oxidative capacity. In particular, we found significant impairment of the complex I-linked oxidative phosphorylation, reduced efficiency of the electron transfer system (ETS) associated with a higher rate of dissipative respiration, and a lower membrane potential. In order to rescue the effect of the mutated SOD1 gene on mitochondria impairment, we evaluated the efficacy of the exosomes, isolated from adipose-derived stem cells, administrated on the NSC-34(G93A) cells. These data show that ASCs-exosomes are able to restore complex I activity, coupling efficiency and mitochondrial membrane potential. Our results improve the knowledge about mitochondrial bioenergetic defects directly associated with the SOD1(G93A) mutation, and prove the efficacy of adipose-derived stem cells exosomes to rescue the function of mitochondria, indicating that these vesicles could represent a valuable approach to target mitochondrial dysfunction in ALS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: A Precise, Controllable in vitro Model for Diffuse Axonal Injury Through Uniaxial Stretch Injury</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Regarding the determination of the biomechanical parameters in a reliable in vitro cell model for diffuse axonal injury (DAI), our study aimed to demonstrate connections between those parameters and secondary axotomy through examination of morphological alterations under a variety of traumatic conditions. An in vitro cell model for DAI was established in primary cultured mouse neurons by uniaxial mechanical stretching of non-myelinated axons under various traumatic conditions: strain (ε) = 5, 10, 20, and 50%; strain time (t) = 500, 100, and 20 ms; strain rate ranging between 0.1 and 25 s&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;. Axonal real strains (strain&lt;sub&gt;axon&lt;/sub&gt;) were measured as 4.53 ± 0.27, 9.02 ± 0.91, 17.75 ± 1.65, and 41.8 ± 4.4%. Axonal real strain rates (SR&lt;sub&gt;axon&lt;/sub&gt;) ranged between 0.096 ± 0.0054 and 20.9 ± 2.2 s&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;. Results showed there was no obvious abnormality of axons with a lower strain condition (strain&lt;sub&gt;axon&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 17.75 ± 1.65%) during the acute phase within 30 min after injury. In contrast, acute axonal degeneration (AAD) was observed in the axons following injury with a higher strain condition (SR&lt;sub&gt;axon&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; 17.75 ± 1.65%). In addition, the incidence and degree of AAD were closely correlated with strain rate. Specifically, AAD occurred to all axons that were examined, when ε = 50% (strain&lt;sub&gt;axon&lt;/sub&gt; = 41.8 ± 4.4%) for 20 ms, while no spontaneous rupture was observed in those axons. Besides, the concentration of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; within the axonal process was significantly increased under such traumatic conditions. Moreover, the continuity of axon cytoskeleton was interrupted, eventually resulting in neuronal death during subacute stage following injury. In this study, we found that there is a minimum strain threshold for the occurrence of AAD in non-myelinated axons of primary cultured mouse neurons, which ranges between 9.02 ± 0.91 and 17.75 ± 1.65%. Basically, the severity of axonal secondary axotomy post DAI is strain rate dependent under a higher strain above the threshold. Hence, a reliable and reproducible in vitro cell model for DAI was established, when ε = 50% (strain&lt;sub&gt;axon&lt;/sub&gt; = 41.8 ± 4.4%) for 20 ms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: Knowing What You Know in Brain Segmentation Using Bayesian Deep Neural Networks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00067</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00067</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we describe a Bayesian deep neural network (DNN) for predicting FreeSurfer segmentations of structural MRI volumes, in minutes rather than hours. The network was trained and evaluated on a large dataset (n = 11,480), obtained by combining data from more than a hundred different sites, and also evaluated on another completely held-out dataset (n = 418). The network was trained using a novel spike-and-slab dropout-based variational inference approach. We show that, on these datasets, the proposed Bayesian DNN outperforms previously proposed methods, in terms of the similarity between the segmentation predictions and the FreeSurfer labels, and the usefulness of the estimate uncertainty of these predictions. In particular, we demonstrated that the prediction uncertainty of this network at each voxel is a good indicator of whether the network has made an error and that the uncertainty across the whole brain can predict the manual quality control ratings of a scan. The proposed Bayesian DNN method should be applicable to any new network architecture for addressing the segmentation problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Gender- and Age-Specific Differences in Resting-State Functional Connectivity of the Central Autonomic Network in Adulthood</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00369</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00369</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Previous functional imaging studies have identified the role of central autonomic network (CAN) in autonomic regulation during various tasks. However, its variability with respect to gender and age, particularly in the resting state, remains poorly understood. Therefore, in this study we systematically investigated gender- and age-related differences in the resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) seeded from core regions of this network, namely posterior mid-cingulate gyrus (pMCC), left amygdala, right anterior and left posterior insula, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), using a large cross-sectional adulthood sample. Results revealed that each of the seeded connectivity maps engaged in at least one of the large-scale brain networks including sensorimotor, attentional, basal ganglia, limbic, and default mode networks (DMN). In the early-adulthood stage, females had stronger negative rsFC in pMCC and right anterior INS (aINS) with the medial DMN than males, possibly reflecting their greater suppression of the sympathoexcitation associated with sex hormonal estrogen. Whereas in the late-adulthood stage, they showed stronger positive rsFC in pMCC with postcentral gyrus and weaker negative rsFC with the most DMN, possibly relating to their higher risk of depression, anxiety, and dementia than males after menopause. Moreover, females demonstrated reduced negative rsFC in pMCC with dorsal PCUN/PCC and left AG with advancing age, whereas males showed the opposite pattern, namely increased positive rsFC, in pMCC with right SMG, and in vmPFC with ventral PCUN. We interpret these results as their differences of altered autonomic regulation associated with pain experience and reflective movement, respectively, due to aging. In sum, our findings add in literature that autonomic responses can be also represented intrinsically in the resting brain, and gender- and age-related differences might be associated with sex hormones and sensorimotor abilities, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Conventional Parkinson’s disease (PD) deep brain stimulation (DBS) utilizes a pulse with an active phase and a passive charge-balancing phase. A pulse-shaping strategy that eliminates the passive phase may be a promising approach to addressing movement disorders.&lt;/p&gt;Objectives&lt;p&gt;The current study assessed the safety and tolerability of square biphasic pulse shaping (sqBIP) DBS for use in PD.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;This small pilot safety and tolerability study compared sqBiP versus conventional DBS. Nine were enrolled. The safety and tolerability were assessed over a 3-h period on sqBiP. Friedman’s test compared blinded assessments at baseline, washout, and 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, and 3 h post sqBIP.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Biphasic pulses were safe and well tolerated by all participants. SqBiP performed as well as conventional DBS without significant differences in motor scores nor accelerometer or gait measures.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Biphasic pulses were well-tolerated and provided similar benefit to conventional DBS. Further studies should address effectiveness of sqBIP in select PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Do Changes in Language Context Affect Visual Memory in Bilinguals?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00364</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00364</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Language is often present when people are encoding visual memories. For bilinguals, this language context can have different forms (i.e., Language A, Language B, or both Language A and B), and can change over the course of events. The current study examined whether a change in language context during a visual event or between visual events affects a bilingual’s ability to remember visual information. English-Spanish bilinguals and control participants encoded three lists of novel shapes amid different task-irrelevant language contexts. Following each list, participants completed a free recall test in which they drew the novel shapes they remembered. Results indicated that a change in language context between events, but not during events, affected visual memory. Specifically, the switch in language context between the second and third event (such as an English context in list 2 switching to a Spanish context in list 3) produced a reliable memory advantage for the English-Spanish bilinguals (relative to the control participants). The results offer preliminary evidence that task-irrelevant language context can influence a bilingual’s ability to remember non-linguistic information, as well as further evidence for context effects and multi-sensory effects in memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Methodological Issues in the Clinical Validation of Biomarkers for Alzheimer’s Disease: The Paradigmatic Example of CSF</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00282</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00282</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The use of biomarkers is profoundly transforming medical research and practice. Their adoption has triggered major advancements in the field of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) over the past years. For instance, the analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neuroimaging changes indicative of neuronal loss and amyloid deposition has led to the understanding that AD is characterized by a long preclinical phase. It is also supporting the transition towards a biology-grounded framework and definition of the disease. Nevertheless, though sufficient evidence exists about the analytical validity (i.e., accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility) of the candidate AD biomarkers, their clinical validity (i.e., how well the test measures the clinical features, and the disease or treatment outcomes) and clinical utility (i.e., if and how the test improves the patient’s outcomes, confirms/changes the diagnosis, identifies at-risk individuals, influences therapeutic choices) have not been fully proven. In the present review, some of the methodological issues and challenges that should be addressed in order to better appreciate the potential benefits and limitations of AD biomarkers are discussed. The ultimate goal is to stimulate a constructive discussion aimed at filling the existing gaps and more precisely defining the directions of future research. Specifically, four main aspects of the clinical validation process are addressed and applied to the most relevant CSF biomarkers: (1) the definition of reference values; (2) the identification of reference standards for the disease of interest (i.e., AD); (3) the inclusion within the diagnostic process; and (4) the statistical process supporting the whole framework.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Age-Related Reductions in Cerebrovascular Reactivity Using 4D Flow MRI</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00281</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00281</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), is important for determining future risk of cerebrovascular disease. It is unclear if primary aging is associated with reductions in CVR because previous studies often include participants with vascular risk factors. Additionally, the inconsistency in the literature may be due to the inherent difficulty in quantifying intracranial cerebral blood flow and CVR. To address these limitations, we determined the effect of age on CVR in the large intracranial vessels in adults with low vascular risk using state-of-the-art MRI techniques. We also determined if the effect of age on CVR was sex-specific. Young (n = 20; 25 ± 3 years) and older (n = 19; 61 ± 5 years) healthy, physically active adults participated in the study. CVR was measured in response to hypercapnia using 4D flow MRI, which allows for simultaneous angiographic and quantitative blood flow measurements in the intracranial arteries. Older adults had lower global CVR and CVR in multiple intracranial arteries [right and left internal carotid arteries (ICA), right and left middle cerebral arteries (MCA), and basilar artery (BA)] compared with young adults (p &amp;lt; 0.05 for all). In addition, the MCA dilated significantly in response to hypercapnia in young (p &amp;lt; 0.05), but not older adults. Young men demonstrated higher global CVR and CVR in multiple intracranial arteries (ICAs, MCAs, and BA) compared with young women and older men (p &amp;lt; 0.05 for both); however, CVR did not differ between young women and older women. Our results demonstrate that, using 4D flow MRI, primary aging is associated with lower CVR in adults with low vascular risk. In addition, the effect of age on CVR may be driven by men. The 4D flow MRI technique may provide a promising new alternative to measure cerebrovascular physiology without the limitations of commonly used techniques. Future studies could utilize this MRI technique to examine interventions to maintain CVR with advancing age. This study was registered under clinicaltrials.gov # NCT02840851.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Acupuncture Treatment Reverses Retinal Gene Expression Induced by Optic Nerve Injury via RNA Sequencing Analysis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Glaucoma and traumatic optic nerve crush (ONC) injury result in progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and defects in visual function. In clinical trials of Traditional Chinese Medicine, acupuncture has been widely used for the treatment of ocular diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms of acupuncture treatment are still unclear. In this study, we used technique of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to study the effects of acupuncture treatment on retinal transcriptome after axotomy injury. RNA-seq results revealed that 436 genes including 31 transcription factors (TFs) were changed after injury, among them were many well-known neural degeneration related TFs such as Jun, Ddit3, Atf3, and Atf4. Interestingly, acupuncture treatment at acupoint GB20 (Fengchi) significantly reversed a series of differential expressed genes (DEGs) induced by optic nerve injury. While treatments at BL1 (Jingming) or GB20 sham control acupoint-GV16 (Fengfu), led to limited DEG reversal. In contrast, treatments at these two sites further enhanced the trend of DEG expression induced by axotomy injury. At last, retina immunostaining results revealed that only GB20 acupoint treatment increased RGC survival, in consistent with RNA-seq results. Therefore, our study first reported that acupuncture treatment regulated retinal transcriptome and reversed the gene expression induced by axotomy injury, and GB20 acupoint treatment increased RGC survival, which will provide novel therapeutic targets for treatment of ocular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: A Novel Method for Assessing Cerebral Edema, Infarcted Zone and Blood-Brain Barrier Breakdown in a Single Post-stroke Rodent Brain</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stroke is a major cause of global morbidity and mortality. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) has historically been the most common animal model of simulating ischemic stroke. The extent of neurological injury after MCAO is typically measured by cerebral edema, infarct zone, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. A significant limitation of these methods is that separate sets of brains must be used for each measurement. Here we examine an alternative method of measuring cerebral edema, infarct zone and BBB permeability following MCAO in the same set of brain samples. Ninety-six rats were randomly divided into three experimental groups. Group 1 (n = 27) was used for the evaluation of infarct zone and brain edema in rats post-MCAO (n = 17) vs. sham-operated controls (n = 10). Group 2 (n = 27) was used for the evaluation of BBB breakdown in rats post-MCAO (n = 15) vs. sham-operated controls (n = 10). In Group 3 (n = 42), all three parameters were measured in the same set of brain slices in rats post-MCAO (n = 26) vs. sham-operated controls (n = 16). The effect of Evans blue on the accuracy of measuring infarct zone by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining was determined by measuring infarct zone with and without an applied blue filter. The effects of various concentrations of TTC (0, 0.05, 0.35, 0.5, 1, and 2%) on the accuracy of measuring BBB permeability was also assessed. There was an increase in infarct volume (p &amp;lt; 0.01), brain edema (p &amp;lt; 0.01) and BBB breakdown (p &amp;lt; 0.01) in rats following MCAO compared to sham-operated controls, whether measured separately or together in the same set of brain samples. Evans blue had an effect on measuring infarct volume that was minimized by the application of a blue filter on scanned brain slices. There was no difference in the Evans blue extravasation index for the brain tissue samples without TTC compared to brain tissue samples incubated in TTC. Our results demonstrate that measuring cerebral edema, infarct zone and BBB permeability following MCAO can accurately be measured in the same set of brain samples.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Prediction and Classification of Alzheimer’s Disease Based on Combined Features From Apolipoprotein-E Genotype, Cerebrospinal Fluid, MR, and FDG-PET Imaging Biomarkers</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00072</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD), including its mild cognitive impairment (MCI) phase that may or may not progress into the AD, is the most ordinary form of dementia. It is extremely important to correctly identify patients during the MCI stage because this is the phase where AD may or may not develop. Thus, it is crucial to predict outcomes during this phase. Thus far, many researchers have worked on only using a single modality of a biomarker for the diagnosis of AD or MCI. Although recent studies show that a combination of one or more different biomarkers may provide complementary information for the diagnosis, it also increases the classification accuracy distinguishing between different groups. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning-based framework to discriminate subjects with AD or MCI utilizing a combination of four different biomarkers: fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein levels, and Apolipoprotein-E (APOE) genotype. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) baseline dataset was used in this study. In total, there were 158 subjects for whom all four modalities of biomarker were available. Of the 158 subjects, 38 subjects were in the AD group, 82 subjects were in MCI groups (including 46 in MCIc [MCI converted; conversion to AD within 24 months of time period], and 36 in MCIs [MCI stable; no conversion to AD within 24 months of time period]), and the remaining 38 subjects were in the healthy control (HC) group. For each image, we extracted 246 regions of interest (as features) using the Brainnetome template image and NiftyReg toolbox, and later we combined these features with three CSF and two APOE genotype features obtained from the ADNI website for each subject using early fusion technique. Here, a different kernel-based multiclass support vector machine (SVM) classifier with a grid-search method was applied. Before passing the obtained features to the classifier, we have used truncated singular value decomposition (Truncated SVD) dimensionality reduction technique to reduce high dimensional features into a lower-dimensional feature. As a result, our combined method achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AU-ROC) curve of 98.33, 93.59, 96.83, 94.64, 96.43, and 95.24% for AD vs. HC, MCIs vs. MCIc, AD vs. MCIs, AD vs. MCIc, HC vs. MCIc, and HC vs. MCIs subjects which are high relative to single modality results and other state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, combined multimodal methods have improved the classification performance over the unimodal classification.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Entorhinal Layer II Calbindin-Expressing Neurons Originate Widespread Telencephalic and Intrinsic Projections</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the present study we provide the first systematic and quantitative hodological study of the calbindin-expressing (CB+) principal neurons in layer II of the entorhinal cortex and compared the respective projections of the lateral and medial subdivisions of the entorhinal cortex. Using elaborate quantitative retrograde tracing, complemented by anterograde tracing, we report that the layer II CB+ population comprises neurons with diverse, mainly excitatory projections. At least half of them originate local intrinsic and commissural projections which distribute mainly to layer I and II. We further show that long-range CB+ projections from the two entorhinal subdivisions differ substantially in that MEC projections mainly target field CA1 of the hippocampus, whereas LEC CB+ projections distribute much more widely to a substantial number of known forebrain targets. This connectional difference between the CB+ populations in LEC and MEC is reminiscent of the overall projection pattern of the two entorhinal subdivisions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Rapid detection of sensory changes is important for survival. We have previously used change-related cortical responses to study the change detection system and found that the generation of a change-related response was based on sensory memory and comparison processes. However, it remains unclear whether change-related cortical responses reflect processing speed. In the present study, we simultaneously recorded the auditory steady-state response (ASSR) and change-related response using magnetoencephalography to investigate the acceleration effects of sensory change events. Overall, 13 healthy human subjects (four females and nine males) completed an oddball paradigm with a sudden change in sound pressure used as the test stimulus, i.e., the control stimulus was a train of 25-ms pure tones at 75 dB for 1,200 ms, whereas the 29th sound at 700 ms of the test stimulus was replaced with a 90-dB tone. Thereafter, we compared the latency of ASSR among four probabilities of test stimulus (0, 25, 75, and 100%). For both the control and test stimulus, stronger effects of acceleration on ASSR were observed when the stimulus was rarer. This finding indicates that ASSR and change-related cortical response depend on physical changes as well as sensory memory and comparison processes. ASSR was modulated without changes in peripheral inputs, and brain areas higher than the primary cortex could be involved in exerting acceleration effects. Furthermore, the reduced latency of ASSR clearly indicated that a new sensory event increased the speed of ongoing sensory processing. Therefore, changes in the latency of ASSR are a sensitive index of accelerated processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Estimating the Readily-Releasable Vesicle Pool Size at Synaptic Connections in the Neocortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Previous studies based on the ‘Quantal Model’ for synaptic transmission suggest that neurotransmitter release is mediated by a single release site at individual synaptic contacts in the neocortex. However, recent studies seem to contradict this hypothesis and indicate that multi-vesicular release (MVR) could better explain the synaptic response variability observed in vitro. In this study we present a novel method to estimate the number of release sites per synapse, also known as the size of the readily releasable pool (N&lt;sub&gt;RRP&lt;/sub&gt;), from paired whole-cell recordings of connections between layer 5 thick tufted pyramidal cell (L5_TTPC) in the juvenile rat somatosensory cortex. Our approach extends the work of Loebel et al. (2009) by leveraging a recently published data-driven biophysical model of neocortical tissue. Using this approach, we estimated N&lt;sub&gt;RRP&lt;/sub&gt; to be between two to three for synaptic connections between L5_TTPCs. To constrain N&lt;sub&gt;RRP&lt;/sub&gt; values for other connections in the microcircuit, we developed and validated a generalization approach using published data on the coefficient of variation (CV) of the amplitudes of post-synaptic potentials (PSPs) from literature and comparing them against in silico experiments. Our study predicts that transmitter release at synaptic connections in the neocortex could be mediated by MVR and provides a data-driven approach to constrain the MVR model parameters in the microcircuit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Gradient of Expression of Dopamine D2 Receptors Along the Dorso-Ventral Axis of the Hippocampus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2019.00028</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2019.00028</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dopamine D2-like receptors (D2R) play an important role in the regulation of hippocampal neuronal excitability and contribute to the regulation of synaptic plasticity, the encoding of hippocampus-dependent memories and the regulation of affective state. In line with this, D2R are targeted in the treatment of psychosis and affective disorders. It has been proposed that the dorso-ventral axis of the hippocampus can be functionally delineated into the dorsal pole that predominantly processes spatial information and the ventral pole that mainly addresses hippocampal processing of emotional and affective state. Although dopaminergic control of hippocampal information processing has been the focus of a multitude of studies, very little is known about the precise distribution of D2R both within anatomically defined sublayers of the hippocampus and along its dorsoventral axis, that could in turn yield insights as to the functional significance of this receptor in supporting hippocampal processing of spatial and affective information. Here, we used an immunohistochemical approach to precisely scrutinize the protein expression of D2R both within the cellular and dendritic layers of the hippocampal subfields, and along the dorso-ventral hippocampal axis. In general, we detected significantly higher levels of protein expression of D2R in the ventral, compared to the dorsal poles with regard to the CA1, CA2, CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) regions. Effects were very consistent: the molecular layer, granule cell layer and polymorphic layer of the DG exhibited higher D2R levels in the ventral compared to dorsal hippocampus. D2R levels were also significantly higher in the ventral Stratum oriens, Stratum radiatum, and Stratum lacunosum-moleculare layers of the CA1 and CA3 regions. The apical dendrites of the ventral CA2 region also exhibited higher D2R expression compared to the dorsal pole. Taken together, our study suggests that the higher D2R expression levels of the ventral hippocampus may contribute to reported gradients in the degree of expression of synaptic plasticity along the dorso-ventral hippocampal axis, and may support behavioral information processing by the ventral hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Selective Functional Interaction Between the Lateral Habenula and Hippocampus During Different Tests of Response Flexibility</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00245</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00245</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The lateral habenula (LHb) has been shown to play critical roles in a variety of appetitive tasks (e.g., spatial memory and object recognition) that require animals to flexibly respond to changing task conditions. These types of tasks are known to be dependent on hippocampus (HPC) and/or medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), suggesting that the LHb contributes to the limbic memory circuit. Here we provide new evidence that the LHb and HPC play distinct but complimentary roles in tasks that require flexible responding to changing task conditions. Experiment 1 tested whether the LHb is needed for the performance of a HPC-dependent maze-based spatial delayed alternation task. The importance of interactions between the LHb and HPC to accomplish the same spatial delayed alternation task was tested in Experiment 2 where the LHb and HPC were disconnected both ipsilaterally and contralaterally. Experiment 3 tested LHb’s involvement in a standard behavioral economic task that requires flexible responding (maze-based delayed discounting), a task previously shown to rely on HPC. Results of Experiment 1, revealed that LHb inactivation impairs spatial delayed alternation during asymptotic performance but not during initial learning. Importantly, working memory did not appear to be affected as performance remained above chance levels both during initial learning and asymptotic testing. Experiment 2 showed that ipsilateral and contralateral disconnection of the LHb and HPC led to impaired performance on the spatial delayed alternation task. Impairments were not observed after unilateral inactivation of only one structure. Results of Experiment 3 were similar to our previous report of the effects of HPC inactivation: LHb inactivation impaired delayed discounting. All effects could not be accounted for by changes in reward magnitude discrimination, reward location per se, or sex of the animal. These findings, combined with other recent publications confirms and extends our working hypothesis that the LHb enables adaptive and flexible responding, particularly when established rules must be flexibly applied on a trial by trial basis. Since there are no known direct anatomical connections between LHb and HPC, future research is needed to understand how these structures communicate to enable flexible and rapid responding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Prenatal Ozone Exposure Induces Memory Deficiencies in Newborns Rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00244</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Air pollution is fully acknowledged to represent a major public health issue. Toxic environmental substances, such as ozone, interfere with prenatal development. Animals exposed to ozone (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) in utero develop biochemical and morphological alterations. This gas has been proven to decrease cognitive capacity in different species. In the present study, we assessed the possible alterations in memory and spatial learning in the offspring of female rats who were exposed to 1.0 ppm of O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; embryonic development. Two instruments were used to evaluate possible alterations: the T-maze and a Skinner box. MAPK, ERK, p-ERK, and NR2B proteins, which are widely regarded as responsible for the learning process in the hippocampus and cortex, were also assessed by immunohistochemistry. We found that male rats exposed to O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;in utero displayed a significant delay to reach the correct response using the spatial learning test as compared to the control group. The female rats exposed to O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; showed a significant delay to reach the correct response as compared to the female control group in the Skinner box. We also found that while the male rats showed decrease in significant differences in the expression of NR2B, ERK and increase in MAPK. Females only showed increase in MAPK, p-ERK and decrease in ERK, when compared to their respective control group. It is possible that the deficits are associated to hormonal expression, inflammation and oxidative stress alterations. In summary, these results suggest that exposure to O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can interfere with prenatal development, resulting in learning and memory deficiencies in rats.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Nuclear Tau, p53 and Pin1 Regulate PARN-Mediated Deadenylation and Gene Expression</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00242</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00242</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;While nuclear tau plays a role in DNA damage response (DDR) and chromosome relaxation, the mechanisms behind these functions are not fully understood. Here, we show that tau forms complex(es) with factors involved in nuclear mRNA processing such as tumor suppressor p53 and poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) deadenylase. Tau induces PARN activity in different cellular models during DDR, and this activation is further increased by p53 and inhibited by tau phosphorylation at residues implicated in neurological disorders. Tau’s binding factor Pin1, a mitotic regulator overexpressed in cancer and depleted in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), also plays a role in the activation of nuclear deadenylation. Tau, Pin1 and PARN target the expression of mRNAs deregulated in AD and/or cancer. Our findings identify novel biological roles of tau and toxic effects of hyperphosphorylated-tau. We propose a model in which factors involved in cancer and AD regulate gene expression by interactions with the mRNA processing machinery, affecting the transcriptome and suggesting insights into alternative mechanisms for the initiation and/or developments of these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Does Electroacupuncture Have Different Effects on Peripheral and Central Sensitization in Humans: A Randomized Controlled Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00061</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00061</link>
	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Acupuncture is used to reduce chronic musculoskeletal pain. The common mechanism underlying these types of pain are peripheral and/or central sensitization. In the clinical setting, it is difficult to separate the peripheral from the central component of pain. Heat/capsaicin 45°C/0.075%-induced hyperalgesia provides a stable, human central sensitization model in which the peripheral component is also assessed.&lt;/p&gt;Aim&lt;p&gt;This randomized, sham-controlled study aimed to investigate the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on the severity of heat (peripheral sensitization) and mechanical hyperalgesia (central sensitization) in a heat/capsaicin pain model in humans.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Twenty-six healthy young participants (24 ± 3.9 years) were recruited. After baseline assessment, heat/capsaicin 45°C/0.075% was applied to the non-dominant forearm to induce hyperalgesia. The primary outcome measures were the size of the area of mechanical hyperalgesia, intensity of pain to heat stimulation and heat pain thresholds. The intensity of pain was recorded using modified 10-cm visual analogues scales (VAS). Participants were assessed at 70 min after the initial application of capsaicin then randomly allocated to receive either real electroacupuncture (REA, n = 14) or sham non-invasive EA (SEA, n = 12) for 30 min. The main outcome measures were assessed again immediately and then 90 min following EA. Credibility of blinding was assessed. Data were analyzed with t-tests or analysis of variance (ANOVA) where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;After the model was established, the area of mechanical hyperalgesia was formed (55.64 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), as was heat hyperalgesia, as the rating to heat stimulation, increased from 2/10 to 6/10. The REA and SEA groups were comparable. Immediately after the allocated acupuncture treatment, the rating to heat stimulation was statistically significantly lower in the REA group (2.94 ± 1.64) than in the SEA group (4.62 ± 2.26) (p &amp;lt; 0.05). The area of mechanical hyperalgesia reduced significantly without any group difference. No group difference was detected in heat pain threshold. Blinding of the participants was successful.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Peripheral and central sensitization in the heat/capsaicin 45°C/0.075% model responded to EA differently, suggesting that acupuncture analgesia could vary, depending on the types of pain. This observation may explain some inconsistent findings from clinical trials of acupuncture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A possible framework to characterize nervous system dynamics and its organization in conscious and unconscious states is introduced, derived from a high level perspective on the coordinated activity of brain cell ensembles. Some questions are best addressable in a global framework and here we build on past observations about the structure of configurations of brain networks in conscious and unconscious states and about neurophysiological results. Aiming to bind some results together into some sort of coherence with a central theme, the scenario that emerges underscores the crucial importance of the creation and dissipation of energy gradients in brain cellular ensembles resulting in maximization of the configurations in the functional connectivity among those networks that favor conscious awareness and healthy conditions. These considerations are then applied to indicate approaches that can be used to improve neuropathological syndromes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Systemic and Intravitreal Antagonism of the TNFR1 Signaling Pathway Delays Axotomy-Induced Retinal Ganglion Cell Loss</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Here, we have blocked the signaling pathway of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) in a mouse model of traumatic neuropathy using a small cell permeable molecule (R7050) that inhibits TNFα/TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) complex internalization. Adult pigmented mice were subjected to intraorbital optic nerve crush (ONC). Animals received daily intraperitoneal injections of R7050, and/or a single intravitreal administration the day of the surgery. Some animals received a combinatorial treatment with R7050 (systemic or local) and a single intravitreal injection of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). As controls, untreated animals were used. Retinas were analyzed for RGC survival 5 and 14 days after the lesion i.e., during the quick and slow phase of axotomy-induced RGC death. qPCR analyses were done to verify that Tnfr1 and TNFα were up-regulated after ONC. At 5 days post-lesion, R7050 intravitreal or systemic treatment neuroprotected RGCs as much as BDNF alone. At 14 days, RGC rescue by systemic or intravitreal administration of R7050 was similar. At this time point, intravitreal treatment with BDNF was significantly better than intravitreal R7050. Combinatory treatment was not better than BDNF alone, although at both time points, the mean number of surviving RGCs was higher. In conclusion, antagonism of the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis rescues axotomized RGCs as it does the activation of survival pathways by BDNF. However, manipulation of both pathways at the same time, does not improve RGC survival.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;People could behave in two different ways when engaging in interpersonal coordination activities: moving at the same frequency (isofrequency pattern, IP; the movement frequency ratio is 1:1) or at different frequencies (multifrequency pattern, MP; the movement frequency ratio is non 1:1). However, how the interpersonal coordination pattern modulates coordination outcome and the related brain-to-brain connectivity is not fully understood. Here, we adopted a continuous joint drawing task in which two participants co-drew parallelogram shapes according to two coordination patterns (i.e., IP vs. MP) while their brain activities were simultaneously recorded by the functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) based hyperscanning technique. Dyads showed better coordination performance, as well as relatively greater interpersonal brain synchronization (IBS) at the left frontopolar area, in the MP condition compared to the IP condition. Granger causality analyses further disclosed the bidirectional influences between the brains of the coordinating individuals. Such interpersonal influences were enhanced when individuals coordinated in the MP condition. Finally, the IBS during coordination was related to the dyadic self-control level. Taken together, our study revealed that interpersonal multifrequency coordination pattern facilitates the coordination efficiency, which was associated with the enhanced brain-to-brain connectivity. Our work also suggests the potentially positive role of self-control during the interpersonal coordination process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Unidirectional Synchronization of Hodgkin-Huxley Neurons With Prescribed Performance Under Transcranial Magneto-Acoustical Simulation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper exploits the unidirectional synchronization dynamics of two Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neurons under transcranial magneto-acoustical stimulation (TMAS). The major purpose is to explore a control scheme to make the spiking modes of the neural potentials stimulated by TMAS achieve synchronization states under the feedback input. For this purpose, an adaptive neural controller, which makes the neurons satisfy the prescribed master-slaver synchronization performance, is designed by introducing a tracking error into Lyapunov analysis. Under the proposed control scheme, the slaver neuron can not only overcome the model uncertainties and the difficulties brought by prescribed performance, but also track the spiking patterns of the master neuron. Finally, the simulations are implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller, that is, the TMAS induced synchronization states of the HH neuron system can achieve the prescribed performance under the proposed controller.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent findings suggest an implication of the gut microbiome in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients. PD onset and progression has also been linked with various environmental factors such as physical activity, exposure to pesticides, head injury, nicotine, and dietary factors. In this study, we used a mouse model, overexpressing the complete human SNCA gene (SNCA-TG mice) modeling familial and sporadic forms of PD to study whether environmental conditions such as standard vs. enriched environment changes the gut microbiome and influences disease progression. We performed 16S rRNA DNA sequencing on fecal samples for microbiome analysis and studied fecal inflammatory calprotectin from the colon of control and SNCA-TG mice kept under standard environment (SE) and enriched environment (EE) conditions. The overall composition of the gut microbiota was not changed in SNCA-TG mice compared with WT in EE with respect to SE. However, individual gut bacteria at genus level such as Lactobacillus sp. was a significant changed in the SNCA-TG mice. EE significantly reduced colon fecal inflammatory calprotectin protein in WT and SNCA-TG EE compared to SE. Moreover, EE reduces the pro-inflammatory cytokines in the feces and inflammation inducing genes in the colon. Our data suggest that an enriched social environment has a positive effect on the induction of SNCA mediated inflammation in the intestine and by modulating anti-inflammatory gut bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: The Dmipy Toolbox: Diffusion MRI Multi-Compartment Modeling and Microstructure Recovery Made Easy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00064</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Non-invasive estimation of brain microstructure features using diffusion MRI (dMRI)—known as Microstructure Imaging—has become an increasingly diverse and complicated field over the last decades. Multi-compartment (MC)-models, representing the measured diffusion signal as a linear combination of signal models of distinct tissue types, have been developed in many forms to estimate these features. However, a generalized implementation of MC-modeling as a whole, providing deeper insights in its capabilities, remains missing. To address this fact, we present Diffusion Microstructure Imaging in Python (Dmipy), an open-source toolbox implementing PGSE-based MC-modeling in its most general form. Dmipy allows on-the-fly implementation, signal modeling, and optimization of any user-defined MC-model, for any PGSE acquisition scheme. Dmipy follows a “building block”-based philosophy to Microstructure Imaging, meaning MC-models are modularly constructed to include any number and type of tissue models, allowing simultaneous representation of a tissue's diffusivity, orientation, volume fractions, axon orientation dispersion, and axon diameter distribution. In particular, Dmipy is geared toward facilitating reproducible, reliable MC-modeling pipelines, often allowing the whole process from model construction to parameter map recovery in fewer than 10 lines of code. To demonstrate Dmipy's ease of use and potential, we implement a wide range of well-known MC-models, including IVIM, AxCaliber, NODDI(x), Bingham-NODDI, the spherical mean-based SMT and MC-MDI, and spherical convolution-based single- and multi-tissue CSD. By allowing parameter cascading between MC-models, Dmipy also facilitates implementation of advanced approaches like CSD with voxel-varying kernels and single-shell 3-tissue CSD. By providing a well-tested, user-friendly toolbox that simplifies the interaction with the otherwise complicated field of dMRI-based Microstructure Imaging, Dmipy contributes to more reproducible, high-quality research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Disruption of Wnt signaling has been implicated in dysfunctional synaptic plasticity, the degree of which correlates with Alzheimer’s disease severity. We sought to examine whether serum levels of Dickkopf-1 (Dkk-1), a Wnt antagonist, are associated with global disease progression in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild-to-moderate AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We prospectively followed 88 older adults with MCI and mild-to-moderate AD attending a Memory Clinic. Cognitive performance, functional performance and neuropsychological symptoms were assessed at baseline and after 1 year. We reviewed neuroimaging for white matter changes and medial temporal atrophy, and performed ApoE genotyping at baseline. Serum Dkk-1 was assayed at baseline and 1 year, along with blood biomarkers of inflammation and endocrine dysfunction. We defined global disease progression (“progressors”) as an increase in Clinical Dementia Rating Sum-of-Boxes (CDR-SB) score by &amp;gt;2 points at 1 year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Fifteen (17.0%) participants had global disease progression. At baseline, there was no difference in cognitive performance and neuropsychiatric symptoms between groups, although progressors were more impaired in instrumental activities of daily living (p = 0.008). Progressors had significantly greater deterioration in cognitive performance (p = 0.002), with significantly worse functional performance and more severe neuropsychiatric symptoms (p = 0.042) at follow-up. Serum inflammatory and endocrine biomarkers at baseline and 1 year were similar between progressors and non-progressors. Serum Dkk-1 had increased significantly from baseline amongst progressors, while non-progressors exhibited decremental Dkk-1 over time (Dkk-1&lt;sub&gt;change&lt;/sub&gt;: 354.304 ± 670.467 vs. −173.582 ± 535.676 ng/ml, p = 0.001). Adjusting for age, gender and baseline cognitive performance, incremental Dkk-1 independently predicted global cognitive decline (p = 0.012).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our results suggest progressively dysfunctional Wnt signaling through Dkk-1 antagonism contributes to disease progression amongst older adults with MCI and mild-moderate AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Alterations of Regional Homogeneity in Parkinson’s Disease Patients With Freezing of Gait: A Resting-State fMRI Study</title>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;The purposes of this study are to investigate the regional homogeneity (ReHo) of spontaneous brain activities in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients with freeze of gait (FOG) and to investigate the neural correlation of movement function through resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A total of 35 normal controls (NC), 33 PD patients with FOG (FOG+), and 35 PD patients without FOG (FOG−) were enrolled. ReHo was applied to evaluate the regional synchronization of spontaneous brain activities. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed on ReHo maps of the three groups, followed by post hoc two-sample t-tests between every two groups. Moreover, the ReHo signals of FOG+ and FOG− were extracted across the whole brain and correlated with movement scores (FOGQ, FOG questionnaire; GFQ, gait and falls questionnaire).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Significant ReHo differences were observed in the left cerebrum. Compared to NC subjects, the ReHo of PD subjects was increased in the left angular gyrus (AG) and decreased in the left rolandic operculum/postcentral gyrus (Rol/PostC), left inferior opercular-frontal cortex, left middle occipital gyrus, and supramarginal gyrus (SMG). Compared to that of FOG−, the ReHo of FOG+ was increased in the left caudate and decreased in the left Rol/PostC. Within the significant regions, the ReHo of FOG+ was negatively correlated with FOGQ in the left SMG/PostC (r = −0.39, p &amp;lt; 0.05). Negative correlations were also observed between ReHo and GFQ/FOGQ (r = −0.36/−0.38, p &amp;lt; 0.05) in the left superior temporal gyrus (STG) of the whole brain analysis based on AAL templates.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The ReHo analysis suggested that the regional signal synchronization of brain activities in FOG+ subjects was most active in the left caudate and most hypoactive in the left Rol/PostC. It also indicated that ReHo in the left caudate and left Rol/PostC was critical for discriminating the three groups. The correlation between ReHo and movement scores (GFQ/FOGQ) in the STG has the potential to differentiate FOG+ from FOG−. This study provided new insight into the understanding of PD with and without FOG.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Spontaneous Thought as an Unconstrained Memory Process</title>

	<description>The stream of thought can flow freely, without much guidance from attention or cognitive control. What determines what we think about from one moment to the next? Spontaneous thought shares many commonalities with memory processes. We use insights from computational models of memory to explain how the stream of thought flows through the landscape of memory. In this framework of spontaneous thought, semantic memory scaffolds episodic memory to form the content of thought, and drifting context modulated by one's current state – both internal and external – constrains the area of memory to explore.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Functional Connectivity Patterns and the Role of 5-HTTLPR Polymorphism on Network Architecture in Female Patients With Anorexia Nervosa</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01056</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01056</link>
	<description>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Recent neuroimaging studies suggest that anorexia nervosa (AN) symptoms emerge from failures in the relationships between spatially distributed networks that support different cognitive, emotional, and somatosensory functions. The 5-HTTLPR genotype has been shown to modulate all these abilities in AN, as well as the connectivity patterns between brain regions that support their functioning. This study aims at exploring the presence of any difference in functional connectome properties between AN patients and healthy controls (HC) by means of graph theory tools. The effect of 5-HTTLPR genotype on regional and global network characteristics in AN and HC was also explored.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A sample of 74 subjects (38 HC, 36 AN) underwent a resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging and was genotyped for 5-HTTLPR polymorphism. Comparisons of network properties were made between the AN and HC groups and, within each group, between 5-HTTLPR carriers of low-functioning alleles and carriers of the long–long genotype.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Patients with AN displayed lower network clustering than HC (p = 0.04 at Mann–Whitney U test). Based on both degree and betweenness, a different distribution of network hubs emerged in the two groups. In particular, the anterior part of the anterior cingulate cortex was a hub only in the patient group. A correlation emerged between differences in brain volumes between patients and HC and differences in degree values of basal ganglia, nodes in the insula, and those in the parietal cortex. Carriers of the short allele of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism were characterized by lower small-world properties (p = 0.027) and modularity (p = 0.031) in the patient group, and a trend toward higher modularity (p = 0.033) and small-world values (p = 0.123) in the HC group.&lt;/p&gt;Discussion&lt;p&gt;Patients with AN showed differences in hubs distribution, providing evidence of the presence of a different functional architectural backbone in this group. Since some correlation emerged between different degree values of nodes and differences in volumes, further longitudinal studies are warranted to better understand the role of malnutrition on brain network architecture. The opposite effects of 5-HTTLPR polymorphism on global network characteristics in the two groups suggest an interaction of the short allele and malnutrition in modulating brain network properties.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Quantitative Proteomic and Network Analysis of Differentially Expressed Proteins in PBMC of Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA) Patients</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01054</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded (GAA) trinucleotide repeat in the FXN gene. The extended repeats expansion results in reduced transcription and, thereby, decreased expression of the mitochondrial protein, frataxin. Given the ongoing drug trials, identification of reliable and easily accessible biomarkers for monitoring disease progression and therapeutic intervention is a foremost requirement. In this study, comparative proteomic profiling of PBMC proteins from FRDA patients and age- and gender-matched healthy controls was done using 2D-Differential in-Gel Electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). Protein–protein interaction (PPI) was analyzed using BioGRID and STRING pathway analysis tools. Using biological variance analysis (BVA) and LC/MS, we found eight differentially expressed proteins with fold change ≥1.5; p ≤ 0.05. Based on their cellular function, the identified proteins showed a strong pathological role in neuroinflammation, cardiomyopathy, compromised glucose metabolism, and iron transport, which are the major clinical manifestations of FRDA. Protein–protein network analysis of differentially expressed proteins with frataxin further supports their involvement in the pathophysiology of FRDA. Considering their crucial role in the cardiac and neurological complications, respectively, the two down-regulated proteins, actin α cardiac muscle 1 (ACTC1) and pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit β (PDHE1), are suggested as potential prognostic markers for FRDA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Anatomy and Physiology of Neurons in Layer 9 of the Chicken Optic Tectum</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00063</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00063</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Visual information in birds is to great extent processed in the optic tectum (TeO), a prominent laminated midbrain structure. Retinal input enters the TeO in its superficial layers, while output is limited to intermediate and deeper layers. In addition to visual information, the TeO receives multimodal input from the auditory and somatosensory pathway. The TeO gives rise to a major ascending tectofugal projection where neurons of tectal layer 13 project to the thalamic nucleus rotundus, which then projects to the entopallium. A second tectofugal projection system, called the accessory pathway, has however not been studied as thoroughly. Again, cells of tectal layer 13 form an ascending projection that targets a nucleus known as either the caudal part of the nucleus dorsolateralis posterior of the thalamus (DLPc) or nucleus uveaformis (Uva). This nucleus is known for multimodal integration and receives additional input from the lateral pontine nucleus (PL), which in turn receives projections from layer 8–15 of the TeO. Here, we studied a particular cell type afferent to the PL that consists of radially oriented neurons in layer 9. We characterized these neurons with respect to their anatomy, their retinal input, and the modulation of retinal input by local circuits. We found that comparable to other radial neurons in the tectum, cells of layer 9 have columnar dendritic fields and reach up to layer 2. Sholl analysis demonstrated that dendritic arborization concentrates on retinorecipient layers 2 and 4, with additional arborization in layers 9 and 10. All neurons recorded in layer 9 received retinal input via glutamatergic synapses. We analyzed the influence of modulatory circuits of the TeO by application of antagonists to γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and acetylcholine (ACh). Our data show that the neurons of layer 9 are integrated in a network under strong GABAergic inhibition, which is controlled by local cholinergic activation. Output to the PL and to the accessory tectofugal pathway thus appears to be under strict control of local tectal networks, the relevance of which for multimodal integration is discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Microglial inflammation is often seen as a secondary event in neurodegeneration. A recent study by Song et al. demonstrates that loss of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) activates microglia through the cytosolic DNA sensor STING. This highlights the ability of microglia to recognize and respond to self-DNA, with potentially neurotoxic consequences.</description>

	<description>It is generally accepted that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has one continuous lumen and operates as one unified Ca2+ store, but new data from Chen-Engerer et al. in hippocampal neurons now challenge this idea and indicate that receptors for inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and ryanodine may be located in two functionally distinct Ca2+ stores.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Circulating miRNAs, Small but Promising Biomarkers for Autism Spectrum Disorder</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00253</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) refers to a heterogeneous group of complex neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by social skill and communication deficits, along with stereotyped repetitive behavior. miRNAs, small non-coding RNAs that have been recognized as critical regulators of gene expression, play a key role in the neurodevelopmental transcriptional networks of the human brain. Previous investigations have proven that circulating miRNAs open up new possibilities for the emerging roles of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in human disorders and diseases. Biomarker development has been progressively becoming more recognized as a cornerstone in medical diagnosis, paving the way to drug discoveries and limiting the progression of various diseases. Due to the complexity of ASD, considerable endeavors have either unsuccessfully identified biomarkers for the disorder or have not yet been established. Cell-free circulating miRNAs in biofluids are extraordinarily stable and considered to represent the next-generation of clinical, non-invasive, biomarkers for many pathologies including neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we conducted a review of all peer-reviewed articles addressing the circulating profiles of miRNAs, mostly performed in serum and saliva samples in individuals with ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Orphan Cytokine Receptor CRLF3 Emerged With the Origin of the Nervous System and Is a Neuroprotective Erythropoietin Receptor in Locusts</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00251</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00251</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The orphan cytokine receptor-like factor 3 (CRLF3) was identified as a neuroprotective erythropoietin receptor in locust neurons and emerged with the evolution of the eumetazoan nervous system. Human CRLF3 belongs to class I helical cytokine receptors that mediate pleiotropic cellular reactions to injury and diverse physiological challenges. It is expressed in various tissues including the central nervous system but its ligand remains unidentified. A CRLF3 ortholog in the holometabolous beetle Tribolium castaneum was recently shown to induce anti-apoptotic mechanisms upon stimulation with human recombinant erythropoietin. To test the hypothesis that CRLF3 represents an ancient cell-protective receptor for erythropoietin-like cytokines, we investigated its presence across metazoan species. Furthermore, we examined CRLF3 expression and function in the hemimetabolous insect Locusta migratoria. Phylogenetic analysis of CRLF3 sequences indicated that CRLF3 is absent in Porifera, Placozoa and Ctenophora, all lacking the traditional nervous system. However, it is present in all major eumetazoan groups ranging from cnidarians over protostomians to mammals. The CRLF3 sequence is highly conserved and abundant amongst vertebrates. In contrast, relatively few invertebrates express CRLF3 and these sequences show greater variability, suggesting frequent loss due to low functional importance. In L. migratoria, we identified the transcript Lm-crlf3 by RACE-PCR and detected its expression in locust brain, skeletal muscle and hemocytes. These findings correspond to the ubiquitous expression of crlf3 in mammalian tissues. We demonstrate that the sole addition of double-stranded RNA to the culture medium (called soaking RNA interference) specifically interferes with protein expression in locust primary brain cell cultures. This technique was used to knock down Lm-crlf3 expression and to abolish its physiological function. We confirmed that recombinant human erythropoietin rescues locust brain neurons from hypoxia-induced apoptosis and showed that this neuroprotective effect is absent after knocking down Lm-crlf3. Our results affirm the erythropoietin-induced neuroprotective function of CRLF3 in a second insect species from a different taxonomic group. They suggest that the phylogenetically conserved CRLF3 receptor may function as a cell protective receptor for erythropoietin or a structurally related cytokine also in other animals including vertebrate and mammalian species.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: NGL-1/LRRC4C-Mutant Mice Display Hyperactivity and Anxiolytic-Like Behavior Associated With Widespread Suppression of Neuronal Activity</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Netrin-G ligand-1 (NGL-1), encoded by Lrrc4c, is a post-synaptic adhesion molecule implicated in various brain disorders, including bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and developmental delay. Although previous studies have explored the roles of NGL-1 in the regulation of synapse development and function, the importance of NGL-1 for specific behaviors and the nature of related neural circuits in mice remain unclear. Here, we report that mice lacking NGL-1 (Lrrc4c&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;) show strong hyperactivity and anxiolytic-like behavior. They also display impaired spatial and working memory, but normal object-recognition memory and social interaction. c-Fos staining under baseline and anxiety-inducing conditions revealed suppressed baseline neuronal activity as well as limited neuronal activation in widespread brain regions, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), motor cortex, endopiriform nucleus, bed nuclei of the stria terminalis, and dentate gyrus. Neurons in the ACC, motor cortex, and dentate gyrus exhibit distinct alterations in excitatory synaptic transmission and intrinsic neuronal excitability. These results suggest that NGL-1 is important for normal locomotor activity, anxiety-like behavior, and learning and memory, as well as synapse properties and excitability of neurons in widespread brain regions under baseline and anxiety-inducing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: A Safe and Effective Magnetic Labeling Protocol for MRI-Based Tracking of Human Adult Neural Stem Cells</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a unique tool for in vivo visualization and tracking of stem cells in the brain. This is of particular importance when assessing safety of experimental cell treatments in the preclinical or clinical setup. Yet, specific imaging requires an efficient and non-perturbing cellular magnetic labeling which precludes adverse effects of the tag, e.g., the impact of iron-oxide-nanoparticles on the critical differentiation and integration processes of the respective stem cell population investigated. In this study we investigated the effects of very small superparamagnetic iron oxide particle (VSOP) labeling on viability, stemness, and neuronal differentiation potential of primary human adult neural stem cells (haNSCs). Cytoplasmic VSOP incorporation massively reduced the transverse relaxation time T2, an important parameter determining MR contrast. Cells retained cytoplasmic label for at least a month, indicating stable incorporation, a necessity for long-term imaging. Using a clinical 3T MRI, 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; haNSCs were visualized upon injection in a gel phantom, but detection limit was much lower (5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; cells) in layer phantoms and using an imaging protocol feasible in a clinical scenario. Transcriptional analysis and fluorescence immunocytochemistry did not reveal a detrimental impact of VSOP labeling on important parameters of cellular physiology with cellular viability, stemness and neuronal differentiation potential remaining unaffected. This represents a pivotal prerequisite with respect to clinical application of this method.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sleep is a complex and dynamic process for maintaining homeostasis, and a lack of sleep can disrupt whole-body functioning. No organ is as vulnerable to the loss of sleep as the brain. Accordingly, we examined a set of task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data by using graph theory to assess brain topological changes in subjects in a state of chronic sleep restriction, and then identified diurnal variability in the graph-theoretic measures. Task-based fMRI data were collected in a 1.5T MR scanner from the same participants on two days: after a week of fully restorative sleep and after a week with 35% sleep curtailment. Each day included four scanning sessions throughout the day (at approximately 10:00 AM, 2:00 PM, 6:00 PM, and 10:00 PM). A modified spatial cueing task was applied to evaluate sustained attention. After sleep restriction, the characteristic path length significantly increased at all measurement times, and small-worldness significantly decreased. Assortativity, a measure of network fault tolerance, diminished over the course of the day in both conditions. Local graph measures were altered primarily across the limbic system (particularly in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and amygdala), default mode network, and visual network.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: A Comparative Study of Different EEG Reference Choices for Event-Related Potentials Extracted by Independent Component Analysis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the event-related potential (ERP) of scalp electroencephalography (EEG) studies, the vertex reference (Cz), linked mastoids or ears (LM), and average reference (AVG) are popular reference methods, and the reference electrode standardization technique (REST) is increasingly applied. Because scalp EEG recordings are considered as spatially degraded signals, independent component analysis (ICA) is a widely used data-driven method for obtaining ERPs by decomposing EEG data. However, the accurate estimation of the differences in ERP components extracted by ICA with different references remains unclear. In this study, we first provided formal descriptions of the above reference methods (Cz, LM, AVG, and REST) and ICA decomposition in ERP and then investigated the influences of different reference techniques on simulation and real EEG datasets. The results revealed that (1) the reference method did not change the peak amplitudes and latencies of relative ERPs corresponding to some IC time courses; (2) there were non-negligible effects of different reference methods on both temporal ERPs and spatial topographies of some ICs; and (3) compared to Cz, LM, and AR, considering both the performances of temporal ERPs and spatial topographies, the REST reference had overall superiority. These findings provide a recommended choice of REST for ICA analysis at the trial level and contribute to empirical investigations regarding the use of reference methods in ERP domains with ICA analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are a group of inherited neurodegenerative conditions whose characteristic feature is degeneration of the longest axons within the corticospinal tract which leads to progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs. Though highly genetically heterogeneous, the majority of HSP cases are caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins that are responsible for generating and organizing the tubular endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Despite this, the role of the ER within neurons, particularly the long axons affected in HSP, is not well understood. Throughout axons, ER tubules make extensive contacts with other organelles, the cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane. At these ER contacts, protein complexes work in concert to perform specialized functions including organelle shaping, calcium homeostasis and lipid biogenesis, all of which are vital for neuronal survival and may be disrupted by HSP-causing mutations. In this article we summarize the proteins which mediate ER contacts, review the functions these contacts are known to carry out within neurons, and discuss the potential contribution of disruption of ER contacts to axonopathy in HSP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are analyzed on the group level. Standard group-level analyses, however, come with severe drawbacks: First, they assume functional homogeneity within the group, building on the idea that we use our brains in similar ways. Second, group-level analyses require spatial warping and substantial smoothing to accommodate for anatomical variability across subjects. Such procedures massively distort the underlying fMRI data, which hampers the spatial specificity. Taken together, group statistics capture the effective overlap, rendering the modeling of individual deviations impossible – a major source of false positivity and negativity. The alternative analysis approach is to leave the data in the native subject space, but this makes comparison across individuals difficult. Here, we propose a new framework for visualizing group-level information, better preserving the information of individual subjects. Our proposal is to limit the use of invasive data procedures such as spatial smoothing and warping and rather extract regional information from the individuals. This information is then visualized for all subjects and brain areas at one glance – hence we term the method brainglance. Additionally, our method incorporates a means for clustering individuals to further identify common traits. We showcase our method on two publicly available data sets and discuss our findings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: The Organization of the Second Optic Chiasm of the Drosophila Optic Lobe</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Visual pathways from the compound eye of an insect relay to four neuropils, successively the lamina, medulla, lobula, and lobula plate in the underlying optic lobe. Among these neuropils, the medulla, lobula, and lobula plate are interconnected by the complex second optic chiasm, through which the anteroposterior axis undergoes an inversion between the medulla and lobula. Given their complex structure, the projection patterns through the second optic chiasm have so far lacked critical analysis. By densely reconstructing axon trajectories using a volumetric scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technique, we reveal the three-dimensional structure of the second optic chiasm of Drosophila melanogaster, which comprises interleaving bundles and sheets of axons insulated from each other by glial sheaths. These axon bundles invert their horizontal sequence in passing between the medulla and lobula. Axons connecting the medulla and lobula plate are also bundled together with them but do not decussate the sequence of their horizontal positions. They interleave with sheets of projection neuron axons between the lobula and lobula plate, which also lack decussations. We estimate that approximately 19,500 cells per hemisphere, about two thirds of the optic lobe neurons, contribute to the second chiasm, most being Tm cells, with an estimated additional 2,780 T4 and T5 cells each. The chiasm mostly comprises axons and cell body fibers, but also a few synaptic elements. Based on our anatomical findings, we propose that a chiasmal structure between the neuropils is potentially advantageous for processing complex visual information in parallel. The EM reconstruction shows not only the structure of the chiasm in the adult brain, the previously unreported main topic of our study, but also suggest that the projection patterns of the neurons comprising the chiasm may be determined by the proliferation centers from which the neurons develop. Such a complex wiring pattern could, we suggest, only have arisen in several evolutionary steps.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
