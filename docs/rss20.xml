	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning techniques are one of the most significant elements of any
Artificial Intelligence (AI) services. Recently, these Machine Learning (ML)
methods, such as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), presented exceptional achievement
in implementing human-level capabilities for various predicaments, such as
Natural Processing Language (NLP), voice recognition, and image processing,
etc. Training these models are expensive in terms of computational power and
the existence of enough labelled data. Thus, ML-based models such as DNNs
establish genuine business value and intellectual property (IP) for their
owners. Therefore the trained models need to be protected from any adversary
attacks such as illegal redistribution, reproducing, and derivation.
Watermarking can be considered as an effective technique for securing a DNN
model. However, so far, most of the watermarking algorithm focuses on
watermarking the DNN by adding noise to an image. To this end, we propose a
framework for watermarking a DNN model designed for a textual domain. The
watermark generation scheme provides a secure watermarking method by combining
Term Frequency (TF) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) of a particular word.
The proposed embedding procedure takes place in the model's training time,
making the watermark verification stage straightforward by sending the
watermarked document to the trained model. The experimental results show that
watermarked models have the same accuracy as the original ones. The proposed
framework accurately verifies the ownership of all surrogate models without
impairing the performance. The proposed algorithm is robust against well-known
attacks such as parameter pruning and brute force attack.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Machine Learning versus Mathematical Model to Estimate the Transverse Shear Stress Distribution in a Rectangular Channel. (arXiv:2103.05447v1 [physics.flu-dyn])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most important subjects of hydraulic engineering is the reliable
estimation of the transverse distribution in the rectangular channel of bed and
wall shear stresses. This study makes use of the Tsallis entropy, genetic
programming (GP) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) methods to
assess the shear stress distribution (SSD) in the rectangular channel. To
evaluate the results of the Tsallis entropy, GP and ANFIS models, laboratory
observations were used in which shear stress was measured using an optimized
Preston tube. This is then used to measure the SSD in various aspect ratios in
the rectangular channel. To investigate the shear stress percentage, 10 data
series with a total of 112 different data were used. The results of the
sensitivity analysis show that the most influential parameter for the SSD in a
smooth rectangular channel is the dimensionless parameter B/H, Where the
transverse coordinate is B, and the flow depth is H. With the parameters (b/B),
(B/H) for the bed and (z/H), (B/H) for the wall as inputs, the modeling of the
GP was better than the other one. Based on the analysis, it can be concluded
that the use of GP and ANFIS algorithms is more effective in estimating shear
stress in smooth rectangular channels than the Tsallis entropy-based equations.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05442</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we propose a novel approach for mining different program
features by analysing the internal behaviour of a deep neural network trained
on source code. Using an unlabelled dataset of Java programs and three
different embedding strategies for the methods in the dataset, we train an
autoencoder for each program embedding and then we test the emerging ability of
the internal neurons in autonomously building internal representations for
different program features. We defined three binary classification labelling
policies inspired by real programming issues, so to test the performance of
each neuron in classifying programs accordingly to these classification rules,
showing that some neurons can actually detect different program properties. We
also analyse how the program representation chosen as input affects the
performance on the aforementioned tasks. On the other hand, we are interested
in finding the overall most informative neurons in the network regardless of a
given task. To this aim, we propose and evaluate two methods for ranking
neurons independently of any property. Finally, we discuss how these ideas can
be applied in different settings for simplifying the programmers' work, for
instance if included in environments such as software repositories or code
editors.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A method to minimize the cost of the structural design of reinforced concrete
structures using Biogeography-Based Optimization, an evolutionary algorithm, is
presented. SAP2000 is used as computational engine, taking into account
modelling aspects such as static soil-structure interaction (SSSI). The
optimization problem is formulated to properly reflect an actual design
problem, limiting e.g. the size of reinforcement bars to commercially available
sections. Strategies to reduce the computational cost of the optimization
procedure are proposed and an extensive parameter tuning was performed. The
resulting tuned optimization algorithm allows to reduce the direct cost of the
construction of a particular structure project with 21% compared to a design
based on traditional criteria. We also evaluate the effect on the cost of the
superstructure when SSSI is takeninto account.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Individual neurons often produce highly variable responses over nominally
identical trials, reflecting a mixture of intrinsic &quot;noise&quot; and systematic
changes in the animal's cognitive and behavioral state. In addition to
investigating how noise and state changes impact neural computation,
statistical models of trial-to-trial variability are becoming increasingly
important as experimentalists aspire to study naturalistic animal behaviors,
which never repeat themselves exactly and may rarely do so even approximately.
Estimating the basic features of neural response distributions may seem
impossible in this trial-limited regime. Fortunately, by identifying and
leveraging simplifying structure in neural data -- e.g. shared gain modulations
across neural subpopulations, temporal smoothness in neural firing rates, and
correlations in responses across behavioral conditions -- statistical
estimation often remains tractable in practice. We review recent advances in
statistical neuroscience that illustrate this trend and have enabled novel
insights into the trial-by-trial operation of neural circuits.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Stream Data with Online Evolving Spiking Neural Networks. (arXiv:1912.08785v2 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08785</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08785</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Unsupervised anomaly discovery in stream data is a research topic with many
practical applications. However, in many cases, it is not easy to collect
enough training data with labeled anomalies for supervised learning of an
anomaly detector in order to deploy it later for identification of real
anomalies in streaming data. It is thus important to design anomalies detectors
that can correctly detect anomalies without access to labeled training data.
Our idea is to adapt the Online evolving Spiking Neural Network (OeSNN)
classifier to the anomaly detection task. As a result, we offer an Online
evolving Spiking Neural Network for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection algorithm
(OeSNN-UAD), which, unlike OeSNN, works in an unsupervised way and does not
separate output neurons into disjoint decision classes. OeSNN-UAD uses our
proposed new two-step anomaly detection method. Also, we derive new theoretical
properties of neuronal model and input layer encoding of OeSNN, which enable
more effective and efficient detection of anomalies in our OeSNN-UAD approach.
The proposed OeSNN-UAD detector was experimentally compared with
state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised detectors of anomalies in
stream data from the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark and Yahoo Anomaly Datasets
repositories. Our approach outperforms the other solutions provided in the
literature in the case of data streams from the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark
repository. Also, in the case of real data files of the Yahoo Anomaly Benchmark
repository, OeSNN-UAD outperforms other selected algorithms, whereas in the
case of Yahoo Anomaly Benchmark synthetic data files, it provides competitive
results to the results recently reported in the literature.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Changes in Resting-State Functional Connectivity of Cerebellum in Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer’s Disease: A Case-Control Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.596221</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.596221</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This case-control study is aimed to investigate the correlation of altered functional connectivity (FC) in cerebellum with cognitive impairment in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The morphometric and resting-state FC MRI analysis including 46 participants with AD, 32 with aMCI and 42 age-matched normal controls (NCs) were conducted. We compared the cerebellar gray matter volume and cerebellar FC with cerebral cortical regions among three groups. To investigate the relationship of cerebellar FC with cognition, we measure the correlation of significant altered FC and individual cognitive domain. No significant morphometric differences of cerebellum was observed across three groups. The patients with AD had weaker cerebral cortical FCs in bilateral Crus I and left VIIb compared to NCs, and in bilateral Crus I compared to patients with aMCI. For patients with aMCI, the weaker FC were found between right Crus I, left VIIb and cerebral cortical regions compared to NCs. The strength of left cerebellar FC positively correlated with specific cognitive subdomains, including memory, executive function, visuospatial function, and global cognition in AD and aMCI. These findings demonstrated the alteration of cerebellar FC with cerebral cortical regions, and the correlation of cerebellar FC and cognitive impairment in AD and aMCI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Circuit Mechanisms of L-DOPA-Induced Dyskinesia (LID)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.614412</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;L-DOPA is the criterion standard of treatment for Parkinson disease. Although it alleviates some of the Parkinsonian symptoms, long-term treatment induces L-DOPA–induced dyskinesia (LID). Several theoretical models including the firing rate model, the firing pattern model, and the ensemble model are proposed to explain the mechanisms of LID. The “firing rate model” proposes that decreasing the mean firing rates of the output nuclei of basal ganglia (BG) including the globus pallidus internal segment and substantia nigra reticulata, along the BG pathways, induces dyskinesia. The “firing pattern model” claimed that abnormal firing pattern of a single unit activity and local field potentials may disturb the information processing in the BG, resulting in dyskinesia. The “ensemble model” described that dyskinesia symptoms might represent a distributed impairment involving many brain regions, but the number of activated neurons in the striatum correlated most strongly with dyskinesia severity. Extensive evidence for circuit mechanisms in driving LID symptoms has also been presented. LID is a multisystem disease that affects wide areas of the brain. Brain regions including the striatum, the pallidal–subthalamic network, the motor cortex, the thalamus, and the cerebellum are all involved in the pathophysiology of LID. In addition, although both amantadine and deep brain stimulation help reduce LID, these approaches have complications that limit their wide use, and a novel antidyskinetic drug is strongly needed; these require us to understand the circuit mechanism of LID more deeply.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Operation-Specific Lexical Consistency Effect in Fronto-Insular-Parietal Network During Word Problem Solving</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.631438</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The practice of mathematical word problem is ubiquitous and thought to impact academic achievement. However, the underlying neural mechanisms are still poorly understood. In this study, we investigate how lexical consistency of word problem description is modulated in adults' brain responses during word problem solution. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging methods, we examined compare word problems that included relational statements, such as “A dumpling costs 9 dollars. A wonton is 2 dollars less than a dumpling. How much does a wonton cost?” and manipulated lexical consistency (consistent: the relational term consistent with the operation to be performed, e.g., more—addition/inconsistent: e.g., less—addition) and problem operation (addition/subtraction). We found a consistency by operation interaction in the widespread fronto-insular-parietal activations, including the anterior insula, dorsoanterior cingulate cortex, middle frontal gyrus, and intraparietal sulcus, such that inconsistent problems engaged stronger activations than consistent problems for addition, whereas the consistency effect was inverse for subtraction. Critically, these results were more salient in the less successful problem solvers than their more successful peers. Our study is the first to demonstrate that lexical consistency effects on arithmetic neural networks are modulated during reading word problem that required distinct arithmetic operations. More broadly, our study has strong potentials to add linkage between neuroscience and education by remediating deficits and enhance instruction design in the school curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Language Mapping Using Stereo Electroencephalography: A Review and Expert Opinion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.619521</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.619521</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) is a method that uses stereotactically implanted depth electrodes for extra-operative mapping of epileptogenic and functional networks. sEEG derived functional mapping is achieved using electrical cortical stimulations (ECS) that are currently the gold standard for delineating eloquent cortex. As this stands true especially for primary cortices (e.g., visual, sensitive, motor, etc.), ECS applied to higher order brain areas determine more subtle behavioral responses. While anterior and posterior language areas in the dorsal language stream seem to share characteristics with primary cortices, basal temporal language area (BTLA) in the ventral temporal cortex (VTC) behaves as a highly associative cortex. After a short introduction and considerations about methodological aspects of ECS using sEEG, we review the sEEG language mapping literature in this perspective. We first establish the validity of this technique to map indispensable language cortices in the dorsal language stream. Second, we highlight the contrast between the growing empirical ECS experience and the lack of understanding regarding the fundamental mechanisms underlying ECS behavioral effects, especially concerning the dispensable language cortex in the VTC. Evidences for considering network architecture as determinant for ECS behavioral response complexities are discussed. Further, we address the importance of designing new research in network organization of language as this could enhance ECS ability to map interindividual variability, pathology driven reorganization, and ultimately identify network resilience markers in order to better predict post-operative language deficit. Finally, based on a whole body of available studies, we believe there is strong evidence to consider sEEG as a valid, safe and reliable method for defining eloquent language cortices although there have been no proper comparisons between surgical resections with or without extra-operative or intra-operative language mapping.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Age-Related Differences in Strategy in the Hand Mental Rotation Task</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.615584</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mental imagery of movement is a potentially valuable rehabilitation task, but its therapeutic efficacy may depend on the specific cognitive strategy employed. Individuals use two main strategies to perform the hand mental rotation task (HMRT), which involves determining whether a visual image depicts a left or right hand. One is the motor imagery (MI) strategy, which involves mentally simulating one’s own hand movements. In this case, task performance as measured by response time (RT) is subject to a medial–lateral effect wherein the RT is reduced when the fingertips are directed medially, presumably as the actual motion would be easier. The other strategy is to employ visual imagery (VI), which involves mentally rotating the picture and is not subject to this medial–lateral effect. The rehabilitative benefits of the HMRT are thought to depend on the MI strategy (mental practice), so it is essential to examine the effects of individual factors such as age, image perspective (e.g., palm or back of the hand), and innate ability (as indicated by baseline RT) on the strategy adopted. When presented with pictures of the palm, all subjects in the current study used the MI strategy, regardless of age and ability. In contrast, when subjects were presented with pictures of the back of the hand, the VI strategy predominated among the young age group regardless of performance, while the strategy used by middle-age and elderly groups depended on performance ability. In the middle-age and elderly groups, the VI approach predominated in those with high performance skill, whereas the MI strategy predominated among those with low performance skill. Thus, higher-skill middle-aged and elderly individuals may not necessarily form a motion image during the HMRT, potentially limiting rehabilitation efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Multidimensional Face Representation in a Deep Convolutional Neural Network Reveals the Mechanism Underlying AI Racism</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The increasingly popular application of AI runs the risk of amplifying social bias, such as classifying non-white faces as animals. Recent research has largely attributed this bias to the training data implemented. However, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood; therefore, strategies to rectify the bias are unresolved. Here, we examined a typical deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), VGG-Face, which was trained with a face dataset consisting of more white faces than black and Asian faces. The transfer learning result showed significantly better performance in identifying white faces, similar to the well-known social bias in humans, the other-race effect (ORE). To test whether the effect resulted from the imbalance of face images, we retrained the VGG-Face with a dataset containing more Asian faces, and found a reverse ORE that the newly-trained VGG-Face preferred Asian faces over white faces in identification accuracy. Additionally, when the number of Asian faces and white faces were matched in the dataset, the DCNN did not show any bias. To further examine how imbalanced image input led to the ORE, we performed a representational similarity analysis on VGG-Face's activation. We found that when the dataset contained more white faces, the representation of white faces was more distinct, indexed by smaller in-group similarity and larger representational Euclidean distance. That is, white faces were scattered more sparsely in the representational face space of the VGG-Face than the other faces. Importantly, the distinctiveness of faces was positively correlated with identification accuracy, which explained the ORE observed in the VGG-Face. In summary, our study revealed the mechanism underlying the ORE in DCNNs, which provides a novel approach to studying AI ethics. In addition, the face multidimensional representation theory discovered in humans was also applicable to DCNNs, advocating for future studies to apply more cognitive theories to understand DCNNs' behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Lymphocyte Activation Gene 3 (Lag3) Contributes to α-Synucleinopathy in α-Synuclein Transgenic Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aggregation of misfolded α-synuclein (α-syn) is the major component of Lewy bodies and neurites in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and related α-synucleinopathies. Some α-syn mutations (e.g., A53T) in familial PD recapitulate the α-syn pathology in transgenic mice, which supports the importance of pathologic α-syn in driving the pathogenesis of α-synucleinopathies. Lymphocyte activation gene 3 (Lag3) is a receptor of α-syn fibrils facilitating pathologic α-syn spread; however, the role of Lag3 in mediating the pathogenesis in α-syn transgenic mice is not clear. Here, we report that depletion of Lag3 in human α-syn A53T transgenic (hA53T) mice significantly reduces the level of detergent-insoluble α-syn aggregates and phosphorylated ser129 α-syn, and inhibits activation of microglia and astrocytes. The absence of Lag3 significantly delays disease progression and reduces the behavioral deficits in hA53T transgenic mice leading to prolonged survival. Taken together, these results show that Lag3 contributes to the pathogenesis in the α-syn A53T transgenic mouse model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Approaches to Study Gap Junctional Coupling</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes and oligodendrocytes are main players in the brain to ensure ion and neurotransmitter homeostasis, metabolic supply, and fast action potential propagation in axons. These functions are fostered by the formation of large syncytia in which mainly astrocytes and oligodendrocytes are directly coupled. Panglial networks constitute on connexin-based gap junctions in the membranes of neighboring cells that allow the passage of ions, metabolites, and currents. However, these networks are not uniform but exhibit a brain region-dependent heterogeneous connectivity influencing electrical communication and intercellular ion spread. Here, we describe different approaches to analyze gap junctional communication in acute tissue slices that can be implemented easily in most electrophysiology and imaging laboratories. These approaches include paired recordings, determination of syncytial isopotentiality, tracer coupling followed by analysis of network topography, and wide field imaging of ion sensitive dyes. These approaches are capable to reveal cellular heterogeneity causing electrical isolation of functional circuits, reduced ion-transfer between different cell types, and anisotropy of tracer coupling. With a selective or combinatory use of these methods, the results will shed light on cellular properties of glial cells and their contribution to neuronal function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Gait Assessment Using Three-Dimensional Acceleration of the Trunk in Idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.653964</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: The subjective evaluation of pathological gait exhibits a low inter-rater reliability. Therefore, we developed a three-dimensional acceleration of the trunk during walking to assess the pathological gait quantitatively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We evaluated 97 patients who underwent the cerebrospinal tap test and were diagnosed with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) and 68 healthy elderlies. The gait features of all patients were evaluated and classified as one of the following: freezing of gait, wide-based gait, short-stepped gait, shuffling gait, instability, gait festination, difficulty in changing direction, and balance disorder in standing up. All gait features of 68 healthy elderlies were treated as normal. Trunk acceleration was recorded automatically by a smartphone placed on the umbilicus during a 15-foot walking test. Two novel indices were created. The first index was a trunk acceleration index, which was defined as (forward acceleration fluctuation) + (vertical acceleration fluctuation) – (lateral acceleration fluctuation) based on the multivariate logistics regression model, and the second index was created by multiplying the forward acceleration with the vertical acceleration. Additionally, 95% confidence ellipsoid volume of the three-dimensional accelerations was assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Forward and vertical acceleration fluctuations were significantly associated with the probability of an iNPH-specific pathological gait. The trunk acceleration index demonstrated the strongest association with the probability of an iNPH-specific pathological gait. The areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves for detecting 100% probability of an iNPH-specific pathological gait were 86.9% for forward acceleration fluctuation, 88.0% for vertical acceleration fluctuation, 82.8% for lateral acceleration fluctuation, 89.0% for trunk acceleration index, 88.8% for forward × vertical acceleration fluctuation, and 87.8% for 95% confidence ellipsoid volume of the three-dimensional accelerations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The probability of a pathological gait specific to iNPH is high at the trunk acceleration fluctuation, reduced in the forward and vertical directions, and increased in the lateral direction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Intranasal Transplantation of Human Neural Stem Cells Ameliorates Alzheimer's Disease-Like Pathology in a Mouse Model</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory impairments, which has no effective therapy. Stem cell transplantation shows great potential in the therapy of various disease. However, the application of stem cell therapy in neurological disorders, especially the ones with a long-term disease course such as AD, is limited by the delivery approach due to the presence of the brain blood barrier. So far, the most commonly used delivery approach in the therapy of neurological disorders with stem cells in preclinical and clinical studies are intracranial injection and intrathecal injection, both of which are invasive. In the present study, we use repetitive intranasal delivery of human neural stem cells (hNSCs) to the brains of APP/PS1 transgenic mice to investigate the effect of hNSCs on the pathology of AD. The results indicate that the intranasally transplanted hNSCs survive and exhibit extensive migration and higher neuronal differentiation, with a relatively limited glial differentiation. A proportion of intranasally transplanted hNSCs differentiate to cholinergic neurons, which rescue cholinergic dysfunction in APP/PS1 mice. In addition, intranasal transplantation of hNSCs attenuates β-amyloid accumulation by upregulating the expression of β-amyloid degrading enzymes, insulin-degrading enzymes, and neprilysin. Moreover, intranasal transplantation of hNSCs ameliorates other AD-like pathology including neuroinflammation, cholinergic dysfunction, and pericytic and synaptic loss, while enhancing adult hippocampal neurogenesis, eventually rescuing the cognitive deficits of APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Thus, our findings highlight that intranasal transplantation of hNSCs benefits cognition through multiple mechanisms, and exhibit the great potential of intranasal administration of stem cells as a non-invasive therapeutic strategy for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Electrophysiological Properties of Substantia Gelatinosa Neurons in the Preparation of a Slice of Middle-Aged Rat Spinal Cord</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A patch-clamp recording in slices generated from the brain or the spinal cord has facilitated the exploration of neuronal circuits and the molecular mechanisms underlying neurological disorders. However, the rodents that are used to generate the spinal cord slices in previous studies involving a patch-clamp recording have been limited to those in the juvenile or adolescent stage. Here, we applied an N-methyl-D-glucamine HCl (NMDG-HCl) solution that enabled the patch-clamp recordings to be performed on the superficial dorsal horn neurons in the slices derived from middle-aged rats. The success rate of stable recordings from substantia gelatinosa (SG) neurons was 34.6% (90/260). When stimulated with long current pulses, 43.3% (39/90) of the neurons presented a tonic-firing pattern, which was considered to represent γ-aminobutyric acid-ergic (GABAergic) signals. Presumptive glutamatergic neurons presented 38.9% (35/90) delayed and 8.3% (7/90) single-spike patterns. The intrinsic membrane properties of both the neuron types were similar but delayed (glutamatergic) neurons appeared to be more excitable as indicated by the decreased latency and rheobase values of the action potential compared with those of tonic (GABAergic) neurons. Furthermore, the glutamatergic neurons were integrated, which receive more excitatory synaptic transmission. We demonstrated that the NMDG-HCl cutting solution could be used to prepare the spinal cord slices of middle-aged rodents for the patch-clamp recording. In combination with other techniques, this preparation method might permit the further study of the functions of the spinal cord in the pathological processes that occur in aging-associated diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Anton J. M. Larsson, Christoph Ziegenhain, Michael Hagemann-Jensen, Björn Reinius, Tina Jacob, Tim Dalessandri, Gert-Jan Hendriks, Maria Kasper, Rickard Sandberg&lt;/p&gt;

Transcriptional bursts render substantial biological noise in cellular transcriptomes. Here, we investigated the theoretical extent of allelic expression resulting from transcriptional bursting and how it compared to the amount biallelic, monoallelic and allele-biased expression observed in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. We found that transcriptional bursting can explain the allelic expression patterns observed in single cells, including the frequent observations of autosomal monoallelic gene expression. Importantly, we identified that the burst frequency largely determined the fraction of cells with monoallelic expression, whereas the burst size had little effect on monoallelic observations. The high consistency between the bursting model predictions and scRNA-seq observations made it possible to assess the heterogeneity of a group of cells as their deviation in allelic observations from the expected. Finally, both burst frequency and size contributed to allelic imbalance observations and reinforced that studies of allelic imbalance can be confounded from the inherent noise in transcriptional bursting. Altogether, we demonstrate that allele-level transcriptional bursting renders widespread, although predictable, amounts of monoallelic and biallelic expression in single cells and cell populations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iXalhcWW9Us&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 are threatening the health care systems of several countries around the world. The initial control of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics relied on non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing, teleworking, mouth masks and contact tracing. However, as pre-symptomatic transmission remains an important driver of the epidemic, contact tracing efforts struggle to fully control SARS-CoV-2 epidemics. Therefore, in this work, we investigate to what extent the use of universal testing, i.e., an approach in which we screen the entire population, can be utilized to mitigate this epidemic. To this end, we rely on PCR test pooling of individuals that belong to the same households, to allow for a universal testing procedure that is feasible with the limited testing capacity. We evaluate two isolation strategies: on the one hand &lt;i&gt;pool isolation&lt;/i&gt;, where we isolate all individuals that belong to a positive PCR test pool, and on the other hand &lt;i&gt;individual isolation&lt;/i&gt;, where we determine which of the individuals that belong to the positive PCR pool are positive, through an additional testing step. We evaluate this universal testing approach in the &lt;i&gt;STRIDE&lt;/i&gt; individual-based epidemiological model in the context of the Belgian COVID-19 epidemic. As the organisation of universal testing will be challenging, we discuss the different aspects related to sample extraction and PCR testing, to demonstrate the feasibility of universal testing when a decentralized testing approach is used. We show through simulation, that weekly universal testing is able to control the epidemic, even when many of the contact reductions are relieved. Finally, our model shows that the use of universal testing in combination with stringent contact reductions could be considered as a strategy to eradicate the virus.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3CVq8BNjM08&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Allowing for invisible name changes is a matter of dignity for trans researchers. This would prevent their own publication record from outing them without their consent. A single, centralized name change request through ORCID iD would alleviate the burden of changing each publication individually.

Academic journals allowing for invisible name changes is a matter of fundamental respect and dignity for trans researchers, but there are currently no acceptable choices when dealing with name changes in a publishing record. This Perspective article proposes a centralized name change solution through ORCID iD to relieve the burden on trans researchers to contact every journal they have previously published with.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/vblJ7m3GTwk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The issues facing academic mothers have been discussed for decades. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is further exposing these inequalities as womxn scientists who are parenting while also engaging in a combination of academic related duties are falling behind. These inequities can be solved by investing strategically in solutions. Here we describe strategies that would ensure a more equitable academy for working mothers now and in the future. While the data are clear that mothers are being disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, many groups could benefit from these strategies. Rather than rebuilding what we once knew, let us be the architects of a new world.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/7PDwqbuv4q4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Astrocyte regional heterogeneity revealed through machine learning‐based glial neuroanatomical assays</title>

	<description>Traditional image analysis techniques fail to determine the morphological changes astrocytes undergo following inflammation. Developing an automated segmentation workflow allowed us to extract morphological data of GFAP or ALDH1L1 positive objects. Using principal component analysis and random forests, we were able to determine the features most important for identifying whether an astrocyte was baseline or reactive. To further determine the changes, different segmented cellular astrocyte components underwent (i.e., the body or process), we performed k‐means clustering. Multiple, well‐validated machine learning approaches allowed us to determine astrocytes undergo a region‐specific heterogenous morphological change following inflammation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS).







Abstract
Evaluation of reactive astrogliosis by neuroanatomical assays represents a common experimental outcome for neuroanatomists. The literature demonstrates several conflicting results as to the accuracy of such measures. We posited that the diverging results within the neuroanatomy literature were due to suboptimal analytical workflows in addition to astrocyte regional heterogeneity. We therefore generated an automated segmentation workflow to extract features of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1, member L1 (ALDH1L1) labeled astrocytes with and without neuroinflammation. We achieved this by capturing multiplexed immunofluorescent confocal images of mouse brains treated with either vehicle or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) followed by implementation of our workflows. Using classical image analysis techniques focused on pixel intensity only, we were unable to identify differences between vehicle‐treated and LPS‐treated animals. However, when utilizing machine learning–based algorithms, we were able to (1) accurately predict which objects were derived from GFAP or ALDH1L1‐stained images indicating that GFAP and ALDH1L1 highlight distinct morphological aspects of astrocytes, (2) we could predict which neuroanatomical region the segmented GFAP or ALDH1L1 object had been derived from, indicating that morphological features of astrocytes change as a function of neuroanatomical location. (3) We discovered a statistically significant, albeit not highly accurate, prediction of which objects had come from LPS versus vehicle‐treated animals, indicating that although features exist capable of distinguishing LPS‐treated versus vehicle‐treated GFAP and ALDH1L1‐segmented objects, that significant overlap between morphologies exists. We further determined that for most classification scenarios, nonlinear models were required for improved treatment class designations. We propose that unbiased automated image analysis techniques coupled with well‐validated machine learning tools represent highly useful models capable of providing insights into neuroanatomical assays.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper investigates prefrontal cortex (PFC) functional connectivity based
on synchronized electrical and hemodynamic responses associated with mental
stress. The electrical response was based on alpha rhythmic of
Electroencephalography (EEG) signals and the hemodynamic responses were based
on the mean concentrations of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin measured
using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). The aim is to explore the
effects of stress on the inter and intra hemispheric PFC functional
connectivity at narrow and wide frequency bands with 8- 13 Hz in EEG and
0.009-0.1Hz in fNIRS signals. The results demonstrated significantly reduce in
the functional connectivity on the dorsolateral PFC within the inter and intra
hemispheric PFC areas based in EEG alpha rhythmic and fNIRS oxygenated and
deoxygenated hemoglobin. The statistical analysis further demonstrated right
dorsolateral dominant to mental stress.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Three major biomarkers: beta-amyloid (A), pathologic tau (T), and
neurodegeneration (N), are recognized as valid proxies for neuropathologic
changes of Alzheimer's disease. While there are extensive studies on
cerebrospinal fluids biomarkers (amyloid, tau), the spatial propagation pattern
across brain is missing and their interactive mechanisms with neurodegeneration
are still unclear. To this end, we aim to analyze the spatiotemporal
associations between ATN biomarkers using large-scale neuroimaging data. We
first investigate the temporal appearances of amyloid plaques, tau tangles, and
neuronal loss by modeling the longitudinal transition trajectories. Second, we
propose linear mixed-effects models to quantify the pathological interactions
and propagation of ATN biomarkers at each brain region. Our analysis of the
current data shows that there exists a temporal latency in the build-up of
amyloid to the onset of tau pathology and neurodegeneration. The propagation
pattern of amyloid can be characterized by its diffusion along the topological
brain network. Our models provide sufficient evidence that the progression of
pathological tau and neurodegeneration share a strong regional association,
which is different from amyloid.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Applying Machine Learning in Self-Adaptive Systems: A Systematic Literature Review. (arXiv:2103.04112v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04112</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, we witness a rapid increase in the use of machine learning in
self-adaptive systems. Machine learning has been used for a variety of reasons,
ranging from learning a model of the environment of a system during operation
to filtering large sets of possible configurations before analysing them. While
a body of work on the use of machine learning in self-adaptive systems exists,
there is currently no systematic overview of this area. Such overview is
important for researchers to understand the state of the art and direct future
research efforts. This paper reports the results of a systematic literature
review that aims at providing such an overview. We focus on self-adaptive
systems that are based on a traditional Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute feedback
loop (MAPE). The research questions are centred on the problems that motivate
the use of machine learning in self-adaptive systems, the key engineering
aspects of learning in self-adaptation, and open challenges. The search
resulted in 6709 papers, of which 109 were retained for data collection.
Analysis of the collected data shows that machine learning is mostly used for
updating adaptation rules and policies to improve system qualities, and
managing resources to better balance qualities and resources. These problems
are primarily solved using supervised and interactive learning with
classification, regression and reinforcement learning as the dominant methods.
Surprisingly, unsupervised learning that naturally fits automation is only
applied in a small number of studies. Key open challenges in this area include
the performance of learning, managing the effects of learning, and dealing with
more complex types of goals. From the insights derived from this systematic
literature review we outline an initial design process for applying machine
learning in self-adaptive systems that are based on MAPE feedback loops.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Electromyography biofeedback system with visual and vibratory feedbacks designed for lower limb rehabilitation. (arXiv:2103.04034v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04034</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04034</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the main causes of long-term prosthetic abandonment is the lack of
ownership over the prosthesis, caused mainly by the absence of sensory
information regarding the lost limb. One strategy to overcome this problem is
to provide alternative feedback mechanisms to convey information respective to
the absent limb. To address this issue, we developed a Biofeedback system for
the rehabilitation of transfemoral amputees, controlled via electromyographic
activity from the leg muscles, that can provide real-time visual and/or
vibratory feedback for the user. In this study, we tested this device with
able-bodied individuals performing an adapted version of the clinical protocol.
Our idea was to test the effectiveness of combining vibratory and visual
feedbacks and how task difficulty affects overall performance. Our results show
no negative interference combining both feedback modalities, and that
performance peaked at the intermediate difficulty. These results provide
powerful insights of what can be expected with the population of amputee people
and will help in the final steps of protocol development. Our goal is to use
this biofeedback system to engage another sensory modality in the process of
spatial representation of a virtual leg, bypassing the lack of information
associated with the disruption of afferent pathways following amputation.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Among the machine learning approaches applied in computer vision,
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is widely used in the field of image
recognition. However, although existing CNN models have been proven to be
efficient, it is not easy to find a network architecture with better
performance. Some studies choose to optimize the network architecture, while
others chose to optimize the hyperparameters, such as the number and size of
convolutional kernels, convolutional strides, pooling size, etc. Most of them
are designed manually, which requires relevant expertise and takes a lot of
time. Therefore, this study proposes the idea of applying Simplified Swarm
Optimization (SSO) on the hyperparameter optimization of LeNet models while
using MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and Cifar10 as validation. The experimental results
show that the proposed algorithm has higher accuracy than the original LeNet
model, and it only takes a very short time to find a better hyperparameter
configuration after training. In addition, we also analyze the output shape of
the feature map after each layer, and surprisingly, the results were mostly
rectangular. The contribution of the study is to provide users with a simpler
way to get better results with the existing model., and this study can also be
applied to other CNN architectures.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Kanerva++: extending The Kanerva Machine with differentiable, locally block allocated latent memory. (arXiv:2103.03905v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Episodic and semantic memory are critical components of the human memory
model. The theory of complementary learning systems (McClelland et al., 1995)
suggests that the compressed representation produced by a serial event
(episodic memory) is later restructured to build a more generalized form of
reusable knowledge (semantic memory). In this work we develop a new principled
Bayesian memory allocation scheme that bridges the gap between episodic and
semantic memory via a hierarchical latent variable model. We take inspiration
from traditional heap allocation and extend the idea of locally contiguous
memory to the Kanerva Machine, enabling a novel differentiable block allocated
latent memory. In contrast to the Kanerva Machine, we simplify the process of
memory writing by treating it as a fully feed forward deterministic process,
relying on the stochasticity of the read key distribution to disperse
information within the memory. We demonstrate that this allocation scheme
improves performance in conditional image generation, resulting in new
state-of-the-art likelihood values on binarized MNIST (&amp;lt;=41.58 nats/image) ,
binarized Omniglot (&amp;lt;=66.24 nats/image), as well as presenting competitive
performance on CIFAR10, DMLab Mazes, Celeb-A and ImageNet32x32.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Fast On-Device Adaptation for Spiking Neural Networks via Online-Within-Online Meta-Learning. (arXiv:2103.03901v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03901</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03901</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have recently gained popularity as machine
learning models for on-device edge intelligence for applications such as mobile
healthcare management and natural language processing due to their low power
profile. In such highly personalized use cases, it is important for the model
to be able to adapt to the unique features of an individual with only a minimal
amount of training data. Meta-learning has been proposed as a way to train
models that are geared towards quick adaptation to new tasks. The few existing
meta-learning solutions for SNNs operate offline and require some form of
backpropagation that is incompatible with the current neuromorphic
edge-devices. In this paper, we propose an online-within-online meta-learning
rule for SNNs termed OWOML-SNN, that enables lifelong learning on a stream of
tasks, and relies on local, backprop-free, nested updates.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Bayesian posterior repartitioning for nested sampling. (arXiv:1908.04655v2 [stat.CO] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04655</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04655</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Priors in Bayesian analyses often encode informative domain knowledge that
can be useful in making the inference process more efficient. Occasionally,
however, priors may be unrepresentative of the parameter values for a given
dataset, which can result in inefficient parameter space exploration, or even
incorrect inferences, particularly for nested sampling (NS) algorithms. Simply
broadening the prior in such cases may be inappropriate or impossible in some
applications. Hence our previous solution to this problem, known as posterior
repartitioning (PR), redefines the prior and likelihood while keeping their
product fixed, so that the posterior inferences and evidence estimates remain
unchanged, but the efficiency of the NS process is significantly increased. In
its most practical form, PR raises the prior to some power $\beta$, which is
introduced as an auxiliary variable that must be determined on a case-by-case
basis, usually by lowering $\beta$ from unity according to some pre-defined
`annealing schedule' until the resulting inferences converge to a consistent
solution. Here we present a very simple yet powerful alternative Bayesian
approach, in which $\beta$ is instead treated as a hyperparameter that is
inferred from the data alongside the original parameters of the problem, and
then marginalised over to obtain the final inference. We show through numerical
examples that this Bayesian PR (BPR) method provides a very robust,
self-adapting and computationally efficient `hands-off' solution to the problem
of unrepresentative priors in Bayesian inference using NS. Moreover, unlike the
original PR method, we show that even for representative priors BPR has a
negligible computational overhead relative to standard nesting sampling, which
suggests that it should be used as the default in all NS analyses.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Multiclass Common Spatial Pattern for EEG based Brain Computer Interface with Adaptive Learning Classifier. (arXiv:1802.09046v2 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09046</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09046</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In Brain Computer Interface (BCI), data generated from Electroencephalogram
(EEG) is non-stationary with low signal to noise ratio and contaminated with
artifacts. Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm has been proved to be
effective in BCI for extracting features in motor imagery tasks, but it is
prone to overfitting. Many algorithms have been devised to regularize CSP for
two class problem, however they have not been effective when applied to
multiclass CSP. Outliers present in data affect extracted CSP features and
reduces performance of the system. In addition to this non-stationarity present
in the features extracted from the CSP present a challenge in classification.
We propose a method to identify and remove artifact present in the data during
pre-processing stage, this helps in calculating eigenvectors which in turn
generates better CSP features. To handle the non-stationarity, Self-Regulated
Interval Type-2 Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (SRIT2NFIS) was proposed in the
literature for two class EEG classification problem. This paper extends the
SRIT2NFIS to multiclass using Joint Approximate Diagonalization (JAD). The
results on standard data set from BCI competition IV shows significant increase
in the accuracies from the current state of the art methods for multiclass
classification.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Computing Temporal Sequences Associated With Dynamic Patterns on the C. elegans Connectome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.564124</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding how the structural connectivity and spatial geometry of a network constrains the dynamics it is able to support is an active and open area of research. We simulated the plausible dynamics resulting from the known C. elegans connectome using a recent model and theoretical analysis that computes the dynamics of neurobiological networks by focusing on how local interactions among connected neurons give rise to the global dynamics in an emergent way. We studied the dynamics which resulted from stimulating a chemosensory neuron (ASEL) in a known feeding circuit, both in isolation and embedded in the full connectome. We show that contralateral motorneuron activations in ventral (VB) and dorsal (DB) classes of motorneurons emerged from the simulations, which are qualitatively similar to rhythmic motorneuron firing pattern associated with locomotion of the worm. One interpretation of these results is that there is an inherent—and we propose—purposeful structural wiring to the C. elegans connectome that has evolved to serve specific behavioral functions. To study network signaling pathways responsible for the dynamics we developed an analytic framework that constructs Temporal Sequences (TSeq), time-ordered walks of signals on graphs. We found that only 5% of TSeq are preserved between the isolated feeding network relative to its embedded counterpart. The remaining 95% of signaling pathways computed in the isolated network are not present in the embedded network. This suggests a cautionary note for computational studies of isolated neurobiological circuits and networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: N-Oleoylglycine and N-Oleoylalanine Do Not Modify Tolerance to Nociception, Hyperthermia, and Suppression of Activity Produced by Morphine</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The endogenous amide N-Oleoylglycine (OlGly) and its analog N-Oleoylalanine (OlAla), have been shown to interfere with the affective and somatic responses to acute naloxone-precipitated MWD in male rats. Here we evaluated the potential of a single dose (5 mg/kg, ip) which alleviates withdrawal of these endogenous fatty acid amides to modify tolerance to anti-nociception, hyperthermia, and suppression of locomotion produced by morphine in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Although rats did develop tolerance to the hypolocomotor and analgesic effects of morphine, they did not develop tolerance to the hyperthermic effects of this substance. Administration of neither OlGly nor OlAla interfered with the establishment of morphine tolerance, nor did they modify behavioral responses elicited by morphine on any trial. These results suggest that the effects of OlGly and OlAla on opiate dependence may be limited to naloxone-precipitated withdrawal effects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: The Perils of Navigating Activity-Dependent Alternative Splicing of Neurexins</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.659681</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurexins are presynaptic cell-adhesion molecules essential for synaptic function that are expressed in thousands of alternatively spliced isoforms. Recent studies suggested that alternative splicing at splice site 4 (SS4) of Nrxn1 is tightly regulated by an activity-dependent mechanism. Given that Nrxn1 alternative splicing at SS4 controls NMDA-receptor-mediated synaptic responses, activity-dependent SS4 alternative splicing would suggest a new synaptic plasticity mechanism. However, conflicting results confound the assessment of neurexin alternative splicing, prompting us to re-evaluate this issue. We find that in cortical cultures, membrane depolarization by elevated extracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-concentrations produced an apparent shift in Nrxn1-SS4 alternative splicing by inducing neuronal but not astroglial cell death, resulting in persistent astroglial Nrxn1-SS4+ expression and decreased neuronal Nrxn1-SS4– expression. in vivo, systemic kainate-induced activation of neurons in the hippocampus produced no changes in Nrxn1-SS4 alternative splicing. Moreover, focal kainate injections into the mouse cerebellum induced small changes in Nrxn1-SS4 alternative splicing that, however, were associated with large decreases in Nrxn1 expression and widespread DNA damage. Our results suggest that although Nrxn1-SS4 alternative splicing may represent a mechanism of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, common procedures for testing this hypothesis are prone to artifacts, and more sophisticated approaches will be necessary to test this important question.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Quantitative Assessment of the Impact of Geometric Distortions and Their Correction on fMRI Data Analyses</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.642808</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is typically collected with gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (GE-EPI) sequences, which are particularly prone to the susceptibility artifact as a result of B&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; field inhomogeneity. The component derived from in-plane spin dephasing induces pixel intensity variations and, more critically, geometric distortions. Despite the physical mechanisms underlying the susceptibility artifact being well established, a systematic investigation on the impact of the associated geometric distortions, and the direct comparison of different approaches to tackle them, on fMRI data analyses is missing. Here, we compared two different distortion correction approaches, by acquiring additional: (1) EPI data with reversed phase encoding direction (TOPUP), and (2) standard (and undistorted) GE data at two different echo times (GRE). We first characterized the geometric distortions and the correction approaches based on the estimated ΔB&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; field offset and voxel shift maps, and then conducted three types of analyses on the distorted and corrected fMRI data: (1) registration into structural data, (2) identification of resting-state networks (RSNs), and (3) mapping of task-related brain regions of interest. GRE estimated the largest voxel shifts and more positively impacted the quality of the analyses, in terms of the (significantly lower) cost function of the registration, the (higher) spatial overlap between the RSNs and appropriate templates, and the (significantly higher) sensitivity of the task-related mapping based on the Z-score values of the associated activation maps, although also evident when considering TOPUP. fMRI data should thus be corrected for geometric distortions, with the choice of the approach having a modest, albeit positive, impact on the fMRI analyses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Contextual MEG and EEG Source Estimates Using Spatiotemporal LSTM Networks</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Most magneto- and electroencephalography (M/EEG) based source estimation techniques derive their estimates sample wise, independently across time. However, neuronal assemblies are intricately interconnected, constraining the temporal evolution of neural activity that is detected by MEG and EEG; the observed neural currents must thus be highly context dependent. Here, we use a network of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells where the input is a sequence of past source estimates and the output is a prediction of the following estimate. This prediction is then used to correct the estimate. In this study, we applied this technique on noise-normalized minimum norm estimates (MNE). Because the correction is found by using past activity (context), we call this implementation Contextual MNE (CMNE), although this technique can be used in conjunction with any source estimation method. We test CMNE on simulated epileptiform activity and recorded auditory steady state response (ASSR) data, showing that the CMNE estimates exhibit a higher degree of spatial fidelity than the unfiltered estimates in the tested cases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Psychiatry: Is There a Need for Electric Field Standardization?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.639640</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Single-pulse and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) are used in clinical practice for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. However, rTMS-based therapies that lead to a significant and sustained reduction in neuropsychiatric symptoms remain scarce. While it is generally accepted that the stimulation frequency plays a crucial role in producing the therapeutic effects of rTMS, less attention has been dedicated to determining the role of the electric field strength. Conventional threshold-based intensity selection approaches, such as the resting motor threshold, produce variable stimulation intensities and electric fields across participants and cortical regions. Insufficient standardization of electric field strength may contribute to the variability of rTMS effects and thus therapeutic success. Computational approaches that can prospectively optimize the electric field and standardize it across patients and cortical targets may overcome some of these limitations. Here, we discuss these approaches and propose that electric field standardization will be instrumental for translational science frameworks (e.g., multiscale modeling and basic science approaches) aimed at deciphering the subcellular, cellular, and network mechanisms of rTMS. Advances in understanding these mechanisms will be important for optimizing rTMS-based therapies in psychiatry.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Spontaneous Afferent Activity Carves Olfactory Circuits</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Electrical activity has a key role in shaping neuronal circuits during development. In most sensory modalities, early in development, internally generated spontaneous activity sculpts the initial layout of neuronal wiring. With the maturation of the sense organs, the system relies more on sensory-evoked electrical activity. Stimuli-driven neuronal discharge is required for the transformation of immature circuits in the specific patterns of neuronal connectivity that subserve normal brain function. The olfactory system (OS) differs from this organizational plan. Despite the important role of odorant receptors (ORs) in shaping olfactory topography, odor-evoked activity does not have a prominent role in refining neuronal wiring. On the contrary, afferent spontaneous discharge is required to achieve and maintain the specific diagram of connectivity that defines the topography of the olfactory bulb (OB). Here, we provide an overview of the development of olfactory topography, with a focus on the role of afferent spontaneous discharge in the formation and maintenance of the specific synaptic contacts that result in the topographic organization of the OB.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Persistent Dark Cones in Oligocone Trichromacy Revealed by Multimodal Adaptive Optics Ophthalmoscopy</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dark cone photoreceptors, defined as those with diminished or absent reflectivity when observed with adaptive optics (AO) ophthalmoscopy, are increasingly reported in retinal disorders. However, their structural and functional impact remain unclear. Here, we report a 3-year longitudinal study on a patient with oligocone trichromacy (OT) who presented with persistent, widespread dark cones within and near the macula. Diminished electroretinogram (ERG) cone but normal ERG rod responses together with normal color vision confirmed the OT diagnosis. In addition, the patient had normal to near normal visual acuity and retinal sensitivity. Occasional dark gaps in the photoreceptor layer were observed on optical coherence tomography, in agreement with reflectance AO scanning light ophthalmoscopy, which revealed that over 50% of the cones in the fovea were dark, increasing to 74% at 10° eccentricity. In addition, the cone density was 78% lower than normal histologic value at the fovea, and 20–40% lower at eccentricities of 5–15°. Interestingly, color vision testing was near normal at locations where cones were predominantly dark. These findings illustrate how a retina with predominant dark cones that persist over at least 3 years can support near normal central retinal function. Furthermore, this study adds to the growing evidence that cones can continue to survive under non-ideal conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Bulk flow of cerebrospinal fluid observed in periarterial spaces is not an artifact of injection</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.65958</guid>

	<description>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flowing through periarterial spaces is integral to the brain's mechanism for clearing metabolic waste products. Experiments that track tracer particles injected into the cisterna magna of mouse brains have shown evidence of pulsatile CSF flow in perivascular spaces surrounding pial arteries, with a bulk flow in the same direction as blood flow. However, the driving mechanism remains elusive. Several studies have suggested that the bulk flow might be an artifact, driven by the injection itself. Here, we address this hypothesis with new &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; experiments where tracer particles are injected into the cisterna magna using a dual-syringe system, with simultaneous injection and withdrawal of equal amounts of fluid. This method produces no net increase in CSF volume and no significant increase in intracranial pressure. Yet, particle-tracking reveals flows that are consistent in all respects with the flows observed in earlier experiments with single-syringe injection.</description>

	<title>eLife: A polarity pathway for exocyst-dependent intracellular tube extension</title>

	<description>Lumen extension in intracellular tubes can occur when vesicles fuse with an invading apical membrane. Within the &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; excretory cell, which forms an intracellular tube, the exocyst vesicle-tethering complex is enriched at the lumenal membrane and is required for its outgrowth, suggesting that exocyst-targeted vesicles extend the lumen. Here, we identify a pathway that promotes intracellular tube extension by enriching the exocyst at the lumenal membrane. We show that PAR-6 and PKC-3/aPKC concentrate at the lumenal membrane and promote lumen extension. Using acute protein depletion, we find that PAR-6 is required for exocyst membrane recruitment, whereas PAR-3, which can recruit the exocyst in mammals, appears dispensable for exocyst localization and lumen extension. Finally, we show that CDC-42 and RhoGEF EXC-5/FGD regulate lumen extension by recruiting PAR-6 and PKC-3 to the lumenal membrane. Our findings reveal a pathway that connects CDC-42, PAR proteins, and the exocyst to extend intracellular tubes.</description>

	<title>eLife: SABRE populates ER domains essential for cell plate maturation and cell expansion influencing cell and tissue patterning</title>

	<description>SABRE, which is found throughout eukaryotes and was originally identified in plants, mediates cell expansion, division plane orientation and planar polarity in plants. How and where SABRE mediates these processes remain open questions. We deleted &lt;i&gt;SABRE&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Physcomitrium patens&lt;/i&gt;, an excellent model for cell biology. &lt;i&gt;SABRE&lt;/i&gt; null mutants were stunted, similar to phenotypes in seed plants. Additionally, polarized growing cells were delayed in cytokinesis, sometimes resulting in catastrophic failures. A functional SABRE fluorescent fusion protein localized to dynamic puncta on regions of the ER during interphase and at the cell plate during cell division. Without &lt;i&gt;SABRE&lt;/i&gt;, cells accumulated ER aggregates and the ER abnormally buckled along the developing cell plate. Notably, callose deposition was delayed in &lt;i&gt;Δsabre&lt;/i&gt;, and in cells that failed to divide, abnormal callose accumulations formed at the cell plate. Our findings revealed a surprising and fundamental role for the ER in cell plate maturation.</description>

	<description>The hypothalamic orexigenic Agouti-related peptide (AgRP)-expressing neurons are crucial for the regulation of whole-body energy homeostasis. Here, we show that fasting-induced AgRP neuronal activation is associated with dynamin-related peptide 1 (DRP1)-mediated mitochondrial fission and mitochondrial fatty acid utilization in AgRP neurons. In line with this, mice lacking &lt;i&gt;Dnm1l&lt;/i&gt; in adult AgRP neurons (Drp1 cKO) show decreased fasting- or ghrelin-induced AgRP neuronal activity and feeding and exhibited a significant decrease in body weight, fat mass, and feeding accompanied by a significant increase in energy expenditure. In support of the role for mitochondrial fission and fatty acids oxidation, Drp1 cKO mice showed attenuated palmitic acid-induced mitochondrial respiration. Altogether, our data revealed that mitochondrial dynamics and fatty acids oxidation in hypothalamic AgRP neurons is a critical mechanism for AgRP neuronal function and body-weight regulation.</description>

	<description>Sensorimotor learning adapts motor output to maintain movement accuracy. For saccadic eye movements, learning also alters space perception, suggesting a dissociation between the performed saccade and its internal representation derived from corollary discharge (CD). This is critical since learning is commonly believed to be driven by CD-based visual prediction error. We estimate the internal saccade representation through pre- and trans-saccadic target localization, showing that it decouples from the actual saccade during learning. We present a model that explains motor and perceptual changes by collective plasticity of spatial target percept, motor command, and a forward dynamics model that transforms CD from motor into visuospatial coordinates. We show that learning does not follow visual prediction error but instead a postdictive update of space after saccade landing. We conclude that trans-saccadic space perception guides motor learning via CD-based postdiction of motor error under the assumption of a stable world.</description>

	<description>The interaction between a bacteriophage and its host is mediated by the phage's receptor binding protein (RBP). Despite its fundamental role in governing phage activity and host range, molecular rules of RBP function remain a mystery. Here, we systematically dissect the functional role of every residue in the tip domain of T7 phage RBP (1660 variants) by developing a high-throughput, locus-specific, phage engineering method. This rich dataset allowed us to cross compare functional profiles across hosts to precisely identify regions of functional importance, many which were previously unknown. Substitution patterns showed host-specific differences in position and physicochemical properties of mutations, revealing molecular adaptation to individual hosts. We discovered gain-of-function variants against resistant hosts and host-constricting variants that eliminated certain hosts. To demonstrate therapeutic utility, we engineered highly active T7 variants against urinary tract pathogen. Our approach presents a generalized framework for characterizing sequence-function relationships in many phage-bacterial systems.</description>

	<title>eLife: Proteomic and transcriptomic profiling reveal different aspects of aging in the kidney</title>

	<description>Little is known about the molecular changes that take place in the kidney during the aging process. In order to better understand these changes, we measured mRNA and protein levels in genetically diverse mice at different ages. We observed distinctive change in mRNA and protein levels as a function of age. Changes in both mRNA and protein are associated with increased immune infiltration and decreases in mitochondrial function. Proteins show a greater extent of change and reveal changes in a wide array of biological processes including unique, organ-specific features of aging in kidney. Most importantly, we observed functionally important age-related changes in protein that occur in the absence of corresponding changes in mRNA. Our findings suggest that mRNA profiling alone provides an incomplete picture of molecular aging in the kidney and that examination of changes in proteins is essential to understand aging processes that are not transcriptionally regulated.</description>

	<title>eLife: Distinct neural mechanisms underlie subjective and objective recollection and guide memory-based decision making</title>

	<description>Accurate memories are often associated with vivid experiences of recollection. However, the neural mechanisms underlying subjective recollection and their unique role in decision making beyond accuracy have received limited attention. We dissociated subjective recollection from accuracy during a forced-choice task. Distractors corresponded either to non-studied exemplars of the targets (A-A’ condition) or to non-studied exemplars of different studied items (A-B’ condition). The A-A’ condition resulted in higher accuracy and greater activation in the superior parietal lobe, whereas the A-B’ condition resulted in higher subjective recollection and greater activation in the precuneus and retrosplenial regions, indicating a dissociation between objective and subjective memory. Activation in insular, cingulate, and lateral prefrontal regions was also associated with subjective recollection; however, during a subsequent decision phase, activation in these same regions was greater for discarded than for selected responses in anticipation of a social reward, underscoring their role in evaluating memory evidence flexibly based on current goals.</description>

	<title>eLife: Heterogeneous contributions of change in population distribution of body mass index to change in obesity and underweight</title>

	<description>From 1985 to 2016, the prevalence of underweight decreased, and that of obesity and severe obesity increased, in most regions, with significant variation in the magnitude of these changes across regions. We investigated how much change in mean body mass index (BMI) explains changes in the prevalence of underweight, obesity, and severe obesity in different regions using data from 2896 population-based studies with 187 million participants. Changes in the prevalence of underweight and total obesity, and to a lesser extent severe obesity, are largely driven by shifts in the distribution of BMI, with smaller contributions from changes in the shape of the distribution. In East and Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, the underweight tail of the BMI distribution was left behind as the distribution shifted. There is a need for policies that address all forms of malnutrition by making healthy foods accessible and affordable, while restricting unhealthy foods through fiscal and regulatory restrictions.</description>

	<description>As countries in the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS) increasingly focus their malaria control and elimination efforts on reducing forest-related transmission, greater understanding of the relationship between deforestation and malaria incidence will be essential for programs to assess and meet their 2030 elimination goals. Leveraging village-level health facility surveillance data and forest cover data in a spatio-temporal modeling framework, we found evidence that deforestation is associated with short-term increases, but long-term decreases in confirmed malaria case incidence in Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). We identified strong associations with deforestation measured within 30 km of villages but not with deforestation in the near (10 km) and immediate (1 km) vicinity. Results appear driven by deforestation in densely forested areas and were more pronounced for infections with &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;P. falciparum&lt;/i&gt;) than for &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium vivax&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;P. vivax&lt;/i&gt;). These findings highlight the influence of forest activities on malaria transmission in the GMS.</description>

	<title>eLife: Regulation of photosynthetic electron flow on dark to light transition by Ferredoxin:NADP(H) Oxidoreductase interactions</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56088</link>
	<description>During photosynthesis, electron transport is necessary for carbon assimilation and must be regulated to minimize free radical damage. There is a longstanding controversy over the role of a critical enzyme in this process (ferredoxin:NADP(H) oxidoreductase, or FNR), and in particular its location within chloroplasts. Here we use immunogold labelling to prove that FNR previously assigned as soluble is in fact membrane associated. We combined this technique with a genetic approach in the model plant Arabidopsis, to show that the distribution of this enzyme between different membrane regions depends on its interaction with specific tether proteins. We further demonstrate a correlation between the interaction of FNR with different proteins and the activity of alternative photosynthetic electron transport pathways. This supports a role for FNR location in regulating photosynthetic electron flow during the transition from dark to light.</description>

	<description>The mechanisms determining the development and individual variability of brain torque (BT) remain unclear. Here, all relevant components of BT were analyzed using neuroimaging data of up to 24,112 individuals from 6 cohorts. Our large-scale data confirmed the population-level predominance of the typical anticlockwise torque and suggested a 'first attenuating, then enlarging' dynamic across the lifespan primarily for frontal, occipital and perisylvian BT features. Sex/handedness differences in BT were found and were related to cognitive sex/handedness differences in verbal-numerical reasoning. We observed differential heritability of up to 56% for BT, especially in temporal language areas, and identified numerous genome- and phenome-wide significant associations pointing to neurodevelopment, cognitive functions, lifestyle, neurological and psychiatric disorders, sociodemographic, cardiovascular and anthropometric traits. This study provides a comprehensive description of BT and insights into biological and other factors that may contribute to the development and individual variations of BT.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: VTA MC3R neurons control feeding in an activity and sex-dependent manner in mice</title>

	<description>Increasing evidence indicates that the melanocortin and mesolimbic dopamine systems interact to regulate feeding and body weight. Because melanocortin-3 receptors (MC3R) are highly expressed in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), we tested whether VTA neurons expressing these receptors (VTA MC3R neurons) control feeding and body weight in vivo. We also tested whether there were sex differences in the ability of VTA MC3R neurons to control feeding, as MC3R -/- mice show sex-dependent alterations in reward feeding and dopamine levels, and there are clear sex differences in multiple dopamine-dependent behaviors and disorders. DREADD receptors were used to acutely activate and inhibit VTA MC3R neurons and changes in food intake and body weight were measured. Acutely altering the activity of VTA MC3R neurons decreased feeding in an activity- and sex-dependent manner, with acute activation decreasing feeding, but only in females, and acute inhibition decreasing feeding, but only in males. These differences did not appear to be due to sex differences in the number of VTA MC3R neurons, the ability of hM3Dq to activate VTA MC3R neurons, or the proportion of VTA MC3R neurons expressing tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). These studies demonstrate an important role for VTA MC3R neurons in the control of feeding and reveal important sex differences in behavior, whereby opposing changes in neuronal activity in male and female mice cause similar changes in behavior.</description>

	<description>One of the central questions about the cognitive neuroscience of creativity is the extent to which creativity depends on either domain-specific or domain-general mechanisms. To address this question, we carried out two parallel activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses of creativity: 1) a motoric analysis that combined studies across five domains of creative production (verbalizing, music, movement, writing, and drawing), and 2) an analysis of the Alternate Uses divergent-thinking task. All experiments contained a contrast between a creative task and a matched non-creative or less-creative task that controlled for the sensorimotor demands of task performance. The activation profiles of the two meta-analyses were non-overlapping, but both pointed to a domain-specific interpretation in which creative production is, at least in part, an enhancement of sensorimotor brain areas involved in non-creative production. The most concordant areas of activation in the motoric meta-analysis were high-level motor areas such as the pre-supplementary motor area and inferior frontal gyrus that interface motor planning and executive control, suggesting a means of uniting domain-specificity and -generality in creative production.</description>

	<description>Brain-based deception research began only two decades ago and has since included a wide variety of contexts and response modalities for deception paradigms. Investigations of this sort serve to better our neuroscientific and legal knowledge of the ways in which individuals deceive others. To this end, we conducted activation likelihood estimation (ALE) and meta-analytic connectivity modelling (MACM) using BrainMap software to examine 45 task-based fMRI brain activation studies on deception. An activation likelihood estimation comparing activations during deceptive versus honest behavior revealed 7 significant peak activation clusters (bilateral insula, left superior frontal gyrus, bilateral supramarginal gyrus, and bilateral medial frontal gyrus). Meta-analytic connectivity modelling revealed an interconnected network amongst the 7 regions comprising both unidirectional and bidirectional connections. Together with subsequent behavioral and paradigm decoding, these findings implicate the supramarginal gyrus as a key component for the sociocognitive process of deception.</description>

	<description>Projections from sensory neurons of olfactory systems coalesce into glomeruli in the brain. The Kirrel receptors are believed to homodimerize via their ectodomains and help separate sensory neuron axons into Kirrel2- or Kirrel3-expressing glomeruli. Here we present the crystal structures of homodimeric Kirrel receptors and show that the closely related Kirrel2 and Kirrel3 have evolved specific sets of polar and hydrophobic interactions, respectively, disallowing heterodimerization while preserving homodimerization, likely resulting in proper segregation and coalescence of Kirrel-expressing axons into glomeruli. We show that the dimerization interface at the N-terminal IG domains is necessary and sufficient to create homodimers, and fail to find evidence for a secondary interaction site in Kirrel ectodomains. Furthermore, we show that abolishing dimerization of Kirrel3 in vivo leads to improper formation of glomeruli in the mouse accessory olfactory bulb as observed in Kirrel3-/- animals. Our results provide strong evidence for Kirrel3 homodimerization controlling axonal coalescence.</description>

	<description>We studied the changes that neuronal RF models undergo when the statistics of the stimulus are changed from those of white Gaussian noise (WGN) to those of natural scenes (NS). Fitting the model to data estimates both a cascade of linear filters on the stimulus, as wells as the static nonlinearities that map the output of the filters to the neuronal spike rates. We found that cells respond differently to these two classes of stimuli, with mostly higher spike rates and shorter response latencies to NS than to WGN. The most striking finding was that NS resulted in RFs that had around twice as many uncovered filters as did WGN. This finding was not an artefact of the higher spike rates but rather related to a change in coding. Our results reveal a greater extent of nonlinear processing in V1 neurons when stimulated using NS compared to WGN. Our findings indicate the existence of nonlinear mechanisms that endow V1 neurons with context-dependent transmission of visual information.</description>

	<description>High-frequency action potentials (APs) allow rapid information acquisition and processing in neural systems, but create biophysical and metabolic challenges for excitable cells. The electric fish Eigenmannia virescens images its world and communicates with high-frequency (200-600 Hz) electric organ discharges (EODs) produced by synchronized APs generated at the same frequency in the electric organ cells (electrocytes). We cloned three previously unidentified Na+-activated K+ channel isoforms from electroctyes (eSlack1, eSlack2, and eSlick1). In electrocytes, mRNA transcript levels of the rapidly-activating eSlick, but not the slower eSlack1 or eSlack2, correlated with EOD frequency across individuals. In addition, transcript levels of an inward-rectifier K+ channel, a voltage-gated Na+ channel, and Na+,K+-ATPases also correlated with EOD frequency while a second Na+ channel isoform did not. Computational simulations showed that maintaining electrocyte AP waveform integrity as firing rates increase requires scaling conductances in accordance with these mRNA expression correlations, causing AP metabolic costs to increase exponentially.</description>

	<description>One in 54 children in the U.S. is diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). De novo germline and somatic mutations cannot account for all cases of ASD, suggesting that epigenetic alterations triggered by environmental exposures may be responsible for a subset of ASD cases. Human and animal studies have shown that exposure of the developing brain to general anesthetic (GA) agents can trigger neurodegeneration and neurobehavioral abnormalities but the effects of general anesthetics on the germ line have not been explored in detail. We exposed pregnant mice to sevoflurane during the time of embryonic development when the germ cells undergo epigenetic reprogramming and found that more than 38% of the directly exposed F1 animals exhibit impairments in anxiety and social interactions. Strikingly, 44-47% of the F2 and F3 animals, which were not directly exposed to sevoflurane, show the same behavioral problems. We performed ATAC-seq and identified more than 1,200 differentially accessible sites in the sperm of F1 animals, 69 of which are also present in the sperm of F2 animals. These sites are located in regulatory regions of genes strongly associated with ASD, including Arid1b, Ntrk2, and Stmn2. These findings suggest that epimutations caused by exposing germ cells to sevoflurane can lead to ASD in the offspring, and this effect can be transmitted through the male germline inter and trans-generationally.</description>

	<description>Recently, it has become progressively more evident that classic diagnostic labels are unable to accurately and reliably describe the complexity and variability of several clinical phenotypes. This is particularly true for a broad range of neuropsychiatric illnesses such as depression and anxiety disorders or behavioural phenotypes such as aggression and antisocial personality. Patient heterogeneity can be better described and conceptualized by grouping individuals into novel categories, which are based on empirically-derived sections of intersecting continua that span both across and beyond traditional categorical borders. In this context, neuroimaging data carry a wealth of spatiotemporally resolved information about each patient brain. However, they are usually heavily collapsed a priori through procedures which are not learned as part of model training, and consequently not optimized for the downstream prediction task. This is due to the fact that every individual participant usually comes with multiple whole-brain 3D imaging modalities often accompanied by a deep genotypic and phenotypic characterization, hence posing formidable computational challenges. In this paper we design and validate a deep learning architecture based on generative models rooted in a modular approach and separable convolutional blocks (which result in a 20-fold decrease in parameter utilization) in order to a) fuse multiple 3D neuroimaging modalities on a voxel-wise level, b) efficiently convert them into informative latent embeddings through heavy dimensionality reduction, c) maintain excellent generalizability and minimal information loss. As proof of concept, we test our architecture on the well characterized Human Connectome Project database (n=974 healthy subjects), demonstrating that our latent embeddings can be clustered into easily separable subject strata which, in turn, map to extremely different phenotypical information (including organic, neuropsychological, personality variables) which was not included in the embedding creation process. The ability to extract meaningful and separable phenotypic information from brain images alone can aid in creating multi-dimensional biomarkers able to chart spatio-temporal trajectories which may correspond to different pathophysiological mechanisms unidentifiable to traditional data analysis approaches. In turn, this may be of aid in predicting disease evolution as well as drug response, hence supporting mechanistic disease understanding and also empowering clinical trials.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Variability of EEG electrode positions and their underlying brain regions: visualising gel artifacts from a simultaneous EEG-fMRI dataset</title>

	<description>We investigated the between-subject variability of EEG electrode placement from a simultaneously recorded EEG-fMRI dataset. Neuro-navigation software was used to localise electrode positions in xyz and MNI space, made possible by the gel artifacts present in the structural MRI images. To assess variation in the brain regions directly underneath each electrode, we used both raw MNI coordinates and labels from the Harvard-Oxford Cortical atlas. In a sample of 20 participants, the mean standard deviation of electrode placement was 3.94 mm in x, 5.55 mm in y, and 7.17 mm in z, with the largest variation in parietal and occipital electrodes. In addition, the brain regions covered by electrode pairs was not always consistent; for example, the mean location of electrode P07 was mapped to BA18, whereas P08 was closer to BA19. Further, electrode C1 was mapped to the left primary motor cortex, whereas C2 was closer to right pre-motor cortex. Overall, the results emphasise the variation in electrode positioning that can be found even in a fixed cap, potentially caused by between-subject differences in brain morphology. We present a relatively simple method for approximating the location of electrodes in a simultaneous EEG-fMRI data set with accompanying analysis code, and suggest that researchers check the regions underlying their EEG ROIs to improve the generalisability and reliability of their neuroimaging results.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: State anxiety alters the neural oscillatory correlates of predictions and prediction errors during reward learning</title>

	<description>Anxiety influences how the brain estimates and responds to uncertainty. These behavioural effects have been described within predictive coding and Bayesian inference frameworks, yet the associated neural correlates remain unclear. Recent work suggests that predictions in generative models of perception are represented in alpha-beta oscillations (8-30 Hz), while updates to predictions are driven by prediction errors weighted by precision (inverse variance; pwPE) and encoded in gamma oscillations (&amp;gt;30 Hz). We tested whether state anxiety alters the neural oscillatory activity associated with predictions and pwPE during learning. Healthy human participants performed a probabilistic reward-learning task in a volatile environment. In our previous work, we described learning behaviour in this task using a hierarchical Bayesian model, revealing more precise (biased) beliefs about the reward tendency in state anxiety, consistent with reduced learning in this group. The model provided trajectories of predictions and pwPEs for the current study, allowing us to assess their parametric effects on the time-frequency representations of EEG data. Using convolution modelling for oscillatory responses, we found that, relative to a control group, state anxiety increased alpha-beta activity in frontal and sensorimotor regions during processing pwPE, and in fronto-parietal regions during encoding predictions. No effects of state anxiety on gamma modulation were found. Our findings expand prior evidence on the oscillatory representations of predictions and pwPEs into the reward-learning domain. The results suggest that state anxiety modulates oscillatory correlates of pwPE and predictions in generative models, providing insights into a potential mechanism explaining biased belief updating and poorer reward learning.</description>

	<description>The continuity of non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREMS) is essential for its functions. However, many mammalian species, including humans, show NREMS fragility to maintain environmental vigilance. The neural substrates balancing NREMS continuity and fragility substates are unexplored. We show that the locus coeruleus (LC) is necessary and sufficient to generate infraslow (~50 s) continuity-fragility fluctuations in mouse NREMS. Through machine-learning-guided closed-loop optogenetic LC interrogation, we suppressed, locked, or entrained continuity-fragility fluctuations, as evident by LC-mediated regulation of sleep spindle clustering and heart rate variability. Noradrenergic modulation of thalamic but not cortical circuits was required for infraslow sleep spindle clustering and involved rapid noradrenaline increases that activated both 1- and {beta}-adrenergic receptors to cause slowly decaying membrane depolarizations. The LC thus coordinates brain and bodily states during NREMS to engender continuity-fragility, accentuating its role in the physiology of sleep-related sensory uncoupling and as target in sleep disorders showing abnormal cortical and/or autonomic arousability.</description>

	<description>Background: With the growing size and richness of neuroscience datasets in terms of dimension, volume, and resolution, identifying spatiotemporal patterns in those datasets is increasingly important. Multivariate dimension-reduction methods are particularly adept at addressing these challenges. New Method: In this paper, we propose a novel method, which we refer to as Principal Louvain Clustering (PLC), to identify clusters in a low-dimensional data subspace, based on time-varying trajectories of spectral dynamics across multisite local field potential (LFP) recordings in awake behaving mice. Data were recorded from prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and parietal cortex in eleven mice while they explored novel and familiar environments. Results: PLC-identified subspaces and clusters showed high consistency across animals, and were modulated by the animals' ongoing behavior. Conclusions: PLC adds to an important growing literature on methods for characterizing dynamics in high-dimensional datasets, using a smaller number of parameters. The method is also applicable to other kinds of datasets, such as EEG or MEG.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Sodium valproate increases activity of the sirtuin pathway resulting in beneficialeffects for spinocerebellar ataxia-3 in vivo</title>

	<description>Machado-Joseph disease (MJD, also known as spinocerebellar ataxia-3) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that impairs control and coordination of movement. Here we tested whether treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor sodium valproate (SV) prevented a movement phenotype that develops in larvae of a transgenic zebrafish model of the disease. We found that treatment with SV improved the swimming of the MJD zebrafish, increased levels of acetylated histones 3 and 4, but also increased expression of polyglutamine expanded human ataxin-3. Proteomic analysis of protein lysates generated from the treated and untreated MJD zebrafish also predicted that SV treatment had activated the sirtuin longevity signaling pathway and this was confirmed by findings of increased SIRT1 protein levels and sirtuin activity in SV treated MJD zebrafish and HEK293 cells expressing ataxin-3-84Q, respectively. Treatment with resveratrol (another compound known to activate the sirtuin pathway), also improved swimming in the MJD zebrafish. Co-treatment with SV alongside EX527, a SIRT1 activity inhibitor, prevented induction of autophagy by SV and the beneficial effects of SV on the movement in the MJD zebrafish, indicating that they were both dependent on sirtuin activity. These findings provide the first evidence of sodium valproate inducing activation of the sirtuin pathway. Further, they indicate that drugs that target the sirtuin pathway, including sodium valproate and resveratrol, warrant further investigation for the treatment of MJD and related neurodegenerative diseases.</description>

	<description>Verbal instructions allow fast and optimal implementation of novel behaviors. Previous research has shown that different control-related variables organize neural activity in frontoparietal regions during the preparation of novel instructed task sets. Little is known, however, about how such variables organize brain activity under different task demands. In this study, we assessed the impact of implementation and memorization demands in the neural representation of novel instructions. We combined functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) with an instruction-following paradigm to compare the effect of three relevant control-related variables (integration of dimensions, response complexity, and stimulus category) across demands, and to explore the degree of overlap between these. Our results reveal, first, that the implementation and memorization of novel instructions share common neural patterns in several brain regions. Importantly, they also suggest that the preparation to implement instructions results in a strengthened coding of relevant control-related information in frontoparietal areas compared to their mere memorization. Overall, our study shows how the content of novel instructions proactively shapes brain activity based on multiple dimensions and how these organizational patterns are strengthened during implementation demands.</description>

	<description>Perceptual decisions are biased toward higher-value options when overall gains can be improved. When stimuli demand immediate reactions, the neurophysiological decision process dynamically evolves through distinct phases of growing anticipation, detection and discrimination, but how value biases are exerted through these phases remains unknown. Here, by parsing motor preparation dynamics in human electrophysiology, we uncovered a multiphasic pattern of countervailing biases operating in speeded decisions. Anticipatory preparation of higher-value actions began earlier, conferring a &quot;starting point&quot;- advantage at stimulus onset, but the delayed preparation of lower-value actions was steeper, conferring a value-opposed buildup rate bias. This, in turn, was countered by a transient deflection toward the higher value action evoked by stimulus detection. A neurally-constrained process model featuring anticipatory urgency, biased detection, and accumulation of growing stimulus-discriminating evidence, successfully captured both behavior and motor preparation dynamics. Thus, an intricate interplay of distinct biasing mechanisms serves to prioritise time-constrained perceptual decisions.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Allopregnanolone mediates affective switching through modulation of oscillatory states in the basolateral amygdala</title>

	<description>Brexanolone (allopregnanolone), was recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of post-partum depression, demonstrating long-lasting antidepressant effects. Despite our understanding of the mechanism of action of neurosteroids as positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of GABAA receptors, we still do not fully understand how allopregnanolone exerts these persistent antidepressant effects. We demonstrate that allopregnanolone and similar synthetic neuroactive steroid analogs, SGE-516 (tool-compound) and zuranolone (SAGE-217, investigational-compound), modulate oscillations across species. We further demonstrate a critical role for interneurons in generating oscillations in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and a role for delta-containing GABAARs in mediating the ability of neurosteroids to modulate network and behavioral states. Actions of allopregnanolone in the BLA confer anxiolytic/antidepressant behavior and enhance BLA high-theta oscillations (6-12Hz) through delta-containing GABAA receptors, a mechanism distinct from other GABAA PAMs, such as benzodiazepines. Moreover, treatment with the allopregnanolone analog SGE-516 protects mice from chronic stress-induced disruption of network and behavioral states. Our findings demonstrate a novel molecular and cellular mechanism mediating the well-established anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of neuroactive steroids.</description>

	<description>Despite extensive studies detecting blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI signals across two hemispheres to present cognitive processes in normal and diseased brains, the role of corpus callosum (CC) to mediate interhemispheric functional connectivity remains controversial. Several studies show maintaining low-frequency fluctuation of resting-state (rs)-fMRI signals in homotopic brain areas of acallosal humans and post-callosotomy animals, raising the question: how can we specify the circuit-specific rs-fMRI signal fluctuation from other sources? To address this question, we have developed a bilateral line-scanning fMRI (BiLS) method to detect bilateral laminar BOLD fMRI signals from symmetric cortical regions with high spatial (100 m) and temporal (100 ms) resolution in rodents under anesthesia. In addition to ultra-slow oscillation (0.01-0.02 Hz) patterns across all cortical layers, a layer-specific bilateral coherence pattern was observed with a peak at Layer (L) 2/3, where callosal projection neurons are primarily located and reciprocal transcallosal projections are received. In particular, the L2/3-specific coherence pattern showed a peak at 0.05 Hz based on the stimulation paradigm, depending on the interhemispheric CC activation. Meanwhile, the L2/3-specific rs-fMRI coherence was peaked at 0.08-0.1Hz which was independent of the varied ultra-slow oscillation patterns (0.01-0.02 Hz) presumably involved with global neuromodulation. This work provides a unique laminar fMRI mapping scheme to characterize the CC-mediated evoked fMRI and frequency-dependent rs-fMRI responses, presenting crucial evidence to distinguish the circuit-specific fMRI signal fluctuations across two hemispheres.</description>

	<description>Neural representations change, even in the absence of overt learning. To preserve stable behavior and memories, the brain must track these changes. Here, we explore homeostatic mechanisms that could allow neural populations to track drift in continuous representations without external error feedback. We build on existing models of Hebbian homeostasis, which have been shown to stabilize representations against synaptic turnover and allow discrete neuronal assemblies to track representational drift. We show that a downstream readout can use its own activity to detect and correct drift, and that such a self-healing code could be implemented by plausible synaptic rules. Population response normalization and recurrent dynamics could stabilize codes further. Our model reproduces aspects of drift observed in experiments, and posits neurally plausible mechanisms for long-term stable readouts from drifting population codes.</description>

	<description>Mechanisms of rhythm generation have been extensively studied in motor systems that control locomotion over terrain in limbed animals; however, much less is known about rhythm generation in soft-bodied terrestrial animals. Here we explored how muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) dependent rhythm generating networks are distributed in the central nervous system (CNS) of soft-bodied Drosophila larvae. We measured fictive motor patterns in isolated CNS preparations using a combination of Ca2+ imaging and electrophysiology while manipulating mAChR signalling pharmacologically. Bath application of the mAChR agonist oxotremorine potentiated rhythm generation in distal regions of the isolated CNS, whereas application of the mAChR antagonist scopolamine suppressed rhythm generation in these regions. Oxotremorine raised baseline Ca2+ levels and potentiated rhythmic activity in isolated posterior abdominal CNS segments as well as isolated anterior brain and thoracic regions, but did not induce rhythmic activity in isolated anterior abdominal segments. Bath application of scopolamine to reduced preparations lowered baseline Ca2+ levels and abolished rhythmic activity. These results suggest the presence of a bimodal gradient of rhythmogenicity in the larval CNS, with mAChR dependent rhythm generating networks in distal regions separated by medial segments with severely reduced rhythmogenic abilities. This work furthers our understanding of motor control in soft-bodied locomotion and provides a foundation for study of rhythm generating networks in an emerging genetically tractable locomotor system.</description>

	<description>Objective: The paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (PVN) is an integrative center in the brain orchestrating a wide range of physiological and behavioral responses. While the PVN melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) signaling (PVNMC4R+) is undoubtedly involved in feeding regulation, the neuroanatomical organization of PVNMC4R+ pathway and its role in diverse physiological and behavioral regulations have not been fully understood. Here we aimed to better characterize the input-output organization of PVNMC4R+ neurons and further test their potential functional roles beyond feeding. Methods: Using a combination of viral tools, we performed a comprehensive mapping of PVNMC4R+ circuits and tested the effects of chemogenetic activation of PVNMC4R+ neurons on thermogenesis, cardiovascular control and other behavioral regulations beyond feeding. Results: We found that PVNMC4R+ neurons broadly innervate many different brain regions known to be important not only for feeding but also for neuroendocrine and autonomic control of thermogenesis and cardiovascular function, including but not limited to preoptic area, median eminence, parabrachial nucleus, locus coeruleus, nucleus of solitary tract, ventrolateral medulla and thoracic spinal cord. Contrary to broad efferent projections, PVNMC4R+ neurons receive monosynaptic inputs from limited brain regions, including medial preoptic nucleus, arcuate and dorsomedial hypothalamic nuclei, and supraoptic nucleus. Consistent with broad efferent projections, chemogenetic activation of PVNMC4R+ neurons not only suppressed feeding but also led to an apparent increase in heart rate, blood pressure and brown adipose tissue thermogenesis. Strikingly, these physiological changes accompanied an unexpected repetitive bedding-removing behavior followed by hypoactivity and resting-like behavior. Conclusions: Our results clarify the neuroanatomical organization of PVNMC4R+ circuits and shed new light on the roles of PVNMC4R+ pathways in autonomic control of thermogenesis, cardiovascular function and other behavioral regulations.</description>

	<description>Traditional clinical approaches diagnose disorders of the nervous system using standardized observational criteria. Although aiming for homogeneity of symptoms, this method often results in highly heterogeneous disorders. A standing question thus is how to automatically stratify a given random cohort of the population, such that treatment can be better tailored to each cluster's symptoms, and severity of any given group forecasted to provide neuroprotective therapies. In this work we introduce new methods to automatically stratify a random cohort of the population composed of healthy controls of different ages and patients with different disorders of the nervous systems. Using a simple walking task and measuring micro-fluctuations in their biorhythmic motions, we show that gait is compromised in healthy aging and that in young FMR1 premutation carriers, gait forecasts, even by 15 years ahead, symptoms resembling those of elderly with Parkinson's disease. Our methods combine non-linear causal network connectivity analyses in the temporal and frequency domains with stochastic mapping, defining a new type of internal motor timings amenable to create personalized clinical interventions. We frame our results using the principle of reafference and operationalize them using causal prediction, thus renovating the theory of internal models for the study of neuromotor control.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Ocular Dominance Columns in V1 are more Susceptible than Associated Callosal Patches to Imbalance of Eye Input During Precritical and Critical Periods</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/10.1002/cne.25134</guid>

	<description>In normal rats, ocular dominance columns (ODCs) overlap with callosal patches in V1. ODCs (a) and callosal patches (c) are present by postnatal day 10 (P10). In rats monocularly enucleated (ME) at P10 and perfused before the onset of the critical period (~P20), ODCs desegregate in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the remaining eye (b), whereas callosal patches do not desegregate in this hemisphere (d).






ABSTRACT
In Long Evans rats, ocular dominance columns (ODCs) in V1 overlap with patches of callosal connections. Using anatomical tracers, we found that ODCs and callosal patches are present at postnatal day 10 (P10), several days before eye opening, and about 10 days before the activation of the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity (~P20). In rats monocularly enucleated at P10 and perfused ~P20, ODCs ipsilateral to the remaining eye desegregated, indicating that rat ODCs are highly susceptible to monocular enucleation during a precritical period. Monocular enucleation during the critical period exerted significant, although smaller, effects. Monocular eye lid suture during the critical period led to a significant expansion of the ipsilateral projection from the non‐deprived eye, whereas the contralateral projection invaded into, and intermixed with, ipsilateral ODCs innervated by the deprived eye. We propose that this intermixing allows callosal connections to contribute to the effects of monocular deprivation assessed in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the non deprived eye. The ipsilateral and contralateral projections from the deprived eye did not undergo significant shrinkage.
In contrast, we found that callosal patches are less susceptible to imbalance of eye input. In rats monocularly enucleated during either the precritical or critical periods, callosal patches were maintained in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the remaining eye, but desegregated in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the enucleated orbit. Callosal patches were maintained in rats binocularly enucleated at P10 or later. Similarly, monocular deprivation during the critical period had no significant effect on callosal patches in either hemisphere.

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: A computational study of co-inhibitory immune complex assembly at the interface between T cells and antigen presenting cells</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Zhaoqian Su, Kalyani Dhusia, Yinghao Wu&lt;/p&gt;

The activation and differentiation of T-cells are mainly directly by their co-regulatory receptors. T lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4) and programed cell death-1 (PD-1) are two of the most important co-regulatory receptors. Binding of PD-1 and CTLA-4 with their corresponding ligands programed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and B7 on the antigen presenting cells (APC) activates two central co-inhibitory signaling pathways to suppress T cell functions. Interestingly, recent experiments have identified a new &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-interaction between PD-L1 and B7, suggesting that a crosstalk exists between two co-inhibitory receptors and the two pairs of ligand-receptor complexes can undergo dynamic oligomerization. Inspired by these experimental evidences, we developed a coarse-grained model to characterize the assembling of an immune complex consisting of CLTA-4, B7, PD-L1 and PD-1. These four proteins and their interactions form a small network motif. The temporal dynamics and spatial pattern formation of this network was simulated by a diffusion-reaction algorithm. Our simulation method incorporates the membrane confinement of cell surface proteins and geometric arrangement of different binding interfaces between these proteins. A wide range of binding constants was tested for the interactions involved in the network. Interestingly, we show that the CTLA-4/B7 ligand-receptor complexes can first form linear oligomers, while these oligomers further align together into two-dimensional clusters. Similar phenomenon has also been observed in other systems of cell surface proteins. Our test results further indicate that both co-inhibitory signaling pathways activated by B7 and PD-L1 can be down-regulated by the new &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-interaction between these two ligands, consistent with previous experimental evidences. Finally, the simulations also suggest that the dynamic and the spatial properties of the immune complex assembly are highly determined by the energetics of molecular interactions in the network. Our study, therefore, brings new insights to the co-regulatory mechanisms of T cell activation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/R4hDckY4L1s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: The evolutionary origin of the universal distribution of mutation fitness effect</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Ayuna Barlukova, Igor M. Rouzine&lt;/p&gt;

An intriguing fact long defying explanation is the observation of a universal exponential distribution of beneficial mutations in fitness effect for different microorganisms. To explain this effect, we use a population model including mutation, directional selection, linkage, and genetic drift. The multiple-mutation regime of adaptation at large population sizes (traveling wave regime) is considered. We demonstrate analytically and by simulation that, regardless of the inherent distribution of mutation fitness effect across genomic sites, an exponential distribution of fitness effects emerges in the long term. This result follows from the exponential statistics of the frequency of the less-fit alleles, &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;, that we predict to evolve, in the long term, for both polymorphic and monomorphic sites. We map the logarithmic slope of the distribution onto the previously derived fixation probability and demonstrate that it increases linearly in time. Our results demonstrate a striking difference between the distribution of fitness effects observed experimentally for naturally occurring mutations, and the &quot;inherent&quot; distribution obtained in a directed-mutagenesis experiment, which can have any shape depending on the organism. Based on these results, we develop a new method to measure the fitness effect of mutations for each variable residue using DNA sequences sampled from adapting populations. This new method is not sensitive to linkage effects and does not require the one-site model assumptions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cpkmKbCoxiA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Abnormal coagulation and an increased risk of thrombosis are features of severe COVID-19, with parallels proposed with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a life-threating condition associated with hyperinflammation. The presence of HLH was described in severely ill patients during the H1N1 influenza epidemic, presenting with pulmonary vascular thrombosis. We tested the hypothesis that genes causing primary HLH regulate pathways linking pulmonary thromboembolism to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 using novel network-informed computational algorithms. This approach led to the identification of Neutrophils Extracellular Traps (NETs) as plausible mediators of vascular thrombosis in severe COVID-19 in children and adults. Taken together, the network-informed analysis led us to propose the following model: the release of NETs in response to inflammatory signals acting in concert with SARS-CoV-2 damage the endothelium and direct platelet-activation promoting abnormal coagulation leading to serious complications of COVID-19. The underlying hypothesis is that genetic and/or environmental conditions that favor the release of NETs may predispose individuals to thrombotic complications of COVID-19 due to an increase risk of abnormal coagulation. This would be a common pathogenic mechanism in conditions including autoimmune/infectious diseases, hematologic and metabolic disorders.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UcvR93KNSVY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Complementary phase responses via functional differentiation of dual negative feedback loops</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008774</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Koichiro Uriu, Hajime Tei&lt;/p&gt;

Multiple feedback loops are often found in gene regulations for various cellular functions. In mammalian circadian clocks, oscillations of &lt;i&gt;Period1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Per1&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;Period2&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Per2&lt;/i&gt;) expression are caused by interacting negative feedback loops (NFLs) whose protein products with similar molecular functions repress each other. However, &lt;i&gt;Per1&lt;/i&gt; expression peaks earlier than &lt;i&gt;Per2&lt;/i&gt; in the pacemaker tissue, raising the question of whether the peak time difference reflects their different dynamical functions. Here, we address this question by analyzing phase responses of the circadian clock caused by light-induced transcription of both &lt;i&gt;Per1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Per2&lt;/i&gt; mRNAs. Through mathematical analyses of dual NFLs, we show that phase advance is mainly driven by light inputs to the repressor with an earlier expression peak as &lt;i&gt;Per1&lt;/i&gt;, whereas phase delay is driven by the other repressor with a later peak as &lt;i&gt;Per2&lt;/i&gt;. Due to the complementary contributions to phase responses, the ratio of light-induced transcription rates between &lt;i&gt;Per1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Per2&lt;/i&gt; determines the magnitude and direction of phase shifts at each time of day. Specifically, stronger &lt;i&gt;Per1&lt;/i&gt; light induction than &lt;i&gt;Per2&lt;/i&gt; results in a phase response curve (PRC) with a larger phase advance zone than delay zone as observed in rats and hamsters, whereas stronger &lt;i&gt;Per2&lt;/i&gt; induction causes a larger delay zone as observed in mice. Furthermore, the ratio of light-induced transcription rates required for entrainment is determined by the relation between the circadian and light-dark periods. Namely, if the autonomous period of a circadian clock is longer than the light-dark period, a larger light-induced transcription rate of &lt;i&gt;Per1&lt;/i&gt; than &lt;i&gt;Per2&lt;/i&gt; is required for entrainment, and vice versa. In short, the time difference between &lt;i&gt;Per1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Per2&lt;/i&gt; expression peaks can differentiate their dynamical functions. The resultant complementary contributions to phase responses can determine entrainability of the circadian clock to the light-dark cycle.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2zd9PlLEkvA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Epileptic seizures are characterized by abnormal and excessive neural activity, where cortical network dynamics seem to become unstable. However, most of the time, during seizure-free periods, cortex of epilepsy patients shows perfectly stable dynamics. This raises the question of how recurring instability can arise in the light of this stable default state. In this work, we examine two potential scenarios of seizure generation: (i) epileptic cortical areas might generally operate closer to instability, which would make epilepsy patients generally more susceptible to seizures, or (ii) epileptic cortical areas might drift systematically towards instability before seizure onset. We analyzed single-unit spike recordings from both the epileptogenic (focal) and the nonfocal cortical hemispheres of 20 epilepsy patients. We quantified the distance to instability in the framework of criticality, using a novel estimator, which enables an unbiased inference from a small set of recorded neurons. Surprisingly, we found no evidence for either scenario: Neither did focal areas generally operate closer to instability, nor were seizures preceded by a drift towards instability. In fact, our results from both pre-seizure and seizure-free intervals suggest that despite epilepsy, human cortex operates in the stable, slightly subcritical regime, just like cortex of other healthy mammalians.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BcP07U0hkow&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Responding to stimuli requires that organisms encode information about the external world. Not all parts of the input are important for behavior, and resource limitations demand that signals be compressed. Prediction of the future input is widely beneficial in many biological systems. We compute the trade-offs between representing the past faithfully and predicting the future using the information bottleneck approach, for input dynamics with different levels of complexity. For motion prediction, we show that, depending on the parameters in the input dynamics, velocity or position information is more useful for accurate prediction. We show which motion representations are easiest to re-use for accurate prediction in other motion contexts, and identify and quantify those with the highest transferability. For non-Markovian dynamics, we explore the role of long-term memory in shaping the internal representation. Lastly, we show that prediction in evolutionary population dynamics is linked to clustering allele frequencies into non-overlapping memories.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2N04EaO3NnY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Variability in muscle force is a hallmark of healthy and pathological human behavior. Predominant theories of sensorimotor control assume ‘motor noise’ leads to force variability and its ‘signal dependence’ (variability in muscle force whose amplitude increases with intensity of neural drive). Here, we demonstrate that the two proposed mechanisms for motor noise (i.e. the stochastic nature of motor unit discharge and unfused tetanic contraction) cannot account for the majority of force variability nor for its signal dependence. We do so by considering three previously underappreciated but physiologically important features of a population of motor units: 1) fusion of motor unit twitches, 2) coupling among motoneuron discharge rate, cross-bridge dynamics, and muscle mechanics, and 3) a series-elastic element to account for the aponeurosis and tendon. These results argue strongly against the idea that force variability and the resulting kinematic variability are generated primarily by ‘motor noise.’ Rather, they underscore the importance of variability arising from properties of control strategies embodied through distributed sensorimotor systems. As such, our study provides a critical path toward developing theories and models of sensorimotor control that provide a physiologically valid and clinically useful understanding of healthy and pathologic force variability.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1FAg7Z2QAFE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Acrylic acid is a value-added chemical used in industry to produce diapers, coatings, paints, and adhesives, among many others. Due to its economic importance, there is currently a need for new and sustainable ways to synthesise it. Recently, the focus has been laid in the use of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; to express the full bio-based pathway using 3-hydroxypropionate as an intermediary through three distinct pathways (glycerol, malonyl-CoA, and &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-alanine). Hence, the goals of this work were to use COPASI software to assess which of the three pathways has a higher potential for industrial-scale production, from either glucose or glycerol, and identify potential targets to improve the biosynthetic pathways yields. When compared to the available literature, the models developed during this work successfully predict the production of 3-hydroxypropionate, using glycerol as carbon source in the glycerol pathway, and using glucose as a carbon source in the malonyl-CoA and &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-alanine pathways. Finally, this work allowed to identify four potential over-expression targets (glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3pD), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (AccC), aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT), and aspartate carboxylase (AspC)) that should, theoretically, result in higher AA yields.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SmWdsZN2yZg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) of some IDPs/IDRs can lead to the formation of the membraneless organelles &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, which are essential for many biological processes in the cell. Here we select three different IDR segments of chaperon Swc5 and develop a polymeric slab model at the residue-level. By performing the molecular dynamics simulations, LLPS can be observed at low temperatures even without charge interactions and disappear at high temperatures. Both the sequence length and the charge pattern of the Swc5 segments can influence the critical temperature of LLPS. The results suggest that the effects of the electrostatic interactions on the LLPS behaviors can change significantly with the ratios and distributions of the charged residues, especially the sequence charge decoration (SCD) values. In addition, three different forms of swc conformation can be distinguished on the phase diagram, which is different from the conventional behavior of the free IDP/IDR. Both the packed form (the condensed-phase) and the dispersed form (the dilute-phase) of swc chains are found to be coexisted when LLPS occurs. They change to the fully-spread form at high temperatures. These findings will be helpful for the investigation of the IDP/IDR ensemble behaviors as well as the fundamental mechanism of the LLPS process in bio-systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/92-5cYIt15s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: The very early evolution of protein translocation across membranes</title>

In this study, we used a computational approach to investigate the early evolutionary history of a system of proteins that, together, embed and translocate other proteins across cell membranes. Cell membranes comprise the basis for cellularity, which is an ancient, fundamental organizing principle shared by all organisms and a key innovation in the evolution of life on Earth. Two related requirements for cellularity are that organisms are able to both embed proteins into membranes and translocate proteins across membranes. One system that accomplishes these tasks is the signal recognition particle (SRP) system, in which the core protein components are the paralogs, FtsY and Ffh. Complementary to the SRP system is the Sec translocation channel, in which the primary channel-forming protein is SecY. We performed phylogenetic analyses that strongly supported prior inferences that FtsY, Ffh, and SecY were all present by the time of the last universal common ancestor of life, the LUCA, and that the ancestor of FtsY and Ffh existed before the LUCA. Further, we combined ancestral sequence reconstruction and protein structure and function prediction to show that the LUCA had an SRP system and Sec translocation channel that were similar to those of extant organisms. We also show that the ancestor of Ffh and FtsY that predated the LUCA was more similar to FtsY than Ffh but could still have comprised a rudimentary protein translocation system on its own. Duplication of the ancestor of FtsY and Ffh facilitated the specialization of FtsY as a membrane bound receptor and Ffh as a cytoplasmic protein that could bind nascent proteins with specific membrane-targeting signal sequences. Finally, we analyzed amino acid frequencies in our ancestral sequence reconstructions to infer that the ancestral Ffh/FtsY protein likely arose prior to or just after the completion of the canonical genetic code. Taken together, our results offer a window into the very early evolutionary history of cellularity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jIzf6-2FzL0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: A multiscale model via single-cell transcriptomics reveals robust patterning mechanisms during early mammalian embryo development</title>

During early mammalian embryo development, a small number of cells make robust fate decisions at particular spatial locations in a tight time window to form inner cell mass (ICM), and later epiblast (Epi) and primitive endoderm (PE). While recent single-cell transcriptomics data allows scrutinization of heterogeneity of individual cells, consistent spatial and temporal mechanisms the early embryo utilize to robustly form the Epi/PE layers from ICM remain elusive. Here we build a multiscale three-dimensional model for mammalian embryo to recapitulate the observed patterning process from zygote to late blastocyst. By integrating the spatiotemporal information reconstructed from multiple single-cell transcriptomic datasets, the data-informed modeling analysis suggests two major processes critical to the formation of Epi/PE layers: a selective cell-cell adhesion mechanism (via EphA4/EphrinB2) for fate-location coordination and a temporal attenuation mechanism of cell signaling (via Fgf). Spatial imaging data and distinct subsets of single-cell gene expression data are then used to validate the predictions. Together, our study provides a multiscale framework that incorporates single-cell gene expression datasets to analyze gene regulations, cell-cell communications, and physical interactions among cells in complex geometries at single-cell resolution, with direct application to late-stage development of embryogenesis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/--FEM5x0ebY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Modern spatial transcriptomics methods can target thousands of different types of RNA transcripts in a single slice of tissue. Many biological applications demand a high spatial density of transcripts relative to the imaging resolution, leading to partial mixing of transcript rolonies in many voxels; unfortunately, current analysis methods do not perform robustly in this highly-mixed setting. Here we develop a new analysis approach, &lt;i&gt;BARcode DEmixing through Non-negative Spatial Regression&lt;/i&gt; (BarDensr): we start with a generative model of the physical process that leads to the observed image data and then apply sparse convex optimization methods to estimate the underlying (demixed) rolony densities. We apply BarDensr to simulated and real data and find that it achieves state of the art signal recovery, particularly in densely-labeled regions or data with low spatial resolution. Finally, BarDensr is fast and parallelizable. We provide open-source code as well as an implementation for the ‘NeuroCAAS’ cloud platform.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hdDPdmMv6_Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Protein sequence optimization with a pairwise decomposable penalty for buried unsatisfied hydrogen bonds</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Brian Coventry, David Baker&lt;/p&gt;

In aqueous solution, polar groups make hydrogen bonds with water, and hence burial of such groups in the interior of a protein is unfavorable unless the loss of hydrogen bonds with water is compensated by formation of new ones with other protein groups. For this reason, buried “unsatisfied” polar groups making no hydrogen bonds are very rare in proteins. Efficiently representing the energetic cost of unsatisfied hydrogen bonds with a pairwise-decomposable energy term during protein design is challenging since whether or not a group is satisfied depends on all of its neighbors. Here we describe a method for assigning a pairwise-decomposable energy to sidechain rotamers such that following combinatorial sidechain packing, buried unsaturated polar atoms are penalized. The penalty can be any quadratic function of the number of unsatisfied polar groups, and can be computed very rapidly. We show that inclusion of this term in Rosetta sidechain packing calculations substantially reduces the number of buried unsatisfied polar groups.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hMfSol7UySQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The function of Sprouty2 (Spry2) in T cells is unknown. Using 2 different (inducible and T cell–targeted) knockout mouse strains, we found that Spry2 positively regulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling by modulating the activity of LCK. Spry2&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells were unable to activate LCK, proliferate, differentiate into T helper cells, or produce cytokines. Spry2 deficiency abrogated type 2 inflammation and airway hyperreactivity in a murine model of asthma. Spry2 expression was higher in blood and airway CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells from patients with asthma, and Spry2 knockdown impaired human T cell proliferation and cytokine production. Spry2 deficiency up-regulated the lipid raft protein caveolin-1, enhanced its interaction with CSK, and increased CSK interaction with LCK, culminating in augmented inhibitory phosphorylation of LCK. Knockdown of CSK or dislodgment of caveolin-1–bound CSK restored ERK1/2 activation in Spry2&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, suggesting an essential role for Spry2 in LCK activation and T cell function.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ILHn1108vAo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Anatomical projections to the dorsal tegmental nucleus and abducens nucleus arise from separate cell populations in the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi, but overlapping cell populations in the medial vestibular nucleus</title>

	<description>Retrograde tracers were utilized to examine projections to the dorsal tegmental nucleus (DTN), a critical component of the head direction cell circuitry, and the abducens nucleus, an oculomotor structure. We found that the medial vestibular nucleus contains individual neurons that project to both the DTN and abducens nucleus. In contrast, neurons in the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi project to either the DTN or abducens nucleus, but rarely to both structures simultaneously. Additionally, we describe interhemispheric connections between the left and right DTN, and projections from the supragenual nucleus, interpeduncular nucleus, and retrosplenial cortex to the DTN.







Abstract
Specialized circuitry in the brain processes spatial information to provide a sense of direction used for navigation. The dorsal tegmental nucleus (DTN) is a core component of this circuitry and utilizes vestibular inputs to generate neural activity encoding the animal's directional heading. Projections arising from the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi (NPH) and the medial vestibular nucleus (MVe) are thought to transmit critical vestibular signals to the DTN and other brain areas, including the abducens nucleus (ABN), a component of eye movement circuitry. Here, we utilized a dual retrograde tracer approach in rats to investigate whether overlapping or distinct populations of neurons project from the NPH or MVe to the DTN and ABN. We report that individual MVe neurons project to both the DTN and ABN. In contrast, we observed individual NPH neurons that project to either the DTN or ABN, but rarely to both structures simultaneously. We also examined labeling patterns in other structures located in the brainstem and posterior cortex and observed (1) complex patterns of interhemispheric connectivity between the left and right DTN, (2) projections from the supragenual nucleus, interpeduncular nucleus, and retrosplenial cortex to the DTN, (3) projections from the lateral superior olive to the ABN, and (4) a unique population of cerebrospinal fluid‐contacting neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus. Collectively, our experiments provide valuable new information that extends our understanding of the anatomical organization of the brain's spatial processing circuitry.</description>

	<description>Abstract
Ground state depletion followed by individual molecule return microscopy (GSDIM) has been used in the past to study the nanoscale distribution of protein co‐localization in living cells. We now demonstrate the successful application of GSDIM to archival human brain tissue sections including from Alzheimer's disease cases as well as experimental tissue samples from mouse and zebrafish larvae. Presynaptic terminals and microglia and their cell processes were visualized at a resolution beyond diffraction‐limited light microscopy, allowing clearer insights into their interactions in situ. The procedure described here offers time and cost savings compared to electron microscopy and opens the spectrum of molecular imaging using antibodies and super‐resolution microscopy to the analysis of routine formalin‐fixed paraffin sections of archival human brain. The investigation of microglia–synapse interactions in dementia will be of special interest in this context.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hyperparameter optimization is a challenging problem in developing deep
neural networks. Decision of transfer layers and trainable layers is a major
task for design of the transfer convolutional neural networks (CNN).
Conventional transfer CNN models are usually manually designed based on
intuition. In this paper, a genetic algorithm is applied to select trainable
layers of the transfer model. The filter criterion is constructed by accuracy
and the counts of the trainable layers. The results show that the method is
competent in this task. The system will converge with a precision of 97% in the
classification of Cats and Dogs datasets, in no more than 15 generations.
Moreover, backward inference according the results of the genetic algorithm
shows that our method can capture the gradient features in network layers,
which plays a part on understanding of the transfer AI models.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dementia is one of the main causes of cognitive decline. Since the majority
of dementia patients cannot be cured, being able to diagnose them before the
onset of the symptoms can prevent the rapid progression of the cognitive
impairment. This study aims to investigate the difference in the
Electroencephalograph (EEG) signals of three groups of subjects: Normal Control
(NC), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Dementia (DEM). Unlike previous
works that focus on the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from EEG signals,
we study the detection of dementia to generalize the classification models to
other types of dementia. We have developed a pilot study on machine
learning-based dementia diagnosis using EEG signals from four visual
stimulation tasks (Fixation, Mental Imagery, Symbol Recognition, and Visually
Evoked Related Potential) to identify the most suitable task and method to
detect dementia using EEG signals. We extracted both frequency and time domain
features from the EEG signals and applied a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for
each domain to classify the patients using those extracted features.
Additionally, we study the feasibility of the Filter Bank Common Spatial
Pattern (FBCSP) algorithm to extract features from the frequency domain to
detect dementia. The evaluation of the model shows that the tasks that test the
working memory are the most appropriate to detect dementia using EEG signals in
both time and frequency domain analysis. However, the best results in both
domains are obtained by combining features of all four cognitive tasks.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the world unprecedentedly, where it has
affected the vast global population both socially and economically. The
pandemic has also opened our eyes to the many threats that novel virus
infections can pose for humanity. While numerous unknowns are being
investigated in terms of the distributed damage that the virus can do to the
human body, recent studies have also shown that the infection can lead to
lifelong sequelae that could affect other parts of the body, and one example is
the brain. As part of this work, we investigate how viral infection can affect
the brain by modelling and simulating a neuron's behaviour under demyelination
that is affected by the cytokine storm. We quantify the effects of
cytokine-induced demyelination on the propagation of action potential signals
within a neuron. We used information and communication theory analysis on the
signal propagated through the axonal pathway under different intensity levels
of demyelination to analyse these effects. Our simulations demonstrate that
virus-induced degeneration can play a role in the signal power and spiking rate
and the probability of releasing neurotransmitters and compromising the
propagation and processing of information between the neurons. We also propose
a transfer function that models these attenuation effects that degenerates the
action potential, where this model has the potential to be used as a framework
for the analysis of virus-induced neurodegeneration that can pave the way to
improved understanding of virus-induced demyelination.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Vision is known to improve human postural responses to external
perturbations. This study investigates the role of vision for the responses to
continuous pseudorandom support surface translations in the body sagittal plane
in three visual conditions: with the eyes closed (EC), in stroboscopic
illumination (EO/SI; only visual position information) and with eyes open in
continuous illumination (EO/CI; position and velocity information) with the
room as static visual scene (or the interior of a moving cabin, in some of the
trials). In the frequency spectrum of the translation stimulus we distinguished
on the basis of the response patterns between a low-frequency, mid-frequency,
and high-frequency range (LFR: 0.0165-0.14 Hz; MFR: 0.15-0.57 Hz; HFR:
0.58-2.46 Hz). With EC, subjects' mean sway response gain was very low in the
LFR. On average it increased with EO/SI (although not to a significant degree p
= 0.078) and more so with EO/CI (p &amp;lt; 10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-6&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;). In contrast, the average
gain in the MFR decreased from EC to EO/SI (although not to a significant
degree, p = 0.548) and further to EO/CI (p = 0.0002). In the HFR, all three
visual conditions produced, similarly, high gain levels. A single inverted
pendulum (SIP) model controlling center of mass (COM) balancing about the ankle
joints formally described the EC response as being strongly shaped by a
resonance phenomenon arising primarily from the control's proprioceptive
feedback loop. The effect of adding visual information in these simulations
lies in a reduction of the resonance, similar as in the experiments. Extending
the model to a double inverted pendulum (DIP) suggested in addition a
biomechanical damping effective from trunk sway in the hip joints on the
resonance.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Typical methods to study cognitive function are to record the electrical
activities of animal neurons during the training of animals performing
behavioral tasks. A key problem is that they fail to record all the relevant
neurons in the animal brain. To alleviate this problem, we develop an RNN-based
Actor-Critic framework, which is trained through reinforcement learning (RL) to
solve two tasks analogous to the monkeys' decision-making tasks. The trained
model is capable of reproducing some features of neural activities recorded
from animal brain, or some behavior properties exhibited in animal experiments,
suggesting that it can serve as a computational platform to explore other
cognitive functions. Furthermore, we conduct behavioral experiments on our
framework, trying to explore an open question in neuroscience: which episodic
memory in the hippocampus should be selected to ultimately govern future
decisions. We find that the retrieval of salient events sampled from episodic
memories can effectively shorten deliberation time than common events in the
decision-making process. The results indicate that salient events stored in the
hippocampus could be prioritized to propagate reward information, and thus
allow decision-makers to learn a strategy faster.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The no free lunch theorem states that no model is better suited to every
problem. A question that arises from this is how to design methods that propose
optimizers tailored to specific problems achieving state-of-the-art
performance. This paper addresses this issue by proposing the use of
meta-learning to infer population-based black-box optimizers that can
automatically adapt to specific classes of problems. We suggest a general
modeling of population-based algorithms that result in Learning-to-Optimize
POMDP (LTO-POMDP), a meta-learning framework based on a specific partially
observable Markov decision process (POMDP). From that framework's formulation,
we propose to parameterize the algorithm using deep recurrent neural networks
and use a meta-loss function based on stochastic algorithms' performance to
train efficient data-driven optimizers over several related optimization tasks.
The learned optimizers' performance based on this implementation is assessed on
various black-box optimization tasks and hyperparameter tuning of machine
learning models. Our results revealed that the meta-loss function encourages a
learned algorithm to alter its search behavior so that it can easily fit into a
new context. Thus, it allows better generalization and higher sample efficiency
than state-of-the-art generic optimization algorithms, such as the Covariance
matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES).

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper documents an exploratory pilot study to define the term Autonomous
Entity, and any characteristics that are required to identify or classify an
Autonomous Entity. Our solution builds on previous work with regard to
philosophical and scientific classification methods but focuses on a novel
Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM) and model to help identify those
characteristics which make any autonomous entity similar or different from
others. We have solved the problem of not having an existing term to define our
lens by creating a new combinatorial term: &quot;Riskyishness&quot;. We present a DSRM
and instrument for initial investigation, as well as observational and
statistical descriptions of their use in the real world to solicit domain
expertise and statistical evidence. Further, we demonstrate a specific
application of the methodology by creating a second artifact - a tool to score
existing and future technologies based on Riskyishness. The first artifact also
provides a technique to disentangle miscellaneous existing technologies or add
dimensions to the tools to capture future additions and paradigm shifts.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The learned weights of a neural network have often been considered devoid of
scrutable internal structure. In this paper, however, we look for structure in
the form of clusterability: how well a network can be divided into groups of
neurons with strong internal connectivity but weak external connectivity. We
find that a trained neural network is typically more clusterable than randomly
initialized networks, and often clusterable relative to random networks with
the same distribution of weights. We also exhibit novel methods to promote
clusterability in neural network training, and find that in multi-layer
perceptrons they lead to more clusterable networks with little reduction in
accuracy. Understanding and controlling the clusterability of neural networks
will hopefully render their inner workings more interpretable to engineers by
facilitating partitioning into meaningful clusters.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human brain has been used as an inspiration for building autonomous agents,
but it is not obvious what level of computational description of the brain one
should use. This has led to overly opinionated symbolic approaches and overly
unstructured connectionist approaches. We propose that using homeostasis as the
computational description provides a good compromise. Similar to how
physiological homeostasis is the regulation of certain homeostatic variables,
cognition can be interpreted as the regulation of certain 'cognitive
homeostatic variables'. We present an outline of a Cognitive Homeostatic Agent,
built as a hierarchy of physiological and cognitive homeostatic subsystems and
describe structures and processes to guide future exploration. We expect this
to be a fruitful line of investigation towards building sophisticated
artificial agents that can act flexibly in complex environments, and produce
behaviors indicating planning, thinking and feelings.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Computations on the dendritic trees of neurons have important constraints.
Voltage dependent conductances in dendrites are not similar to arbitrary
direct-current generation, they are the basis for dendritic nonlinearities and
they do not allow converting positive currents into negative currents. While it
has been speculated that the dendritic tree of a neuron can be seen as a
multi-layer neural network and it has been shown that such an architecture
could be computationally strong, we do not know if that computational strength
is preserved under these biological constraints. Here we simulate models of
dendritic computation with and without these constraints. We find that
dendritic model performance on interesting machine learning tasks is not hurt
by these constraints but may benefit from them. Our results suggest that single
real dendritic trees may be able to learn a surprisingly broad range of tasks.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Gene-pool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm (GOMEA) is a model-based
EA framework that has been shown to perform well in several domains, including
Genetic Programming (GP). Differently from traditional EAs where variation acts
blindly, GOMEA learns a model of interdependencies within the genotype, i.e.,
the linkage, to estimate what patterns to propagate. In this article, we study
the role of Linkage Learning (LL) performed by GOMEA in Symbolic Regression
(SR). We show that the non-uniformity in the distribution of the genotype in GP
populations negatively biases LL, and propose a method to correct for this. We
also propose approaches to improve LL when ephemeral random constants are used.
Furthermore, we adapt a scheme of interleaving runs to alleviate the burden of
tuning the population size, a crucial parameter for LL, to SR. We run
experiments on 10 real-world datasets, enforcing a strict limitation on
solution size, to enable interpretability. We find that the new LL method
outperforms the standard one, and that GOMEA outperforms both traditional and
semantic GP. We also find that the small solutions evolved by GOMEA are
competitive with tuned decision trees, making GOMEA a promising new approach to
SR.

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Whether and how SARS-CoV-2 outbreak affected in-hospital acute stroke care system is still matter of debate. In the setting of the STROKOVID network, a collaborative project between the ten centers designed as hubs for the treatment of acute stroke during SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Lombardy, Italy, we retrospectively compared clinical features and process measures of patients with confirmed infection (COVID-19) and non-infected patients (non-COVID-19) who underwent reperfusion therapies for acute ischemic stroke. Between March 8 and April 30, 2020, 296 consecutive patients [median age, 74 years (interquartile range (IQR), 62–80.75); males, 154 (52.0%); 34 (11.5%) COVID-19] qualified for the analysis. Time from symptoms onset to treatment was longer in the COVID-19 group [230 (IQR 200.5–270) minutes vs. 190 (IQR 150–245) minutes; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.007], especially in the first half of the study period. Patients with COVID-19 who underwent endovascular thrombectomy had more frequently absent collaterals or collaterals filling ≤ 50% of the occluded territory (50.0% vs. 16.6%; OR 5.05; 95% CI 1.82–13.80) and a lower rate of good/complete recanalization of the primary arterial occlusive lesion (55.6% vs. 81.0%; OR 0.29; 95% CI 0.10–0.80). Post-procedural intracranial hemorrhages were more frequent (35.3% vs. 19.5%; OR 2.24; 95% CI 1.04–4.83) and outcome was worse among COVID-19 patients (in-hospital death, 38.2% vs. 8.8%; OR 6.43; 95% CI 2.85–14.50). Our findings showed longer delays in the intra-hospital management of acute ischemic stroke in COVID-19 patients, especially in the early phase of the outbreak, that likely impacted patients outcome and should be the target of future interventions.

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Does sonification of action simulation training impact corticospinal excitability and audiomotor plasticity?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00221-021-06069-w</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Sonification is a sensory augmentation strategy whereby a sound is associated with, and modulated by, movement. Evidence suggests that sonification could be a viable strategy to maximize learning and rehabilitation. Recent studies investigated sonification of action observation, reporting beneficial effects, especially in Parkinson’s disease. However, research on simulation training—a training regime based on action observation and motor imagery, in which actions are internally simulated, without physical execution—suggest that action observation alone is suboptimal, compared to the combined use of action observation and motor imagery. In this study, we explored the effects of sonified action observation and motor imagery on corticospinal excitability, as well as to evaluate the extent of practice-dependent plasticity induced by this training. Nineteen participants were recruited to complete a practice session based on combined and congruent action observation and motor imagery (AOMI) and physical imitation of the same action. Prior to the beginning, participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups, one group (nine participants) completed the practice block with sonified AOMI, while the other group (ten participants) completed the practice without extrinsic auditory information and served as control group. To investigate practice-induced plasticity, participants completed two auditory paired associative stimulation (aPAS) protocols, one completed after the practice block, and another one completed alone, without additional interventions, at least 7 days before the practice. After the practice block, both groups significantly increased their corticospinal excitability, but sonification did not exert additional benefits, compared to non-sonified conditions. In addition, aPAS significantly increased corticospinal excitability when completed alone, but when it was primed by a practice block, no modulatory effects on corticospinal excitability were found. It is possible that sonification of combined action observation and motor imagery may not be a useful strategy to improve corticospinal, but further studies are needed to explore its relationship with performance improvements. We also confirm the neuromodulatory effect of aPAS, but its interaction with audiomotor practice remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Monkey see, monkey tap: mimicry of movement dynamics during coordinated tapping</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Common social behaviors, such as having a conversation, dancing, or playing a team sport, require precise interpersonal coordination of action. One question that emerges in research on interpersonal coordination is to what extent individuals implicitly mimic the spatial characteristics of movements for tasks that emphasize movement timing. To investigate this question, we conducted two experiments using an interpersonal synchronization-continuation tapping paradigm in which pairs of individuals tapped with their index finger on a table in synchrony with an auditory metronome and then continued tapping at the same tempo when the metronome stopped. Pairs of individuals tapped either together with the instruction to maintain synchrony with each other (interpersonal tapping) or tapped alone (solo tapping). Solo tapping conditions either occurred with their tapping partner present in the testing room (Experiment 1) or absent (Experiment 2). We used motion capture to examine both the spatial and temporal aspects of movement dynamics during task performance. In both experiments, participants implicitly mimicked subtle aspects of spatial elements of their partner’s movements. The extent of finger extension (tap amplitude) and, in Experiment 1, duration of finger contact with the surface (dwell time) were correlated between tapping partners when they tapped together. In some cases, this spatial mimicry extended to solo tapping conditions, but only during solo tapping conditions that followed the interpersonal tapping task, and, to a lesser degree, when solo tapping after having observed the other participant solo tapping.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Sequential aiming in pairs: the multiple levels of joint action</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The task constraints imposed upon a co-actor can often influence our own actions. Likewise, the observation of somebody else’s movements can involuntarily contaminate the execution of our own movements. These joint action outcomes have rarely been considered in unison. The aim of the present study was to simultaneously examine the underlying processes contributing to joint action. We had pairs of participants work together to execute sequential aiming movements between two targets—the first person’s movement was contingent upon the anticipation of the second person’s movement (leader), while the second person’s movement was contingent upon the direct observation of the first person’s movement (follower). Participants executed separate blocks of two-target aiming movements under different contexts; that is, solely on their own using one (2T1L) and two (2T2L) of their upper limbs, or with another person (2T2P). The first movement segment generally indicated a more abrupt approach (shorter time after peak velocity, greater displacement and magnitude of peak velocity), which surprisingly coincided with lower spatial variability, for the 2T2P context. Meanwhile, the second segment indicated a similar kinematic profile as the first segment for the 2T2P context. The first movement of the leader appeared to accommodate the follower for their movement, while the second movement of the follower was primed by the observation of the leader’s movement. These findings collectively advocate two distinct levels of joint action including the anticipation (top–down) and mapping (bottom–up) of other people’s actions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: [18F]F13640, a 5-HT1A Receptor Radiopharmaceutical Sensitive to Brain Serotonin Fluctuations</title>

	<description>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Serotonin is involved in a variety of physiological functions and brain disorders. In this context, efforts have been made to investigate the in vivo fluctuations of this neurotransmitter using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging paradigms. Since serotonin is a full agonist, it binds preferentially to G-protein coupled receptors. In contrast, antagonist PET ligands additionally interact with uncoupled receptors. This could explain the lack of sensitivity to serotonin fluctuations of current 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt; radiopharmaceuticals which are mainly antagonists and suggests that agonist radiotracers would be more appropriate to measure changes in neurotransmitter release. The present study evaluated the sensitivity to endogenous serotonin release of a recently developed, selective 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor PET radiopharmaceutical, the agonist [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]F13640 (a.k.a. befiradol or NLX-112).&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;Four cats each underwent three PET scans with [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]F13640, i.e., a control PET scan of 90 min, a PET scan preceded 30 min before by an intravenous injection 1 mg/kg of d-fenfluramine, a serotonin releaser (blocking challenge), and a PET scan comprising the intravenous injection of 1 mg/kg of d-fenfluramine 30 min after the radiotracer injection (displacement challenge). Data were analyzed with regions of interest and voxel-based approaches. A lp-ntPET model approach was implemented to determine the dynamic of serotonin release during the challenge study.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;D-fenfluramine pretreatment elicited a massive inhibition of [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]F13640 labeling in regions known to express 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, e.g., raphe nuclei, hippocampus, thalamus, anterior cingulate cortex, caudate putamen, occipital, frontal and parietal cortices, and gray matter of cerebellum. Administration of d-fenfluramine during PET acquisition indicates changes in occupancy from 10% (thalamus) to 31% (gray matter of cerebellum) even though the dissociation rate of [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]F13640 over the 90 min acquisition time was modest. The lp-ntPET simulation succeeded in differentiating the control and challenge conditions.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The present findings demonstrate that labeling of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors with [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]F13640 is sensitive to serotonin concentration fluctuations in vivo. Although the data underline the need to perform longer PET scan to ensure accurate measure of displacement, they support clinical development of [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]F13640 as a tool to explore experimental paradigms involving physiological or pathological (neurological or neuropsychiatric pathologies) fluctuations of extracellular serotonin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Transcutaneous Auricular Neurostimulation (tAN): A Novel Adjuvant Treatment in Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.648556</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Maternal opioid use during pregnancy is a growing national problem and can lead to newborns developing neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) soon after birth. Recent data demonstrates that nearly every 15 min a baby is born in the United States suffering from NOWS. The primary treatment for NOWS is opioid replacement therapy, commonly oral morphine, which has neurotoxic effects on the developing brain. There is an urgent need for non-opioid treatments for NOWS. Transcutaneous auricular neurostimulation (tAN), a novel and non-invasive form of electrostimulation, may serve as a promising alternative to morphine. tAN is delivered via a multichannel earpiece electrode worn on and around the left ear, targeting two cranial nerves—the vagus and trigeminal nerves. Prior research suggests that auricular neurostimulation exerts an anxiolytic effect on the body by releasing endogenous opioids and reduces withdrawal symptoms in adults actively withdrawing from opioids. In this first-in-human prospective, open-label trial, we investigated tAN as an adjuvant to morphine therapy in eight infants &amp;gt;33 weeks gestational age suffering from NOWS and receiving oral morphine treatment. Infants received tAN for 30 min 1 h before receiving a morphine dose. tAN was delivered at 0.1 mA below perception intensity at two different nerve targets on the ear: Region 1, the auricular branch of the vagus nerve; and Region 2, the auriculotemporal nerve. tAN was delivered up to four times daily for a maximum of 12 days. The primary outcome measures were safety [heart rate monitoring, Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS), and skin irritation] and morphine length of treatment (LOT). tAN was well-tolerated and resulted in no unanticipated adverse events. Comparing to the national average of 23 days, the average oral morphine LOT was 13.3 days (median 9 days) and the average LOT after tAN initiation was 7 days (median 6 days). These preliminary data suggest that tAN is safe and may serve as a promising alternative adjuvant for treating NOWS and reducing the amount of time an infant receives oral morphine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Driving Skills of Individuals With and Without Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD/Dyspraxia)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Learning to drive is a significant event for the transition to adulthood and delay or avoidance may have social, practical, and psychological implications. For those with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD/Dyspraxia), driving presents a considerable challenge, and the literature shows that there are differences in driving ability between individuals with and without DCD. The aim of the current research is to further our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the driving experiences of individuals with DCD. Nineteen participants with DCD (10 drivers and 9 non-drivers) and 36 controls (17 drivers and 19 non-drivers) aged 18–57 years took part in this study. Participants completed standardized tests, questionnaires and a driving simulation task designed to measure speed, road positioning, and rate of change of steering in three conditions with increasing perceptual complexity. Results indicate that behaviors for all participants changed as the perceptual demands of the task increased. However, drivers with DCD were more affected than all other groups, driving more slowly, and driving further to the right. These findings illustrate how the impact of both internal and external constraints negatively affect the success of the driving task for individuals with DCD compared to their TD peers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Theta Oscillations and Source Connectivity During Complex Audiovisual Object Encoding in Working Memory</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Working memory is a limited capacity memory system that involves the short-term storage and processing of information. Neuroscientific studies of working memory have mostly focused on the essential roles of neural oscillations during item encoding from single sensory modalities (e.g., visual and auditory). However, the characteristics of neural oscillations during multisensory encoding in working memory are rarely studied. Our study investigated the oscillation characteristics of neural signals in scalp electrodes and mapped functional brain connectivity while participants encoded complex audiovisual objects in a working memory task. Experimental results showed that theta oscillations (4–8 Hz) were prominent and topographically distributed across multiple cortical regions, including prefrontal (e.g., superior frontal gyrus), parietal (e.g., precuneus), temporal (e.g., inferior temporal gyrus), and occipital (e.g., cuneus) cortices. Furthermore, neural connectivity at the theta oscillation frequency was significant in these cortical regions during audiovisual object encoding compared with single modality object encoding. These results suggest that local oscillations and interregional connectivity via theta activity play an important role during audiovisual object encoding and may contribute to the formation of working memory traces from multisensory items.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: A Novel Recurrent Neural Network to Classify EEG Signals for Customers' Decision-Making Behavior Prediction in Brand Extension Scenario</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.610890</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;It was meaningful to predict the customers' decision-making behavior in the field of market. However, due to individual differences and complex, non-linear natures of the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, it was hard to classify the EEG signals and to predict customers' decisions by using traditional classification methods. To solve the aforementioned problems, a recurrent t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) neural network was proposed in current study to classify the EEG signals in the designed brand extension paradigm and to predict the participants' decisions (whether to accept the brand extension or not). The recurrent t-SNE neural network contained two steps. In the first step, t-SNE algorithm was performed to extract features from EEG signals. Second, a recurrent neural network with long short-term memory (LSTM) layer, fully connected layer, and SoftMax layer was established to train the features, classify the EEG signals, as well as predict the cognitive performance. The proposed network could give a good prediction with accuracy around 87%. Its superior in prediction accuracy as compared to a recurrent principal component analysis (PCA) network, a recurrent independent component correlation algorithm [independent component analysis (ICA)] network, a t-SNE support vector machine (SVM) network, a t-SNE back propagation (BP) neural network, a deep LSTM neural network, and a convolutional neural network were also demonstrated. Moreover, the performance of the proposed network with different activated channels were also investigated and compared. The results showed that the proposed network could make a relatively good prediction with only 16 channels. The proposed network would become a potentially useful tool to help a company in making marketing decisions and to help uncover the neural mechanisms behind individuals' decision-making behavior with low cost and high efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Tangent Space Mapping (TSM) using the geometric structure of the covariance matrices is an effective method to recognize multiclass motor imagery (MI). Compared with the traditional CSP method, the Riemann geometric method based on TSM takes into account the nonlinear information contained in the covariance matrix, and can extract more abundant and effective features. Moreover, the method is an unsupervised operation, which can reduce the time of feature extraction. However, EEG features induced by MI mental activities of different subjects are not the same, so selection of subject-specific discriminative EEG frequency components play a vital role in the recognition of multiclass MI. In order to solve the problem, a discriminative and multi-scale filter bank tangent space mapping (DMFBTSM) algorithm is proposed in this article to design the subject-specific Filter Bank (FB) so as to effectively recognize multiclass MI tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: On the 4-class BCI competition IV-2a dataset, first, a non-parametric method of multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) based on the sum of squared distances is used to select discriminative frequency bands for a subject; next, a multi-scale FB is generated according to the range of these frequency bands, and then decompose multi-channel EEG of the subject into multiple sub-bands combined with several time windows. Then TSM algorithm is used to estimate Riemannian tangent space features in each sub-band and finally a liner Support Vector Machines (SVM) is used for classification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Main Results: The analysis results show that the proposed discriminative FB enhances the multi-scale TSM algorithm, improves the classification accuracy and reduces the execution time during training and testing. On the 4-class BCI competition IV-2a dataset, the average session to session classification accuracy of nine subjects reached 77.33 ± 12.3%. When the training time and the test time are similar, the average classification accuracy is 2.56% higher than the latest TSM method based on multi-scale filter bank analysis technology. When the classification accuracy is similar, the training speed is increased by more than three times, and the test speed is increased two times more. Compared with Supervised Fisher Geodesic Minimum Distance to the Mean (Supervised FGMDRM), another new variant based on Riemann geometry classifier, the average accuracy is 3.36% higher, we also compared with the latest Deep Learning method, and the average accuracy of 10-fold cross validation improved by 2.58%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Research shows that the proposed DMFBTSM algorithm can improve the classification accuracy of MI tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significance: Compared with the MFBTSM algorithm, the algorithm proposed in this article is expected to select frequency bands with good separability for specific subject to improve the classification accuracy of multiclass MI tasks and reduce the feature dimension to reduce training time and testing time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Directed acyclic graphs or Bayesian networks that are popular in many AI-related sectors for probabilistic inference and causal reasoning can be mapped to probabilistic circuits built out of probabilistic bits (p-bits), analogous to binary stochastic neurons of stochastic artificial neural networks. In order to satisfy standard statistical results, individual p-bits not only need to be updated sequentially but also in order from the parent to the child nodes, necessitating the use of sequencers in software implementations. In this article, we first use SPICE simulations to show that an autonomous hardware Bayesian network can operate correctly without any clocks or sequencers, but only if the individual p-bits are appropriately designed. We then present a simple behavioral model of the autonomous hardware illustrating the essential characteristics needed for correct sequencer-free operation. This model is also benchmarked against SPICE simulations and can be used to simulate large-scale networks. Our results could be useful in the design of hardware accelerators that use energy-efficient building blocks suited for low-level implementations of Bayesian networks. The autonomous massively parallel operation of our proposed stochastic hardware has biological relevance since neural dynamics in brain is also stochastic and autonomous by nature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Impact of Estrogen and Estrogen-Like Molecules in Neurogenesis and Neurodegeneration: Beneficial or Harmful?</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Estrogens and estrogen-like molecules can modify the biology of several cell types. Estrogen receptors alpha (ERα) and beta (ERβ) belong to the so-called classical family of estrogen receptors, while the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER-1) represents a non-classical estrogen receptor mainly located in the plasma membrane. As estrogen receptors are ubiquitously distributed, they can modulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival in several tissues and organs, including the central nervous system (CNS). Estrogens can exert neuroprotective roles by acting as anti-oxidants, promoting DNA repair, inducing the expression of growth factors, and modulating cerebral blood flow. Additionally, estrogen-dependent signaling pathways are involved in regulating the balance between proliferation and differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs), thus influencing neurogenic processes. Since several estrogen-based therapies are used nowadays and estrogen-like molecules, including phytoestrogens and xenoestrogens, are omnipresent in our environment, estrogen-dependent changes in cell biology and tissue homeostasis have gained attention in human health and disease. This article provides a comprehensive literature review on the current knowledge of estrogen and estrogen-like molecules and their impact on cell survival and neurodegeneration, as well as their role in NSPCs proliferation/differentiation balance and neurogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Mitochondrial Behavior in Axon Degeneration and Regeneration</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria are organelles responsible for bioenergetic metabolism, calcium homeostasis, and signal transmission essential for neurons due to their high energy consumption. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that mitochondria play a key role in axon degeneration and regeneration under physiological and pathological conditions. Mitochondrial dysfunction occurs at an early stage of axon degeneration and involves oxidative stress, energy deficiency, imbalance of mitochondrial dynamics, defects in mitochondrial transport, and mitophagy dysregulation. The restoration of these defective mitochondria by enhancing mitochondrial transport, clearance of reactive oxidative species (ROS), and improving bioenergetic can greatly contribute to axon regeneration. In this paper, we focus on the biological behavior of axonal mitochondria in aging, injury (e.g., traumatic brain and spinal cord injury), and neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, AD; Parkinson's disease, PD; Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ALS) and consider the role of mitochondria in axon regeneration. We also compare the behavior of mitochondria in different diseases and outline novel therapeutic strategies for addressing abnormal mitochondrial biological behavior to promote axonal regeneration in neurological diseases and injuries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Emerging Role of Neuropeptides in Parkinson’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD), the second most common age-related neurodegenerative disease, results from the loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra. This disease is characterized by cardinal non-motor and motor symptoms. Several studies have demonstrated that neuropeptides, such as ghrelin, neuropeptide Y, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide, substance P, and neurotensin, are related to the onset of PD. This review mainly describes the changes in these neuropeptides and their receptors in the substantia nigra-striatum system as well as the other PD-related brain regions. Based on several in vitro and in vivo studies, most neuropeptides play a significant neuroprotective role in PD by preventing caspase-3 activation, decreasing mitochondrial-related oxidative stress, increasing mitochondrial biogenesis, inhibiting microglial activation, and anti-autophagic activity. Thus, neuropeptides may provide a new strategy for PD therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Dl-3-n-Butylphthalide Alleviates Demyelination and Improves Cognitive Function by Promoting Mitochondrial Dynamics in White Matter Lesions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.632374</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;White matter lesions (WMLs) are a type of cerebrovascular disorder accompanied by demyelination and cognitive decline. Dl-3-n-butylphthalide (D1-NBP) is a neuroprotective drug used for the treatment of ischemic cerebrovascular diseases, although the function of DI-NBP on WML is still not clear. This study aims to investigate whether DI-NBP affects cognitive function and ameliorates demyelination in a model of WML. The bilateral carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) mouse model and in vitro brain slice cultures with low glucose and low oxygen (LGLO) treatment were adopted. The Dl-NBP was administered intragastrically for 28 days after BCAS or added at a dose of 50 μm for 48 h after LGLO. Spatial learning and memory were evaluated by an eight-arm radial maze. Demyelination was detected using a TEM. Mitochondrial dynamics were assessed by time-lapse imaging in the cultured brain slices. The function of the synapse was evaluated by the patch clamp technique. In BCAS mice, obvious demyelination and cognitive decline were observed, while both were significantly relieved by a high-dose D1-NBP treatment (100 mg/kg). Along with demyelination, mitochondrial accumulation in the axons was significantly increased in the BCAS mice model, but with the treatment of a high-dose D1-NBP, mitochondrial accumulation was mitigated, and the anterograde/retrograde transport of mitochondria was increased. Following the improved anterograde/retrograde transport of mitochondria, the synapse activity was significantly upregulated while the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was remarkably decreased in the cultured brain slices. In addition, we identified syntaphilin (SNPH) as the downstream target of D1-NBP. The overexpression of SNPH mediated the effects of D1-NBP in mitigating axonal mitochondrial accumulation. In conclusion, the D1-NBP treatment significantly relieved demyelination and improved spatial learning and memory in the WML model by promoting mitochondrial dynamics. These neuroprotective effects of D1-NBP were mediated by inhibiting the mitochondrial arching protein, SNPH, which provided a potential therapeutic target for WML.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Exercise and Fitness Neuroprotective Effects: Molecular, Brain Volume and Psychological Correlates and Their Mediating Role in Healthy Late-Middle-Aged Women and Men</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.615247</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.615247</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Although exercise is known to have a neuroprotective effect in aging, the mediators underlying the exercise-cognition association remain poorly understood. In this paper we aimed to study the molecular, brain, and behavioral changes related to physical activity and their potential role as mediators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We obtained demographic, physical activity outcomes [sportive physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF)], plasma biomarkers (TNF-α, ICAM-1, HGF, SDF1-α, and BDNF), structural-MRI (brain volume areas), psychological and sleep health (mood, depressive and distress symptoms, and sleep quality), and multi-domain cognitive data from 115 adults aged 50–70 years. We conducted linear regression models and mediation analyses stratifying results by sex in a final sample of 104 individuals [65 women (age = 56.75 ± 4.96) and 39 men (age = 58.59 ± 5.86)].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Women engaging in greater amounts of exercising showed lower TNF-α levels and greater dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and temporal lobe volumes. Men engaging in greater amounts of exercise showed greater temporal lobe volumes. CRF levels were not related to any of the analyzed outcomes in women but in men higher CRF was associated with lower TNF-α, HGF and ventricle volumes, greater volume of temporal and parietal lobes and fewer depressive symptoms and better mood. In men, reduced TNF-α and HGF levels mediated brain and cognitive CRF-related benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our results show that exercise is a promising approach for influencing inflammation and brain volume and also contributes to ongoing discussions about the physiological mediators for the association between CRF and cognition in men.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Multiple time-scales of decision making in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex</title>

	<description>The prefrontal cortex and hippocampus are crucial for memory-guided decision-making. Neural activity in the hippocampus exhibits place-cell sequences at multiple timescales, including slow behavioral sequences (~seconds) and fast theta sequences (~100-200 ms) within theta oscillation cycles. How prefrontal ensembles interact with hippocampal sequences to support decision-making is unclear. Here, we examined simultaneous hippocampal and prefrontal ensemble activity in rats during learning of a spatial working-memory decision task. We found clear theta sequences in prefrontal cortex, nested within its behavioral sequences. In both regions, behavioral sequences maintained representations of current choices during navigation. In contrast, hippocampal theta sequences encoded alternatives for deliberation, and were coordinated with prefrontal theta sequences that predicted upcoming choices. During error trials, these representations were preserved to guide ongoing behavior, whereas replay sequences during inter-trial periods were impaired prior to navigation. These results establish cooperative interaction between hippocampal and prefrontal sequences at multiple timescales for memory-guided decision-making.</description>

	<description>Gene expression levels are influenced by multiple coexisting molecular mechanisms. Some of these interactions, such as those of transcription factors and promoters have been studied extensively. However, predicting phenotypes of gene regulatory networks remains a major challenge. Here, we use a well-defined synthetic gene regulatory network to study in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; how network phenotypes depend on local genetic context, i.e. the genetic neighborhood of a transcription factor and its relative position. We show that one gene regulatory network with fixed topology can display not only quantitatively but also qualitatively different phenotypes, depending solely on the local genetic context of its components. Transcriptional read-through is the main molecular mechanism that places one transcriptional unit within two separate regulons without the need for complex regulatory sequences. We propose that relative order of individual transcriptional units, with its potential for combinatorial complexity, plays an important role in shaping phenotypes of gene regulatory networks.</description>

	<title>eLife: HPF1 and nucleosomes mediate a dramatic switch in activity of PARP1 from polymerase to hydrolase</title>

	<description>Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) is an important player in the response to DNA damage. Recently, histone PARylation factor (HPF1) was shown to be a critical modulator of the activity of PARP1 by facilitating PARylation of histones and redirecting the target amino acid specificity from acidic to serine residues. Here we investigate the mechanism and specific consequences of HPF1-mediated PARylation using nucleosomes as both activators and substrates for PARP1. HPF1 provides that catalytic base Glu284 to substantially redirect PARylation by PARP1 such that the histones in nucleosomes become the primary recipients of PAR chains. Surprisingly, HPF1 partitions most of the reaction product to free ADPR, resulting in much shorter PAR chains compared to reactions in the absence of HPF1. This HPF1-mediated switch from polymerase to hydrolase has important implications for the PARP1-mediated response to DNA damage and raises interesting new questions about the role of intracellular ADPR and depletion of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.</description>

	<description>Methods for measuring gut microbiota biochemical activities in vivo are needed to characterize its functional states in health and disease. To illustrate one approach, an arabinan-containing polysaccharide was isolated from pea fiber, its structure defined, and forward genetic and proteomic analyses used to compare its effects, versus unfractionated pea fiber and sugar beet arabinan, on a human gut bacterial strain consortium in gnotobiotic mice. We produced ‘Microbiota Functional Activity Biosensors’ (MFABs) consisting of glycans covalently linked to the surface of fluorescent paramagnetic microscopic glass beads. Three MFABs, each containing a unique glycan/fluorophore combination, were simultaneously orally gavaged into gnotobiotic mice, recovered from their intestines, and analyzed to directly quantify bacterial metabolism of structurally distinct arabinans in different human diet contexts. Colocalizing pea-fiber arabinan and another polysaccharide (glucomannan) on the bead surface enhanced in vivo degradation of glucomannan. MFABs represent a potentially versatile platform for developing new prebiotics and more nutritious foods.</description>

	<description>Extensive fibrin deposition in the lungs and altered levels of circulating blood coagulation proteins in COVID-19 patients imply local derangement of pathways that limit fibrin formation and/or promote its clearance. We examined transcriptional profiles of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples to identify molecular mechanisms underlying these coagulopathies. mRNA levels for regulators of the kallikrein-kinin (C1-inhibitor), coagulation (thrombomodulin, endothelial protein C receptor), and fibrinolytic (urokinase and urokinase receptor) pathways were significantly reduced in COVID-19 patients. While transcripts for several coagulation proteins were increased, those encoding tissue factor, the protein that initiates coagulation and whose expression is frequently increased in inflammatory disorders, were not increased in BALF from COVID-19 patients. Our analysis implicates enhanced propagation of coagulation and decreased fibrinolysis as drivers of the coagulopathy in the lungs of COVID-19 patients.</description>

	<title>eLife: The neural basis of intelligence in fine-grained cortical topographies</title>

	<description>Intelligent thought is the product of efficient neural information processing, which is embedded in fine-grained, topographically-organized population responses and supported by fine-grained patterns of connectivity among cortical fields. Previous work on the neural basis of intelligence, however, has focused on coarse-grained features of brain anatomy and function, because cortical topographies are highly idiosyncratic at a finer scale, obscuring individual differences in fine-grained connectivity patterns. We used a computational algorithm, hyperalignment, to resolve these topographic idiosyncrasies, and found that predictions of general intelligence based on fine-grained (vertex-by-vertex) connectivity patterns were markedly stronger than predictions based on coarse-grained (region-by-region) patterns. Intelligence was best predicted by fine-grained connectivity in the default and frontoparietal cortical systems, both of which are associated with self-generated thought. Previous work overlooked fine-grained architecture because existing methods couldn't resolve idiosyncratic topographies, preventing investigation where the keys to the neural basis of intelligence are more likely to be found.</description>

	<title>eLife: Structural basis for human TRPC5 channel inhibition by two distinct inhibitors</title>

	<description>TRPC5 channel is a non-selective cation channel that participates diverse physiological processes. TRPC5 inhibitors show promise in the treatment of anxiety disorder, depression and kidney disease. However, the binding sites and inhibitory mechanism of TRPC5 inhibitors remain elusive. Here we present the cryo-EM structures of human TRPC5 in complex with two distinct inhibitors, namely clemizole and HC-070, to the resolution of 2.7 Å. The structures reveal that clemizole binds inside the voltage sensor-like domain of each subunit. In contrast, HC-070 is wedged between adjacent subunits and replaces the glycerol group of a putative DAG molecule near the extracellular side. Moreover, we found mutations in the inhibitor binding pockets altered the potency of inhibitors. These structures suggest that both clemizole and HC-070 exert the inhibitory functions by stabilizing the ion channel in a non-conductive closed state. These results pave the way for further design and optimization of inhibitors targeting human TRPC5.</description>

	<description>Eukaryotic DNA replication initiates during S phase from origins that have been licensed in the preceding G1 phase. Here, we compare ChIP-seq profiles of the licensing factors Orc2, Orc3, Mcm3, and Mcm7 with gene expression, replication timing and fork directionality profiles obtained by RNA-seq, Repli-seq and OK-seq. ORC and MCM are significantly and homogeneously depleted from transcribed genes, enriched at gene promoters, and more abundant in early- than in late-replicating domains. Surprisingly, after controlling these variables, no difference in ORC/MCM density is detected between initiation zones, termination zones, unidirectionally replicating and randomly replicating regions. Therefore, ORC/MCM density correlates with replication timing but does not solely regulate the probability of replication initiation. Interestingly, H4K20me3, a histone modification proposed to facilitate late origin licensing, was enriched in late replicating initiation zones and gene deserts of stochastic replication fork direction. We discuss potential mechanisms specifying when and where replication initiates in human cells.</description>

	<title>eLife: Sub-minute prediction of brain temperature based on sleep–wake state in the mouse</title>

	<description>Although brain temperature has neurobiological and clinical importance, it remains unclear which factors contribute to its daily dynamics and to what extent. Using a statistical approach, we previously demonstrated that hourly brain temperature values co-varied strongly with time spent awake (Hoekstra et al., 2019). Here we develop and make available a mathematical tool to simulate and predict cortical temperature in mice based on a 4-s sleep–wake sequence. Our model estimated cortical temperature with remarkable precision and accounted for 91% of the variance based on three factors: sleep–wake sequence, time-of-day (‘circadian’), and a novel ‘prior wake prevalence’ factor, contributing with 74%, 9%, and 43%, respectively (including shared variance). We applied these optimized parameters to an independent cohort of mice and predicted cortical temperature with similar accuracy. This model confirms the profound influence of sleep–wake state on brain temperature, and can be harnessed to differentiate between thermoregulatory and sleep–wake-driven effects in experiments affecting both.</description>

	<description>A hallmark of adaptive immunity is CD4 T cells’ ability to differentiate into specialized effectors. A long-standing question is whether T cell receptor (TCR) signal strength can dominantly instruct the development of Th1 and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells across distinct infectious contexts. We characterized the differentiation of murine CD4 TCR transgenic T cells responding to altered peptide ligand lymphocytic choriomeningitis viruses (LCMV) derived from acute and chronic parental strains. We found that TCR signal strength exerts opposite and hierarchical effects on the balance of Th1 and Tfh cells responding to acute versus persistent infection. TCR signal strength correlates positively with Th1 generation during acute but negatively during chronic infection. Weakly activated T cells express lower levels of markers associated with chronic T cell stimulation and may resist functional inactivation. We anticipate that the panel of recombinant viruses described herein will be valuable for investigating a wide range of CD4 T cell responses.</description>

	<description>Fluorescent calcium indicators are often used to investigate neural dynamics, but the relationship between fluorescence and action potentials (APs) remains unclear. Most APs can be detected when the soma almost fills the microscope's field of view, but calcium indicators are often used to image populations of neurons, necessitating a large field of view, generating fewer photons per neuron, and compromising AP detection. Here we characterized the AP-fluorescence transfer function &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt;for 48 layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in primary visual cortex, with simultaneous calcium imaging and cell-attached recordings from transgenic mice expressing GCaMP6s or GCaMP6f. While most APs were detected under optimal conditions, under conditions typical of population imaging studies only a minority of 1AP and 2AP events were detected (often &amp;lt;10% and ~20-30%, respectively), emphasizing the limits of AP detection under more realistic imaging conditions.</description>

	<description>Oxidative stress is thought to be a major contributor to aging processes. Here, we report differential effects on neurotransmission caused by loss-of-function mutations of Superoxide dismutase (Sod) and by paraquat (PQ) feeding in Drosophila. We demonstrated alterations in Sod mutants; the larval neuromuscular junction displayed supernumerary discharges and the adult giant-fiber escape pathway showed increased latency and poor response to repetitive high-frequency stimulation. Even though the concentrations used led to motor coordination defects and lethality, PQ feeding failed to reproduce such performance deficits in these larval and adult preparations, indicating mechanistic distinctions between genetic and pharmacological manipulation of oxidative stress.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Aerodynamics and motor control of ultrasonic vocalizations for social communication in mice and rats</title>

	<description>Rodent ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are crucial to their social communication and a widely used translational tool for linking gene mutations to behavior. To maximize the causal interpretation of experimental treatments, we need to understand how neural control affects USV production. However, both the aerodynamics of USV production and its neural control remain poorly understood. Here we test three intralaryngeal whistle mechanisms - the wall and alar edge impingement, and shallow cavity tone - by combining in vitro larynx physiology and individual-based 3D airway reconstructions with fluid dynamics simulations. Our results show that in the mouse and rat larynx USVs are produced by a glottal jet impinging on the thyroid inner wall. Furthermore, we implemented an empirically based motor control model that predicts motor gesture trajectories of USV call types. Our work provides a quantitative neuromechanical framework to evaluate the contributions of brain and body in shaping USVs, and a first step in linking descending motor control to USV production.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Is galactose a hormetic sugar? Evidence from rat hippocampal redox regulatory network</title>

	<description>Galactose is a ubiquitous simple monosaccharide with yet incompletely understood biochemical and physiological role. Most of what we currently know about galactose is based on induction from the research on inherited disorders of galactose metabolism and animal models that exploit galactose-induced oxidative stress to model aging in rodents, however, recent evidence also demonstrates unique properties of galactose to conserve cellular function during the periods of starvation, and prevent and alleviate cognitive deficits in a rat model of sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Here, we try to understand the molecular background of both detrimental and beneficial effects of galactose by exploring the acute systemic and hippocampal biochemical changes upon oral administration of galactose solution focusing primarily on the components of the redox regulatory network (RRN). Although orogastric gavage of galactose solution (200 mg/kg) was insufficient to induce systemic RRN disbalance in the first two hours upon administration, analysis of hippocampal RRN revealed a mild pro-oxidative shift accompanied by a paradoxical increase in tissue reductive capacity, suggesting overcompensation of endogenous antioxidant systems in the response to the pro-oxidative stimulus. The more thorough analysis revealed that galactose-induced increment of reductive capacity was accompanied by inflation of the hippocampal pool of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphates indicating ROS detoxification through disinhibition of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway flux, reduced neuronal activity, and upregulation of Leloir pathway gatekeeper enzyme galactokinase-1. Based on the observed findings, and in the context of previous work on galactose, we propose a hormetic hypothesis of galactose action suggesting that the protective effects of galactose might be inseparable from its pro-oxidative effects at the biochemical level.</description>

	<description>Projections from the basal amygdala (BA) to the ventral hippocampus (vH) are proposed to provide information about the rewarding or threatening nature of learned associations to support appropriate goal-directed and anxiety-like behaviour. Such behaviour occurs via the differential activity of multiple, parallel populations of pyramidal neurons in vH that project to distinct downstream targets, but the nature of BA input and how it connects with these populations is unclear. Using channelrhodopsin-2-assisted circuit mapping in mice, we show that BA input to vH consists of both excitatory and inhibitory projections. Excitatory input specifically targets BA- and nucleus accumbens-projecting vH neurons, and avoids prefrontal cortex-projecting vH neurons; while inhibitory input preferentially targets BA-projecting neurons. Through this specific connectivity, BA inhibitory projections gate place-value associations by controlling the activity of nucleus accumbens-projecting vH neurons. Our results define a parallel excitatory and inhibitory projection from BA to vH that can support goal-directed behaviour.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Probing adaptation and spontaneous firing in human auditory-nerve fibers with far-field peri-stimulus time responses</title>

	<description>Information in sound stimuli is conveyed from sensory hair cells to the cochlear nuclei by the firing of auditory nerve fibers (ANFs). For obvious ethical reasons, single unit recordings from the cochlear nerve have never been performed in human, thus functional hallmarks of ANFs are unknown. By filtering and rectifying the electrical signal recorded at the round window of gerbil cochleae, we reconstructed a peri-stimulus time response (PSTR), with a waveform similar to the peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs) recorded from single ANFs. Pair-by-pair analysis of simultaneous PSTR and PSTH recordings in gerbil provided a model to predict the rapid adaptation and spontaneous discharge rates (SR) in a population of ANFs according to their location in the cochlea. We then probed the model in the mouse, in which the SR-based distribution of ANFs differs from the gerbil. We show that the PSTR-based predictions of the rapid adaptation time constant and mean SR across frequency again matched those obtained by recordings from single ANFs. Using PSTR recorded from the human cochlear nerve in 8 normal-hearing patients who underwent cerebellopontine angle surgeries for a functional cranial-nerve disorders (trigeminal neuralgia or hemifacial spasm), we predicted a rapid adaptation of about 3 milliseconds and a mean SR of 23 spikes/s in the 4 kHz frequency range in human ANFs. Together, our results support the use of PSTR as a promising diagnostic tool to map the auditory nerve in humans, thus opening new avenues to better understanding neuropathies, tinnitus, and hyperacusis.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The developing brain structural and functional connectome fingerprint</title>

	<description>In the mature brain, structural and functional fingerprints of brain connectivity can be used to identify the uniqueness of an individual. However, whether the characteristics that make a given brain distinguishable from others already exist at birth remains unknown. Here, we used neuroimaging data from the developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) of preterm born neonates who were scanned twice during the perinatal period to assess the developing brain fingerprint. We found that 62% of the participants could be identified based on the congruence of the later structural connectome to the initial connectivity matrix derived from the earlier timepoint. In contrast, similarity between functional connectomes of the same subject at different time points was low. Only 12% of the participants showed greater self-similarity in comparison to self-to-other-similarity for the functional connectome. These suggests that structural connectivity is more stable in early life and can represent a potential connectome fingerprint of the individual. In contrast, the functional connectome is highly dynamic at this developmental time. Thus, a relatively stable structural connectome appears to support a changing functional connectome at a time when neonates must rapidly acquire new skills to adapt to their new environment.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Regulation of coordinated muscular relaxation by a pattern-generating intersegmental circuit</title>

	<description>Typical patterned movements in animals are achieved through combinations of contraction and delayed relaxation of groups of muscles. However, how intersegmentally coordinated patterns of muscular relaxation are regulated by the neural circuits remain poorly understood. Here, we identify Canon, a class of higher-order premotor interneurons, that regulates muscular relaxation during backward locomotion of Drosophila larvae. Canon neurons are cholinergic interneurons present in each abdominal neuromere and show wave-like activity during fictive backward locomotion. Optogenetic activation of Canon neurons induces relaxation of body wall muscles, whereas inhibition of these neurons disrupts timely muscle relaxation. Canon neurons provide excitatory outputs to inhibitory premotor interneurons. Canon neurons also connect with each other to form an intersegmental circuit and regulate their own wave-like activities. Thus, our results demonstrate how coordinated muscle relaxation can be realized by an intersegmental circuit that regulates its own patterned activity and sequentially terminates motor activities along the anterior-posterior axis.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Differential Roles of Positive and Negative Valence Systems in the Development of Post-Traumatic Stress Psychopathology</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.434335v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.434335v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Negative and positive valence systems (NVS and PVS) pertain to processing of aversive and rewarding stimuli, respectively. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) has been typically associated with abnormalities of the NVS, mostly related to heightened threat processing, yet more recent work also suggests deficits in PVS functionality in PTSD, mainly in the form of reduced reward functioning. The current study examined the hypothesis that individuals' ability to recover from a potentially traumatic event relies on promoting reward-seeking behaviors (i.e., PVS) alongside diminished threat assessment (i.e., NVS), during the first year following trauma, a critical period for PTSD development or recovery. To do so, we longitudinally tracked behavioral and neural responses among 171 adult civilians with early post-traumatic stress symptoms at 1-, 6- and 14-months following trauma exposure (TP1, TP2, and TP3, respectively). At each time-point, participants played a naturalistic game encompassing dynamic provocation of risk-taking, punishments and rewards in an fMRI setting. Results showed that greater amygdala activation and functional connectivity with the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) in response to punishments (i.e., hyperactive NVS) at TP1 were associated with more severe post-traumatic stress symptoms at both TP1 and TP3 (but not at TP2), and specifically with more hyperarousal and intrusion symptoms. On the other hand, decreased ventral striatum (VS) activity and functional connectivity with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) in response to rewards (i.e., hypoactive PVS) at TP1 were associated with more severe post-traumatic stress symptoms at TP3 (but not at TP1 or TP2), and specifically with more avoidance symptoms. Explainable machine learning revealed the primacy of the PVS over the NVS at TP1 in predicting PTSD symptom development from TP1 to TP3. Behaviorally, fewer risky choices in the task were associated with more severe symptoms at TP1, but not at TP2 or TP3. Finally, an integrative exploratory analysis revealed that reduction in risky choices in the task (from TP1 to TP2) moderated the relation between NVS hyperactivity at TP1 and symptom severity at TP3. Altogether, our results support the idea that trauma exposure might alter both NVS and PVS processing. While NVS presents early heightened saliency processing in the immediate aftermath of trauma, early PVS only affects the long-term outcome of traumatic stress. These insights inform possible mechanism-driven therapeutic strategies for PTSD, addressing not only negative but also positive valence processing.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neurology: Is postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) a central nervous system disorder?</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), a disorder of the autonomic nervous system characterized by a rise in heart rate of at least 30 bpm from supine to standing position, has been traditionally viewed as a dysfunction of the peripheral nervous system. However, recent studies and evidence from overlapping conditions suggest that in addition to being considered a disorder of the peripheral nervous system, POTS should be viewed also as a central nervous system (CNS) disorder given (1) significant CNS symptom burden in patients with POTS; (2) structural and functional differences found on neuroimaging in patients with POTS and other forms of orthostatic intolerance; (3) evidence of cerebral hypoperfusion and possible alteration in cerebrospinal fluid volume, and (4) positive response to medications targeting the CNS and non-pharmacologic CNS therapies. This review outlines existing evidence of POTS as a CNS disorder and proposes a hypothetical model combining key mechanisms in the pathophysiology of POTS. Redefining POTS as a CNS disorder can lead to new possibilities in pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacologic therapeutic interventions in patents affected by this disabling syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To describe patient characteristics and assess the risk of disability worsening in patients of different age groups with focus on late-onset multiple sclerosis (LOMS) defined as disease onset after the age of 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The nationwide population-based Danish Multiple Sclerosis Registry served as data source. We described baseline characteristics and analyzed rates of reaching Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) milestones.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We identified 28,232 patients with MS with a known year of clinical onset, of which 2661 had LOMS. The LOMS group had a higher proportion of males and patients with primary progressive disease course, and they were less likely to receive disease-modifying therapy. The initial rate of reaching EDSS milestone 6 after diagnosis was higher in LOMS [hazard ratio (HR) 1.53; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14–2.06]; however, when assessing the risk of reaching EDSS 6 according to age, the HR was significantly lower for the LOMS group (HR 0.307; 95% CI 0.221–0.426).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The clinical characteristics and treatment approaches for patients with LOMS differ from their younger counterparts. Following diagnosis, patients with LOMS initially have an increased rate of reaching EDSS score 6; however, the risk of reaching EDSS score 6 at any given age is higher in patients with non-LOMS.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: The two-point discrimination threshold depends both on the stimulation noxiousness and modality</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The two-point discrimination threshold (2PDT) has been used to investigate the integration of sensory information, especially in relation to spatial acuity. The 2PDT has been investigated for both innocuous mechanical stimuli and noxious thermal stimuli; however, previous studies used different stimulation modalities to compare innocuous and noxious stimuli. This study investigated the 2PDT in 19 healthy participants, using both thermal (laser) and mechanical stimulation modalities. Within each modality, both innocuous and noxious intensities were applied. Concurrent point stimuli were applied to the right volar forearm, with separation distances of 0–120 mm, in steps of 10 mm. 0 mm corresponds to a single point. Following each stimulus, the participants indicated the number of perceived points (1 or 2) and the perceived intensity (NRS: 0: no perception, 3: pain threshold, 10: maximum pain). The order of stimulation modality, intensity and distance was randomized. The 2PDT for innocuous and noxious mechanical stimuli was 34.7 mm and 47.1 mm, respectively. For thermal stimuli, the 2PDT was 80.5 mm for innocuous stimuli and 66.9 mm for noxious stimuli. The average NRS for thermal stimuli was 1.6 for innocuous intensities and 4.0 for noxious intensities, while for mechanical stimuli, the average NRS was 0.9 for innocuous intensities and 3.6 for noxious intensities. This study showed that the 2PDT highly depends on both stimulation modality and intensity. Within each modality, noxious intensities modulates the 2PDT differently, i.e., noxious intensities lowers the 2PDT for thermal stimuli, but increases the 2PDT for mechanical stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Negative polarity in quantifiers evokes greater activation in language-related regions compared to negative polarity in adjectives</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The processing of sentences with negative quantifiers (e.g., &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;few&lt;/em&gt;) is more costly than of sentences that contain their positive counterparts (e.g., &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;many&lt;/em&gt;). While this polarity effect is robust and reliably replicable, its neurological bases are not well understood. In this study, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm for 30 participants to assess the polarity effect in sentences with polar quantifiers, and compare it with the polarity effect of polar adjectives. Both in quantifiers and in adjectives, the polarity effect manifests in the anterior insula bilaterally. The polarity effect in quantifiers, however, shows greater activation in the left hemisphere than it does for adjectives. In particular, left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and left superior temporal sulcus (STS) show increased activation for polarity in quantifiers than in adjectives, which is the evidence for the specific involvement of the language network in this type of polarity processing.

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Daphnetin, a natural coumarin averts reserpine-induced fibromyalgia in mice: modulation of MAO-A</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Fibromyalgia is a common, chronic, and generalized pain syndrome that is often associated with comorbid depression. The etiology of fibromyalgia is complex; most researchers have documented that the hallmark symptoms are due to the central nervous system’s abnormal functioning. Neurotransmitters such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and glutamate, have been reported to be key regulators of fibromyalgia syndrome. Daphnetin is a 7, 8 dihydroxy coumarin widely distributed in Thymelaeaceae family plants, possessing various activities such as anti-arthritic, anti-tumor, anti-malarial, and anti-parasitic. The present study was designed to explore the potential of daphnetin against reserpine-induced fibromyalgia in mice. In mice, a fibromyalgia-like state was achieved by injecting reserpine (0.5 mg/kg, s.c) continuously for 3 days. All behavioral tests were conducted on the 4th and 6th day of experimentation. Reserpine administration significantly increased the mechanical hypersensitivity in electronic von Frey (eVF) and pressure application measurement (PAM) tests. It also increased the immobility period and time to reach the platform in force swim test (FST) and Morris water maze (MWM) test, respectively. In the biochemical analysis, reserpine treatment upregulated the monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) activity and level of glutamate, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). Whereas, it decreased the level of glutathione (GSH), dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. Daphnetin pretreatment attenuated the behavioral and biochemical changes induced by reserpine. Thus, the current investigation results delineate that daphnetin might exert its protective effect by inhibiting inflammatory stress and MAO-A-mediated neurotransmitter depletion and oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Postictal Death Is Associated with Tonic Phase Apnea in a Mouse Model of Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26053</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26053?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is an unpredictable and devastating comorbidity of epilepsy that is believed to be due to cardiorespiratory failure immediately after generalized convulsive seizures.


Methods
We performed cardiorespiratory monitoring of seizure‐induced death in mice carrying either a p.Arg1872Trp or p.Asn1768Asp mutation in a single Scn8a allele—mutations identified from patients who died from SUDEP—and of seizure‐induced death in pentylenetetrazole‐treated wild‐type mice.


Results
The primary cause of seizure‐induced death for all mice was apnea, as (1) apnea began during a seizure and continued for tens of minutes until terminal asystole, and (2) death was prevented by mechanical ventilation. Fatal seizures always included a tonic phase that was coincident with apnea. This tonic phase apnea was not sufficient to produce death, as it also occurred during many nonfatal seizures; however, all seizures that were fatal had tonic phase apnea. We also made the novel observation that continuous tonic diaphragm contraction occurred during tonic phase apnea, which likely contributes to apnea by preventing exhalation, and this was only fatal when breathing did not resume after the tonic phase ended. Finally, recorded seizures from a patient with developmental epileptic encephalopathy with a previously undocumented SCN8A likely pathogenic variant (p.Leu257Val) revealed similarities to those of the mice, namely, an extended tonic phase that was accompanied by apnea.


Interpretation
We conclude that apnea coincident with the tonic phase of a seizure, and subsequent failure to resume breathing, are the determining events that cause seizure‐induced death in Scn8a mutant mice. ANN NEUROL 2021</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Common X‐Chromosome Variants Are Associated with Parkinson Disease Risk</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26051</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26051?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
The objective of this study was to identify genetic variants on the X‐chromosome associated with Parkinson disease (PD) risk.


Methods
We performed an X‐chromosome–wide association study (XWAS) of PD risk by meta‐analyzing results from sex‐stratified analyses. To avoid spurious associations, we designed a specific harmonization pipeline for the X‐chromosome and focused on a European ancestry sample. We included 11,142 cases, 280,164 controls, and 5,379 proxy cases, based on parental history of PD. Additionally, we tested the association of significant variants with (1) PD risk in an independent replication with 1,561 cases and 2,465 controls and (2) putamen volume in 33,360 individuals from the UK Biobank.


Results
In the discovery meta‐analysis, we identified rs7066890 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06–1.14, p = 2.2 × 10−9), intron of GPM6B, and rs28602900 (OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.07–1.14, p = 1.6 × 10−8) in a high gene density region including RPL10, ATP6A1, FAM50A, and PLXNA3. The rs28602900 association with PD was replicated (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.03–1.30, p = 0.016) and shown to colocalize with a significant expression quantitative locus (eQTL) regulating RPL10 expression in the putamen and other brain tissues in the Genotype‐Tissue Expression Project. Additionally, the rs28602900 locus was found to be associated with reduced brain putamen volume. No results reached genome‐wide significance in the sex‐stratified analyses.


Interpretation
We report the first XWAS of PD and identify 2 genome‐wide significant loci. The rs28602900 association was replicated in an independent PD dataset and showed concordant effects in its association with putamen volume. Critically, rs26802900 is a significant eQTL of RPL10. These results support a role for ribosomal proteins in PD pathogenesis and show that the X‐chromosome contributes to PD genetic risk. ANN NEUROL 2021</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Hippocampal‐entorhinal system represents nested hierarchical relations between words during concept learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/10.1002/hipo.23320</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23320?af=R</link>
	<description>Abstract
A fundamental skill of an intelligent mind is that of being able to rapidly discover the structural organization underlying the relations across the objects or the events in the world. Humans, thanks to language, master this skill. For example, a child learning that dolphins and cats can also be referred to as mammals, not only will infer the presence of a hierarchical organization for which dolphins and cats are subordinate exemplars of the category mammals, but will also derive that dolphins are, at least at one conceptual level, more similar to cats than to sharks, despite their indisputable higher perceptual similarity to the latter. The hippocampal‐entorhinal system, classically known for its involvement in relational and inferential memory, is a likely candidate to construct and hold these complex relational structures between concepts. To test this hypothesis, we trained healthy human adults to organize a novel audio‐visual object space into categories labeled with novel words. Crucially, a hierarchical taxonomy existed between the object categories, and participants discovered it via inference during a simple associative object‐to‐word training. Using functional MRI after learning, and a combination of ROI‐based multivariate analyses, we found that both the mid‐anterior hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex represented the inferred hierarchical structure between words: subordinate‐level words were represented more similarly to their related superordinate than to unrelated ones. This was paired, in the entorhinal cortex, by an additional signature of internalized structural representation of nested hierarchy: words referring to subordinate concepts belonging to the same superordinate category were represented more similarly compared with those not belonging to the same superordinate level: interestingly, this similarity was never directly taught to subjects nor it was made explicit during the task, but only indirectly derived through a logical inferential process and, crucially, contrasted the evidence coming from the definitional perceptual properties of the concepts. None of these results were observed before learning, when the same words were not yet semantically organized. A whole‐brain searchlight revealed that the effect in the entorhinal cortex extends to a wider network of areas, encompassing the prefrontal, temporal, and parietal cortices, partially overlapping with the semantic network.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Selective endothelial hyperactivation of oncogenic KRAS induces brain arteriovenous malformations in mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26059</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26059?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
Brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) are a leading cause of hemorrhagic stroke and neurological deficits in children and young adults, however no pharmacological intervention is available to treat these patients. Although more than 95% of bAVMs are sporadic without family history, the pathogenesis of sporadic bAVMs is largely unknown, which may account for the lack of therapeutic options. KRAS mutations are frequently observed in cancer, and a recent unprecedented finding of these mutations in sporadic human bAVMs offers a new direction in the research. Using a novel adeno‐associated virus targeting brain endothelium (AAV‐BR1), the current study tested if endothelial KRASG12V mutation induces sporadic bAVMs in mice.


Methods
Five‐week‐old mice were systemically injected with either AAV‐BR1‐GFP or ‐KRASG12V. At 8 weeks after the AAV injection, bAVM formation and characteristics were addressed by histological and molecular analyses. The effect of MEK/ERK inhibition on KRASG12V‐induced bAVMs was determined by treatment of trametinib, an FDA‐approved MEK/ERK inhibitor.


Results
The viral‐mediated KRASG12V overexpression induced bAVMs which were composed of a tangled nidus mirroring the distinctive morphology of human bAVMs. The bAVMs were accompanied by focal angiogenesis, intracerebral hemorrhages, altered vascular constituents, neuroinflammation, and impaired sensory/cognitive/motor functions. Finally, we confirmed that bAVM growth was inhibited by trametinib treatment.


Interpretation
Our innovative approach using AAV‐BR1 confirms that KRAS mutations promote bAVM development via the MEK/ERK pathway, and provides a preclinical mouse model of bAVMs which will be useful to develop a therapeutic strategy for bAVM patients.

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Targeting the mitochondrial permeability transition pore for neuroprotection in a piglet model of neonatal hypoxic‐ischemic encephalopathy</title>

	<description>GNX‐4728, a mitochondrial permeability transition pore inhibitor, does not protect against hypoxia‐ischemia induced neuronal necrosis in piglet putamen (indicated by bolt strike zone). Acute depletion of mitochondrial SOD2 and developmental differences in mitochondrial proteins, such as CypD, may limit the efficacy of mitochondrial‐targeted drugs for neonatal brain injury.

Abstract
Neonatal hypoxic‐ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) causes significant morbidity despite treatment with therapeutic hypothermia. Mitochondrial dysfunction may drive the mechanisms underlying neuronal cell death, thereby making mitochondria prime targets for neuroprotection. The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is one such target within mitochondria. In adult animal models, mPTP inhibition is neuroprotective. However, evidence for mPTP inhibition in neonatal models of neurologic disease is less certain. We tested the therapeutic efficacy of the mPTP small molecule inhibitor GNX‐4728 and examined the developmental presence of brain mPTP proteins for drug targeting in a neonatal piglet model of hypoxic‐ischemic brain injury. Male neonatal piglets were randomized to hypoxia‐ischemia (HI) or sham procedure with GNX‐4728 (15 mg/kg, IV) or vehicle (saline/cyclodextrin/DMSO, IV). GNX‐4728 was administered as a single dose within 5 min after resuscitation from bradycardic arrest. Normal, ischemic, and injured neurons were counted in putamen and somatosensory cortex using hematoxylin and eosin staining. In separate neonatal and juvenile pigs, western blots of putamen mitochondrial‐enriched fractions were used to evaluate mitochondrial integrity and the presence of mPTP proteins. We found that a single dose of GNX‐4728 did not protect putamen and cortical neurons from cell death after HI. However, loss of mitochondrial matrix integrity occurred within 6h after HI, and while mPTP components are present in the neonatal brain their levels were significantly different compared to that of a mature juvenile brain. Thus, the neonatal brain mPTP may not be a good target for current neurotherapeutic drugs that are developed based on adult mitochondria.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Maternal and iatrogenic neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome: Differences and similarities in recognition, management, and consequences</title>

	<description>Abstract
Opioids are potent analgesics used to manage pain in both young and old, but the increased use in the pregnant population has significant individual and societal implications. Infants dependent on opioids, either through maternal or iatrogenic exposure, undergo neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS), where they may experience withdrawal symptoms ranging from mild to severe. We present a detailed and original review of NOWS caused by maternal opioid exposure (mNOWS) and iatrogenic opioid intake (iNOWS). While these two entities have been assessed entirely separately, recognition and treatment of the clinical manifestations of NOWS overlap. Neonatal risk factors such as age, genetic predisposition, drug type, and clinical factors like type of opioid, cumulative dose of opioid exposure, and disease status affect the incidence of both mNOWS and iNOWS, as well as their severity. Recognition of withdrawal is dependent on clinical assessment of symptoms, and the use of clinical assessment tools designed to determine the need for pharmacotherapy. Treatment of NOWS relies on a combination of non‐pharmacological therapies and pharmacological options. Long‐term consequences of opioids and NOWS continue to generate controversy, with some evidence of anatomic brain changes, but conflicting animal and human clinical evidence of significant cognitive or behavioral impacts on school‐age children. We highlight the current knowledge on clinically relevant recognition, treatment, and consequences of NOWS, and identify new advances in clinical management of the neonate. This review brings a unique clinical perspective and critically analyzes gaps between the clinical problem and our preclinical understanding of NOWS.</description>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Chiari malformation type I (CMI) provides an opportunity for examining possible moderators of allostatic load. CMI patients who had (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 43) and had not (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 19) undergone decompression surgery completed questionnaires regarding pain, disability, and loneliness, and provided serum samples for IL-6, CRP, estrogen, and free estradiol assays, and saliva samples to assess diurnal cortisol curves. ANOVAs examining surgical status (decompressed versus non-decompressed), loneliness (high vs. low), and disability (high vs. low) as independent variables and biomarker variables as dependent factors found that loneliness was associated with higher levels of cortisol, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;(1, 37) = 4.91, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = .04, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;η&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = .11, and lower levels of estrogen, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;(1, 36) = 7.29, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = .01, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;η&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = .17, but only in decompressed patients.

	<title>The Cerebellum: Feasibility of combining functional near-infrared spectroscopy with electroencephalography to identify chronic stroke responders to cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation—a computational modeling and portable neuroimaging methodological study</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Feasibility of portable neuroimaging of cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (ctDCS) effects on the cerebral cortex has not been investigated vis-à-vis cerebellar lobular electric field strength. We studied functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) in conjunction with electroencephalography (EEG) to measure changes in the brain activation at the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the sensorimotor cortex (SMC) following ctDCS as well as virtual reality–based balance training (VBaT) before and after ctDCS treatment in 12 hemiparetic chronic stroke survivors. We performed general linear modeling (GLM) that putatively associated the lobular electric field strength with the changes in the fNIRS-EEG measures at the ipsilesional and contra-lesional PFC and SMC. Here, fNIRS-EEG measures were found in the latent space from canonical correlation analysis (CCA) between the changes in total hemoglobin (tHb) concentrations (0.01–0.07Hz and 0.07–0.13Hz bands) and log10-transformed EEG bandpower within 1–45 Hz where significant (Wilks’ lambda&amp;gt;0.95) canonical correlations were found only for the 0.07–0.13-Hz band. Also, the first principal component (97.5% variance accounted for) of the mean lobular electric field strength was a good predictor of the latent variables of oxy-hemoglobin (O2Hb) concentrations and log10-transformed EEG bandpower. GLM also provided insights into non-responders to ctDCS who also performed poorly in the VBaT due to ideomotor apraxia. Future studies should investigate fNIRS-EEG joint-imaging in a larger cohort to identify non-responders based on GLM fitting to the fNIRS-EEG data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: PAC1 Receptor Internalization and Endosomal MEK/ERK Activation Is Essential for PACAP-Mediated Neuronal Excitability</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Adcyap1&lt;/em&gt;) activation of PAC1 receptors (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Adcyap1r1&lt;/em&gt;) can significantly increase the excitability of diverse neurons through differential mechanisms. For guinea pig cardiac neurons, the modulation of excitability can be mediated in part by PAC1 receptor plasma membrane G protein-dependent activation of adenylyl cyclase and downstream signaling cascades. By contrast, PAC1 receptor-mediated excitability of hippocampal dentate gyrus granule cells appears independent of membrane-delimited AC/cAMP/PKA and PLC/PKC signaling. For both neuronal types, there is mechanistic convergence demonstrating that endosomal PAC1 receptor signaling has prominent roles. In these models, neuronal exposure to Pitstop2 to inhibit β-arrestin/clathrin-mediated PAC1 receptor internalization eliminates PACAP modulation of excitability. β-arrestin is a scaffold for a number of effectors especially MEK/ERK and notably, paradigms that inhibit PAC1 receptor endosome formation and ERK signaling also blunt the PACAP-induced increase in excitability. Detailed PAC1 receptor internalization and endosomal ERK signaling mechanisms have been confirmed in HEK PAC1R-EGFP cells and shown to be long lasting which appear to recapitulate the sustained electrophysiological responses. Thus, PAC1 receptor internalization/endosomal recruitment efficiently and efficaciously activates MEK/ERK signaling and appears to represent a singular and critical common denominator in regulating neuronal excitability by PACAP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      &lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Ischemic stroke (IS) is a complex disease regarding its risk factors; among those factors, genetics has an important role. Protein C (PC) is an important antithrombotic enzyme which its genetic variations disrupt the normal cascade of blood coagulation, resulting in thrombosis and increases the chance of stroke. Therefore, we aimed to investigate three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the core promoter of PC in order to find their role in this condition in the Iranian population. Blood samples from IS patients (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 249) and healthy volunteers (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 203) were collected. Biochemical analysis was performed. Genotyping was conducted on the extracted DNA from blood samples via the HRM technique. Bioinformatic investigations were used to assess how these SNPs may be involved in the IS. Smoking, hypertension, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and fasting blood glucose were significantly different between healthy and IS groups. rs1799809 and rs1799810 SNPs were significantly more frequent among IS patients. Also, among four identified haplotypes, CGT was found associated with IS (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001). It was also found that these SNPs may interfere with the binding of transcription factors to alter the expression of PC. Our data predict that SNPs at the core promoter of PC can affect the binding affinity of transcription factors which in turn reduces the expression of PC and increases the risk of IS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study aimed to investigate the effect of androgen suppression therapy using leuprorelin focused on the bulbar function of patients with spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Genetically confirmed SBMA patients who consented to participate in this observational study were enrolled. Leuprorelin was subcutaneously injected every 12 weeks. Videofluoroscopic swallowing study was performed at baseline and after androgen suppression therapy for 1 year. The primary outcome measures were the changes in the vallecular residue and pyriform sinus residue. The videofluoroscopic swallowing study data were analyzed and interpreted by two experienced physiatrists.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A total of 40 patients with SBMA were analyzed in this study. The inter-rater reliability testing showed good agreement for the pharyngeal residue (ICC = 0.84) and videofluoroscopic dysphagia scale (ICC = 0.75). The vallecular residue and pyriform sinus residue after swallowing 9 mL yogurt were significantly reduced (26.8 ± 22.6 to 14.6 ± 14.5, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001, 14.9 ± 16.9 to 7.6 ± 9.9, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001, respectively). The swallowing subscore of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional rating scale-revised improved after androgen suppression therapy (3.3 ± 0.5 to 3.5 ± 0.6, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.041).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Leuprorelin significantly reduced the pharyngeal residue in patients with SBMA after 1 year of treatment without any serious adverse events and longitudinal studies are needed to confirm these results.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neurology: Efficacy and safety of intravenous immunoglobulins for the treatment of viral encephalitis: a systematic literature review</title>

	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-021-10494-w</link>
	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;For most viral encephalitides, therapy is merely supportive. Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) have been used as a prophylactic and therapeutic approach. We conduct a systematic review on the safety and efficacy of IVIG in viral encephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We conducted a systematic review assessing PubMed, Cochrane Database, Biosis Previews and the ClinicalTrials.gov website to identify all reports on patients with viral encephalitis treated with IVIG as of May 31, 2019. The main outcomes assessed were therapeutic efficacy and safety. For an increased homogeneity of the population, atypical viral infections were excluded, as were reports on prophylactic IVIG use, intrathecal application of immunoglobulins, or use of antibody-enriched IVIG-preparations. Data were extracted from published studies. Descriptive statistics were used.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We included a total of 44 studies (39 case reports). The case reports cover a total of 53 patients. Our search retrieved two prospective and three retrospective studies. These show heterogeneous results as to the efficacy of IVIG therapy. Only one study reports a significant association between IVIG-use and death (odds ratio 0.032; 95% confidence interval 0.0033–0.3024; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.0027). None of the studies report significant differences in the number of serious adverse events.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Data on the efficacy of IVIG-therapy is heterogeneous. While it seems generally safe, evident superiority compared to supportive treatment has not been demonstrated so far. Future trials should also investigate the optimal dosing and timing of IVIG and their benefit in the immunosuppressed.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Attention and sensory integration for postural control in young adults with autism spectrum disorders</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00221-021-06058-z</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Postural control impairments have been reported in adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Balance relies on the integration of multisensory cues, a process that requires attention. The purpose of this study was to determine if the influence of attention demands on sensory integration abilities relevant for balance partially contributes to postural control impairments in ASD. Young adults with ASD (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 24) and neurotypical participants (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 24) were exposed to sensory perturbations during standing. An established dual-task paradigm was used, requiring participants to maintain balance in these sensory challenging environments and to perform auditory information processing tasks (simple reaction time task and choice reaction time task). Balance was assessed using sway magnitude and sway speed, and attention demands were evaluated based on the response time in the auditory tasks. While young adults with ASD were able to maintain balance in destabilizing sensory conditions, they were more challenged (greater sway speed) than their neurotypical counterparts. Additionally, when exposed for an extended amount of time (3 min) to the most challenging sensory condition included in this study, adults with ASD exhibited a reduced ability to adapt their postural control strategies (sway speed was minimally reduced), demonstrating a postural inflexibility pattern in ASD compared to neurotypical counterparts. Finally, the impact of performing an auditory information processing task on balance and the dual-task cost on information processing (response time) was similar in both groups. ASD may disrupt temporal adaptive postural control processes associated with sensory reweighting that occurs in neurotypicals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Perceptual-motor styles</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Even for a stereotyped task, sensorimotor behavior is generally variable due to noise, redundancy, adaptability, learning or plasticity. The sources and significance of different kinds of behavioral variability have attracted considerable attention in recent years. However, the idea that part of this variability depends on unique individual strategies has been explored to a lesser extent. In particular, the notion of style recurs infrequently in the literature on sensorimotor behavior. In general use, style refers to a distinctive manner or custom of behaving oneself or of doing something, especially one that is typical of a person, group of people, place, context, or period. The application of the term to the domain of perceptual and motor phenomenology opens new perspectives on the nature of behavioral variability, perspectives that are complementary to those typically considered in the studies of sensorimotor variability. In particular, the concept of style may help toward the development of personalised physiology and medicine by providing markers of individual behaviour and response to different stimuli or treatments. Here, we cover some potential applications of the concept of perceptual-motor style to different areas of neuroscience, both in the healthy and the diseased. We prefer to be as general as possible in the types of applications we consider, even at the expense of running the risk of encompassing loosely related studies, given the relative novelty of the introduction of the term perceptual-motor style in neurosciences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Biochemical processes in cells are governed by complex networks of many chemical species interacting stochastically in diverse ways and on different time scales. Constructing microscopically accurate models of such networks is often infeasible. Instead, here we propose a systematic framework for building &lt;i&gt;phenomenological&lt;/i&gt; models of such networks from experimental data, focusing on accurately approximating the time it takes to complete the process, the First Passage (FP) time. Our phenomenological models are mixtures of Gamma distributions, which have a natural biophysical interpretation. The complexity of the models is adapted automatically to account for the amount of available data and its temporal resolution. The framework can be used for predicting behavior of FP systems under varying external conditions. To demonstrate the utility of the approach, we build models for the distribution of inter-spike intervals of a morphologically complex neuron, a Purkinje cell, from experimental and simulated data. We demonstrate that the developed models can not only fit the data, but also make nontrivial predictions. We demonstrate that our coarse-grained models provide constraints on more mechanistically accurate models of the involved phenomena.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AJj-_t4aBqM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

&lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; complex (MTC) CRISPR locus diversity has long been studied solely investigating the presence/absence of a known set of spacers. Unveiling the genetic mechanisms of its evolution requires a more exhaustive reconstruction in a large amount of representative strains.
In this article, we point out and resolve, with a new pipeline, the problem of CRISPR reconstruction based directly on short read sequences in &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;. We first show that the process we set up, that we coin as “CRISPRbuilder-TB” (https://github.com/cguyeux/CRISPRbuilder-TB), allows an efficient reconstruction of simulated or real CRISPRs, even when including complex evolutionary steps like the insertions of mobile elements. Compared to more generalist tools, the whole process is much more precise and robust, and requires only minimal manual investigation. Second, we show that more than 1/3 of the currently complete genomes available for this complex in the public databases contain largely erroneous CRISPR loci. Third, we highlight how both the classical experimental &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; approach and the basic &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; spoligotyping provided by existing analytic tools miss a whole diversity of this locus in MTC, by not capturing duplications, spacer and direct repeats variants, and IS&lt;i&gt;6110&lt;/i&gt; insertion locations. This description is extended in a second article that describes MTC-CRISPR diversity and suggests general rules for its evolution. This work opens perspectives for an in-depth exploration of &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; CRISPR loci diversity and of mechanisms involved in its evolution and its functionality, as well as its adaptation to other CRISPR locus-harboring bacterial species.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sMB0wMI08DA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Inferring latent temporal progression and regulatory networks from cross-sectional transcriptomic data of cancer samples</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaoqiang Sun, Ji Zhang, Qing Nie&lt;/p&gt;

Unraveling molecular regulatory networks underlying disease progression is critically important for understanding disease mechanisms and identifying drug targets. The existing methods for inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) rely mainly on time-course gene expression data. However, most available omics data from cross-sectional studies of cancer patients often lack sufficient temporal information, leading to a key challenge for GRN inference. Through quantifying the latent progression using random walks-based manifold distance, we propose a latent-temporal progression-based Bayesian method, PROB, for inferring GRNs from the cross-sectional transcriptomic data of tumor samples. The robustness of PROB to the measurement variabilities in the data is mathematically proved and numerically verified. Performance evaluation on real data indicates that PROB outperforms other methods in both pseudotime inference and GRN inference. Applications to bladder cancer and breast cancer demonstrate that our method is effective to identify key regulators of cancer progression or drug targets. The identified ACSS1 is experimentally validated to promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of bladder cancer cells, and the predicted FOXM1-targets interactions are verified and are predictive of relapse in breast cancer. Our study suggests new effective ways to clinical transcriptomic data modeling for characterizing cancer progression and facilitates the translation of regulatory network-based approaches into precision medicine.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_hXsVlqJGRc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Variation in cognitive ability arises from subtle differences in underlying neural architecture. Understanding and predicting individual variability in cognition from the differences in brain networks requires harnessing the unique variance captured by different neuroimaging modalities. Here we adopted a multi-level machine learning approach that combines diffusion, functional, and structural MRI data from the Human Connectome Project (N = 1050) to provide unitary prediction models of various cognitive abilities: global cognitive function, fluid intelligence, crystallized intelligence, impulsivity, spatial orientation, verbal episodic memory and sustained attention. Out-of-sample predictions of each cognitive score were first generated using a sparsity-constrained principal component regression on individual neuroimaging modalities. These individual predictions were then aggregated and submitted to a LASSO estimator that removed redundant variability across channels. This stacked prediction led to a significant improvement in accuracy, relative to the best single modality predictions (approximately 1% to more than 3% boost in variance explained), across a majority of the cognitive abilities tested. Further analysis found that diffusion and brain surface properties contribute the most to the predictive power. Our findings establish a lower bound to predict individual differences in cognition using multiple neuroimaging measures of brain architecture, both structural and functional, quantify the relative predictive power of the different imaging modalities, and reveal how each modality provides unique and complementary information about individual differences in cognitive function.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zNDhzR3phvs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Reexposure to a sensorimotor perturbation produces opposite effects on explicit and implicit learning processes</title>

The motor system demonstrates an exquisite ability to adapt to
changes in the environment and to quickly reset when these changes prove transient. If similar environmental changes are encountered in the future, learning may be faster, a phenomenon known as savings. In studies of sensorimotor learning, a central component of savings is attributed to the explicit recall of the task structure and appropriate compensatory strategies. Whether implicit adaptation also contributes to savings remains subject to debate. We tackled this question by measuring, in parallel, explicit and implicit adaptive responses in a visuomotor rotation task, employing a protocol that typically elicits savings. While the initial rate of learning was faster in the second exposure to the perturbation, an analysis decomposing the 2 processes showed the benefit to be solely associated with explicit re-aiming. Surprisingly, we found a significant decrease after relearning in aftereffect magnitudes during no-feedback trials, a direct measure of implicit adaptation. In a second experiment, we isolated implicit adaptation using clamped visual feedback, a method known to eliminate the contribution of explicit learning processes. Consistent with the results of the first experiment, participants exhibited a marked reduction in the adaptation function, as well as an attenuated aftereffect when relearning from the clamped feedback. Motivated by these results, we reanalyzed data from prior studies and observed a consistent, yet unappreciated pattern of attenuation of implicit adaptation during relearning. These results indicate that explicit and implicit sensorimotor processes exhibit opposite effects upon relearning: Explicit learning shows savings, while implicit adaptation becomes attenuated&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/bHjbYsBzork&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Onset of Preclinical Alzheimer Disease in Monozygotic Twins</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26048</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26048?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
The present work was undertaken to study the genetic contribution to the start of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with amyloid and tau biomarkers in cognitively intact older identical twins.


Methods
We studied in 96 monozygotic twin‐pairs relationships between amyloid‐beta (Aβ) aggregation as measured by the Aβ1–42/1–40 ratio in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; n = 126) and positron emission tomography (PET, n = 194), and CSF markers for Aβ production (beta‐secretase 1, Aβ1–40, and Aβ1–38) and CSF tau. Associations among markers were tested with generalized estimating equations including a random effect for twin status, adjusted for age, gender, and apolipoprotein E ε4 genotype. We used twin analyses to determine relative contributions of genetic and/or environmental factors to AD pathophysiological processes.


Results
Twenty‐seven individuals (14%) had an abnormal amyloid PET, and 14 twin‐pairs (15%) showed discordant amyloid PET scans. Within twin‐pairs, Aβ production markers and total‐tau (t‐tau) levels strongly correlated (r range = 0.73–0.86, all p &amp;lt; 0.0001), and Aβ aggregation markers and 181‐phosphorylated‐tau (p‐tau) levels correlated moderately strongly (r range = 0.50–0.64, all p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Cross‐twin cross‐trait analysis showed that Aβ1–38 in one twin correlated with Aβ1–42/1–40 ratios, and t‐tau and p‐tau levels in their cotwins (r range = −0.28 to 0.58, all p &amp;lt; .007). Within‐pair differences in Aβ production markers related to differences in tau levels (r range = 0.49–0.61, all p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Twin discordance analyses suggest that Aβ production and tau levels show coordinated increases in very early AD.


Interpretation
Our results suggest a substantial genetic/shared environmental background contributes to both Aβ and tau increases, suggesting that modulation of environmental risk factors may aid in delaying the onset of AD pathophysiological processes. ANN NEUROL 2021</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Heritability Enrichment Implicates Microglia in Parkinson's Disease Pathogenesis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26032</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26032?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
Understanding how different parts of the immune system contribute to pathogenesis in Parkinson's disease is a burning challenge with important therapeutic implications. We studied enrichment of common variant heritability for Parkinson's disease stratified by immune and brain cell types.


Methods
We used summary statistics from the most recent meta‐analysis of genomewide association studies in Parkinson's disease and partitioned heritability using linkage disequilibrium score regression, stratified for specific cell types, as defined by open chromatin regions. We also validated enrichment results using a polygenic risk score approach and intersected disease‐associated variants with epigenetic data and expression quantitative loci to nominate and explore a putative microglial locus.


Results
We found significant enrichment of Parkinson's disease risk heritability in open chromatin regions of microglia and monocytes. Genomic annotations overlapped substantially between these 2 cell types, and only the enrichment signal for microglia remained significant in a joint model. We present evidence suggesting P2RY12, a key microglial gene and target for the antithrombotic agent clopidogrel, as the likely driver of a significant Parkinson's disease association signal on chromosome 3.


Interpretation
Our results provide further support for the importance of immune mechanisms in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis, highlight microglial dysregulation as a contributing etiological factor, and nominate a targetable microglial gene candidate as a pathogenic player. Immune processes can be modulated by therapy, with potentially important clinical implications for future treatment in Parkinson's disease. ANN NEUROL 2021</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Ipsilateral motor pathways to the lower limb after stroke: Insights and opportunities</title>

	<description>Abstract
Stroke‐related damage to the crossed lateral corticospinal tract causes motor deficits in the contralateral (paretic) limb. To restore functional movement in the paretic limb, the nervous system may increase its reliance on ipsilaterally descending motor pathways, including the uncrossed lateral corticospinal tract, the reticulospinal tract, the rubrospinal tract, and the vestibulospinal tract. Our knowledge about the role of these pathways for upper limb motor recovery is incomplete, and even less is known about the role of these pathways for lower limb motor recovery. Understanding the role of ipsilateral motor pathways to paretic lower limb movement and recovery after stroke may help improve our rehabilitative efforts and provide alternate solutions to address stroke‐related impairments. These advances are important because walking and mobility impairments are major contributors to long‐term disability after stroke, and improving walking is a high priority for individuals with stroke. This perspective highlights evidence regarding the contributions of ipsilateral motor pathways from the contralesional hemisphere and spinal interneuronal pathways for paretic lower limb movement and recovery. This perspective also identifies opportunities for future research to expand our knowledge about ipsilateral motor pathways and provides insights into how this information may be used to guide rehabilitation.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Cortical connections of the functional domain for climbing or running in posterior parietal cortex of galagos</title>

	<description>A domain for combined forelimb and hindlimb movements in posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of galagos was identified. This domain had dense intrinsic connections within PPC and reciprocal connections with frontal and parietal sensorimotor areas of the ipsilateral cortex. It also had connections with the homotopic region of the contralateral cortex.







Abstract
Previous studies in prosimian galagos (Otolemur garnetti) have demonstrated that posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is subdivided into several functionally distinct domains, each of which mediates a specific type of complex movements (e.g., reaching, grasping, hand‐to‐mouth) and has a different pattern of cortical connections. Here we identified a medially located domain in PPC where combined forelimb and hindlimb movements, as if climbing or running, were evoked by long‐train intracortical microstimulation. We injected anatomical tracers in this climbing/running domain of PPC to reveal its cortical connections. Our results showed the PPC climbing domain had dense intrinsic connections within rostral PPC and reciprocal connections with forelimb and hindlimb region in primary motor cortex (M1) of the ipsilateral hemisphere. Fewer connections were with dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), supplementary motor (SMA), and cingulate motor (CMA) areas, as well as somatosensory cortex including areas 3a, 3b, and 1–2, secondary somatosensory (S2), parietal ventral (PV), and retroinsular (Ri) areas. The rostral portion of the climbing domain had more connections with primary somatosensory cortex than the caudal portion. Cortical projections were found in functionally matched domains in M1 and premotor cortex (PMC). Similar patterns of connections with fewer labeled neurons and terminals were seen in the contralateral hemisphere. These connection patterns are consistent with the proposed role of the climbing/running domain as part of a parietal‐frontal network for combined use of the limbs in locomotion as in climbing and running. The cortical connections identify this action‐specific domain in PPC as a more somatosensory driven domain.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Self-supervised learning (SSL) is rapidly closing the gap with supervised
methods on large computer vision benchmarks. A successful approach to SSL is to
learn representations which are invariant to distortions of the input sample.
However, a recurring issue with this approach is the existence of trivial
constant representations. Most current methods avoid such collapsed solutions
by careful implementation details. We propose an objective function that
naturally avoids such collapse by measuring the cross-correlation matrix
between the outputs of two identical networks fed with distorted versions of a
sample, and making it as close to the identity matrix as possible. This causes
the representation vectors of distorted versions of a sample to be similar,
while minimizing the redundancy between the components of these vectors. The
method is called Barlow Twins, owing to neuroscientist H. Barlow's
redundancy-reduction principle applied to a pair of identical networks. Barlow
Twins does not require large batches nor asymmetry between the network twins
such as a predictor network, gradient stopping, or a moving average on the
weight updates. It allows the use of very high-dimensional output vectors.
Barlow Twins outperforms previous methods on ImageNet for semi-supervised
classification in the low-data regime, and is on par with current state of the
art for ImageNet classification with a linear classifier head, and for transfer
tasks of classification and object detection.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: An empirical analysis of phrase-based and neural machine translation. (arXiv:2103.03108v1 [cs.CL])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03108</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Two popular types of machine translation (MT) are phrase-based and neural
machine translation systems. Both of these types of systems are composed of
multiple complex models or layers. Each of these models and layers learns
different linguistic aspects of the source language. However, for some of these
models and layers, it is not clear which linguistic phenomena are learned or
how this information is learned. For phrase-based MT systems, it is often clear
what information is learned by each model, and the question is rather how this
information is learned, especially for its phrase reordering model. For neural
machine translation systems, the situation is even more complex, since for many
cases it is not exactly clear what information is learned and how it is
learned.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To shed light on what linguistic phenomena are captured by MT systems, we
analyze the behavior of important models in both phrase-based and neural MT
systems. We consider phrase reordering models from phrase-based MT systems to
investigate which words from inside of a phrase have the biggest impact on
defining the phrase reordering behavior. Additionally, to contribute to the
interpretability of neural MT systems we study the behavior of the attention
model, which is a key component in neural MT systems and the closest model in
functionality to phrase reordering models in phrase-based systems. The
attention model together with the encoder hidden state representations form the
main components to encode source side linguistic information in neural MT. To
this end, we also analyze the information captured in the encoder hidden state
representations of a neural MT system. We investigate the extent to which
syntactic and lexical-semantic information from the source side is captured by
hidden state representations of different neural MT architectures.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Ventricle features as reliable differentiators between the bvFTD and other dementias. (arXiv:2103.03065v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03065</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03065</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;INTRODUCTION: Lateral ventricles are reliable and sensitive indicators of
brain atrophy and disease progression in behavioral variant frontotemporal
dementia (bvFTD). We aimed to investigate whether an automated tool using
ventricular features could improve diagnostic accuracy in bvFTD across
neurodegenerative diseases. METHODS: Using 678 subjects (2750 timepoints),
differences in ventricular features were assessed between bvFTD, normal
controls and other dementia cohorts. RESULTS: Ventricular antero-posterior
ratio (APR) was the only feature that was significantly different and increased
faster in bvFTD compared to all other cohorts. We achieved a 10-fold
cross-validation accuracy of 80% (77% sensitivity, 82% specificity) in
differentiating bvFTD from all other cohorts with ventricular features, and 76%
accuracy using only the single APR feature. DISCUSSION: APR could be a useful
and easy-to-implement feature to aid bvFTD diagnosis. We have made our
ventricle feature estimation and bvFTD diagnostic tool publicly available,
allowing application of our model in other studies.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite their recent success on image denoising, the need for deep and
complex architectures still hinders the practical usage of CNNs. Older but
computationally more efficient methods such as BM3D remain a popular choice,
especially in resource-constrained scenarios. In this study, we aim to find out
whether compact neural networks can learn to produce competitive results as
compared to BM3D for AWGN image denoising. To this end, we configure networks
with only two hidden layers and employ different neuron models and layer widths
for comparing the performance with BM3D across different AWGN noise levels. Our
results conclusively show that the recently proposed self-organized variant of
operational neural networks based on a generative neuron model (Self-ONNs) is
not only a better choice as compared to CNNs, but also provide competitive
results as compared to BM3D and even significantly surpass it for high noise
levels.

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We mined a set of neuroblastoma (NBL) exomes for immune receptor recombinations representing all seven, human adaptive immune receptor genes, using a very high standard for identifications of V- and J-gene segments in sequencing reads. Results indicated an unusually large number of TRD recombination reads in the NBL samples, possibly related to the younger age of the patients. In general, recovery of immune receptor (IR) recombination reads representing any of the immune receptors, from either blood or tumor samples, was associated with a lower overall survival rate, consistent with an emerging literature indicating that systemic immunology parameters can be informative for cancer evaluations. Despite the overall negative association of IR recombination frequencies and outcomes, survival rate distinctions could still be established as associated with certain chemical features of IR complementarity determining region-3 (CDR3) amino acid sequences, thereby likely revealing a distinction between the negative impacts of a general adaptive immune response versus the positive aspects of specific CDR3 chemical interaction potentials. These data underscore the relevance of gamma-delta T cells in the development of cancer in younger patients. And for the first time, these data allow a distinction within an NBL cohort with active disease, between two contrasting systemic immune states: (i) general and likely harmful adaptive immunity development versus (ii) a likely positive, adaptive immune response with particular antigenic specificities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Neuroinformatics: Identification of Neuronal Polarity by Node-Based Machine Learning</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Identifying the direction of signal flows in neural networks is important for understanding the intricate information dynamics of a living brain. Using a dataset of 213 projection neurons distributed in more than 15 neuropils of a &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; brain, we develop a powerful machine learning algorithm: node-based polarity identifier of neurons (NPIN). The proposed model is trained only by information specific to nodes, the branch points on the skeleton, and includes both Soma Features &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;(which contain spatial information from a given node to a soma)&lt;/em&gt; and Local Features &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;(which contain morphological information of a given node).&lt;/em&gt; After including the spatial correlations between nodal polarities, our NPIN provided extremely high accuracy (&amp;gt;96.0%) for the classification of neuronal polarity, even for complex neurons with more than two dendrite/axon clusters. Finally, we further apply NPIN to classify the neuronal polarity of neurons in other species (Blowfly and Moth), which have much less neuronal data available. Our results demonstrate the potential of NPIN as a powerful tool to identify the neuronal polarity of insects and to map out the signal flows in the brain’s neural networks if more training data become available in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) is a recessively inherited multisystem ataxia compromising cerebellar, vestibular, and sensory nerves, which has been associated to a pathogenic AAGGG(n) biallelic expansion repeat in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;RFC1&lt;/em&gt; gene. Our objective was to assess its prevalence in a French cohort of patients with idiopathic sporadic late-onset ataxia (ILOA), idiopathic early-onset ataxia (IEOA), or Multiple System Atrophy of Cerebellar type (MSA-C).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;163 patients were recruited in 3 French tertiary centers: 100 ILOA, 21 IEOA, and 42 patients with possible or probable MSA-C.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A pathogenic biallelic &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;RFC1&lt;/em&gt; AAGGG(n) repeat expansion was found in 15 patients: 15/100 in the ILOA group, but none in the IEOA and MSA-C subgroups. 14/15 patients had a CANVAS phenotype. Only 1/15 had isolated cerebellar ataxia, but also shorter biallelic expansions. Two &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;RFC1&lt;/em&gt; AAGGG(n) alleles were found in 78% of patients with a CANVAS phenotype. In one post-mortem case, the pathophysiological involvement of cerebellum and medullar posterior columns was found.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Our study confirms the genetic heterogeneity of the CANVAS and that &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;RFC1&lt;/em&gt; repeat expansions should be searched for preferentially in case of unexplained ILOA associated with a sensory neuronopathy, but not particularly in patients classified as MSA-C.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Antiviral treatments for Bell palsy have been widely used, but there is no definite conclusion of which is the most effective antiviral drug. We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including network meta-analysis to investigate the comparative effectiveness of antiviral treatments for Bell palsy.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Data&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;RCTs comparing effectiveness between antiviral treatments and placebo were included. Risk of bias within and across studies was assessed with the Cochrane tool and the GRADE approach, respectively. Random-effects pairwise meta-analyses were conducted, followed by network meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Sources&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Three electronic databases were searched from inception to May 18, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;11 trials and 3393 patients with four arms and eleven contrasts were included.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Significant differences were observed between placebo and famciclovir with respect to overall recovery and no statistically significant differences were found from other comparisons. Treatment ranking based on the evidence network indicated that famciclovir shared the best results, followed by valacyclovir, acyclovir, and finally placebo. Adverse events of famciclovir were too rare and slight to be analyzed. Our confidence in pairwise comparisons was moderate to low, due to study limitations, inconsistency, and imprecision; our confidence in ranking was moderate, due to study limitations. Inconsistency is not deemed to exist by a loop-specific approach and node-splitting procedure. Results of exploring publication bias are satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec6&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;According to pairwise and network comparisons, famciclovir could be better than placebo and the effectiveness of other antiviral treatments are similar. For clinical efficacy, famciclovir obtains the best recovery rate of facial function for Bell palsy. Acyclovir has the lowest rate of synkinesis, though, it is not adequately recommended and more superior trails are needed in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We investigate the frequency and diagnostic yield of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis in adult patients with status epilepticus (SE) and its impact on the outcome.
      &lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;From 2011 to 2018, adult patients treated at the University Hospital Basel were included. Primary outcomes were defined as the frequency of lumbar puncture and results from chemical, cellular, and microbiologic CSF analyses. Secondary outcomes were differences between patients receiving and not receiving lumbar puncture in the context of SE.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In 18% of 408 patients, a lumbar puncture was performed. Of those, infectious pathogens were identified in 21% with 15% detected ± 24 h around SE diagnosis. 74% of CSF analyses revealed abnormal chemical or cellular components without infectious pathogens. Screening for autoimmune diseases was only performed in 22%. In 8%, no or late (i.e., &amp;gt; 24 after SE diagnosis) lumbar puncture was performed despite persistent unknown SE etiology in all, transformation into refractory SE in 78%, and no recovery to premorbid neurologic function in 66%. Withholding lumbar puncture was associated with no return to premorbid neurologic function during hospital stay independent of potential confounders. Not receiving a lumbar puncture was associated with presumed known etiology and signs of systemic infectious complications.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Withholding lumbar puncture in SE patients is associated with increased odds for no return to premorbid neurologic function, and CSF analyses in SE detect infectious pathogens frequently. These results and pathologic chemical and cellular CSF findings in the absence of infections call for rigorous screening to confirm or exclude infectious or autoimmune encephalitis in this context which should not be withheld.
      &lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Intra-prefrontal cyclosporine potentiates ketamine-induced fear extinction in rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00221-021-06050-7</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Several brain regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), are important in the process of fear extinction learning. Ketamine is a glutamate &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;-methyl-&lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus emphasis type-small-caps&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, which is shown to play a role in extinction modulation. Ketamine and calcineurin (CN), an intracellular protein phosphatase, have several common targets in the cells. Therefore, in the present study, our aim is to investigate the possible role of calcineurin in the mPFC on the enhancing effects of ketamine in fear extinction. First, different doses of a CN inhibitor, cyclosporine-A (CsA), were micro-injected into the infralimbic (IL) region of the mPFC prior to extinction training in a classical conditioning model in rats. Next, sub-effective doses of CsA (Intra-mPFC) and ketamine (i.p.) were co-administered in another cohort of rats to find their possible interactions. Enzymatic activity of calcineurin was measured in the IL-mPFC following drug administration. We used the elevated plus-maze (EPM) and open field (OF) test for further behavioral assessments. The results showed that CsA can enhance the extinction of conditioned fear and inhibit the enzyme CN at a dose of 20 nM. The combination of sub-effective doses of CsA (5 nM) and ketamine (10 mg/kg) could again enhance the extinction of fear and reduce CN activity in the region. Our results propose that inhibition of CN in the IL-mPFC is involved in the extinction of fear and ketamine enhancement of extinction is probably mediated by reducing CN activity in this part of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Visual Cues Predictive of Behaviorally Neutral Outcomes Evoke Persistent but Not Interval Timing Activity in V1, Whereas Aversive Conditioning Suppresses This Activity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.611744</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.611744</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cue-evoked persistent activity is neural activity that persists beyond stimulation of a sensory cue and has been described in many regions of the brain, including primary sensory areas. Nonetheless, the functional role that persistent activity plays in primary sensory areas is enigmatic. However, one form of persistent activity in a primary sensory area is the representation of time between a visual stimulus and a water reward. This “reward timing activity”—observed within the primary visual cortex—has been implicated in informing the timing of visually cued, reward-seeking actions. Although rewarding outcomes are sufficient to engender interval timing activity within V1, it is unclear to what extent cue-evoked persistent activity exists outside of reward conditioning, and whether temporal relationships to other outcomes (such as behaviorally neutral or aversive outcomes) are able to engender timing activity. Here we describe the existence of cue-evoked persistent activity in mouse V1 following three conditioning strategies: pseudo-conditioning (where unpaired, monocular visual stimuli are repeatedly presented to an animal), neutral conditioning (where monocular visual stimuli are paired with a binocular visual stimulus, at a delay), and aversive conditioning (where monocular visual stimuli are paired with a tail shock, at a delay). We find that these conditioning strategies exhibit persistent activity that takes one of three forms, a sustained increase of activity; a sustained decrease of activity; or a delayed, transient peak of activity, as previously observed following conditioning with delayed reward. However, these conditioning strategies do not result in visually cued interval timing activity, as observed following appetitive conditioning. Moreover, we find that neutral conditioning increases the magnitude of cue-evoked responses whereas aversive conditioning strongly diminished both the response magnitude and the prevalence of cue-evoked persistent activity. These results demonstrate that cue-evoked persistent activity within V1 can exist outside of conditioning visual stimuli with delayed outcomes and that this persistent activity can be uniquely modulated across different conditioning strategies using unconditioned stimuli of varying behavioral relevance. Together, these data extend our understanding of cue-evoked persistent activity within a primary sensory cortical network and its ability to be modulated by salient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Diminished Feedback Evaluation and Knowledge Updating Underlying Age-Related Differences in Choice Behavior During Feedback Learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.635996</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.635996</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In our daily lives, we continuously evaluate feedback information, update our knowledge, and adapt our behavior in order to reach desired goals. This ability to learn from feedback information, however, declines with age. Previous research has indicated that certain higher-level learning processes, such as feedback evaluation, integration of feedback information, and updating of knowledge, seem to be affected by age, and recent studies have shown how the adaption of choice behavior following feedback can differ with age. The neural mechanisms underlying this age-related change in choice behavior during learning, however, remain unclear. The aim of this study is therefore to investigate the relation between learning-related neural processes and choice behavior during feedback learning in two age groups. Behavioral and fMRI data were collected, while a group of young (age 18–30) and older (age 60–75) adults performed a probabilistic learning task consisting of 10 blocks of 20 trials each. On each trial, the participants chose between a house and a face, after which they received visual feedback (loss vs. gain). In each block, either the house or the face image had a higher probability of yielding a reward (62.5 vs. 37.5%). Participants were instructed to try to maximize their gains. Our results showed that less successful learning in older adults, as indicated by a lower learning rate, corresponded with a higher tendency to switch to the other stimulus option, and with a reduced adaptation of this switch choice behavior following positive feedback. At the neural level, activation following positive and negative feedback was found to be less distinctive in the older adults, due to a smaller feedback-evaluation response to positive feedback in this group. Furthermore, whereas young adults displayed increased levels of knowledge updating prior to adapting choice behavior, we did not find this effect in older adults. Together, our results suggest that diminished learning performance with age corresponds with diminished evaluation of positive feedback and reduced knowledge updating related to changes in choice behavior, indicating how such differences in feedback processing at the trial level in older adults might lead to reduced learning performance across trials.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Spontaneous Alpha and Theta Oscillations Are Related to Complementary Aspects of Cognitive Control in Younger and Older Adults</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.621620</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.621620</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The resting-state human electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectrum is dominated by alpha (8–12 Hz) and theta (4–8 Hz) oscillations, and also includes non-oscillatory broadband activity inversely related to frequency (1/f activity). Gratton proposed that alpha and theta oscillations are both related to cognitive control function, though in a complementary manner. Alpha activity is hypothesized to facilitate the maintenance of representations, such as task sets in preparation for expected task conditions. In contrast, theta activity would facilitate changes in representations, such as the updating of task sets in response to unpredicted task demands. Therefore, theta should be related to reactive control (which may prompt changes in task representations), while alpha may be more relevant to proactive control (which implies the maintenance of current task representations). Less is known about the possible relationship between 1/f activity and cognitive control, which was analyzed here in an exploratory fashion. To investigate these hypothesized relationships, we recorded eyes-open and eyes-closed resting-state EEG from younger and older adults and subsequently tested their performance on a cued flanker task, expected to elicit both proactive and reactive control processes. Results showed that alpha power and 1/f offset were smaller in older than younger adults, whereas theta power did not show age-related reductions. Resting alpha power and 1/f offset were associated with proactive control processes, whereas theta power was related to reactive control as measured by the cued flanker task. All associations were present over and above the effect of age, suggesting that these resting-state EEG correlates could be indicative of trait-like individual differences in cognitive control performance, which may be already evident in younger adults, and are still similarly present in healthy older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Investigating Arousal, Saccade Preparation, and Global Luminance Effects on Microsaccade Behavior</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.602835</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.602835</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Microsaccades, small saccadic eye movements occurring during fixation, have been suggested to be modulated by various sensory, cognitive, and affective processes relating to arousal. Although the modulation of fatigue-related arousal on microsaccade behavior has previously been characterized, the influence of other aspects of arousal, such as emotional arousal, is less understood. Moreover, microsaccades are modulated by cognitive processes (e.g., voluntary saccade preparation) that could also be linked to arousal. To investigate the influence of emotional arousal, saccade preparation, and global luminance levels on microsaccade behavior, emotional auditory stimuli were presented prior to the onset of a fixation cue whose color indicated to look either at the peripheral stimulus (pro-saccade) or in the opposite direction of the stimulus (anti-saccade). Microsaccade behavior was found to be significantly modulated by saccade preparation and global luminance level, but not emotional arousal. In the pro- and anti-saccade task, microsaccade rate was lower during anti-saccade preparation as compared to pro-saccade preparation, though microsaccade dynamics were comparable during both trial types. Our results reveal a differential role of arousal linked to emotion, fatigue, saccade preparation, and global luminance level on microsaccade behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Dopamine in Auditory Nuclei and Lemniscal Projections is Poised to Influence Acoustic Integration in the Inferior Colliculus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.624563</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.624563</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dopamine (DA) modulates the activity of nuclei within the ascending and descending auditory pathway. Previous studies have identified neurons and fibers in the inferior colliculus (IC) which are positively labeled for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a key enzyme in the synthesis of dopamine. However, the origins of the tyrosine hydroxylase positive projections to the inferior colliculus have not been fully explored. The lateral lemniscus (LL) provides a robust inhibitory projection to the inferior colliculus and plays a role in the temporal processing of sound. In the present study, immunoreactivity for tyrosine hydroxylase was examined in animals with and without 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions. Lesioning, with 6-OHDA placed in the inferior colliculus, led to a significant reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase immuno-positive labeling in the lateral lemniscus and inferior colliculus. Immunolabeling for dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT), enzymes responsible for the synthesis of norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E), respectively, were evaluated. Very little immunoreactivity for DBH and no immunoreactivity for PNMT was found within the cell bodies of the dorsal, intermediate, or ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus. The results indicate that catecholaminergic neurons of the lateral lemniscus are likely dopaminergic and not noradrenergic or adrenergic. Next, high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis was used to confirm that dopamine is present in the inferior colliculus and nuclei that send projections to the inferior colliculus, including the cochlear nucleus (CN), superior olivary complex (SOC), lateral lemniscus, and auditory cortex (AC). Finally, fluorogold, a retrograde tracer, was injected into the inferior colliculus of adult rats. Each subdivision of the lateral lemniscus contained fluorogold within the somata, with the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus showing the most robust projections to the inferior colliculus. Fluorogold-tyrosine hydroxylase colocalization within the lateral lemniscus was assessed. The dorsal and intermediate nuclei neurons exhibiting similar degrees of colocalization, while neurons of the ventral nucleus had significantly fewer colocalized fluorogold-tyrosine hydroxylase labeled neurons. These results suggest that several auditory nuclei that project to the inferior colliculus contain dopamine, dopaminergic neurons in the lateral lemniscus project to the inferior colliculus and that dopaminergic neurotransmission is poised to play a pivotal role in the function of the inferior colliculus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Modeling of Astrocyte Networks: Toward Realistic Topology and Dynamics</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.645068</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.645068</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal firing and neuron-to-neuron synaptic wiring are currently widely described as orchestrated by astrocytes—elaborately ramified glial cells tiling the cortical and hippocampal space into non-overlapping domains, each covering hundreds of individual dendrites and hundreds thousands synapses. A key component to astrocytic signaling is the dynamics of cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; which displays multiscale spatiotemporal patterns from short confined elemental Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; events (puffs) to Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; waves expanding through many cells. Here, we synthesize the current understanding of astrocyte morphology, coupling local synaptic activity to astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in perisynaptic astrocytic processes and morphology-defined mechanisms of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; regulation in a distributed model. To this end, we build simplified realistic data-driven spatial network templates and compile model equations as defined by local cell morphology. The input to the model is spatially uncorrelated stochastic synaptic activity. The proposed modeling approach is validated by statistics of simulated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients at a single cell level. In multicellular templates we observe regular sequences of cell entrainment in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; waves, as a result of interplay between stochastic input and morphology variability between individual astrocytes. Our approach adds spatial dimension to the existing astrocyte models by employment of realistic morphology while retaining enough flexibility and scalability to be embedded in multiscale heterocellular models of neural tissue. We conclude that the proposed approach provides a useful description of neuron-driven Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-activity in the astrocyte syncytium.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Correlation of Frontal Atrophy and CSF Tau Levels With Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Patients With Cognitive Impairment: A Memory Clinic Experience</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are a distressful condition. We aimed to investigate the BPSD distribution in subjects with cognitive impairment, and the potential correlations between BPSD and neurodegeneration in terms of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau and brain atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: One-hundred patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia (Alzheimer’s disease, AD; Lewy-body disease, LBD; frontotemporal dementia, FTD; vascular dementia, VD) underwent a complete diagnostic workup, including 3T-MRI and/or CT and CSF. Cortical atrophy was assessed with medial temporal atrophy (MTA), posterior atrophy (PA), and global cortical atrophy-frontal lobe (GCA-F) scales. BPSD were rated using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), and BPSD clusters were defined according to the European Alzheimer Disease Consortium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Delusions, hallucinations, and psychosis cluster were differently distributed among the diagnostic groups (p &amp;lt; 0.05, p &amp;lt; 0.001, and p &amp;lt; 0.05), with LBD patients showing higher scores for hallucinations (vs. MCI, p &amp;lt; 0.001, and AD, p &amp;lt; 0.05) and psychosis cluster (vs. MCI, p &amp;lt; 0.05). In primary dementias, we found a negative correlation between NPI total score and tau levels (p = 0.08), confirmed by beta regression (p &amp;lt; 0.01), while a positive non-significant relationship was observed in MCI. Higher GCA-F scores were associated with delusions and apathy (p &amp;lt; 0.05, on both hemispheres) and hallucinations (left: p &amp;lt; 0.01, right: p &amp;lt; 0.05). GCA-F scores were positively correlated with psychosis cluster (right: p &amp;lt; 0.05), and agitation/aggression (left: p &amp;lt; 0.05). Conversely, nighttime disturbances were positively correlated with both GCA-F and MTA scores (left: p &amp;lt; 0.01; right: p &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our results suggest that psychotic symptoms are significantly more represented in LBD patients and that CSF tau and frontal atrophy are associated with the occurrence and severity of BPSD in clinical practice. Longitudinal studies are however required to ascertain their actual predictive value.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Glial insulin regulates cooperative or antagonistic Golden goal/Flamingo interactions during photoreceptor axon guidance</title>

	<description>Transmembrane protein Golden goal (Gogo) interacts with atypical cadherin Flamingo to direct R8 photoreceptor axons in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; visual system. However, the precise mechanisms underlying Gogo regulation during columnar- and layer-specific R8 axon targeting are unknown. Our studies demonstrated that the insulin secreted from surface and cortex glia switches the phosphorylation status of Gogo, thereby regulating its two distinct functions. Non-phosphorylated Gogo mediates the initial recognition of the glial protrusion in the center of the medulla column, whereas phosphorylated Gogo suppresses radial filopodia extension by counteracting Flamingo to maintain a one axon to one column ratio. Later, Gogo expression ceases during the midpupal stage, thus allowing R8 filopodia to extend vertically into the M3 layer. These results demonstrate that the long- and short-range signaling between the glia and R8 axon growth cones regulates growth cone dynamics in a stepwise manner, and thus shape the entire organization of the visual system.</description>

	<description>Homing based gene drives, engineered using CRISPR/Cas9, have been proposed to spread desirable genes throughout populations. However, invasion of such drives can be hindered by the accumulation of resistant alleles. To limit this obstacle, we engineer a confinable population modification Home-and-Rescue (HomeR) drive in Drosophila targeting an essential gene. In our experiments, resistant alleles that disrupt the target gene function were recessive lethal, and therefore disadvantaged. We demonstrate that HomeR can achieve an increase in frequency in population cage experiments, but that fitness costs due to the Cas9 insertion limit drive efficacy. Finally, we conduct mathematical modeling comparing HomeR to contemporary gene drive architectures for population modification over wide ranges of fitness costs, transmission rates, and release regimens. HomeR could potentially be adapted to other species, as a means for safe, confinable, modification of wild populations.</description>

	<description>Establishing how many people have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 remains an urgent priority for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Serological tests that identify past infection can be used to estimate cumulative incidence, but the relative accuracy and robustness of various sampling strategies has been unclear. We developed a flexible framework that integrates uncertainty from test characteristics, sample size, and heterogeneity in seroprevalence across subpopulations to compare estimates from sampling schemes. Using the same framework and making the assumption that seropositivity indicates immune protection, we propagated estimates and uncertainty through dynamical models to assess uncertainty in the epidemiological parameters needed to evaluate public health interventions, and found that sampling schemes informed by demographics and contact networks outperform uniform sampling. The framework can be adapted to optimize serosurvey design given test characteristics and capacity, population demography, sampling strategy, and modeling approach, and can be tailored to support decision-making around introducing or removing interventions.</description>

	<description>Determining the molecular properties of neurons is essential to understand their development, function and evolution. Using Targeted DamID (TaDa), we characterize RNA polymerase II occupancy and chromatin accessibility in selected &lt;i&gt;Ionotropic &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;receptor&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Ir&lt;/i&gt;)-expressing olfactory sensory neurons in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. Although individual populations represent a minute fraction of cells, TaDa is sufficiently sensitive and specific to identify the expected receptor genes. Unique &lt;i&gt;Ir&lt;/i&gt; expression is not consistently associated with differences in chromatin accessibility, but rather to distinct transcription factor profiles. Genes that are heterogeneously-expressed across populations are enriched for neurodevelopmental factors, and we identify functions for the POU-domain protein Pdm3 as a genetic switch of Ir neuron fate, and the atypical cadherin Flamingo in segregation of neurons into discrete glomeruli. Together this study reveals the effectiveness of TaDa in profiling rare neural populations, identifies new roles for a transcription factor and a neuronal guidance molecule, and provides valuable datasets for future exploration.</description>

	<description>A notable example of spiral architecture in organs is the mammalian cochlear duct, where the morphology is critical for hearing function. Genetic studies have revealed necessary signaling molecules, but it remains unclear how cellular dynamics generate elongating, bending, and coiling of the cochlear duct. Here, we show that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation waves control collective cell migration during the murine cochlear duct development using deep tissue live-cell imaging, Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based quantitation, and mathematical modeling. Long-term FRET imaging reveals that helical ERK activation propagates from the apex duct tip concomitant with the reverse multicellular flow on the lateral side of the developing cochlear duct, resulting in advection-based duct elongation. Moreover, model simulations, together with experiments, explain that the oscillatory wave trains of ERK activity and the cell flow are generated by mechanochemical feedback. Our findings propose a regulatory mechanism to coordinate the multicellular behaviors underlying the duct elongation during development.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Physiologically based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model for the prediction of morphine brain disposition and analgesia in adults and children</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Laurens F. M. Verscheijden, Carlijn H. C. Litjens, Jan B. Koenderink, Ron H. J. Mathijssen, Marcel M. Verbeek, Saskia N. de Wildt, Frans G. M. Russel&lt;/p&gt;

Morphine is a widely used opioid analgesic, which shows large differences in clinical response in children, even when aiming for equivalent plasma drug concentrations. Age-dependent brain disposition of morphine could contribute to this variability, as developmental increase in blood-brain barrier (BBB) P-glycoprotein (Pgp) expression has been reported. In addition, age-related pharmacodynamics might also explain the variability in effect. To assess the influence of these processes on morphine effectiveness, a multi-compartment brain physiologically based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PB-PK/PD) model was developed in R (Version 3.6.2). Active Pgp-mediated morphine transport was measured in MDCKII-Pgp cells grown on transwell filters and translated by an &lt;i&gt;in vitro-in vivo&lt;/i&gt; extrapolation approach, which included developmental Pgp expression. Passive BBB permeability of morphine and its active metabolite morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) and their pharmacodynamic parameters were derived from experiments reported in literature. Model simulations after single dose morphine were compared with measured and published concentrations of morphine and M6G in plasma, brain extracellular fluid (ECF) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), as well as published drug responses in children (1 day– 16 years) and adults. Visual predictive checks indicated acceptable overlays between simulated and measured morphine and M6G concentration-time profiles and prediction errors were between 1 and -1. Incorporation of active Pgp-mediated BBB transport into the PB-PK/PD model resulted in a 1.3-fold reduced brain exposure in adults, indicating only a modest contribution on brain disposition. Analgesic effect-time profiles could be described reasonably well for older children and adults, but were largely underpredicted for neonates. In summary, an age-appropriate morphine PB-PK/PD model was developed for the prediction of brain pharmacokinetics and analgesic effects. In the neonatal population, pharmacodynamic characteristics, but not brain drug disposition, appear to be altered compared to adults and older children, which may explain the reported differences in analgesic effect.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NbwUuMplwc0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Age-structured non-pharmaceutical interventions for optimal control of COVID-19 epidemic</title>

In an epidemic, individuals can widely differ in the way they spread the infection depending on their age or on the number of days they have been infected for. In the absence of pharmaceutical interventions such as a vaccine or treatment, non-pharmaceutical interventions (&lt;i&gt;e.g&lt;/i&gt;. physical or social distancing) are essential to mitigate the pandemic. We develop an original approach to identify the optimal age-stratified control strategy to implement as a function of the time since the onset of the epidemic. This is based on a model with a double continuous structure in terms of host age and time since infection. By applying optimal control theory to this model, we identify a solution that minimizes deaths and costs associated with the implementation of the control strategy itself. We also implement this strategy for three countries with contrasted age distributions (Burkina-Faso, France, and Vietnam). Overall, the optimal strategy varies throughout the epidemic, with a more intense control early on, and depending on host age, with a stronger control for the older population, except in the scenario where the cost associated with the control is low. In the latter scenario, we find strong differences across countries because the control extends to the younger population for France and Vietnam 2 to 3 months after the onset of the epidemic, but not for Burkina Faso. Finally, we show that the optimal control strategy strongly outperforms a constant uniform control exerted over the whole population or over its younger fraction. This improved understanding of the effect of age-based control interventions opens new perspectives for the field, especially for age-based contact tracing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NP-QGyXkP6s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

We propose an analysis and applications of sample pooling to the epidemiologic monitoring of COVID-19. We first introduce a model of the RT-qPCR process used to test for the presence of virus in a sample and construct a statistical model for the viral load in a typical infected individual inspired by large-scale clinical datasets. We present an application of group testing for the prevention of epidemic outbreak in closed connected communities. We then propose a method for the measure of the prevalence in a population taking into account the increased number of false negatives associated with the group testing method.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8HMaprGIowc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The enzyme nitrogenase reduces dinitrogen to ammonia utilizing electrons, protons, and energy obtained from the hydrolysis of ATP. Mo-dependent nitrogenase is a symmetric dimer, with each half comprising an ATP-dependent reductase, termed the Fe Protein, and a catalytic protein, known as the MoFe protein, which hosts the electron transfer P-cluster and the active-site metal cofactor (FeMo-co). A series of synchronized events for the electron transfer have been characterized experimentally, in which electron delivery is coupled to nucleotide hydrolysis and regulated by an intricate allosteric network. We report a graph theory analysis of the mechanical coupling in the nitrogenase complex as a key step to understanding the dynamics of allosteric regulation of nitrogen reduction. This analysis shows that regions near the active sites undergo large-scale, large-amplitude correlated motions that enable communications within each half and between the two halves of the complex. Computational predictions of mechanically regions were validated against an analysis of the solution phase dynamics of the nitrogenase complex via hydrogen-deuterium exchange. These regions include the P-loops and the switch regions in the Fe proteins, the loop containing the residue β-188&lt;sup&gt;Ser&lt;/sup&gt; adjacent to the P-cluster in the MoFe protein, and the residues near the protein-protein interface. In particular, it is found that: (&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;) within each Fe protein, the switch regions I and II are coupled to the [4Fe-4S] cluster; (&lt;i&gt;ii&lt;/i&gt;) within each half of the complex, the switch regions I and II are coupled to the loop containing β-188&lt;sup&gt;Ser&lt;/sup&gt;; (&lt;i&gt;iii&lt;/i&gt;) between the two halves of the complex, the regions near the nucleotide binding pockets of the two Fe proteins (in particular the P-loops, located over 130 Å apart) are also mechanically coupled. Notably, we found that residues next to the P-cluster (in particular the loop containing β-188&lt;sup&gt;Ser&lt;/sup&gt;) are important for communication between the two halves.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/awb8dOq8sRc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Janez Demšar, Blaž Zupan&lt;/p&gt;

Overfitting is one of the critical problems in developing models by machine learning. With machine learning becoming an essential technology in computational biology, we must include training about overfitting in all courses that introduce this technology to students and practitioners. We here propose a hands-on training for overfitting that is suitable for introductory level courses and can be carried out on its own or embedded within any data science course. We use workflow-based design of machine learning pipelines, experimentation-based teaching, and hands-on approach that focuses on concepts rather than underlying mathematics. We here detail the data analysis workflows we use in training and motivate them from the viewpoint of teaching goals. Our proposed approach relies on Orange, an open-source data science toolbox that combines data visualization and machine learning, and that is tailored for education in machine learning and explorative data analysis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QBik8ingZkM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Existing compartmental mathematical modelling methods for epidemics, such as SEIR models, cannot accurately represent effects of contact tracing. This makes them inappropriate for evaluating testing and contact tracing strategies to contain an outbreak. An alternative used in practice is the application of agent- or individual-based models (ABM). However ABMs are complex, less well-understood and much more computationally expensive. This paper presents a new method for accurately including the effects of Testing, contact-Tracing and Isolation (TTI) strategies in standard compartmental models. We derive our method using a careful probabilistic argument to show how contact tracing at the individual level is reflected in aggregate on the population level. We show that the resultant SEIR-TTI model accurately approximates the behaviour of a mechanistic agent-based model at far less computational cost. The computational efficiency is such that it can be easily and cheaply used for exploratory modelling to quantify the required levels of testing and tracing, alone and with other interventions, to assist adaptive planning for managing disease outbreaks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/43t7fNS7pq4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are a small population of undifferentiated cells that have the capacity for self-renewal and differentiate into all blood cell lineages. These cells are the most useful cells for clinical transplantations and for regenerative medicine. So far, it has not been possible to expand adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) without losing their self-renewal properties. CD74 is a cell surface receptor for the cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), and its mRNA is known to be expressed in HSCs. Here, we demonstrate that mice lacking CD74 exhibit an accumulation of HSCs in the bone marrow (BM) due to their increased potential to repopulate and compete for BM niches. Our results suggest that CD74 regulates the maintenance of the HSCs and CD18 expression. Its absence leads to induced survival of these cells and accumulation of quiescent and proliferating cells. Furthermore, in in vitro experiments, blocking of CD74 elevated the numbers of HSPCs. Thus, we suggest that blocking CD74 could lead to improved clinical insight into BM transplant protocols, enabling improved engraftment.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/vmo-KLRPzv8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Custom made antibodies against four putative neuropeptides where used on whole mounts of the box jellyfish, Tripedalia cystophora, and revealed new details of the neuroanatomy in both the rhopalium and in the bell. These neuropeptides are most likely neurotransmitters in most stained neurons but might also be involved in neuronal development.






Abstract
Box jellyfish have an elaborate visual system and perform advanced visually guided behaviours. However, the rhopalial nervous system (RNS), believed to be the main visual processing centre, only has 1000 neurons in each of the four eye carrying rhopalia. We have examined the detailed structure of the RNS of the box jellyfish Tripedalia cystophora, using immuno‐labelling with antibodies raised against four putative neuropeptides (T. cys RFamide, VWamide, RAamide and FRamide). In the RNS T. cys RF‐, VW‐ and RAamide antibodies stain sensory neurons, the pit eyes, the neuropil, and in peptide specific subpopulations of stalk associated neurons and giant neurons. Furthermore, RFamide ir+ neurites are seen in the epidermal stalk nerve, whereas VWamide antibodies stain the gastrodermal stalk nerve. RFamide has the most widespread expression including in the ring and radial nerves, the pedalium nerve plexus and in the tentacular nerve net. RAamide is the putative neurotransmitter in the motor neurons of the subumbrellar nerve net and VWamide is a potential marker for neuronal differentiation as it is found in subpopulations of undifferentiated cells both in the rhopalia and in the bell. The results from the FRamide antibodies were not included as only few cells were stained and in an unreproducible way. Our studies show hitherto unseen details of the nervous system of T. cystophora, and allowed us to identify specific functional groups of neurons. This identification is important for understanding visual processing in the RNS and enables experimental work, directly addressing the role of the different neuropeptides in vision.

	<description>Parkinson's disease and other Lewy body spectrum diseases (LBDs) are associated with a specific risk for clinical depression. In the present clinicopathological study with 73 patients with LBD, we observed that the substantia nigra pars compacta dopamine neuron density was markedly lower in patients who had comorbid depression antemortem than in nondepressed patients (1.52 vs 2.32 n/mm2, p = 0.004). There were no differences in cognition, motor disease severity, antiparkinsonian medications, or disease duration between groups. The results implicate the substantia nigra as an important psychomotor modulatory area of mood in patients with Lewy body disorders. ANN NEUROL 2021</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Functional Convergence of Motor and Social Processes in Lobule IV/V of the Mouse Cerebellum</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Topographic organization of the cerebellum is largely segregated into the anterior and posterior lobes that represent its “motor” and “non-motor” functions, respectively. Although patients with damage to the anterior cerebellum often exhibit motor deficits, it remains unclear whether and how such an injury affects cognitive and social behaviors. To address this, we perturbed the activity of major anterior lobule IV/V in mice by either neurotoxic lesion or chemogenetic excitation of Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex. We found that both of the manipulations impaired motor coordination, but not general locomotion or anxiety-related behavior. The lesioned animals showed memory deficits in object recognition and social-associative recognition tests, which were confounded by a lack of exploration. Chemogenetic excitation of Purkinje cells disrupted the animals’ social approach in a less-preferred context and social memory, without affecting their overall exploration and object-based memory. In a free social interaction test, the two groups exhibited less interaction with a stranger conspecific. Subsequent &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;c-Fos&lt;/em&gt; imaging indicated that decreased neuronal activities in the medial prefrontal cortex, hippocampal dentate gyrus, parahippocampal cortices, and basolateral amygdala, as well as disorganized modular structures of the brain networks might underlie the reduced social interaction. These findings suggest that the anterior cerebellum plays an intricate role in processing motor, cognitive, and social functions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Freeze-Frame Imaging of Dendritic Calcium Signals With TubuTag</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The extensive dendritic arbor of neurons is thought to be actively involved in the processing of information. Dendrites contain a rich diversity of ligand- and voltage-activated ion channels as well as metabotropic receptors. In addition, they are capable of releasing calcium from intracellular stores. Under specific conditions, large neurons produce calcium spikes that are locally restricted to a dendritic section. To investigate calcium signaling in dendrites, we introduce TubuTag, a genetically encoded ratiometric calcium sensor anchored to the cytoskeleton. TubuTag integrates cytoplasmic calcium signals by irreversible photoconversion from green to red fluorescence when illuminated with violet light. We used a custom two-photon microscope with a large field of view to image pyramidal neurons in CA1 at subcellular resolution. Photoconversion was strongest in the most distal parts of the apical dendrite, suggesting a gradient in the amplitude of dendritic calcium signals. As the read-out of fluorescence can be performed several hours after photoconversion, TubuTag will help investigating dendritic signal integration and calcium homeostasis in large populations of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Circulating MicroRNAs and Long Non-coding RNAs as Potential Diagnostic Biomarkers for Parkinson’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the world’s second most common neurodegenerative disease that is associated with age. With the aging of the population, patients with PD are increasing in number year by year. Most such patients lose their ability to self-care with disease progression, which brings an incalculable burden to individual families and society. The pathogenesis of PD is complex, and its clinical manifestations are diverse. Therefore, it is of great significance to screen for circulating biomarkers associated with PD to reveal its pathogenesis and develop objective diagnostic methods so as to prevent, control, and treat the disease. In recent years, microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are considered to be effective biomarkers for various diseases due to their stability, and resistance to RNAase digestion and extreme conditions in circulating fluids. Here, we review recent advances in the detection of abnormally expressed miRNAs and lncRNAs in PD circulating fluids, and discuss the function and molecular mechanisms of plasma or serum miR-124, miR-132, miR-29, miR-221, miR-7, miR-433, and miR-153 in the regulation and progression of PD. Additionally, application of the differential expression of lncRNAs in circulating fluid in the pathological progression and diagnosis of PD is also reviewed. In short, the determination of abnormally expressed circulating miRNAs and lncRNAs will be valuable for the future diagnosis and treatment of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Lateral Habenula Glutamatergic Neurons Modulate Isoflurane Anesthesia in Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Since their introduction in the 1840s, one of the largest mysteries of modern anesthesia are how general anesthetics create the state of reversible loss of consciousness. Increasing researchers have shown that neural pathways that regulate endogenous sleep–wake systems are also involved in general anesthesia. Recently, the Lateral Habenula (LHb) was considered as a hot spot for both natural sleep–wake and propofol-induced sedation; however, the role of the LHb and related pathways in the isoflurane-induced unconsciousness has yet to be identified. Here, using real-time calcium fiber photometry recordings in vivo, we found that isoflurane reversibly increased the activity of LHb glutamatergic neurons. Then, we selectively ablated LHb glutamatergic neurons in Vglut2-cre mice, which caused a longer induction time and less recovery time along with a decrease in delta-band power in mice under isoflurane anesthesia. Furthermore, using a chemogenetic approach to specifically activate LHb glutamatergic neurons shortened the induction time and prolonged the recovery time in mice under isoflurane anesthesia with an increase in delta-band power. In contrast, chemogenetic inhibition of LHb glutamatergic neurons was very similar to the effects of selective lesions of LHb glutamatergic neurons. Finally, optogenetic activation of LHb glutamatergic neurons or the synaptic terminals of LHb glutamatergic neurons in the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) produced a hypnosis-promoting effect in isoflurane anesthesia with an increase in slow wave activity. Our results suggest that LHb glutamatergic neurons and pathway are vital in modulating isoflurane anesthesia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Complement Activation in the Central Nervous System: A Biophysical Model for Immune Dysregulation in the Disease State</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.620090</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Complement, a feature of the innate immune system that targets pathogens for phagocytic clearance and promotes inflammation, is tightly regulated to prevent damage to host tissue. This regulation is paramount in the central nervous system (CNS) since complement proteins degrade neuronal synapses during development, homeostasis, and neurodegeneration. We propose that dysregulated complement, particularly C1 or C3b, may errantly target synapses for immune-mediated clearance, therefore highlighting regulatory failure as a major potential mediator of neurological disease. First, we explore the mechanics of molecular neuroimmune relationships for the regulatory proteins: Complement Receptor 1, C1-Inhibitor, Factor H, and the CUB-sushi multiple domain family. We propose that biophysical and chemical principles offer clues for understanding mechanisms of dysregulation. Second, we describe anticipated effects to CNS disease processes (particularly Alzheimer's Disease) and nest our ideas within existing basic science, clinical, and epidemiological findings. Finally, we illustrate how the concepts presented within this manuscript provoke new ways of approaching age-old neurodegenerative processes. Every component of this model is testable by straightforward experimentation and highlights the untapped potential of complement dysregulation as a driver of CNS disease. This includes a putative role for complement-based neurotherapeutic agents and companion biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Rationalizing the Role of Monosodium Glutamate in the Protein Aggregation Through Biophysical Approaches: Potential Impact on Neurodegeneration</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is the world’s most extensively used food additive and is generally recognized as safe according to the FDA. However, it is well reported that MSG is associated with a number of neurological diseases, and in turn, neurological diseases are associated with protein aggregation. This study rationalized the role of MSG in protein aggregation using different biophysical techniques such as absorption, far-UV CD, DLS, and ITC. Kinetic measurements revealed that MSG causes significant enhancement of aggregation of BSA through a nucleation-dependent polymerization mechanism. Also, CTAB-BSA aggregation is enhanced by MSG significantly. MSG-induced BSA aggregation also exhibits the formation of irreversible aggregates, temperature dependence, non-Arrhenius behavior, and enhancement of hydrodynamic diameter. From the isothermal titration calorimetry measurement, the significant endothermic heat of the interaction of BSA-MSG indicates that protein aggregation may be due to the coupling of MSG with the protein. The determined enthalpy change (ΔH) is largely positive, also suggesting an endothermic nature, whereas entropy change (ΔS) is positive and Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) is largely negative, suggesting the spontaneous nature of the interaction. Furthermore, even a low concentration of MSG is involved in the unfolding of the secondary structure of protein with the disappearance of original peaks and the formation of a unique peak in the far-UV CD, which is an attention-grabbing observation. This is the first investigation which links the dietary MSG with protein aggregation and thus will be very instrumental in understanding the mechanism of various MSG-related human physiological as well as neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Remyelination is a naturally occurring response to demyelination and has a central role in the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis and traumatic brain injury. Recently we demonstrated that a novel MRI technique entitled Relaxation Along a Fictitious Field (RAFF) in the rotating frame of rank n (RAFFn) achieved exceptional sensitivity in detecting the demyelination processes induced by lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) in rat brain. In the present work, our aim was to test whether RAFF4, along with magnetization transfer (MT) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), would be capable of detecting the changes in the myelin content and microstructure caused by modifications of myelin sheets around axons or by gliosis during the remyelination phase after LPC-induced demyelination in the corpus callosum of rats. We collected MRI data with RAFF4, MT and DTI at 3 days after injection (demyelination stage) and at 38 days after injection (remyelination stage) of LPC (n = 12) or vehicle (n = 9). Cell density and myelin content were assessed by histology. All MRI metrics detected differences between LPC-injected and control groups of animals in the demyelination stage, on day 3. In the remyelination phase (day 38), RAFF4, MT parameters, fractional anisotropy, and axial diffusivity detected signs of a partial recovery consistent with the remyelination evident in histology. Radial diffusivity had undergone a further increase from day 3 to 38 and mean diffusivity revealed a complete recovery correlating with the histological assessment of cell density attributed to gliosis. The combination of RAFF4, MT and DTI has the potential to differentiate between normal, demyelinated and remyelinated axons and gliosis and thus it may be able to provide a more detailed assessment of white matter pathologies in several neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Case Report: Aperiodic Fluctuations of Neural Activity in the Ictal MEG of a Child With Drug-Resistant Fronto-Temporal Epilepsy</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Successful surgical treatment of patients with focal drug-resistant epilepsy remains challenging, especially in cases for which it is difficult to define the area of cortex from which seizures originate, the seizure onset zone (SOZ). Various diagnostic methods are needed to select surgical candidates and determine the extent of resection. Interictal magnetoencephalography (MEG) with source imaging has proven to be useful for presurgical evaluation, but the use of ictal MEG data remains limited. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether pre-ictal variations of spectral properties of neural activity from ictal MEG recordings are predictive of SOZ location.We performed a 4 h overnight MEG recording in an 8-year-old child with drug-resistant focal epilepsy of suspected right fronto-temporal origin and captured one ~45-s seizure. The patient underwent a right temporal resection from the anterior temporal neocortex and amygdala to the mid-posterior temporal neocortex, sparing the hippocampus proper. She remains seizure-free 21 months postoperatively. The histopathological assessment confirmed frank focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type IIa in the MEG-defined SOZ, which was based on source imaging of averaged ictal spikes at seizure onset. We investigated temporal changes (inter-ictal, pre-ictal, and ictal periods) together with spatial differences (SOZ vs. control regions) in spectral parameters of background brain activity, namely the aperiodic broadband offset and slope, and assessed how they confounded the interpretation of apparent variations of signal power in typical electrophysiological bands. Our data show that the SOZ was associated with a higher aperiodic offset and exponent during the seizure compared to control regions. Both parameters increased in all regions from 2 min before the seizure onwards. Regions anatomically closer to the SOZ also expressed higher values compared to contralateral regions, potentially indicating ictal spread. We also show that narrow-band power changes were caused by these fluctuations in the aperiodic component of ongoing brain activity. Our results indicate that the broadband aperiodic component of ongoing brain activity cannot be reduced to background noise of no physiological interest, and rather may be indicative of the neuropathophysiology of the SOZ. We believe these findings will inspire future studies of ictal MEG cases and confirm their significance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Handgrip Based Action Information Modulates Attentional Selection: An ERP Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.634359</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.634359</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Prior work shows that the possibility of action to an object (visual affordance) facilitates attentional deployment. We sought to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying this modulation of attention by examining ERPs to target objects that were either congruently or incongruently gripped for their use in the presence of a congruently or incongruently gripped distractor. Participants responded to the presence or absence of a target object matching a preceding action word with a distractor object presented in the opposite location. Participants were faster in responding to congruently gripped targets compared to incongruently gripped targets. There was a reduced N2pc potential when the target was congruently gripped, and the distractor was incongruently gripped compared to the conditions where targets were incongruently gripped or when the distractor, as well as target, was congruently gripped. The N2pc results indicate that target selection is easier when action information is congruent with an object’s use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Visual Modulation of Human Responses to Support Surface Translation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Vision is known to improve human postural responses to external perturbations. This study investigates the role of vision for the responses to continuous pseudorandom support surface translations in the body sagittal plane in three visual conditions: with the eyes closed (EC), in stroboscopic illumination (EO/SI; only visual position information) and with eyes open in continuous illumination (EO/CI; position and velocity information) with the room as static visual scene (or the interior of a moving cabin, in some of the trials). In the frequency spectrum of the translation stimulus we distinguished on the basis of the response patterns between a low-frequency, mid-frequency, and high-frequency range (LFR: 0.0165-0.14 Hz; MFR: 0.15–0.57 Hz; HFR: 0.58–2.46 Hz). With EC, subjects’ mean sway response gain was very low in the LFR. On average it increased with EO/SI (although not to a significant degree p = 0.078) and more so with EO/CI (p &amp;lt; 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;). In contrast, the average gain in the MFR decreased from EC to EO/SI (although not to a significant degree, p = 0.548) and further to EO/CI (p = 0.0002). In the HFR, all three visual conditions produced, similarly, high gain levels. A single inverted pendulum (SIP) model controlling center of mass (COM) balancing about the ankle joints formally described the EC response as being strongly shaped by a resonance phenomenon arising primarily from the control’s proprioceptive feedback loop. The effect of adding visual information in these simulations lies in a reduction of the resonance, similar as in the experiments. Extending the model to a double inverted pendulum (DIP) suggested in addition a biomechanical damping effective from trunk sway in the hip joints on the resonance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Unsupervised Learning and Clustered Connectivity Enhance Reinforcement Learning in Spiking Neural Networks</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Reinforcement learning is a paradigm that can account for how organisms learn to adapt their behavior in complex environments with sparse rewards. To partition an environment into discrete states, implementations in spiking neuronal networks typically rely on input architectures involving place cells or receptive fields specified ad hoc by the researcher. This is problematic as a model for how an organism can learn appropriate behavioral sequences in unknown environments, as it fails to account for the unsupervised and self-organized nature of the required representations. Additionally, this approach presupposes knowledge on the part of the researcher on how the environment should be partitioned and represented and scales poorly with the size or complexity of the environment. To address these issues and gain insights into how the brain generates its own task-relevant mappings, we propose a learning architecture that combines unsupervised learning on the input projections with biologically motivated clustered connectivity within the representation layer. This combination allows input features to be mapped to clusters; thus the network self-organizes to produce clearly distinguishable activity patterns that can serve as the basis for reinforcement learning on the output projections. On the basis of the MNIST and Mountain Car tasks, we show that our proposed model performs better than either a comparable unclustered network or a clustered network with static input projections. We conclude that the combination of unsupervised learning and clustered connectivity provides a generic representational substrate suitable for further computation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Theta Rhythm of the Hippocampus: From Neuronal and Circuit Mechanisms to Behavior</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.649262</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.649262</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This review focuses on the neuronal and circuit mechanisms involved in the generation of the theta (θ) rhythm and of its participation in behavior. Data have accumulated indicating that θ arises from interactions between medial septum-diagonal band of Broca (MS-DbB) and intra-hippocampal circuits. The intrinsic properties of MS-DbB and hippocampal neurons have also been shown to play a key role in θ generation. A growing number of studies suggest that θ may represent a timing mechanism to temporally organize movement sequences, memory encoding, or planned trajectories for spatial navigation. To accomplish those functions, θ and gamma (γ) oscillations interact during the awake state and REM sleep, which are considered to be critical for learning and memory processes. Further, we discuss that the loss of this interaction is at the base of various neurophatological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Membrane Interaction of Alpha-Synuclein</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A presynaptic protein closely related to Parkinson's disease (PD), α-synuclein (α-Syn), has been studied extensively regarding its pathogenic mechanisms. As a physiological protein in presynapses, however, α-Syn's physiological function remains unclear. Its location in nerve terminals and effects on membrane fusion also imply its functional role in synaptic transmission, including its possible interaction with high-curvature membranes via its N-terminus and amorphous C-terminus. PD-related mutants that disrupt the membrane interaction (e.g., A30P and G51D) additionally suggest a relationship between α-Syn's pathogenic mechanisms and physiological roles through the membrane binding. Here, we summarize recent research on how α-Syn and its variants interact with membranes and influence synaptic transmission. We list several membrane-related connections between the protein's physiological function and the pathological mechanisms that stand to expand current understandings of α-Syn.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Synaptic Function and Dysfunction in Lysosomal Storage Diseases</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) with neurological involvement are inherited genetic diseases of the metabolism characterized by lysosomal dysfunction and the accumulation of undegraded substrates altering glial and neuronal function. Often, patients with neurological manifestations present with damage to the gray and white matter and irreversible neuronal decline. The use of animal models of LSDs has greatly facilitated studying and identifying potential mechanisms of neuronal dysfunction, including alterations in availability and function of synaptic proteins, modifications of membrane structure, deficits in docking, exocytosis, recycling of synaptic vesicles, and inflammation-mediated remodeling of synapses. Although some extrapolations from findings in adult-onset conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease or Parkinson’s disease have been reported, the pathogenetic mechanisms underpinning cognitive deficits in LSDs are still largely unclear. Without being fully inclusive, the goal of this mini-review is to present a discussion on possible mechanisms leading to synaptic dysfunction in LSDs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Assessment of the Concordance and Diagnostic Accuracy Between Elecsys and Lumipulse Fully Automated Platforms and Innotest</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Manual ELISA assays are the most commonly used methods for quantification of biomarkers; however, they often show inter- and intra-laboratory variability that limits their wide use. Here, we compared the Innotest ELISA method with two fully automated platforms (Lumipulse and Elecsys) to determine whether these new methods can provide effective substitutes for ELISA assays. We included 149 patients with AD (n = 34), MCI (n = 94) and non-AD dementias (n = 21). Aβ42, T-tau, and P-tau were quantified using the ELISA method (Innotest, Fujirebio Europe), CLEIA method on a Lumipulse G600II (Fujirebio Diagnostics), and ECLIA method on a Cobas e 601 (Roche Diagnostics) instrument. We found a high correlation between the three methods, although there were systematic differences between biomarker values measured by each method. Both Lumipulse and Elecsys methods were highly concordant with clinical diagnoses, and the combination of Lumipulse Aβ42 and P-tau had the highest discriminating power (AUC 0.915, 95% CI 0.822–1.000). We also assessed the agreement of AT(N) classification for each method with AD diagnosis. Although differences were not significant, the use of Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio instead of Aβ42 alone in AT(N) classification enhanced the diagnostic accuracy (AUC 0.798, 95% CI 0.649–0.947 vs. AUC 0.778, 95% CI 0.617–0.939). We determined the cut-offs for the Lumipulse and Elecsys assays based on the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio ± status as a marker of amyloid pathology, and these cut-offs were consistent with those recommended by manufacturers, which had been determined based on visual amyloid PET imaging or diagnostic accuracy. Finally, the biomarker ratios (P-tau/Aβ42 and T-tau/Aβ42) were more consistent with the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio for both Lumipulse and Elecsys methods, and Elecsys P-tau/Aβ42 had the highest consistency with amyloid pathology (AUC 0.994, 95% CI 0.986–1.000 and OPA 96.4%) at the ≥0.024 cut-off. The Lumipulse and Elecsys cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD assays showed high analytical and clinical performances. As both automated platforms were standardized for reference samples, their use is recommended for the measurement of CSF AD biomarkers compared with unstandardized manual methods, such as Innotest ELISA, that have demonstrated a high inter and intra-laboratory variability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Forecasting the risk of pathogen spillover from reservoir populations of wild or domestic animals is essential for the effective deployment of interventions such as wildlife vaccination or culling. Due to the sporadic nature of spillover events and limited availability of data, developing and validating robust, spatially explicit, predictions is challenging. Recent efforts have begun to make progress in this direction by capitalizing on machine learning methodologies. An important weakness of existing approaches, however, is that they generally rely on combining human and reservoir infection data during the training process and thus conflate risk attributable to the prevalence of the pathogen in the reservoir population with the risk attributed to the realized rate of spillover into the human population. Because effective planning of interventions requires that these components of risk be disentangled, we developed a multi-layer machine learning framework that separates these processes. Our approach begins by training models to predict the geographic range of the primary reservoir and the subset of this range in which the pathogen occurs. The spillover risk predicted by the product of these reservoir specific models is then fit to data on realized patterns of historical spillover into the human population. The result is a geographically specific spillover risk forecast that can be easily decomposed and used to guide effective intervention. Applying our method to Lassa virus, a zoonotic pathogen that regularly spills over into the human population across West Africa, results in a model that explains a modest but statistically significant portion of geographic variation in historical patterns of spillover. When combined with a mechanistic mathematical model of infection dynamics, our spillover risk model predicts that 897,700 humans are infected by Lassa virus each year across West Africa, with Nigeria accounting for more than half of these human infections.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_lf2kqbW0e4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Neural modelling of the encoding of fast frequency modulation</title>

Frequency modulation (FM) is a basic constituent of vocalisation in many animals as well as in humans. In human speech, short rising and falling FM-sweeps of around 50 ms duration, called formant transitions, characterise individual speech sounds. There are two representations of FM in the ascending auditory pathway: a spectral representation, holding the instantaneous frequency of the stimuli; and a sweep representation, consisting of neurons that respond selectively to FM direction. To-date computational models use feedforward mechanisms to explain FM encoding. However, from neuroanatomy we know that there are massive feedback projections in the auditory pathway. Here, we found that a classical FM-sweep perceptual effect, the sweep pitch shift, cannot be explained by standard feedforward processing models. We hypothesised that the sweep pitch shift is caused by a predictive feedback mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel model of FM encoding incorporating a predictive interaction between the sweep and the spectral representation. The model was designed to encode sweeps of the duration, modulation rate, and modulation shape of formant transitions. It fully accounted for experimental data that we acquired in a perceptual experiment with human participants as well as previously published experimental results. We also designed a new class of stimuli for a second perceptual experiment to further validate the model. Combined, our results indicate that predictive interaction between the frequency encoding and direction encoding neural representations plays an important role in the neural processing of FM. In the brain, this mechanism is likely to occur at early stages of the processing hierarchy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/io_kgaV_ykQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Up-down biphasic volume response of human red blood cells to PIEZO1 activation during capillary transits</title>

In this paper we apply a novel JAVA version of a model on the homeostasis of human red blood cells (RBCs) to investigate the changes RBCs experience during single capillary transits. In the companion paper we apply a model extension to investigate the changes in RBC homeostasis over the approximately 200000 capillary transits during the ~120 days lifespan of the cells. These are topics inaccessible to direct experimentation but rendered mature for a computational modelling approach by the large body of recent and early experimental results which robustly constrain the range of parameter values and model outcomes, offering a unique opportunity for an in depth study of the mechanisms involved. Capillary transit times vary between 0.5 and 1.5s during which the red blood cells squeeze and deform in the capillary stream transiently opening stress-gated PIEZO1 channels allowing ion gradient dissipation and creating minuscule quantal changes in RBC ion contents and volume. Widely accepted views, based on the effects of experimental shear stress on human RBCs, suggested that quantal changes generated during capillary transits add up over time to develop the documented changes in RBC density and composition during their long circulatory lifespan, the quantal hypothesis. Applying the new red cell model (RCM) we investigated here the changes in homeostatic variables that may be expected during single capillary transits resulting from transient PIEZO1 channel activation. The predicted quantal volume changes were infinitesimal in magnitude, biphasic in nature, and essentially irreversible within inter-transit periods. A sub-second transient PIEZO1 activation triggered a sharp swelling peak followed by a much slower recovery period towards lower-than-baseline volumes. The peak response was caused by net CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and fluid gain via PIEZO1 channels driven by the steep electrochemical inward Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; gradient. The ensuing dehydration followed a complex time-course with sequential, but partially overlapping contributions by KCl loss via Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated Gardos channels, restorative Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; extrusion by the plasma membrane calcium pump, and chloride efflux by the Jacobs-Steward mechanism. The change in relative cell volume predicted for single capillary transits was around 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;, an infinitesimal volume change incompatible with a functional role in capillary flow. The biphasic response predicted by the RCM appears to conform to the quantal hypothesis, but whether its cumulative effects could account for the documented changes in density during RBC senescence required an investigation of the effects of myriad transits over the full four months circulatory lifespan of the cells, the subject of the next paper.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Lj1OPWU3UrY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: MITOL-dependent ubiquitylation negatively regulates the entry of PolγA into mitochondria</title>

Mutations in mitochondrial replicative polymerase PolγA lead to progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO). While PolγA is the known central player in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication, it is unknown whether a regulatory process exists on the mitochondrial outer membrane which controlled its entry into the mitochondria. We now demonstrate that PolγA is ubiquitylated by mitochondrial E3 ligase, MITOL (or MARCH5, RNF153). Ubiquitylation in wild-type (WT) PolγA occurs at Lysine 1060 residue via K6 linkage. Ubiquitylation of PolγA negatively regulates its binding to Tom20 and thereby its mitochondrial entry. While screening different PEO patients for mitochondrial entry, we found that a subset of the PolγA mutants is hyperubiquitylated by MITOL and interact less with Tom20. These PolγA variants cannot enter into mitochondria, instead becomes enriched in the insoluble fraction and undergo enhanced degradation. Hence, mtDNA replication, as observed via BrdU incorporation into the mtDNA, was compromised in these PEO mutants. However, by manipulating their ubiquitylation status by 2 independent techniques, these PEO mutants were reactivated, which allowed the incorporation of BrdU into mtDNA. Thus, regulated entry of non-ubiquitylated PolγA may have beneficial consequences for certain PEO patients.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Q1lc4OzFC2E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: A unified mechanism for the control of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; wing growth by the morphogens Decapentaplegic and Wingless</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Myriam Zecca, Gary Struhl&lt;/p&gt;

Development of the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; wing—a paradigm of organ development—is governed by 2 morphogens, Decapentaplegic (Dpp, a BMP) and Wingless (Wg, a Wnt). Both proteins are produced by defined subpopulations of cells and spread outwards, forming gradients that control gene expression and cell pattern as a function of concentration. They also control growth, but how is unknown. Most studies have focused on Dpp and yielded disparate models in which cells throughout the wing grow at similar rates in response to the grade or temporal change in Dpp concentration or to the different amounts of Dpp “equalized” by molecular or mechanical feedbacks. In contrast, a model for Wg posits that growth is governed by a progressive expansion in morphogen range, via a mechanism in which a minimum threshold of Wg sustains the growth of cells within the wing and recruits surrounding “pre-wing” cells to grow and enter the wing. This mechanism depends on the capacity of Wg to fuel the autoregulation of &lt;i&gt;vestigial&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;vg&lt;/i&gt;)—the selector gene that specifies the wing state—both to sustain &lt;i&gt;vg&lt;/i&gt; expression in wing cells and by a feed-forward (FF) circuit of Fat (Ft)/Dachsous (Ds) protocadherin signaling to induce &lt;i&gt;vg&lt;/i&gt; expression in neighboring pre-wing cells. Here, we have subjected Dpp to the same experimental tests used to elucidate the Wg model and find that it behaves indistinguishably. Hence, we posit that both morphogens act together, via a common mechanism, to control wing growth as a function of morphogen range.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/VxPNZ5hhW64&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Open Practical Laboratories in Neurosciences are outreach activities aimed towards middle schoo students in the Brazilian Amazon, discussing neuroscience topics. The outreach led to immediate benefits on attitudes towards science and scientists, which led to better understanding of the neurosciences.

Abstract
The Open Practical Laboratory in the Neurosciences is an outreach program that seeks to improve the knowledge of the neurosciences by elementary school students and to promote better attitudes in relation to neuroscience, science in general, and scientists. It consists in practical and demonstration activities on the theme of the neurosciences. This outreach strategy was applied in four public schools in a municipality in Southeastern Pará, Brazil characterized by low performance in educational reviews in Brazil. Students from both sexes from 9th grade (last grade before high school) were enrolled in the program. The outreach program improved students’ knowledge about the neurosciences, and promoted better attitudes in relation to science and scientists, in comparison to students who did not go through the activities. Results suggest that scientific outreach strategies can produce results beyond immediate increases in knowledge, promoting better attitudes in relation to science.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Voltage-Gated Ca2+-Channel α1-Subunit de novo Missense Mutations: Gain or Loss of Function – Implications for Potential Therapies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.634760</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This review summarizes our current knowledge of human disease-relevant genetic variants within the family of voltage gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channelopathies cover a wide spectrum of diseases including epilepsies, autism spectrum disorders, intellectual disabilities, developmental delay, cerebellar ataxias and degeneration, severe cardiac arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death, eye disease and endocrine disorders such as congential hyperinsulinism and hyperaldosteronism. A special focus will be on the rapidly increasing number of de novo missense mutations identified in the pore-forming α1-subunits with next generation sequencing studies of well-defined patient cohorts. In contrast to likely gene disrupting mutations these can not only cause a channel loss-of-function but can also induce typical functional changes permitting enhanced channel activity and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling. Such gain-of-function mutations could represent therapeutic targets for mutation-specific therapy of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-channelopathies with existing or novel Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-channel inhibitors. Moreover, many pathogenic mutations affect positive charges in the voltage sensors with the potential to form gating-pore currents through voltage sensors. If confirmed in functional studies, specific blockers of gating-pore currents could also be of therapeutic interest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Estimating and Correcting for Off-Target Cellular Contamination in Brain Cell Type Specific RNA-Seq Data</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transcriptionally profiling minor cellular populations remains an ongoing challenge in molecular genomics. Single-cell RNA sequencing has provided valuable insights into a number of hypotheses, but practical and analytical challenges have limited its widespread adoption. A similar approach, which we term single-cell type RNA sequencing (sctRNA-seq), involves the enrichment and sequencing of a pool of cells, yielding cell type-level resolution transcriptomes. While this approach offers benefits in terms of mRNA sampling from targeted cell types, it is potentially affected by off-target contamination from surrounding cell types. Here, we leveraged single-cell sequencing datasets to apply a computational approach for estimating and controlling the amount of off-target cell type contamination in sctRNA-seq datasets. In datasets obtained using a number of technologies for cell purification, we found that most sctRNA-seq datasets tended to show some amount of off-target mRNA contamination from surrounding cells. However, using covariates for cellular contamination in downstream differential expression analyses increased the quality of our models for differential expression analysis in case/control comparisons and typically resulted in the discovery of more differentially expressed genes. In general, our method provides a flexible approach for detecting and controlling off-target cell type contamination in sctRNA-seq datasets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Diffusion Tensor Imaging of the Sciatic Nerve as a Surrogate Marker for Nerve Functionality of the Upper and Lower Limb in Patients With Diabetes and Prediabetes</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Nerve damage in diabetic neuropathy (DN) is assumed to begin in the distal legs with a subsequent progression to hands and arms at later stages. In contrast, recent studies have found that lower limb nerve lesions in DN predominate at the proximal sciatic nerve and that, in the upper limb, nerve functions can be impaired at early stages of DN.&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;In this prospective, single-center cross-sectional study, participants underwent diffusion-weighted 3 Tesla magnetic resonance neurography in order to calculate the sciatic nerve’s fractional anisotropy (FA), a surrogate parameter for structural nerve integrity. Results were correlated with clinical and electrophysiological assessments of the lower limb and an examination of hand function derived from the Purdue Pegboard Test.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Overall, 71 patients with diabetes, 11 patients with prediabetes and 25 age-matched control subjects took part in this study. In patients with diabetes, the sciatic nerve’s FA showed positive correlations with tibial and peroneal nerve conduction velocities (r = 0.62; p &amp;lt; 0.001 and r = 0.56; p &amp;lt; 0.001, respectively), and tibial and peroneal nerve compound motor action potentials (r = 0.62; p &amp;lt; 0.001 and r = 0.63; p &amp;lt; 0.001, respectively). Moreover, the sciatic nerve’s FA was correlated with the Pegboard Test results in patients with diabetes (r = 0.52; p &amp;lt; 0.001), prediabetes (r = 0.76; p &amp;lt; 0.001) and in controls (r = 0.79; p = 0.007).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This study is the first to show that the sciatic nerve’s FA is a surrogate marker for functional and electrophysiological parameters of both upper and lower limbs in patients with diabetes and prediabetes, suggesting that nerve damage in these patients is not restricted to the level of the symptomatic limbs but rather affects the entire peripheral nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Sex-related difference in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has been proposed, and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) isoforms have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of AD.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;We aimed to explore whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ApoE is associated with AD biomarkers and whether the associations are different (between sexes).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Data of 309 participants [92 with normal cognition, 148 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 69 with AD dementia] from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were cross-sectionally evaluated with the multiple linear regression model and longitudinally with the multivariate linear mixed-effects model for the associations of CSF ApoE with AD biomarkers. Sex–ApoE interaction was used to estimate whether sex moderates the associations of CSF ApoE and AD biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Significant interactions between CSF ApoE and sex on AD biomarkers were observed [amyloid-β (Aβ): p = 0.0169 and phosphorylated-tau (p-tau): p = 0.0453]. In women, baseline CSF ApoE levels were significantly associated with baseline Aβ (p = 0.0135) and total-tau (t-tau) (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) as well as longitudinal changes of the biomarkers (Aβ: p = 0.0104; t-tau: p = 0.0110). In men, baseline CSF ApoE levels were only correlated with baseline p-tau (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) and t-tau (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) and did not aggravate AD biomarkers longitudinally.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The associations between CSF ApoE and AD biomarkers were sex-specific. Elevated CSF ApoE was associated with longitudinal changes of AD biomarkers in women, which indicates that CSF ApoE might be involved in the pathogenesis of AD pathology in a sex-specific way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Word Detection in Individual Subjects Is Difficult to Probe With Fast Periodic Visual Stimulation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Measuring cognition in single subjects presents unique challenges. On the other hand, individually sensitive measurements offer extraordinary opportunities, from informing theoretical models to enabling truly individualised clinical assessment. Here, we test the robustness of fast, periodic, and visual stimulation (FPVS), an emerging method proposed to elicit detectable responses to written words in the electroencephalogram (EEG) of individual subjects. The method is non-invasive, passive, and requires only a few minutes of testing, making it a potentially powerful tool to test comprehension in those who do not speak or who struggle with long testing procedures. In an initial study, Lochy et al. (2015) used FPVS to detect word processing in eight out of 10 fluent French readers. Here, we attempted to replicate their study in a new sample of 10 fluent English readers. Participants viewed rapid streams of pseudo-words with words embedded at regular intervals, while we recorded their EEG. Based on Lochy et al. (2015) we expected that words would elicit a steady-state response at the word-presentation frequency (2 Hz) over parieto-occipital electrode sites. However, across 40 datasets (10 participants, two conditions, and two regions of interest–ROIs), only four datasets met the criteria for a unique response to words. This corresponds to a 10% detection rate. We conclude that FPVS should be developed further before it can serve as an individually-sensitive measure of written word processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Baseline Differences in Anxiety Affect Attention and tDCS-Mediated Learning</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Variable responses to transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) protocols across individuals are widely reported, but the reasons behind this variation are unclear. This includes tDCS protocols meant to improve attention. Attentional control is impacted by top-down and bottom-up processes, and this relationship is affected by state characteristics such as anxiety. According to Attentional Control Theory, anxiety biases attention towards bottom-up and stimulus-driven processing. The goal of this study was to explore the extent to which differences in state anxiety and related measures affect visual attention and category learning, both with and without the influence of tDCS. Using discovery learning, participants were trained to classify pictures of European streets into two categories while receiving 30 min of 2.0 mA anodal, cathodal, or sham tDCS over the rVLPFC. The pictures were classifiable according to two separate rules, one stimulus and one hypothesis-driven. The Remote Associates Test (RAT), Profile of Mood States, and Attention Networks Task (ANT) were used to understand the effects of individual differences at baseline on subsequent tDCS-mediated learning. Multinomial logistic regression was fit to predict rule learning based on the baseline measures, with subjects classified according to whether they used the stimulus-driven or hypothesis-driven rule to classify the pictures. The overall model showed a classification accuracy of 74.1%. The type of tDCS stimulation applied, attentional orienting score, and self-reported mood were significant predictors of different categories of rule learning. These results indicate that anxiety can influence the quality of subjects’ attention at the onset of the task and that these attentional differences can influence tDCS-mediated category learning during the rapid assessment of visual scenes. These findings have implications for understanding the complex interactions that give rise to the variability in response to tDCS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Widespread Decreases in Cerebral Copper Are Common to Parkinson's Disease Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease Dementia</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Several studies of Parkinson's disease (PD) have reported dysregulation of cerebral metals, particularly decreases in copper and increases in iron in substantia nigra (SN). However, few studies have investigated regions outside the SN, fewer have measured levels of multiple metals across different regions within the same brains, and there are no currently-available reports of metal levels in Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). This study aimed to compare concentrations of nine essential metals across nine different brain regions in cases of PDD and controls. Investigated were: primary motor cortex (MCX); cingulate gyrus (CG); primary visual cortex (PVC); hippocampus (HP); cerebellar cortex (CB); SN; locus coeruleus (LC); medulla oblongata (MED); and middle temporal gyrus (MTG), thus covering regions with severe, moderate, or low levels of neuronal loss in PDD. Levels of eight essential metals and selenium were determined using an analytical methodology involving the use of inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and compared between cases and controls, to better understand the extent and severity of metal perturbations. Findings were also compared with those from our previous study of sporadic Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD), which employed equivalent methods, to identify differences and similarities between these conditions. Widespread copper decreases occurred in PDD in seven of nine regions (exceptions being LC and CB). Four PDD-affected regions showed similar decreases in ADD: CG, HP, MTG, and MCX. Decreases in potassium and manganese were present in HP, MTG and MCX; decreased manganese was also found in SN and MED. Decreased selenium and magnesium were present in MCX, and decreased zinc in HP. There was no evidence for increased iron in SN or any other region. These results identify alterations in levels of several metals across multiple regions of PDD brain, the commonest being widespread decreases in copper that closely resemble those in ADD, pointing to similar disease mechanisms in both dementias.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Preanalytical Stability of CSF Total and Oligomeric Alpha-Synuclein</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: The role of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) alpha-synuclein as a potential biomarker has been challenged mainly due to variable preanalytical measures between laboratories. To evaluate the impact of the preanalytical factors contributing to such variability, the different subforms of alpha-synuclein need to be studied individually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: We investigated the effect of exposing CSF samples to several preanalytical sources of variability: (1) different polypropylene (PP) storage tubes; (2) use of non-ionic detergents; (3) multiple tube transfers; (4) multiple freeze-thaw cycles; and (5) delayed storage. CSF oligomeric- and total-alpha-synuclein levels were estimated using our in-house sandwich-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Siliconized tubes provided the optimal preservation of CSF alpha-synuclein proteins among other tested polypropylene tubes. The use of tween-20 detergent significantly improved the recovery of oligomeric-alpha-synuclein, while multiple freeze-thaw cycles significantly lowered oligomeric-alpha-synuclein in CSF. Interestingly, oligomeric-alpha-synuclein levels remained relatively stable over multiple tube transfers and upon delayed storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our study showed for the first-time distinct impact of preanalytical factors on the different forms of CSF alpha-synuclein. These findings highlight the need for special considerations for the different forms of alpha-synuclein during CSF samples’ collection and processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Ipsilateral Motor Evoked Potentials as a Measure of the Reticulospinal Tract in Age-Related Strength Changes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.612352</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.612352</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: The reticulospinal tract (RST) is essential for balance, posture, and strength, all functions which falter with age. We hypothesized that age-related strength reductions might relate to differential changes in corticospinal and reticulospinal connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We divided 83 participants (age 20–84) into age groups &amp;lt;50 (n = 29) and ≥50 (n = 54) years; five of which had probable sarcopenia. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) was applied to the left cortex, inducing motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in the biceps muscles bilaterally. Contralateral (right, cMEPs) and ipsilateral (left, iMEPs) MEPs are carried by mainly corticospinal and reticulospinal pathways respectively; the iMEP/cMEP amplitude ratio (ICAR) therefore measured the relative importance of the two descending tracts. Grip strength was measured with a dynamometer and normalized for age and sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We found valid iMEPs in 74 individuals (n = 44 aged ≥50, n = 29 &amp;lt; 50). Younger adults had a significant negative correlation between normalized grip strength and ICAR (r = −0.37, p = 0.045); surprisingly, in older adults, the correlation was also significant, but positive (r = 0.43, p = 0.0037).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: Older individuals who maintain or strengthen their RST are stronger than their peers. We speculate that reduced RST connectivity could predict those at risk of age-related muscle weakness; interventions that reinforce the RST could be a candidate for treatment or prevention of sarcopenia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Using neural networks to mine text and predict metabolic traits for thousands of microbes</title>

Microbes can metabolize more chemical compounds than any other group of organisms. As a result, their metabolism is of interest to investigators across biology. Despite the interest, information on metabolism of specific microbes is hard to access. Information is buried in text of books and journals, and investigators have no easy way to extract it out. Here we investigate if neural networks can extract out this information and predict metabolic traits. For proof of concept, we predicted two traits: whether microbes carry one type of metabolism (fermentation) or produce one metabolite (acetate). We collected written descriptions of 7,021 species of bacteria and archaea from &lt;i&gt;Bergey’s Manual&lt;/i&gt;. We read the descriptions and manually identified (labeled) which species were fermentative or produced acetate. We then trained neural networks to predict these labels. In total, we identified 2,364 species as fermentative, and 1,009 species as also producing acetate. Neural networks could predict which species were fermentative with 97.3% accuracy. Accuracy was even higher (98.6%) when predicting species also producing acetate. Phylogenetic trees of species and their traits confirmed that predictions were accurate. Our approach with neural networks can extract information efficiently and accurately. It paves the way for putting more metabolic traits into databases, providing easy access of information to investigators.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NvmhGOIwmeU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Functional innovation promotes diversification of form in the evolution of an ultrafast trap-jaw mechanism in ants</title>

Evolutionary innovations underlie the rise of diversity and complexity—the 2 long-term trends in the history of life. How does natural selection redesign multiple interacting parts to achieve a new emergent function? We investigated the evolution of a biomechanical innovation, the latch-spring mechanism of trap-jaw ants, to address 2 outstanding evolutionary problems: how form and function change in a system during the evolution of new complex traits, and whether such innovations and the diversity they beget are repeatable in time and space. Using a new phylogenetic reconstruction of 470 species, and X-ray microtomography and high-speed videography of representative taxa, we found the trap-jaw mechanism evolved independently 7 to 10 times in a single ant genus (&lt;i&gt;Strumigenys&lt;/i&gt;), resulting in the repeated evolution of diverse forms on different continents. The trap mechanism facilitates a 6 to 7 order of magnitude greater mandible acceleration relative to simpler ancestors, currently the fastest recorded acceleration of a resettable animal movement. We found that most morphological diversification occurred after evolution of latch-spring mechanisms, which evolved via minor realignments of mouthpart structures. This finding, whereby incremental changes in form lead to a change of function, followed by large morphological reorganization around the new function, provides a model for understanding the evolution of complex biomechanical traits, as well as insights into why such innovations often happen repeatedly.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/rs2fK7Oquks&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Adaptive Rewiring in Weighted Networks Shows Specificity, Robustness, and Flexibility</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.580569</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.580569</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain network connections rewire adaptively in response to neural activity. Adaptive rewiring may be understood as a process which, at its every step, is aimed at optimizing the efficiency of signal diffusion. In evolving model networks, this amounts to creating shortcut connections in regions with high diffusion and pruning where diffusion is low. Adaptive rewiring leads over time to topologies akin to brain anatomy: small worlds with rich club and modular or centralized structures. We continue our investigation of adaptive rewiring by focusing on three desiderata: specificity of evolving model network architectures, robustness of dynamically maintained architectures, and flexibility of network evolution to stochastically deviate from specificity and robustness. Our adaptive rewiring model simulations show that specificity and robustness characterize alternative modes of network operation, controlled by a single parameter, the rewiring interval. Small control parameter shifts across a critical transition zone allow switching between the two modes. Adaptive rewiring exhibits greater flexibility for skewed, lognormal connection weight distributions than for normally distributed ones. The results qualify adaptive rewiring as a key principle of self-organized complexity in network architectures, in particular of those that characterize the variety of functional architectures in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Analysis of Chronic Mild Stress-Induced Hypothalamic Proteome: Identification of Protein Dysregulations Associated With Vulnerability and Resiliency to Depression or Anxiety</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chronic stress as a known risk factor leads to hyperactivity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in both depression and anxiety. However, the stress-induced dysfunction of the HPA axis in these disorders especially the common and unique molecular dysregulations have not been well-explored. Previously, we utilized a chronic mild stress (CMS) paradigm to segregate and gain depression-susceptible, anxiety-susceptible, and insusceptible groups. In this study, we continue to examine the possible protein expression alterations of the hypothalamus as the center of the HPA axis in these three groups by using a proteomic approach. Though isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based quantitative analysis, a total of 593 dysregulated proteins were identified. These were potentially associated with vulnerability and adaptability of CMS-caused depression or anxiety and therefore might become novel investigative protein targets. Further independent analysis using parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) indicated that 5, 7, and 21 dysregulated proteins were specifically associated with depression-susceptible, anxiety-susceptible, and insusceptible groups, respectively, suggesting that the same CMS differently affected the regulation system of the rat hypothalamic proteome. In summary, the current proteomic research on the hypothalamus provided insights into the specific and common molecular basis for the HPA dysfunction mechanisms that underlie resiliency and vulnerability to stress-induced depression or anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Intra-Arterial Stem Cell Transplantation in Experimental Stroke in Rats: Real-Time MR Visualization of Transplanted Cells Starting With Their First Pass Through the Brain With Regard to the Therapeutic Action</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cell therapy is an emerging approach to stroke treatment with a potential to limit brain damage and enhance its restoration after the acute phase of the disease. In this study we tested directly reprogrammed neural precursor cells (drNPC) derived from adult human bone marrow cells in the rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of acute ischemic stroke using human placenta mesenchymal stem cells (pMSC) as a positive control with previously confirmed efficacy. Cells were infused into the ipsilateral (right) internal carotid artery of male Wistar rats 24 h after MCAO. The main goal of this work was to evaluate real-time distribution and subsequent homing of transplanted cells in the brain. This was achieved by performing intra-arterial infusion directly inside the MRI scanner and allowed transplanted cells tracing starting from their first pass through the brain vessels. Immediately after transplantation, cells were observed in the periphery of the infarct zone and in the brain stem, 15 min later small numbers of cells could be discovered deep in the infarct core and in the contralateral hemisphere, where drNPC were seen earlier and in greater numbers than pMSC. Transplanted cells in both groups could no longer be detected in the rat brain 48–72 h after infusion. Histological and histochemical analysis demonstrated that both the drNPC and pMSC were localized inside blood vessels in close contact with the vascular wall. No passage of labeled cells through the blood brain barrier was observed. Additionally, the therapeutic effects of drNPC and pMSC were compared. Both drNPC and pMSC induced substantial attenuation of neurological deficits evaluated at the 7th and 14th day after transplantation using the modified neurological severity score (mNSS). Some of the effects of drNPC and pMSC, such as the influence on the infarct volume and the survival rate of animals, differed. The results suggest a paracrine mechanism of the positive therapeutic effects of IA drNPC and pMSC infusion, potentially enhanced by the cell-cell interactions. Our data also indicate that the long-term homing of transplanted cells in the brain is not necessary for the brain’s functional recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Deep-Learning-Based Multivariate Pattern Analysis (dMVPA): A Tutorial and a Toolbox</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.638052</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) has been hugely beneficial for cognitive neuroscience by making new experiment designs possible and by increasing the inferential power of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and other neuroimaging methodologies. In a similar time frame, “deep learning” (a term for the use of artificial neural networks with convolutional, recurrent, or similarly sophisticated architectures) has produced a parallel revolution in the field of machine learning and has been employed across a wide variety of applications. Traditional MVPA also uses a form of machine learning, but most commonly with much simpler techniques based on linear calculations; a number of studies have applied deep learning techniques to neuroimaging data, but we believe that those have barely scratched the surface of the potential deep learning holds for the field. In this paper, we provide a brief introduction to deep learning for those new to the technique, explore the logistical pros and cons of using deep learning to analyze neuroimaging data – which we term “deep MVPA,” or dMVPA – and introduce a new software toolbox (the “Deep Learning In Neuroimaging: Exploration, Analysis, Tools, and Education” package, DeLINEATE for short) intended to facilitate dMVPA for neuroscientists (and indeed, scientists more broadly) everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Is brain structure related to function? Can one predict the other? These are questions that are still waiting to be answered definitively. In this paper we seek to investigate these questions, in particular, we are interested in the relation between brain structure and theory of mind (ToM). ToM is defined as the ability to attribute mental states to others. Previous studies have observed correlations between performance on ToM tasks, and gray-matter size/volume in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and precuneus (PCu). Despite these findings, there are concerns about false positive results and replicability issues. In this study we used two different tasks to evaluate ToM, Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET), and the Short Story Task (SST). Performance in these tasks was correlated to brain anatomy measures including voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and cortical thickness (CT) analysis, from ninety-one neurotypical participants. High-resolution structural brain images were acquired, and whole-brain and region of interest (ROI) analyses were implemented. The analyses did not show statistically significant associations between ToM performance and brain structural measures after correction. Significant associations between performance on ToM tests and a widespread array of regions loosely associated with ToM were observed only for whole brain uncorrected analysis (p &amp;lt; 0.001). These results do not replicate a previous study with neurotypical participants. We tested two different ToM tests, two different softwares for VBM and CT, and we used two samples, one with 91 and a sub-sample with 69 participants. Neither of these conditions made a difference in the results obtained. Consequently, these results suggest that if the population is neurotypical and homogenous, it is unlikely that a reliable association between brain anatomy measures and ToM performance, as measured with these tasks, may be found.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Intraoperative Cognitive Mapping Tasks for Direct Electrical Stimulation in Clinical and Neuroscientific Contexts</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Direct electrical stimulation (DES) has been widely applied in both guidance of lesion resection and scientific research; however, the design and selection of intraoperative cognitive mapping tasks have not been updated in a very long time. We introduce updated mapping tasks for language and non-language functions and provide recommendations for optimal design and selection of intraoperative mapping tasks. In addition, with DES becoming more critical in current neuroscientific research, a task design that has not been widely used in DES yet (subtraction and conjunction paradigms) was introduced for more delicate mapping of brain functions especially for research purposes. We also illustrate the importance of designing a common task series for DES and other non-invasive mapping techniques. This review gives practical updated guidelines for advanced application of DES in clinical and neuroscientific research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The globus pallidus externa (GPe) functions as a central hub in the basal ganglia for processing motor and non-motor information through the creation of complex connections with the other basal ganglia nuclei and brain regions. Recently, with the adoption of sophisticated genetic tools, substantial advances have been made in understanding the distinct molecular, anatomical, electrophysiological, and functional properties of GPe neurons and non-neuronal cells. Impairments in dopamine transmission in the basal ganglia contribute to Parkinson's disease (PD), the most common movement disorder that severely affects the patients' life quality. Altered GPe neuron activity and synaptic connections have also been found in both PD patients and pre-clinical models. In this review, we will summarize the main findings on the composition, connectivity and functionality of different GPe cell populations and the potential GPe-related mechanisms of PD symptoms to better understand the cell type and circuit-specific roles of GPe in both normal and PD conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The past decade has seen growing support for the critical brain hypothesis, i.e., the possibility that the brain could operate at or very near a critical state between two different dynamical regimes. Such critical states are well-studied in different disciplines, therefore there is potential for a continued transfer of knowledge. Here, I revisit foundations of bifurcation theory, the mathematical theory of transitions. While the mathematics is well-known it's transfer to neural dynamics leads to new insights and hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Synaptic and Axon Degeneration in Parkinson’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that impairs movement as well as causing multiple other symptoms such as autonomic dysfunction, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, hyposmia, and cognitive changes. Loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and loss of dopamine terminals in the striatum contribute to characteristic motor features. Although therapies ease the symptoms of PD, there are no treatments to slow its progression. Accumulating evidence suggests that synaptic impairments and axonal degeneration precede neuronal cell body loss. Early synaptic changes may be a target to prevent disease onset and slow progression. Imaging of PD patients with radioligands, post-mortem pathologic studies in sporadic PD patients, and animal models of PD demonstrate abnormalities in presynaptic terminals as well as postsynaptic dendritic spines. Dopaminergic and excitatory synapses are substantially reduced in PD, and whether other neuronal subtypes show synaptic defects remains relatively unexplored. Genetic studies implicate several genes that play a role at the synapse, providing additional support for synaptic dysfunction in PD. In this review article we: (1) provide evidence for synaptic defects occurring in PD before neuron death; (2) describe the main genes implicated in PD that could contribute to synapse dysfunction; and (3) show correlations between the expression of Snca mRNA and mouse homologs of PD GWAS genes demonstrating selective enrichment of Snca and synaptic genes in dopaminergic, excitatory and cholinergic neurons. Altogether, these findings highlight the need for novel therapeutics targeting the synapse and suggest that future studies should explore the roles for PD-implicated genes across multiple neuron types and circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: The Anatomical Distribution of Mechanoreceptors in Mouse Hind Paw Skin and the Influence of Integrin α1β1 on Meissner-Like Corpuscle Density in the Footpads</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.628711</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Afferent neurons and their mechanoreceptors provide critical sensory feedback for gait. The anatomical distribution and density of afferents and mechanoreceptors influence sensory feedback, as does mechanoreceptor function. Electrophysiological studies of hind paw skin reveal the different types of afferent responses and their receptive fields, however, the anatomical distribution of mechanoreceptor endings is unknown. Also, the role of integrin α1β1 in mechanoreceptor function is unclear, though it is expressed by keratinocytes in the stratum basale where it is likely involved in a variety of mechanotransduction pathways and ion channel functionalities. For example, it has been shown that integrin α1β1 is necessary for the function of TRPV4 that is highly expressed by afferent units. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to determine and compare the distribution of mechanoreceptors across the hind paw skin and the footfall patterns of itga1-null and wild type mice. The itga1-null mouse is lacking the integrin α1 subunit, which binds exclusively to the β1 subunit, thus rendering integrin α1β1 nonfunctional while leaving the numerous other pairings of the β1 subunit undisturbed. Intact hind paws were processed, serially sectioned, and stained to visualize mechanoreceptors. Footfall patterns were analyzed as a first step in correlating mechanoreceptor distribution and functionality. Merkel cells and Meissner-like corpuscles were present, however, Ruffini endings and Pacinian corpuscles were not observed. Meissner-like corpuscles were located exclusively in the glabrous skin of the footpads and digit tips, however, Merkel cells were found throughout hairy and glabrous skin. The increased density of Merkel cells and Meissner-like corpuscles in footpads 1 and 3 and Meissner-like corpuscles in footpad 4 suggests their role in anteroposterior balance, while Meissner-like corpuscle concentrations in digits 2 and 5 support their role in mediolateral balance. Finally, a larger density of Meissner-like corpuscles in footpads 3 and 4 in male itga1-null mice compared to wild type controls paves the way for future site-specific single fiber in vivo recordings to provide insight into the role of integrin α1β1 in tactile mechanotransduction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Recent concerns about the reproducibility of science have led to several calls for more open and transparent research practices and for the monitoring of potential improvements over time. However, with tens of thousands of new biomedical articles published per week, manually mapping and monitoring changes in transparency is unrealistic. We present an open-source, automated approach to identify 5 indicators of transparency (data sharing, code sharing, conflicts of interest disclosures, funding disclosures, and protocol registration) and apply it across the entire open access biomedical literature of 2.75 million articles on PubMed Central (PMC). Our results indicate remarkable improvements in some (e.g., conflict of interest [COI] disclosures and funding disclosures), but not other (e.g., protocol registration and code sharing) areas of transparency over time, and map transparency across fields of science, countries, journals, and publishers. This work has enabled the creation of a large, integrated, and openly available database to expedite further efforts to monitor, understand, and promote transparency and reproducibility in science.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/l0TdCjmsGF0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Macaque monkey trigeminal blink reflex circuits targeting orbicularis oculi motoneurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/10.1002/cne.25130</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25130?af=R</link>
	<description>The blink reflex is critical for protecting the eyes and spreading the tear film, and is a commonly used for learning model. We demonstrate monosynaptic trigeminal (shown here) and disynaptic reticular formation pathways connecting the principal and the spinal trigeminal nucleus (pars caudalis) with orbicularis oculi motoneurons in the macaque monkey.







Abstract
The trigeminal blink reflex plays an important role in protecting the corneal surface from damage and preserving visual function in an unpredictable environment. The closing phase of the human reflex, produced by activation of the orbicularis oculi (ObOc) muscles, consists of an initial, small, ipsilateral R1 component, followed by a larger, bilateral R2 component. We investigated the circuitry that underlies this reflex in macaque (Macaca fascicularis and Macaca mulatta) monkeys by the use of single and dual tracer methods. Injection of retrograde tracer into the facial nucleus labeled neurons in the principal trigeminal nucleus, and in the spinal nucleus pars oralis and interpolaris, bilaterally, and in pars caudalis, ipsilaterally. Injection of anterograde tracer into the principal trigeminal nucleus labeled axons that directly terminated on ObOc motoneurons, with an ipsilateral predominance. Injection of anterograde tracer into pars caudalis of the spinal trigeminal nucleus labeled axons that directly terminated on ipsilateral ObOc motoneurons. The observed pattern of labeling indicates that the reticular formation ventromedial to the principal and spinal nuclei also contributes extensive bilateral input to ObOc motoneurons. Thus, much of the trigeminal sensory complex is in a position to supply a monosynaptic drive for lid closure, and the adjacent reticular formation can supply a disynaptic drive. These findings indicate that the assignment of the R1 and R2 components of the blink reflex to different parts of the trigeminal sensory complex cannot be exclusively based on subdivision connectional relationships with facial motoneurons. The characteristics of the R2 component may be due, instead, to other circuit properties.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Leucine Zipper 4 Autoantibody: A Novel Germ Cell Tumor and Paraneoplastic Biomarker</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26050</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26050?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
This study was undertaken to describe a novel biomarker of germ cell tumor and associated paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS).


Methods
Archival sera from patients with germ cell tumor–associated PNS were evaluated. We identified a common autoantigen in a human testicular cancer cell line (TCam‐2) by Western blot and mass spectrometry. Its identity was confirmed by recombinant‐protein Western blot, enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and cell‐based assay. Autoantibody specificity was confirmed by analyzing assorted control sera/cerebrospinal fluid.


Results
Leucine zipper 4 (LUZP4)–immunoglobulin G (IgG) was detected in 28 patients' sera, 26 of whom (93%) were men. The median age at neurological symptom onset was 45 years (range = 28–84). Median titer (ELISA) was 1:300 (1:50 to &amp;gt;1:6,400, normal value &amp;lt; 1:50). Coexistent kelchlike protein 11–IgG was identified in 18 cases (64%). The most common presenting phenotype was rhombencephalitis (17/28, 61%). Other presentations included limbic encephalitis (n = 5, 18%), seizures and/or encephalitis (n = 2, 7%), and motor neuronopathy/polyradiculopathy (n = 4, 14%). The most common malignancy among cancer‐evaluated PNS patients was seminoma (21/27, 78%). Nine of the 21 seminomas detected by whole‐body fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan (43%) were extratesticular. Both female patients had ovarian teratoma. Regressed testicular germ cell tumors were found in 4 patients. Exposure of T‐cell–dendritic‐cell cocultures from chronic immunosuppression‐naïve LUZP4‐IgG–seropositive patients to recombinant LUZP4 protein evoked a marked increase in CD69 expression on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells when compared to vehicle‐exposed and healthy control cultures.


Interpretation
LUZP4‐IgG represents a novel serological biomarker of PNS and has high predictive value for germ cell tumors. The demonstrated antigen‐specific T‐cell responses support a CD8+ T‐cell–mediated cytotoxic paraneoplastic and antitumor potential. ANN NEUROL 2021</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Making the World Behave: A New Embodied Account on Mobile Paradigm</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.643526</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.643526</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this review article, we describe the mobile paradigm, a method used for more than 50 years to assess how infants learn and remember sensorimotor contingencies. The literature on the mobile paradigm demonstrates that infants below 6 months of age can remember the learning environment weeks after when reminded periodically and integrate temporally distributed information across modalities. The latter ability is only possible if events occur within a temporal window of a few days, and the width of this required window changes as a function of age. A major critique of these conclusions is that the majority of this literature has neglected the embodied experience, such that motor behavior was considered an equivalent developmental substitute for verbal behavior. Over recent years, simulation and empirical work have highlighted the sensorimotor aspect and opened up a discussion for possible learning mechanisms and variability in motor preferences of young infants. In line with this recent direction, we present a new embodied account on the mobile paradigm which argues that learning sensorimotor contingencies is a core feature of development forming the basis for active exploration of the world and body. In addition to better explaining recent findings, this new framework aims to replace the dis-embodied approach to the mobile paradigm with a new understanding that focuses on variance and representations grounded in sensorimotor experience. Finally, we discuss a potential role for the dorsal stream which might be responsible for guiding action according to visual information, while infants learn sensorimotor contingencies in the mobile paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: A Comprehensive Analysis of Multilayer Community Detection Algorithms for Application to EEG-Based Brain Networks</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Modular organization is an emergent property of brain networks, responsible for shaping communication processes and underpinning brain functioning. Moreover, brain networks are intrinsically multilayer since their attributes can vary across time, subjects, frequency, or other domains. Identifying the modular structure in multilayer brain networks represents a gateway toward a deeper understanding of neural processes underlying cognition. Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals, thanks to their high temporal resolution, can give rise to multilayer networks able to follow the dynamics of brain activity. Despite this potential, the community organization has not yet been thoroughly investigated in brain networks estimated from EEG. Furthermore, at the state of the art, there is still no agreement about which algorithm is the most suitable to detect communities in multilayer brain networks, and a way to test and compare them all under a variety of conditions is lacking. In this work, we perform a comprehensive analysis of three algorithms at the state of the art for multilayer community detection (namely, genLouvain, DynMoga, and FacetNet) as compared with an approach based on the application of a single-layer clustering algorithm to each slice of the multilayer network. We test their ability to identify both steady and dynamic modular structures. We statistically evaluate their performances by means of ad hoc benchmark graphs characterized by properties covering a broad range of conditions in terms of graph density, number of clusters, noise level, and number of layers. The results of this simulation study aim to provide guidelines about the choice of the more appropriate algorithm according to the different properties of the brain network under examination. Finally, as a proof of concept, we show an application of the algorithms to real functional brain networks derived from EEG signals collected at rest with closed and open eyes. The test on real data provided results in agreement with the conclusions of the simulation study and confirmed the feasibility of multilayer analysis of EEG-based brain networks in both steady and dynamic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to extinguish fear memories when threats are no longer present is critical for adaptive behavior. Fear extinction represents a new learning process that eventually leads to the formation of extinction memories. Understanding the neural basis of fear extinction has considerable clinical significance as deficits in extinction learning are the hallmark of human anxiety disorders. In recent years, the dopamine (DA) system has emerged as one of the key regulators of fear extinction. In this review article, we highlight recent advances that have demonstrated the crucial role DA plays in mediating different phases of fear extinction. Emerging concepts and outstanding questions for future research are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Consistency and Stability of Motor Subtype Classifications in Patients With de novo Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.637896</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.637896</link>
	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;Patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) are commonly classified into subtypes based on motor symptoms. The aims of the present study were to determine the consistency between PD motor subtypes, to assess the stability of PD motor subtypes over time, and to explore the variables influencing PD motor subtype stability.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;This study was part of a longitudinal study of de novo PD patients at a single center. Based on three different motor subtype classification systems proposed by Jankovic, Schiess, and Kang, patients were respectively categorized as tremor-dominant/indeterminate/postural instability and gait difficulty (TD/indeterminate/PIGD), TD&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;/mixed&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;/akinetic-rigid&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; (ARS), or TD&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;/mixed&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;/AR&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt; at baseline evaluation and then re-assessed 1 month later. Demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded at each evaluation. The consistency between subtypes at baseline evaluation was assessed using Cohen’s kappa coefficient (κ). Additional variables were compared between PD subtype groups using the two-sample t-test, Mann–Whitney U-test or Chi-squared test.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Of 283 newly diagnosed, untreated PD patients, 79 were followed up at 1 month. There was fair agreement between the Jankovic, Schiess, and Kang classification systems (κ&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.383 ± 0.044, κ&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.360 ± 0.042, κ&lt;sub&gt;SK&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.368 ± 0.038). Among the three classification systems, the Schiess classification was the most stable and the Jankovic classification was the most unstable. The non-motor symptoms questionnaire (NMSQuest) scores differed significantly between PD patients with stable and unstable subtypes based on the Jankovic classification (p = 0.008), and patients with a consistent subtype had more severe NMSQuest scores than patients with an inconsistent subtype.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Fair consistency was observed between the Jankovic, Schiess, and Kang classification systems. For the first time, non-motor symptoms (NMSs) scores were found to influence the stability of the TD/indeterminate/PIGD classification. Our findings support combining NMSs with motor symptoms to increase the effectiveness of PD subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Exosomal MicroRNAs Contribute to Cognitive Impairment in Hypertensive Patients by Decreasing Frontal Cerebrovascular Reactivity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.614220</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment (CI) in hypertensive patients remain relatively unclear. The present study aimed to explore the relationship among serum exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs), cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), and cognitive function in hypertensive patients. Seventy-three hypertensive patients with CI (HT-CI), 67 hypertensive patients with normal cognition (HT-NC), and 37 healthy controls underwent identification of exosomal miRNA, multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, and neuropsychological tests. CVR mapping was investigated based on resting-state functional MRI data. Compared with healthy subjects and HT-NC subjects, HT-CI subjects displayed decreased serum exosomal miRNA-330-3p. The group difference of CVR was mainly found in the left frontal lobe and demonstrated that HT-CI group had a lower CVR than both HT-NC group and control group. Furthermore, both the CVR in the left medial superior frontal gyrus and the miRNA-330-3p level were significantly correlated with executive function (r = −0.275, P = 0.021, and r = −0.246, P = 0.04, respectively) in HT-CI subjects, and the CVR was significantly correlated with the miRNA-330-3p level (r = 0.246, P = 0.040). Notably, path analysis showed that the CVR mediated the association between miRNA-330-3p and executive function. In conclusion, decreased miRNA-330-3p might contribute to CI in hypertensive patients by decreasing frontal CVR and could be a biomarker of early diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Social Exclusion Down-Regulates Pain Empathy at the Late Stage of Empathic Responses: Electrophysiological Evidence</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.634714</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.634714</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Social exclusion has a significant impact on cognition, emotion, and behavior. Some behavioral studies investigated how social exclusion affects pain empathy. Conclusions were inconsistent, and there is a lack of clarity in identifying which component of pain empathy is more likely to be affected. To investigate these issues, we used a Cyberball task to manipulate feelings of social exclusion. Two groups (social exclusion and social inclusion) participated in the same pain empathy task while we recorded event-related potentials (ERP) when participants viewed static images of body parts in painful and neutral situations. The results showed early N2 differentiation between painful and neutral pictures in the central regions in both groups. The pattern at the late controlled processing stage was different. Parietal P3 amplitudes for painful pictures were significantly smaller than those for neutral pictures in the social exclusion group; they did not differ in the social inclusion group. We observed a parietal late positive potential (LPP) differentiation between painful and neutral pictures in both groups. LPP amplitudes were significantly smaller in the social exclusion group than those in the social inclusion group for painful stimuli. Our results indicate that social exclusion does not affect empathic responses during the early emotional sharing stage. However, it down-regulates empathic responses at the late cognitive controlled stage, and this modulation is attenuated gradually. The current study provides neuroscientific evidence of how social exclusion dynamically influences pain empathy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation to Treat Medication-Refractory Freezing of Gait in Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.633655</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.633655</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Treating medication-refractory freezing of gait (FoG) in Parkinson’s disease (PD) remains challenging despite several trials reporting improvements in motor symptoms using subthalamic nucleus or globus pallidus internus (GPi) deep brain stimulation (DBS). Pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) region DBS has been used for medication-refractory FoG, with mixed findings. FoG, as a paroxysmal phenomenon, provides an ideal framework for the possibility of closed-loop DBS (CL-DBS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: In this clinical trial (NCT02318927), five subjects with medication-refractory FoG underwent bilateral GPi DBS implantation to address levodopa-responsive PD symptoms with open-loop stimulation. Additionally, PPN DBS leads were implanted for CL-DBS to treat FoG. The primary outcome of the study was a 40% improvement in medication-refractory FoG in 60% of subjects at 6 months when “on” PPN CL-DBS. Secondary outcomes included device feasibility to gauge the recruitment potential of this four-lead DBS approach for a potentially larger clinical trial. Safety was judged based on adverse events and explantation rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Findings: The feasibility of this approach was demonstrated as we recruited five subjects with both “on” and “off” medication freezing. The safety for this population of patients receiving four DBS leads was suboptimal and associated with a high explantation rate of 40%. The primary clinical outcome in three of the five subjects was achieved at 6 months. However, the group analysis of the primary clinical outcome did not reveal any benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: This study of a human PPN CL-DBS trial in medication-refractory FoG showed feasibility in recruitment, suboptimal safety, and a heterogeneous clinical effect in FoG outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Behavioral Time Scale Plasticity of Place Fields: Mathematical Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.640235</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.640235</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Traditional synaptic plasticity experiments and models depend on tight temporal correlations between pre- and postsynaptic activity. These tight temporal correlations, on the order of tens of milliseconds, are incompatible with significantly longer behavioral time scales, and as such might not be able to account for plasticity induced by behavior. Indeed, recent findings in hippocampus suggest that rapid, bidirectional synaptic plasticity which modifies place fields in CA1 operates at behavioral time scales. These experimental results suggest that presynaptic activity generates synaptic eligibility traces both for potentiation and depression, which last on the order of seconds. These traces can be converted to changes in synaptic efficacies by the activation of an instructive signal that depends on naturally occurring or experimentally induced plateau potentials. We have developed a simple mathematical model that is consistent with these observations. This model can be fully analyzed to find the fixed points of induced place fields and how these fixed points depend on system parameters such as the size and shape of presynaptic place fields, the animal's velocity during induction, and the parameters of the plasticity rule. We also make predictions about the convergence time to these fixed points, both for induced and pre-existing place fields.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Crosstalk Between ATP-P2X7 and Adenosine A2A Receptors Controlling Neuroinflammation in Rats Subject to Repeated Restraint Stress</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.639322</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.639322</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Depressive conditions precipitated by repeated stress are a major socio-economical burden in Western countries. Previous studies showed that ATP-P&lt;sub&gt;2X7&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (P&lt;sub&gt;2X7&lt;/sub&gt;R) and adenosine A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R) antagonists attenuate behavioral modifications upon exposure to repeated stress. Since it is unknown if these two purinergic modulation systems work independently, we now investigated a putative interplay between P&lt;sub&gt;2X7&lt;/sub&gt;R and A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R. Adult rats exposed to restraint stress for 14 days displayed an anxious (thigmotaxis, elevated plus maze), depressive (anhedonia, increased immobility), and amnesic (modified Y maze, object displacement) profile, together with increased expression of Iba-1 (a marker of microglia “activation”) and interleukin-1β (IL1β) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα; proinflammatory cytokines) and an up-regulation of P&lt;sub&gt;2X7&lt;/sub&gt;R (mRNA) and A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R (receptor binding) in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. All these features were attenuated by the P&lt;sub&gt;2X7&lt;/sub&gt;R-preferring antagonist brilliant blue G (BBG, 45 mg/kg, i.p.) or by caffeine (0.3 g/L, p.o.), which affords neuroprotection through A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R blockade. Notably, BBG attenuated A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R upregulation and caffeine attenuated P&lt;sub&gt;2X7&lt;/sub&gt;R upregulation. In microglial N9 cells, the P&lt;sub&gt;2X7&lt;/sub&gt;R agonist BzATP (100 μM) or the A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R agonist CGS26180 (100 nM) increased calcium levels, which was abrogated by the P&lt;sub&gt;2X7&lt;/sub&gt;R antagonist JNJ47965567 (1 μM) and by the A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R antagonist SCH58261 (50 nM), respectively; notably JNJ47965567 prevented the effect of CGS21680 and the effect of BzATP was attenuated by SCH58261 and increased by CGS21680. These results provide the first demonstration of a functional interaction between P&lt;sub&gt;2X7&lt;/sub&gt;R and A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R controlling microglia reactivity likely involved in behavioral adaptive responses to stress and are illustrative of a cooperation between the two arms of the purinergic system in the control of brain function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Spontaneous Ca2+ Fluctuations Arise in Thin Astrocytic Processes With Real 3D Geometry</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.617989</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fluctuations of cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration in astrocytes are regarded as a critical non-neuronal signal to regulate neuronal functions. Although such fluctuations can be evoked by neuronal activity, rhythmic astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oscillations may also spontaneously arise. Experimental studies hint that these spontaneous astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oscillations may lie behind different kinds of emerging neuronal synchronized activities, like epileptogenic bursts or slow-wave rhythms. Despite the potential importance of spontaneous Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oscillations in astrocytes, the mechanism by which they develop is poorly understood. Using simple 3D synapse models and kinetic data of astrocytic Glu transporters (EAATs) and the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; exchanger (NCX), we have previously shown that NCX activity alone can generate markedly stable, spontaneous Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oscillation in the astrocytic leaflet microdomain. Here, we extend that model by incorporating experimentally determined real 3D geometries of 208 excitatory synapses reconstructed from publicly available ultra-resolution electron microscopy datasets. Our simulations predict that the surface/volume ratio (SVR) of peri-synaptic astrocytic processes prominently dictates whether NCX-mediated spontaneous Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oscillations emerge. We also show that increased levels of intracellular astrocytic Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration facilitate the appearance of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; fluctuations. These results further support the principal role of the dynamical reshaping of astrocyte processes in the generation of intrinsic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oscillations and their spreading over larger astrocytic compartments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Locus Coeruleus Malfunction Is Linked to Psychopathology in Prodromal Dementia With Lewy Bodies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.641101</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.641101</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: The locus coeruleus (LC) is a nucleus in the human brainstem with a variety of noradrenaline-driven functions involved in cognition, emotions, and perception. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) constitutes a neurodegenerative disease involving deposits of alpha-synuclein, first appearing in the brainstem. The goal of this narrative review is to delineate the relationship between the expression of psychiatric symptoms as an early-onset of DLB and the degeneration of the LC's noradrenaline system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We searched in PubMed for relevant articles concerning LC degeneration and psychiatric symptoms in prodromal DLB in this narrative review. We rely on the McKeith criteria for prodromal psychiatric DLB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We found four studies that document neuronal loss, deposits of Lewy bodies and other hints for neurodegeneration in the LC in patients with DLB. Furthermore, we reviewed theories and studies on how the degenerated noradrenaline LC system contributes to psychiatric DLB's phenotype. We hypothesized how anxiety, hallucinations, delusions, and depressive symptoms might occur in DLB patients due to degenerated noradrenergic neurons entailing consecutive altered noradrenergic transmission in the LC's projection areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: LC degeneration in prodromal DLB might cause psychiatric symptoms as the first and non-motor manifestation of DLB, as the LC is affected earlier by degeneration than are dopaminergic structures such as the substantia nigra, which are impaired later in the disease course.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Contributions of Age-Related and Audibility-Related Deficits to Aided Consonant Identification in Presbycusis: A Causal-Inference Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.640522</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.640522</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The decline of speech intelligibility in presbycusis can be regarded as resulting from the combined contribution of two main groups of factors: (1) audibility-related factors and (2) age-related factors. In particular, there is now an abundant scientific literature on the crucial role of suprathreshold auditory abilities and cognitive functions, which have been found to decline with age even in the absence of audiometric hearing loss. However, researchers investigating the direct effect of aging in presbycusis have to deal with the methodological issue that age and peripheral hearing loss covary to a large extent. In the present study, we analyzed a dataset of consonant-identification scores measured in quiet and in noise for a large cohort (n = 459, age = 42–92) of hearing-impaired (HI) and normal-hearing (NH) listeners. HI listeners were provided with a frequency-dependent amplification adjusted to their audiometric profile. Their scores in the two conditions were predicted from their pure-tone average (PTA) and age, as well as from their Extended Speech Intelligibility Index (ESII), a measure of the impact of audibility loss on speech intelligibility. We relied on a causal-inference approach combined with Bayesian modeling to disentangle the direct causal effects of age and audibility on intelligibility from the indirect effect of age on hearing loss. The analysis revealed that the direct effect of PTA on HI intelligibility scores was 5 times higher than the effect of age. This overwhelming effect of PTA was not due to a residual audibility loss despite amplification, as confirmed by a ESII-based model. More plausibly, the marginal role of age could be a consequence of the relatively little cognitively-demanding task used in this study. Furthermore, the amount of variance in intelligibility scores was smaller for NH than HI listeners, even after accounting for age and audibility, reflecting the presence of additional suprathreshold deficits in the latter group. Although the non-sense-syllable materials and the particular amplification settings used in this study potentially restrict the generalization of the findings, we think that these promising results call for a wider use of causal-inference analysis in audiology, e.g., as a way to disentangle the influence of the various cognitive factors and suprathreshold deficits associated to presbycusis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Diagnostic Value of Exosome-Derived Biomarkers in Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Meta-Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.637218</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.637218</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnoses once depended on neuropathologic examination. Now, many widely used, validated biomarkers benefits for monitoring of AD neuropathologic changes. Exosome-derived biomarker studies have reported them to be significantly related to AD's early occurrence and development, although the findings are inconclusive. The aim of this meta-analysis was to identify exosome-derived biomarkers for the diagnosis of AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: PubMed, PubMed Central, Web of Science, Embase, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) were searched for studies assessing the diagnostic value of biomarkers, including data describing the pooled sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), positive diagnostic likelihood ratio (DLR+), negative diagnostic likelihood ratio (DLR–), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the curve (AUC). The quality of the included studies was assessed using RevMan 5.3 software. Publication bias was analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In total, 19 eligible studies, including 3,742 patients, were selected for this meta-analysis. The SEN, SPE, DLR+, DLR–, DOR, and AUC (95% confidence intervals) of exosome-derived biomarkers in the diagnosis of AD or MCI were 0.83 (0.76–0.87), 0.82 (0.77–0.86), 4.53 (3.46–5.93), 0.21 (0.15–0.29), 17.27 (11.41–26.14), and 0.89 (0.86–0.92), respectively. Sub-group analyses revealed that studies based on serum or microRNA (miRNA) analysis, and those of Caucasian populations, AD patients, patient sample size &amp;gt;50, neuron-derived exosomes (NDE) from plasma and p-tau had higher sensitivity, specificity, and AUC values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Exosome-derived biomarkers have shown potential diagnostic value in AD and MCI, although further research is required for confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Impaired Learning and Memory Ability Induced by a Bilaterally Hippocampal Injection of Streptozotocin in Mice: Involved With the Adaptive Changes of Synaptic Plasticity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.633495</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.633495</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive decline, psychiatric symptoms and behavioral disorders, resulting in disability, and loss of self-sufficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: To establish an AD-like mice model, investigate the behavioral performance, and explore the potential mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Streptozotocin (STZ, 3 mg/kg) was microinjected bilaterally into the dorsal hippocampus of C57BL/6 mice, and the behavioral performance was observed. The serum concentrations of insulin and nesfatin-1 were measured by ELISA, and the activation of hippocampal microglia and astrocytes was assessed by immunohistochemistry. The protein expression of several molecular associated with the regulation of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and the pre-frontal cortex (PFC) was detected via western blotting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The STZ-microinjected model mice showed a slower bodyweight gain and higher serum concentration of insulin and nesfatin-1. Although there was no significant difference between groups with regard to the ability of balance and motor coordination, the model mice presented a decline of spontaneous movement and exploratory behavior, together with an impairment of learning and memory ability. Increased activated microglia was aggregated in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of model mice, together with an increase abundance of Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1−42&lt;/sub&gt; and Tau in the hippocampus and PFC. Moreover, the protein expression of NMDAR2A, NMDAR2B, SynGAP, PSD95, BDNF, and p-β-catenin/β-catenin were remarkably decreased in the hippocampus and the PFC of model mice, and the expression of p-GSK-3β (ser9)/GSK-3β were reduced in the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: A bilateral hippocampal microinjection of STZ could induce not only AD-like behavioral performance in mice, but also adaptive changes of synaptic plasticity against neuroinflammatory and endocrinal injuries. The underlying mechanisms might be associated with the imbalanced expression of the key proteins of Wnt signaling pathway in the hippocampus and the PFC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Elamipretide (SS-31) Improves Functional Connectivity in Hippocampus and Other Related Regions Following Prolonged Neuroinflammation Induced by Lipopolysaccharide in Aged Rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.600484</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuroinflammation has been recognized as a major cause for neurocognitive diseases. Although the hippocampus has been considered an important region for cognitive dysfunction, the influence of hippocampal neuroinflammation on brain functional connectivity (FC) has been rarely studied. In this study, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation in the aged rat brain, while elamipretide (SS-31) was used for treatment. Systemic and hippocampal inflammation were determined using ELISA, while astrocyte responses during hippocampal neuroinflammation were determined by interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β)/tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) double staining immunofluorescence. Oxidative stress was determined by reactive oxidative species (ROS), electron transport chain (ETC) complex, and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Short- (&amp;lt;7 days) and long-term (&amp;gt;30 days) learning and spatial working memory were tested by the Morris water maze (MWM). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was used to analyze the brain FC by placing seed voxels on the left and right hippocampus. Compared with the vehicle group, rats with the LPS exposure showed an impaired MWM performance, higher oxidative stress, higher levels of inflammatory cytokines, and astrocyte activation in the hippocampus. The neuroimaging examination showed decreased FC on the right orbital cortex, right olfactory bulb, and left hippocampus on day 3, 7, and 31, respectively, after treatment. In contrast, rats with SS-31 treatment showed lower levels of inflammatory cytokines, less astrocyte activation in the hippocampus, and improved MWM performance. Neuroimaging examination showed increased FC on the left-parietal association cortex (L-PAC), left sensory cortex, and left motor cortex on day 7 with the right flocculonodular lobe on day 31 as compared with those without SS-31 treatment. Our study demonstrated that inhibiting neuroinflammation in the hippocampus not only reduces inflammatory responses in the hippocampus but also improves the brain FC in regions related to the hippocampus. Furthermore, early anti-inflammatory treatment with SS-31 has a long-lasting effect on reducing the impact of LPS-induced neuroinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Dorsolateral Prefrontal Functional Connectivity Predicts Working Memory Training Gains</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.592261</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.592261</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Normal aging is associated with working memory decline. A decrease in working memory performance is associated with age-related changes in functional activation patterns in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Cognitive training can improve cognitive performance in healthy older adults. We implemented a cognitive training study to assess determinants of generalization of training gains to untrained tasks, a key indicator for the effectiveness of cognitive training. We aimed to investigate the association of resting-state functional connectivity (FC) of DLPFC with working memory performance improvement and cognitive gains after the training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: A sample of 60 healthy older adults (mean age: 68 years) underwent a 4-week neuropsychological training, entailing a working memory task. Baseline resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) images were acquired in order to investigate the FC of DLPFC. To evaluate training effects, participants underwent a neuropsychological assessment before and after the training. A second follow-up assessment was applied 12 weeks after the training. We used cognitive scores of digit span backward and visual block span backward tasks representing working memory function. The training group was divided into subjects who had and who did not have training gains, which was defined as a higher improvement in working memory tasks than the control group (N = 19).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A high FC of DLPFC of the right hemisphere was significantly associated with training gains and performance improvement in the visuospatial task. The maintenance of cognitive gains was restricted to the time period directly after the training. The training group showed performance improvement in the digit span backward task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Functional activation patterns of the DLPFC were associated with the degree of working memory training gains and visuospatial performance improvement. Although improvement through cognitive training and acquisition of training gains are possible in aging, they remain limited.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>The study revealed a significant reduction of frequency and severity of seizure in patients of generalized epilepsy with generalized onset motor seizures in adults who were treated with valproate and melatonin

Abstract
Epilepsy treatment is challenging because of multiple impediments like lack of efficacy of monotherapy, adverse drug reactions, and different comorbidities. Add‐on therapy to first‐line antiepileptics may be the option to overcome therapeutic hurdles. The present randomized, double‐blind, add‐on placebo‐controlled clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of add‐on melatonin in the treatment of generalized epilepsy with generalized onset motor seizure in adults. The control group (n = 52) received add‐on placebo, and the test group (n = 52) received add‐on melatonin (3 mg/day) with valproate (20 mg/kg in two divided doses). Clinical evaluation of seizure frequency, Chalfont‐National Hospital seizure severity scale (NHS3), Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), quality of life in epilepsy inventory, Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), and biochemical estimation of serum neuron‐specific enolase (NSE) and glutathione reductase were done at baseline and compared with follow‐up at 8 weeks. Among 104 patients randomized [mean (SD) age of 27.6 (11.5); 84 (80.8%) male], 88 (84.6%) completed the trial. The responder rate and seizure‐free rate in the test group were significantly (p = 0.006 and 0.034) higher than the control group. There was a significantly higher reduction in the frequency of seizures (p = 0.016) and NHS3 (−2.39; 95%CI: −4.56 to −0.21; p = 0.032) in the test group compared to the control group. Similarly, improvement in PSQI (−1.40; 95%CI: −2.64 to −0.15; p = 0.029) was significantly better in the test group. There was no significant difference in the change in ESS (p = 0.621) and quality of life scoring (p = 0.456) between the study groups. The decrease in serum NSE was significantly higher with the test group compared to the control group (−2.01; 95% CI: −3.74 to −0.27; p = 0.024). Add‐on melatonin increased serum glutathione reductase significantly (p = 0.038), but there was no significant difference between the groups (p = 0.685). Add‐on melatonin with valproate for generalized epilepsy with generalized onset motor seizures in adults can achieve a significantly better clinical outcome by reducing the seizure frequency, severity and attaining a better seizure‐free rate in comparison to the control group.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Long‐Term Safety and Efficacy of Eculizumab in Aquaporin‐4 IgG‐Positive NMOSD</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26049</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26049?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
During PREVENT (NCT01892345), eculizumab significantly reduced relapse risk versus placebo in patients with aquaporin‐4 immunoglobulin G‐positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (AQP4‐IgG+ NMOSD). We report an interim analysis of PREVENT's ongoing open‐label extension (OLE; NCT02003144) evaluating eculizumab's long‐term safety and efficacy.


Methods
Patients who completed PREVENT could enroll in the OLE to receive eculizumab (maintenance dose = 1,200 mg/2 weeks, after a blinded induction phase). Safety and efficacy data from PREVENT and its OLE (interim data cut, July 31, 2019) were combined for this analysis.


Results
Across PREVENT and the OLE, 137 patients received eculizumab and were monitored for a median (range) of 133.3 weeks (5.1–276.9 weeks), for a combined total of 362.3 patient‐years (PY). Treatment‐related adverse event (AE) and serious adverse event (SAE) rates were 183.5 in 100 PY and 8.6 in 100 PY, respectively. Serious infection rates were 10.2 in 100 PY in eculizumab‐treated patients versus 15.1 in 100 PY in the PREVENT placebo group. No patient developed a meningococcal infection. At 192 weeks (3.7 years), 94.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 88.6–97.3) of patients remained adjudicated relapse‐free. The adjudicated annualized relapse rate was 0.025 (95% CI = 0.013–0.048) in all eculizumab‐treated patients versus 0.350 (95% CI = 0.199–0.616) in the PREVENT placebo group. During the OLE, 37% of patients (44 of 119 patients) stopped or decreased background immunosuppressive therapy use.


Interpretation
This analysis demonstrates that eculizumab's long‐term safety profile in NMOSD is consistent with its established profile across other indications. This analysis also demonstrated the sustained ability of long‐term eculizumab treatment to reduce relapse risk in patients with AQP4‐IgG+ NMOSD. ANN NEUROL 2021</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Probabilistic value learning in medial temporal lobe amnesia</title>

	<description>Abstract
A prevailing view in cognitive neuroscience suggests that different forms of learning are mediated by dissociable memory systems, with a mesolimbic (i.e., midbrain and basal ganglia) system supporting incremental trial‐and‐error reinforcement learning and a hippocampal‐based system supporting episodic memory. Yet, growing evidence suggests that the hippocampus may also be important for trial‐and‐error learning, particularly value or reward‐based learning. In the present report, we use a lesion‐based neuropsychological approach to clarify hippocampal contributions to such learning. Six amnesic patients with medial temporal lobe damage and a group of healthy controls were administered a simple value‐based learning task involving probabilistic trial‐and‐error acquisition of stimulus–response‐outcome (reward or none) contingencies modeled after Li et al. (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
, 2011, 108
(1), 55–60). As predicted, patients were significantly impaired on the task, demonstrating reduced learning of the contingencies. Our results provide further supportive evidence that the hippocampus' role in cognition extends beyond episodic memory tasks and call for further refinement of theoretical models of hippocampal functioning.</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: The unique plasticity of hippocampal adult‐born neurons: Contributing to a heterogeneous dentate</title>

	<description>Abstract
The dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus is evolutionarily conserved as one of the few sites of adult neurogenesis in mammals. Although there is clear evidence that neurogenesis is necessary for healthy hippocampal function, whether adult‐born neurons are simply integrated into existing hippocampal networks to serve a similar purpose to that of developmentally born neurons or whether they represent a discrete cell population with unique functions remains less clear. In this review, we consider evidence for discrete cellular, synaptic, and structural features of adult‐born DG neurons, suggesting that neurogenesis contributes to the formation of a heterogeneous DG. We therefore propose that hippocampal neurogenesis creates a specialized neuronal subpopulation that may play a key role in hippocampal functions like episodic memory. We note critical gaps in this extensive body of work, including a general failure to include female animals in relevant research and a need for more precise consideration of intrahippocampal neuroanatomy.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Early Predictors of 9‐Year Disability in Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26052</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26052?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
The purpose of this study was to assess early predictors of 9‐year disability in pediatric patients with multiple sclerosis.


Methods
Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessments of 123 pediatric patients with multiple sclerosis were obtained at disease onset and after 1 and 2 years. A 9‐year clinical follow‐up was also performed. Cox proportional hazard and multivariable regression models were used to assess independent predictors of time to first relapse and 9‐year outcomes.


Results
Time to first relapse was predicted by optic nerve lesions (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.10, p = 0.02) and high‐efficacy treatment exposure (HR = 0.31, p = 0.005). Predictors of annualized relapse rate were: at baseline, presence of cerebellar (β = −0.15, p &amp;lt; 0.001), cervical cord lesions (β = 0.16, p = 0.003), and high‐efficacy treatment exposure (β = −0.14, p = 0.01); considering also 1‐year variables, number of relapses (β = 0.14, p = 0.002), and the previous baseline predictors; considering 2‐year variables, time to first relapse (2‐year: β = −0.12, p = 0.01) entered, whereas high‐efficacy treatment exposure exited the model. Predictors of 9‐year disability worsening were: at baseline, presence of optic nerve lesions (odds ratio [OR] = 6.45, p = 0.01); considering 1‐year and 2‐year variables, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) changes (1‐year: OR = 26.05, p &amp;lt; 0.001; 2‐year: OR = 16.38, p = 0.02), and ≥ 2 new T2‐lesions in 2 years (2‐year: OR = 4.91, p = 0.02). Predictors of higher 9‐year EDSS score were: at baseline, EDSS score (β = 0.58, p &amp;lt; 0.001), presence of brainstem lesions (β = 0.31, p = 0.04), and number of cervical cord lesions (β = 0.22, p = 0.05); considering 1‐year and 2‐year variables, EDSS changes (1‐year: β = 0.79, p &amp;lt; 0.001; 2‐year: β = 0.55, p &amp;lt; 0.001), and ≥ 2 new T2‐lesions (1‐year: β = 0.28, p = 0.03; 2‐year: β = 0.35, p = 0.01).


Interpretation
A complete baseline MRI assessment and an accurate clinical and MRI monitoring during the first 2 years of disease contribute to predict 9‐year prognosis in pediatric patients with multiple sclerosis. ANN NEUROL 2021</description>

	<description>Two‐dimensional (2D) gene expression snapshots cannot properly reflect the volumes, positions, or overlapped domains of multiple genes in tissues that are organized in three‐dimensional (3D) naturally. Novel approach, combing fluorescent antisense mRNA labeling, confocal z‐stack acquisition, and 3D image alignment tool, has uncovered what have been overlooked by 2D images.

Abstract
The conserved bilateral habenular nuclei (HA) in vertebrate diencephalon develop into compartmentalized structures containing neurons derived from different cell lineages. Despite extensive studies demonstrated that zebrafish larval HA display distinct left–right (L‐R) asymmetry in gene expression and connectivity, the spatial gene expression domains were mainly obtained from two‐dimensional (2D) snapshots of colorimetric RNA in situ hybridization staining which could not properly reflect different HA neuronal lineages constructed in three‐dimension (3D). Combing the tyramide‐based fluorescent mRNA in situ hybridization, confocal microscopy and customized imaging processing procedures, we have created spatial distribution maps of four genes for 4‐day‐old zebrafish and in sibling fish whose L‐R asymmetry was spontaneously reversed. 3D volumetric analyses showed that ratios of cpd2, lov, ron, and nrp1a expression in L‐R reversed HA were reversed according to the parapineal positions. However, the quantitative changes of gene expression in reversed larval brains do not mirror the gene expression level in the obverse larval brains. There were a total 87.78% increase in lov+nrp1a+ and a total 12.45% decrease in lov+ron+ double‐positive neurons when the L‐R asymmetry of HA was reversed. Thus, our volumetric analyses of the 3D maps indicate that changes of HA neuronal cell fates are associated with the reversal of HA laterality. These changes likely account for the behavior changes associated with HA laterality alterations.</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Sustained neural rhythms reveal endogenous oscillations supporting speech perception</title>

Rhythmic sensory or electrical stimulation will produce rhythmic brain responses. These rhythmic responses are often interpreted as endogenous neural oscillations aligned (or “entrained”) to the stimulus rhythm. However, stimulus-aligned brain responses can also be explained as a sequence of evoked responses, which only appear regular due to the rhythmicity of the stimulus, without necessarily involving underlying neural oscillations. To distinguish evoked responses from true oscillatory activity, we tested whether rhythmic stimulation produces oscillatory responses which continue after the end of the stimulus. Such sustained effects provide evidence for true involvement of neural oscillations. In Experiment 1, we found that rhythmic intelligible, but not unintelligible speech produces oscillatory responses in magnetoencephalography (MEG) which outlast the stimulus at parietal sensors. In Experiment 2, we found that transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) leads to rhythmic fluctuations in speech perception outcomes after the end of electrical stimulation. We further report that the phase relation between electroencephalography (EEG) responses and rhythmic intelligible speech can predict the tACS phase that leads to most accurate speech perception. Together, we provide fundamental results for several lines of research—including neural entrainment and tACS—and reveal endogenous neural oscillations as a key underlying principle for speech perception.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/2tSmh3oY5ds&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Cerebral palsy (CP) neurologic care and research efforts typically focus on children. However, most people with CP are adults. Adults with CP are at increased risk of new neurologic conditions, such as stroke and myelopathy, that require ongoing neurologic surveillance to distinguish them from baseline motor impairments. Neurologic factors could also contribute to the motor function decline, chronic pain, and chronic fatigue that are commonly experienced by adults with CP. Based on a systematic literature review, we suggest (1) guidelines for neurologic surveillance and neurologist referral and (2) clinical research questions regarding the evolving neurologic risks for adults with CP.

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Mindfulness‐based stress reduction training modulates striatal and cerebellar connectivity</title>

	<description>We show how mindfulness training changes functional connectivity in the right putamen, cerebellum, and insula, as well as effective connectivity in the anterior cingulate cortex, right cerebellum, and bilateral putamen. Results suggest a rearrangement of dorsal striatum functional and effective connectivity, with changes in cortico‐subcortical‐cerebellar modulatory dynamics.

Abstract
Mindfulness is a meditation practice frequently associated with changes in subjective evaluation of cognitive and sensorial experience, as well as with modifications of brain activity and morphometry. Aside from the anatomical localization of functional changes induced by mindfulness practice, little is known about changes in functional and effective functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) connectivity. Here we performed a connectivity fMRI analysis in a group of healthy individuals participating in an 8‐week mindfulness‐based stress reduction (MBSR) training program. Data from both a “mind‐wandering” and a “meditation” state were acquired before and after the MBSR course. Results highlighted decreased local connectivity after training in the right anterior putamen and insula during spontaneous mind‐wandering and the right cerebellum during the meditative state. A further effective connectivity analysis revealed (a) decreased modulation by the anterior cingulate cortex over the anterior portion of the putamen, and (b) a change in left and right posterior putamen excitatory input and inhibitory output with the cerebellum, respectively. Results suggest a rearrangement of dorsal striatum functional and effective connectivity in response to mindfulness practice, with changes in cortico‐subcortical‐cerebellar modulatory dynamics. Findings might be relevant for the understanding of widely documented mindfulness behavioral effects, especially those related to pain perception.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Assessing Dysferlinopathy Patients Over Three Years With a New Motor Scale</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26044</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26044?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
Dysferlinopathy is a muscular dystrophy with a highly variable clinical presentation and currently unpredictable progression. This variability and unpredictability presents difficulties for prognostication and clinical trial design. The Jain Clinical Outcomes Study of Dysferlinopathy aims to establish the validity of the North Star Assessment for Limb Girdle Type Muscular Dystrophies (NSAD) scale and identify factors that influence the rate of disease progression using NSAD.


Methods
We collected a longitudinal series of functional assessments from 187 patients with dysferlinopathy over 3 years. Rasch analysis was used to develop the NSAD, a motor performance scale suitable for ambulant and nonambulant patients. Generalized estimating equations were used to evaluate the impact of patient factors on outcome trajectories.


Results
The NSAD detected significant change in clinical progression over 1 year. The steepest functional decline occurred during the first 10 years after symptom onset, with more rapid decline noted in patients who developed symptoms at a younger age (p = 0.04). The most rapidly deteriorating group over the study was patients 3 to 8 years post symptom onset at baseline.


Interpretation
The NSAD is the first validated limb girdle specific scale of motor performance, suitable for use in clinical practice and clinical trials. Longitudinal analysis showed it may be possible to identify patient factors associated with greater functional decline both across the disease course and in the short‐term for clinical trial preparation. Through further work and validation in this cohort, we anticipate that a disease model incorporating functional performance will allow for more accurate prognosis for patients with dysferlinopathy.

	<description>Neurodegenerative disease (ND) may lead to aberrant changes in glycoenzymes, including glycosyltransferases and glycosidases, which further regulate the key ND‐related molecules, such as amyloid precursor protein, nicastrin, β‐site APP‐cleaving enzyme 1β‐site APP‐cleaving enzyme 1, a disintegrin and metallopeptidase domain 10 (ADAM10), neprilysin, etc.

Abstract
Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are incurable and can develop progressively debilitating disorders, including dementia and ataxias. Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are the most common NDs that mainly affect the elderly people. There is an urgent need to develop new diagnostic tools so that patients can be accurately stratified at an early stage. As a common post‐translational modification, protein glycosylation plays a key role in physiological and pathological processes. The abnormal changes in glycosylation are associated with the altered biological pathways in NDs. The pathogenesis‐related proteins, like amyloid‐β and microtubule‐associated protein tau, have altered glycosylation. Importantly, specific glycosylation changes in cerebrospinal fluid, blood and urine are valuable for revealing neurodegeneration in the early stages. This review describes the emerging biomarkers based on glycoproteomics in NDs, highlighting the potential applications of glycoprotein biomarkers in the early detection of diseases, monitoring of the disease progression, and measurement of the therapeutic responses. The mass spectrometry‐based strategies for characterizing glycoprotein biomarkers are also introduced.</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Sex differences in hippocampal connectivity during spatial long‐term memory</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/10.1002/hipo.23319</guid>

	<description>Abstract
Sex differences in brain activity have been reported across various types of long‐term memory. To our knowledge, sex differences in functional connectivity during long‐term memory have not been investigated. A previous study on the structural connectome identified that female brains have a greater degree of interhemispheric connectivity than males, whereas males have a greater degree of intrahemispheric connectivity than females. The aim of the current investigation was twofold: (a) identify which brain regions were functionally connected to the hippocampus during spatial long‐term memory, and (b) determine if there were sex differences in the functionally connected regions. During the study phase, abstract shapes were presented to the left or right of fixation. During the test phase, abstract shapes were presented at fixation and participants classified each item as previously on the “left” or “right”. A hippocampal region of interest (ROI) was identified by contrasting spatial memory hits and misses. The peak coordinate from this ROI was used to define the center of a sphere that was used as the seed for the functional connectivity analysis. The connectivity analysis produced many connected activations including the medial posterior frontal cortex, lateral posterior frontal cortex, left inferior frontal gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex, and caudate/putamen. Although there were no regions with greater connectivity in females than males, the male versus female comparison produced connected activations in the medial posterior frontal cortex, anterior prefrontal cortex, precuneus, and cingulate sulcus. Females also had greater interhemispheric connectivity than males. The current findings suggest collapsing across sex in cognitive neuroscience studies may not be warranted.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Prolonged mastication may induce an asymmetric modification of the local perfusion of the trigeminal principal nucleus. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible influence of vitamin C (vit. C) on such effect. Four groups of healthy volunteers underwent arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging (ASL-MRI) to evaluate the local perfusion of the trigeminal nuclei after a vit. C-enriched lunch or a control lunch. Two ASL-MRI scans were acquired, respectively, before and after a 1 h-long masticating exercise or a 1 h long resting period. The results showed (i) an increased global perfusion of the brain in the vit. C-enriched lunch groups, (ii) an increased local perfusion of the right principal trigeminal nucleus (Vp) due to mastication, and (iii) a reduction of the rightward asymmetry of the Vp perfusion, due to mastication, after the vit C-enriched meal compared to the control meal. These results confirmed a long-lasting effect of prolonged mastication on Vp perfusion and also suggest a possible effect of vit. C on cerebral vascular tone regulation. Moreover, the data strongly draw attention on the side-to-side relation in Vp perfusion as a possible physiological parameter to be considered to understand the origin of pathological conditions like migraine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Voltage-Gated Ca2+ Channels in Dopaminergic Substantia Nigra Neurons: Therapeutic Targets for Neuroprotection in Parkinson's Disease?</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The loss of dopamine (DA)-producing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SN) underlies the core motor symptoms of the progressive movement disorder Parkinson's disease (PD). To date, no treatment to prevent or slow SN DA neurodegeneration exists; thus, the identification of the underlying factors contributing to the high vulnerability of these neurons represents the basis for the development of novel therapies. Disrupted Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction seem to be key players in the pathophysiology of PD. The autonomous pacemaker activity of SN DA neurons, in combination with low cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; buffering, leads to large somatodendritic fluctuations of intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels that are linked to elevated mitochondrial oxidant stress. L-type voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels (LTCCs) contribute to these Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oscillations in dendrites, and LTCC inhibition was beneficial in cellular and in vivo animal models of PD. However, in a recently completed phase 3 clinical trial, the dihydropyridine (DHP) LTCC inhibitor isradipine failed to slow disease progression in early PD patients, questioning the feasibility of DHPs for PD therapy. Novel evidence also suggests that R- and T-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels (RTCCs and TTCCs, respectively) represent potential PD drug targets. This short review aims to (re)evaluate the therapeutic potential of LTCC, RTCC, and TTCC inhibition in light of novel preclinical and clinical data and the feasibility of available Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel blockers to modify PD disease progression. I also summarize their cell-specific roles for SN DA neuron function and describe how their gating properties allow activity (and thus their contribution to stressful Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oscillations) during pacemaking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Multi-Electrode Array Analysis Identifies Complex Dopamine Responses and Glucose Sensing Properties of Substantia Nigra Neurons in Mouse Brain Slices</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dopaminergic (DA) midbrain neurons within the substantia nigra (SN) display an autonomous pacemaker activity that is crucial for dopamine release and voluntary movement control. Their progressive degeneration is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease. Their metabolically demanding activity-mode affects Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis, elevates metabolic stress, and renders SN DA neurons particularly vulnerable to degenerative stressors. Accordingly, their activity is regulated by complex mechanisms, notably by dopamine itself, via inhibitory D2-autoreceptors and the neuroprotective neuronal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensor NCS-1. Analyzing regulation of SN DA neuron activity-pattern is complicated by their high vulnerability. We studied this activity and its control by dopamine, NCS-1, and glucose with extracellular multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings from midbrain slices of juvenile and adult mice. Our tailored MEA- and spike sorting-protocols allowed high throughput and long recording times. According to individual dopamine-responses, we identified two distinct SN cell-types, in similar frequency: dopamine-inhibited and dopamine-excited neurons. Dopamine-excited neurons were either silent in the absence of dopamine, or they displayed pacemaker-activities, similar to that of dopamine-inhibited neurons. Inhibition of pacemaker-activity by dopamine is typical for SN DA neurons, and it can undergo prominent desensitization. We show for adult mice, that the number of SN DA neurons with desensitized dopamine-inhibition was increased (~60–100%) by a knockout of NCS-1, or by prevention of NCS-1 binding to D2-autoreceptors, while time-course and degrees of desensitization were not altered. The number of neurons with desensitized D2-responses was also higher (~65%) at high glucose-levels (25 mM), compared to lower glucose (2.5 mM), while again desensitization-kinetics were unaltered. However, spontaneous firing-rates were significantly higher at high glucose-levels (~20%). Moreover, transient glucose-deprivation (1 mM) induced a fast and fully-reversible pacemaker frequency reduction. To directly address and quantify glucose-sensing properties of SN DA neurons, we continuously monitored their electrical activity, while altering extracellular glucose concentrations stepwise from 0.5 mM up to 25 mM. SN DA neurons were excited by glucose, with EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values ranging from 0.35 to 2.3 mM. In conclusion, we identified a novel, common subtype of dopamine-excited SN neurons, and a complex, joint regulation of dopamine-inhibited neurons by dopamine and glucose, within the range of physiological brain glucose-levels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Physical and Chemical Interplay Between the Membrane and a Prototypical Potassium Channel Reconstituted on a Lipid Bilayer Platform</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Once membrane potential changes or ligand binding activates the ion channel, the activity of the channel is finely modulated by the fluctuating membrane environment, involving local lipid composition and membrane tension. In the age of post-structural biology, the factors in the membrane that affect the ion channel function and how they affect it are a central concern among ion channel researchers. This review presents our strategies for elucidating the molecular mechanism of membrane effects on ion channel activity. The membrane’s diverse and intricate effects consist of chemical and physical processes. These elements can be quantified separately using lipid bilayer methods, in which a membrane is reconstructed only from the components of interest. In our advanced lipid bilayer platform (contact bubble bilayer, CBB), physical features of the membrane, such as tension, are freely controlled. We have elucidated how the specific lipid or membrane tension modulates the gating of a prototypical potassium channel, KcsA, embedded in the lipid bilayer. Our results reveal the molecular mechanism of the channel for sensing and responding to the membrane environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Oxidative Stress, Inflammation, and Autophagy: Potential Targets of Mesenchymal Stem Cells-Based Therapies in Ischemic Stroke</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death worldwide; currently available treatment approaches for ischemic stroke are to restore blood flow, which reduce disability but are time limited. The interruption of blood flow in ischemic stroke contributes to intricate pathophysiological processes. Oxidative stress and inflammatory activity are two early events in the cascade of cerebral ischemic injury. These two factors are reciprocal causation and directly trigger the development of autophagy. Appropriate autophagy activity contributes to brain recovery by reducing oxidative stress and inflammatory activity, while autophagy dysfunction aggravates cerebral injury. Abundant evidence demonstrates the beneficial impact of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and secretome on cerebral ischemic injury. MSCs reduce oxidative stress through suppressing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) generation and transferring healthy mitochondria to damaged cells. Meanwhile, MSCs exert anti-inflammation properties by the production of cytokines and extracellular vesicles, inhibiting proinflammatory cytokines and inflammatory cells activation, suppressing pyroptosis, and alleviating blood–brain barrier leakage. Additionally, MSCs regulation of autophagy imbalances gives rise to neuroprotection against cerebral ischemic injury. Altogether, MSCs have been a promising candidate for the treatment of ischemic stroke due to their pleiotropic effect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Novel Neuroimaging Biomarker for Sleep Quality in Insomnia Disorder: A Hypothalamus Resting State Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.634984</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite striking progress in the understanding of the neurobiology of insomnia disorder (ID), about 40% of ID patients do not reach sustained remission with the primary treatments. It is necessary to reveal novel neuroimaging biomarkers for sleep quality in ID. The hypothalamus has a central role in sleep-wake regulation by communicating with different brain regions. However, the functional implications of hypothalamus circuitry with other brain areas remains largely unknown in ID. It may be speculated that dysfunctional circuitry in the hypothalamus is involved in the pathogenesis of ID. Thus, we investigated the different network organizations of the bilateral hypothalamus during the resting-state between 26 ID patients and 28 healthy controls (HC). Correlation analysis has been carried out to link the neuroimaging findings and Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) scores. Group comparisons reveal that the resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) between the left hypothalamic region and a few other brain regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and pallidum, are significantly higher in ID compared with HC. The right inferior temporal cortex showed reduced RSFC with the left hypothalamus. No significantly different RSFC between ID and HC was detected for the right hypothalamus. Positive correlations with PSQI scores were observed for RSFC strength between the left hypothalamus and bilateral mPFC (left: r = 0.2985, p = 0.0393; right: r = 0.3723, p = 0.0056). Similarly, the RSFC strength between the right hypothalamus and bilateral mPFC (left: r = 0.3980, p = 0.0029; right: r = 0.2972, p = 0.0291) also showed significant positive correlations with PSQI scores. In conclusion, we reveal a novel neuroimaging biomarker for sleep quality, i.e., the RSFC strength of the hypothalamus-mPFC pathway. Consistent with the hyperarousal model of ID, our results shed new insights into the implications of the hyper-connection within hypothalamus circuits in the pathology of the ID.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Neuromodulation of the Pudendal Nerve Assisted by 3D Printed: A New Method of Neuromodulation for Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves by implanted electrodes is an effective treatment for certain pelvic floor diseases. As well as intravesical electrical stimulation, this predominantly includes stimulation of the sacral nerve, tibial nerve, and pudendal nerve. The pudendal nerve is one of the main nerves that stimulate pelvic floor muscles, external urethral meatus, and the anal sphincter and pelvic organs, and it may have effects on frequent urination, urgency, dysuria, and perineal pain. It is difficult to locate because of its anatomical course, however, leading to difficulties fixing the electrode, which increases the difficulty of pudendal nerve electrical stimulation in clinical practice. In the current study 3D printed navigation was used to solve these problems. Combined with autopsy data and patient pelvic and nerve data, a personalized design was generated. Neural modulation of the pudendal nerve was achieved by implanting the lead with the guidance of 3D printed navigation. 3D printed navigation can maximize the phase II conversion rate, reduce the difficulty of surgery, shorten the operation time, reduce damage to additional organs and blood vessels, and increase the accuracy of electrode implantation, and it can be performed while the patient is awake. It is an accurate, reversible, efficient, and minimally invasive surgery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Is Reconsolidation a General Property of Memory?</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Memory reconsolidation holds great hope for memory modification approaches and clinical treatments of mental disorders associated with maladaptive memories. However, it remains controversial as to whether reconsolidation is a general property of all types of memory. Especially, discrepancies have been reported in research focusing on whether declarative memory undergoes reconsolidation, and whether old memories can be reorganized after retrieval. Here, we discuss how these inconsistent results can be reconciled and what information we need to uncover for the general use of reconsolidation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Interrelation Between Peripersonal Action Space and Interpersonal Social Space: Psychophysiological Evidence and Clinical Implications</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The peripersonal space is an adaptive and flexible interface between the body and the environment that fulfills a dual-motor function: preparing the body for voluntary object-oriented actions to interact with incentive stimuli and preparing the body for defensive responses when facing potentially harmful stimuli. In this position article, we provide arguments for the sensorimotor rooting of the peripersonal space representation and highlight the variables that contribute to its flexible and adaptive characteristics. We also demonstrate that peripersonal space represents a mediation zone between the body and the environment contributing to not only the control of goal-directed actions but also the organization of social life. The whole of the data presented and discussed led us to the proposal of a new theoretical framework linking the peripersonal action space and the interpersonal social space and we highlight how this theoretical framework can account for social behaviors in populations with socio-emotional deficits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Long-Term Mutual Training for the CYBATHLON BCI Race With a Tetraplegic Pilot: A Case Study on Inter-Session Transfer and Intra-Session Adaptation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;CYBATHLON is an international championship where people with severe physical disabilities compete with the aid of state-of-the-art assistive technology. In one of the disciplines, the BCI Race, tetraplegic pilots compete in a computer game race by controlling an avatar with a brain-computer interface (BCI). This competition offers a perfect opportunity for BCI researchers to study long-term training effects in potential end-users, and to evaluate BCI performance in a realistic environment. In this work, we describe the BCI system designed by the team Mirage91 for participation in the CYBATHLON BCI Series 2019, as well as in the CYBATHLON 2020 Global Edition. Furthermore, we present the BCI’s interface with the game and the main methodological strategies, along with a detailed evaluation of its performance over the course of the training period, which lasted 14 months. The developed system was a 4-class BCI relying on task-specific modulations of brain rhythms. We implemented inter-session transfer learning to reduce calibration time, and to reinforce the stability of the brain patterns. Additionally, in order to compensate for potential intra-session shifts in the features’ distribution, normalization parameters were continuously adapted in an unsupervised fashion. Across the aforementioned 14 months, we recorded 26 game-based training sessions. Between the first eight sessions, and the final eight sessions leading up to the CYBATHLON 2020 Global Edition, the runtimes significantly improved from 255 ± 23 s (mean ± std) to 225 ± 22 s, respectively. Moreover, we observed a significant increase in the classifier’s accuracy from 46 to 53%, driven by more distinguishable brain patterns. Compared to conventional single session, non-adaptive BCIs, the inter-session transfer learning and unsupervised intra-session adaptation techniques significantly improved the performance. This long-term study demonstrates that regular training helped the pilot to significantly increase the distance between task-specific patterns, which resulted in an improvement of performance, both with respect to class separability in the calibration data, and with respect to the game. Furthermore, it shows that our methodological approaches were beneficial in transferring the performance across sessions, and most importantly to the CYBATHLON competitions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Socio-emotional impairments are key symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorders. This work proposes to analyze the neuronal activity related to the discrimination of emotional prosodies in autistic children (aged 9 to 11-year-old) as follows. Firstly, a database for single words uttered in Mexican Spanish by males, females, and children will be created. Then, optimal acoustic features for emotion characterization will be extracted, followed of a cubic kernel function Support Vector Machine (SVM) in order to validate the speech corpus. As a result, human-specific acoustic properties of emotional voice signals will be identified. Secondly, those identified acoustic properties will be modified to synthesize the recorded human emotional voices. Thirdly, both human and synthesized utterances will be used to study the electroencephalographic correlate of affective prosody processing in typically developed and autistic children. Finally, and on the basis of the outcomes, synthesized voice-enhanced environments will be created to develop an intervention based on social-robot and Social Story&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; for autistic children to improve affective prosodies discrimination. This protocol has been registered at BioMed Central under the following number: ISRCTN18117434.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Object-Location Memory Training in Older Adults Leads to Greater Deactivation of the Dorsal Default Mode Network</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.623766</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Substantial evidence indicates that cognitive training can be efficacious for older adults, but findings regarding training-related brain plasticity have been mixed and vary depending on the imaging modality. Recent years have seen a growth in recognition of the importance of large-scale brain networks on cognition. In particular, task-induced deactivation within the default mode network (DMN) is thought to facilitate externally directed cognition, while aging-related decrements in this neural process are related to reduced cognitive performance. It is not yet clear whether task-induced deactivation within the DMN can be enhanced by cognitive training in the elderly. We previously reported durable cognitive improvements in a sample of healthy older adults (age range = 60–75) who completed 6 weeks of process-based object-location memory training (N = 36) compared to an active control training group (N = 31). The primary aim of the current study is to evaluate whether these cognitive gains are accompanied by training-related changes in task-related DMN deactivation. Given the evidence for heterogeneity of the DMN, we examine task-related activation/deactivation within two separate DMN branches, a ventral branch related to episodic memory and a dorsal branch more closely resembling the canonical DMN. Participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing an untrained object-location memory task at four time points before, during, and after the training period. Task-induced (de)activation values were extracted for the ventral and dorsal DMN branches at each time point. Relative to visual fixation baseline: (i) the dorsal DMN was deactivated during the scanner task, while the ventral DMN was activated; (ii) the object-location memory training group exhibited an increase in dorsal DMN deactivation relative to the active control group over the course of training and follow-up; (iii) changes in dorsal DMN deactivation did not correlate with task improvement. These results indicate a training-related enhancement of task-induced deactivation of the dorsal DMN, although the specificity of this improvement to the cognitive task performed in the scanner is not clear.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Effects of Emotional Stimulations on the Online Operation of a P300-Based Brain–Computer Interface</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Using P300-based brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) in daily life should take into account the user’s emotional state because various emotional conditions are likely to influence event-related potentials (ERPs) and consequently the performance of P300-based BCIs. This study aimed at investigating whether external emotional stimuli affect the performance of a P300-based BCI, particularly built for controlling home appliances. We presented a set of emotional auditory stimuli to subjects, which had been selected for each subject based on individual valence scores evaluated a priori, while they were controlling an electric light device using a P300-based BCI. There were four conditions regarding the auditory stimuli, including high valence, low valence, noise, and no sound. As a result, subjects controlled the electric light device using the BCI in real time with a mean accuracy of 88.14%. The overall accuracy and P300 features over most EEG channels did not show a significant difference between the four auditory conditions (p &amp;gt; 0.05). When we measured emotional states using frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) and compared FAA across the auditory conditions, we also found no significant difference (p &amp;gt; 0.05). Our results suggest that there is no clear evidence to support a hypothesis that external emotional stimuli influence the P300-based BCI performance or the P300 features while people are controlling devices using the BCI in real time. This study may provide useful information for those who are concerned with the implementation of a P300-based BCI in practice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Language Familiarity and Proficiency Leads to Differential Cortical Processing During Translation Between Distantly Related Languages</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.593108</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the midst of globalization, English is regarded as an international language, or Lingua Franca, but learning it as a second language (L2) remains still difficult to speakers of other languages. This is true especially for the speakers of languages distantly related to English such as Japanese. In this sense, exploring neural basis for translation between the first language (L1) and L2 is of great interest. There have been relatively many previous researches revealing brain activation patterns during translations between L1 and English as L2. These studies, which focused on language translation with close or moderate linguistic distance (LD), have suggested that the Broca area (BA 44/45) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; BA 46) may play an important role on translation. However, the neural mechanism of language translation between Japanese and English, having large LD, has not been clarified. Thus, we used functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to investigate the brain activation patterns during word translation between Japanese and English. We also assessed the effects of translation directions and word familiarity. All participants’ first language was Japanese and they were learning English. Their English proficiency was advanced or elementary. We selected English and Japanese words as stimuli based on the familiarity for Japanese people. Our results showed that the brain activation patterns during word translation largely differed depending on their English proficiency. The advanced group elicited greater activation on the left prefrontal cortex around the Broca’s area while translating words with low familiarity, but no activation was observed while translating words with high familiarity. On the other hand, the elementary group evoked greater activation on the left temporal area including the superior temporal gyrus (STG) irrespective of the word familiarity. These results suggested that different cognitive process could be involved in word translation corresponding to English proficiency in Japanese learners of English. These difference on the brain activation patterns between the advanced and elementary group may reflect the difference on the cognitive loads depending on the levels of automatization in one’s language processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: The rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigm is a high-speed paradigm of brain–computer interface (BCI) applications. The target stimuli evoke event-related potential (ERP) activity of odd-ball effect, which can be used to detect the onsets of targets. Thus, the neural control can be produced by identifying the target stimulus. However, the ERPs in single trials vary in latency and length, which makes it difficult to accurately discriminate the targets against their neighbors, the near-non-targets. Thus, it reduces the efficiency of the BCI paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: To overcome the difficulty of ERP detection against their neighbors, we proposed a simple but novel ternary classification method to train the classifiers. The new method not only distinguished the target against all other samples but also further separated the target, near-non-target, and other, far-non-target samples. To verify the efficiency of the new method, we performed the RSVP experiment. The natural scene pictures with or without pedestrians were used; the ones with pedestrians were used as targets. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data of 10 subjects were acquired during presentation. The SVM and CNN in EEGNet architecture classifiers were used to detect the onsets of target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We obtained fairly high target detection scores using SVM and EEGNet classifiers based on MEG data. The proposed ternary classification method showed that the near-non-target samples can be discriminated from others, and the separation significantly increased the ERP detection scores in the EEGNet classifier. Moreover, the visualization of the new method suggested the different underling of SVM and EEGNet classifiers in ERP detection of the RSVP experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: In the RSVP experiment, the near-non-target samples contain separable ERP activity. The ERP detection scores can be increased using classifiers of the EEGNet model, by separating the non-target into near- and far-targets based on their delay against targets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Quantitative Fluorescent in situ Hybridization Reveals Differential Transcription Profile Sharpening of Endocytic Proteins in Cochlear Hair Cells Upon Maturation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The organ of Corti (OC) comprises two types of sensory cells: outer hair cells (OHCs) and inner hair cells (IHCs). While both are mechanotransducers, OHCs serve as cochlear amplifiers, whereas IHCs transform sound into transmitter release. Reliable sound encoding is ensured by indefatigable exocytosis of synaptic vesicles associated with efficient replenishment of the vesicle pool. Vesicle reformation requires retrieval of vesicle membrane from the hair cell’s membrane via endocytosis. So far, the protein machinery for endocytosis in pre-mature and terminally differentiated hair cells has only partially been deciphered. Here, we studied three endocytic proteins, dynamin-1, dynamin-3, and endophilin-A1, by assessing their transcription profiles in pre-mature and mature mouse OCs. State-of-the-art RNAscope&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) of whole-mount OCs was used for quantification of target mRNAs on single-cell level. We found that pre-mature IHCs contained more mRNA transcripts of dnm1 (encoding dynamin-1) and sh3gl2 (endophilin-A1), but less of dnm3 (dynamin-3) than OHCs. These differential transcription profiles between OHCs and IHCs were sharpened upon maturation. It is noteworthy that low but heterogeneous signal numbers were found between individual negative controls, which highlights the importance of corresponding analyses in RNAscope&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; assays. Complementary immunolabeling revealed strong expression of dynamin-1 in the soma of mature IHCs, which was much weaker in pre-mature IHCs. By contrast, dynamin-3 was predominantly found in the soma and at the border of the cuticular plates of pre-mature and mature OHCs. In summary, using quantitative RNAscope&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; FISH and immunohistochemistry on whole-mount tissue of both pre-mature and mature OCs, we disclosed the cellular upregulation of endocytic proteins at the level of transcription/translation during terminal differentiation of the OC. Dynamin-1 and endophilin-A1 likely contribute to the strengthening of the endocytic machinery in IHCs after the onset of hearing, whereas expression of dynamin-3 at the cuticular plate of pre-mature and mature OHCs suggests its possible involvement in activity-independent apical endocytosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
