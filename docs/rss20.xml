	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A single-cell spiking model for the origin of grid-cell patterns</title>

Spatial cognition in mammals is thought to rely on the activity of grid cells in the entorhinal cortex, yet the fundamental principles underlying the origin of grid-cell firing are still debated. Grid-like patterns could emerge via Hebbian learning and neuronal adaptation, but current computational models remained too abstract to allow direct confrontation with experimental data. Here, we propose a single-cell spiking model that generates grid firing fields via spike-rate adaptation and spike-timing dependent plasticity. Through rigorous mathematical analysis applicable in the linear limit, we quantitatively predict the requirements for grid-pattern formation, and we establish a direct link to classical pattern-forming systems of the Turing type. Our study lays the groundwork for biophysically-realistic models of grid-cell activity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OBzyBRe4hNc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Determining how synaptic coupling within and between regions is modulated during sensory processing is an important topic in neuroscience. Electrophysiological recordings provide detailed information about neural spiking but have traditionally been confined to a particular region or layer of cortex. Here we develop new theoretical methods to study interactions between and within two brain regions, based on experimental measurements of spiking activity simultaneously recorded from the two regions. By systematically comparing experimentally-obtained spiking statistics to (efficiently computed) model spike rate statistics, we identify regions in model parameter space that are consistent with the experimental data. We apply our new technique to dual micro-electrode array &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; recordings from two distinct regions: olfactory bulb (OB) and anterior piriform cortex (PC). Our analysis predicts that: i) inhibition within the afferent region (OB) has to be weaker than the inhibition within PC, ii) excitation from PC to OB is generally stronger than excitation from OB to PC, iii) excitation from PC to OB and inhibition within PC have to both be relatively strong compared to presynaptic inputs from OB. These predictions are validated in a spiking neural network model of the OB–PC pathway that satisfies the many constraints from our experimental data. We find when the derived relationships are violated, the spiking statistics no longer satisfy the constraints from the data. In principle this modeling framework can be adapted to other systems and be used to investigate relationships between other neural attributes besides network connection strengths. Thus, this work can serve as a guide to further investigations into the relationships of various neural attributes within and across different regions during sensory processing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bmAz5E-V358&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

With the rapidly increasing volume of deep sequencing data, more efficient algorithms and data structures are needed. Minimizers are a central recent paradigm that has improved various sequence analysis tasks, including hashing for faster read overlap detection, sparse suffix arrays for creating smaller indexes, and Bloom filters for speeding up sequence search. Here, we propose an alternative paradigm that can lead to substantial further improvement in these and other tasks. For integers &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;, we say that a set of &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-mers is a &lt;i&gt;universal hitting set&lt;/i&gt; (UHS) if every possible &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;-long sequence must contain a &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-mer from the set. We develop a heuristic called DOCKS to find a compact UHS, which works in two phases: The first phase is solved optimally, and for the second we propose several efficient heuristics, trading set size for speed and memory. The use of heuristics is motivated by showing the NP-hardness of a closely related problem. We show that DOCKS works well in practice and produces UHSs that are very close to a theoretical lower bound. We present results for various values of &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt; and by applying them to real genomes show that UHSs indeed improve over minimizers. In particular, DOCKS uses less than 30% of the 10-mers needed to span the human genome compared to minimizers. The software and computed UHSs are freely available at github.com/Shamir-Lab/DOCKS/ and acgt.cs.tau.ac.il/docks/, respectively.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-LCuI1mRyPk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Estimating time of HIV-1 infection from next-generation sequence diversity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005775</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Vadim Puller, Richard Neher, Jan Albert&lt;/p&gt;

Estimating the time since infection (TI) in newly diagnosed HIV-1 patients is challenging, but important to understand the epidemiology of the infection. Here we explore the utility of virus diversity estimated by next-generation sequencing (NGS) as novel biomarker by using a recent genome-wide longitudinal dataset obtained from 11 untreated HIV-1-infected patients with known dates of infection. The results were validated on a second dataset from 31 patients. Virus diversity increased linearly with time, particularly at 3rd codon positions, with little inter-patient variation. The precision of the TI estimate improved with increasing sequencing depth, showing that diversity in NGS data yields superior estimates to the number of ambiguous sites in Sanger sequences, which is one of the alternative biomarkers. The full advantage of deep NGS was utilized with continuous diversity measures such as average pairwise distance or site entropy, rather than the fraction of polymorphic sites. The precision depended on the genomic region and codon position and was highest when 3rd codon positions in the entire &lt;i&gt;pol&lt;/i&gt; gene were used. For these data, TI estimates had a mean absolute error of around 1 year. The error increased only slightly from around 0.6 years at a TI of 6 months to around 1.1 years at 6 years. Our results show that virus diversity determined by NGS can be used to estimate time since HIV-1 infection many years after the infection, in contrast to most alternative biomarkers. We provide the regression coefficients as well as web tool for TI estimation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KMtznCSBzrY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A continuum-mechanical skeletal muscle model including actin-titin interaction predicts stable contractions on the descending limb of the force-length relation</title>

Contractions on the descending limb of the total (active + passive) muscle force—length relationship (i. e. when muscle stiffness is negative) are expected to lead to vast half-sarcomere—length inhomogeneities. This is however not observed in experiments—vast half-sarcomere—length inhomogeneities can be absent in myofibrils contracting in this range, and initial inhomogeneities can even decrease. Here we show that the absence of half-sarcomere—length inhomogeneities can be predicted when considering interactions of the semi-active protein titin with the actin filaments. Including a model of actin—titin interactions within a multi-scale continuum-mechanical model, we demonstrate that stability, accurate forces and nearly homogeneous half-sarcomere lengths can be obtained on the descending limb of the static total force—length relation. This could be a key to durable functioning of the muscle because large local stretches, that might harm, for example, the transverse-tubule system, are avoided.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/l4uY3cS3ehc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Pairwise maximum-entropy models have been used in neuroscience to predict the activity of neuronal populations, given only the time-averaged correlations of the neuron activities. This paper provides evidence that the pairwise model, applied to experimental recordings, would produce a bimodal distribution for the population-averaged activity, and for some population sizes the second mode would peak at high activities, that experimentally would be equivalent to 90% of the neuron population active within time-windows of few milliseconds. Several problems are connected with this bimodality: 1. The presence of the high-activity mode is unrealistic in view of observed neuronal activity and on neurobiological grounds. 2. Boltzmann learning becomes non-ergodic, hence the pairwise maximum-entropy distribution cannot be found: in fact, Boltzmann learning would produce an incorrect distribution; similarly, common variants of mean-field approximations also produce an incorrect distribution. 3. The Glauber dynamics associated with the model is unrealistically bistable and cannot be used to generate realistic surrogate data. This bimodality problem is first demonstrated for an experimental dataset from 159 neurons in the motor cortex of macaque monkey. Evidence is then provided that this problem affects typical neural recordings of population sizes of a couple of hundreds or more neurons. The cause of the bimodality problem is identified as the inability of standard maximum-entropy distributions with a uniform reference measure to model neuronal inhibition. To eliminate this problem a modified maximum-entropy model is presented, which reflects a basic effect of inhibition in the form of a simple but non-uniform reference measure. This model does not lead to unrealistic bimodalities, can be found with Boltzmann learning, and has an associated Glauber dynamics which incorporates a minimal asymmetric inhibition.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SMTazwKifmI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Learning causal networks with latent variables from multivariate information in genomic data</title>

Learning causal networks from large-scale genomic data remains challenging in absence of time series or controlled perturbation experiments. We report an information- theoretic method which learns a large class of causal or non-causal graphical models from purely observational data, while including the effects of unobserved latent variables, commonly found in many genomic datasets. Starting from a complete graph, the method iteratively removes dispensable edges, by uncovering significant information contributions from indirect paths, and assesses edge-specific confidences from randomization of available data. The remaining edges are then oriented based on the signature of causality in observational data. The approach and associated algorithm, miic, outperform earlier methods on a broad range of benchmark networks. Causal network reconstructions are presented at different biological size and time scales, from gene regulation in single cells to whole genome duplication in tumor development as well as long term evolution of vertebrates. Miic is publicly available at https://github.com/miicTeam/MIIC.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zqYgkhitkBA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: In reply to Faes et al. and Barnett et al. regarding &quot;A study of problems encountered in Granger causality analysis from a neuroscience perspective&quot;. (arXiv:1709.10248v1 [stat.ME])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This reply is in response to commentaries by Barnett, Barrett, and Seth
(&lt;a href=&quot;http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1708.08001&quot;&gt;arXiv:1708.08001&lt;/a&gt;) and Faes, Stramaglia, and Marinazzo (&lt;a href=&quot;http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1708.06990&quot;&gt;arXiv:1708.06990&lt;/a&gt;) on
our paper entitled &quot;A study of problems encountered in Granger causality
analysis from a neuroscience perspective.&quot; (PNAS 114(34):7063-7072. 2017). In
our paper, we analyzed several properties of Granger-Geweke causality (GGC) and
discussed potential problems in neuroscience applications. We demonstrated: (i)
that GGC, estimated using separate model fits, is either severely biased,
particularly when the true model is known, or a high variance is introduced to
overcome the bias; and (ii) that GGC does not reflect some component dynamics
of the system. The commentaries by both Faes et al. and Barnett et al. point
out that the computational problems of (i) are resolved by using recent
computational methods. We acknowledge that these problems are indeed resolved
by these methods. However, the traditional computation using separate model
fits continues to be presented and applied. More fundamentally, the
interpretational problems stemming from (ii) are not in anyway addressed by the
improved methods because they are inherent to the definition of GGC. These
properties are indeed acknowledged by both commentaries. We have no
misconception of the GGC measure and do not claim that these properties are
facially wrong. But we do discuss at length how these properties make it
inappropriate and misleading for common types of scientific questions, how
presentation of GGC results without model estimates are not decipherable, and
how the absence of clear statements of questions of interest present further
opportunities for misinterpretation.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The characterisation of neuronal connectivity is one of the most important
matters in neuroscience. In this work, we show that a recently proposed
informational quantity, the causal mutual information, employed with an
appropriate methodology, can be used not only to correctly infer the direction
of the underlying physical synapses, but also to identify their excitatory or
inhibitory nature, considering easy to handle and measure bivariate
time-series. The success of our approach relies on a surprising property found
in neuronal networks by which non-adjacent neurons do &quot;understand&quot; each other
(positive mutual information), however this exchange of information is not
capable of causing effect (zero transfer entropy). Remarkably, inhibitory
connections, responsible for enhancing synchronisation, transfer more
information than excitatory connections, known to enhance entropy in the
network. We also demonstrate that our methodology can be used to correctly
infer directionality of synapses even in the presence of dynamic and
observational Gaussian noise, and is also successful in providing the effective
directionality of inter modular connectivity, when only mean fields can be
measured.

	<description>The ability to reproducibly target expression of transgenes to small, defined subsets of cells is a key experimental tool for understanding many biological processes. The Drosophila nervous system contains thousands of distinct cell types and it has generally not been possible to limit expression to one or a few cell types when using a single segment of genomic DNA as an enhancer to drive expression. Intersectional methods, in which expression of the transgene only occurs where two different enhancers overlap in their expression patterns, can be used to achieve the desired specificity. This report describes a set of over 2,800 transgenic lines for use with the split-GAL4 intersectional method.</description>

	<description>Photoreceptor degeneration is a leading cause of visual impairment worldwide. Separation of neurosensory retina from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium is a prominent feature preceding photoreceptor degeneration in a variety of retinal diseases. Although ophthalmic surgeries have been well developed to restore retinal structures, post-op patients usually experience progressive photoreceptor degeneration and irreversible vision loss that is incurable at present. Previous studies point to a critical role of mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway in photoreceptor degeneration, but the upstream triggers remain largely unexplored. In this study, we show that after experimental RD induction, photoreceptors activate dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1)-dependent mitochondrial fission pathway and subsequent apoptotic cascades. Mechanistically, endogenous ROS is necessary for Drp1 activation in vivo and exogenous ROS insult is sufficient to activate Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission in cultured photoreceptors. Accordingly, inhibition of Drp1 activity effectively preserves mitochondrial integrity and rescues photoreceptors. Collectively, our data delineates a ROS-Drp1-mitochondria axis that promotes photoreceptor degeneration in retinal diseased models.</description>

	<description>Healthy ageing is associated with decline in cognitive abilities such as language. Aerobic fitness has been shown to ameliorate decline in some cognitive domains, but the potential benefits for language have not been examined. We investigated the relationship between aerobic fitness and tip-of-the-tongue states. These are among the most frequent cognitive failures in healthy older adults and occur when a speaker knows a word but is unable to produce it. We found that the healthy older adults indeed experience more tip-of-the-tongue states, and that when they do they have access to less information about the word's sound structure, compared to young controls. Importantly, higher aerobic fitness levels decrease the probability of experiencing tip-of-the-tongue states in healthy older adults, over and above the effect of age. This is the first demonstration of a link between aerobic fitness and language functioning in healthy older adults.</description>

	<description>Background: C-reactive protein (CRP) is a candidate biomarker for major depressive disorder (MDD), but it is unclear how peripheral CRP levels relate to the heterogeneous clinical phenotypes of the disorder. Methods: We recruited 102 treatment-resistant, depressed MDD patients, 48 treatment-responsive, non-depressed MDD patients, 48 depressed but un-medicated patients, and 54 healthy volunteers. High sensitivity CRP in peripheral venous blood, body mass index (BMI), and questionnaire assessments of depression, anxiety, and childhood trauma, were measured. Group differences in CRP were estimated, before and after correction for BMI. Partial least squares (PLS) analysis explored the relationships between CRP and specific clinical phenotypes. Outcomes: Compared to healthy volunteers, BMI-corrected CRP was significantly elevated in treatment-resistant patients (P = 0.007; Cohen's d = 0.47); but not significantly so in the treatment-responsive (d = 0.29) and untreated (d = 0.18) groups. PLS yielded an optimal two factor solution that accounted for 34.7% of variation in clinical measures, and for 36.0% of variation in CRP. The clinical phenotypes most strongly associated with CRP and heavily weighted on the first PLS component were: vegetative depressive symptoms, BMI, state anxiety, and feeling unloved as a child or wishing for a different childhood. Interpretation: Peripheral CRP was elevated in MDD, especially in treatment-resistant cases. Other phenotypes associated with elevated CRP included childhood adversity, and specific depressive and anxious symptoms. We suggest that MDD patients stratified for pro-inflammatory biomarkers, like CRP, have a distinctive clinical profile that might be responsive to second-line treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs.

	<description>Humans are remarkably adept at generalizing knowledge between experiences in a way that can be difficult for computers. Often, this entails generalizing constituent pieces of experiences that do not fully overlap, but nonetheless share useful similarities with, previously acquired knowledge. However, it is often unclear how knowledge gained in one context should generalize to another. Previous computational models and data suggest that rather than learning about each individual context, humans build latent abstract structures and learn to link these structures to arbitrary contexts, facilitating generalization. In these models, task structures that are more popular across contexts are more likely to be revisited in new contexts. However, these models predict that structures are either re-used as a whole or created from scratch, prohibiting the ability to generalize constituent parts of learned structures. This contrasts with ecological settings, where some aspects of task structure, such as the transition function, will be shared between context separately from other aspects, such as the reward function. Here, we develop a novel non-parametric Bayesian agent that forms independent latent clusters for transition and reward functions that may have different popularity across contexts. We compare this agent to an agent that jointly clusters both across a range of task domains. We show that relative performance of the two agents depends on the statistics of the task domain, including the mutual information between transition and reward functions in the environment, and the stochasticity of the observations. We formalize our analysis through an information theoretic account of the priors, and develop a meta learning agent that can dynamically arbitrate between strategies across task domains. We argue that this provides a first step in allowing for compositional structures in reinforcement learners, which should be provide a better model of human learning and additional flexibility for artificial agents.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Offline Replay Supports Planning: fMRI Evidence from Reward Revaluation</title>

	<description>Making decisions in sequentially structured tasks requires integrating distally acquired information. The extensive computational cost of such integration challenges planning methods that integrate online, at decision time. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether offline integration during replay supports planning, and if so which memories should be replayed. Inspired by machine learning, we propose that (a) offline replay of trajectories facilitates integrating representations that guide decisions, and (b) unsigned prediction errors (uncertainty) trigger such integrative replay. We designed a 2-step revaluation task for fMRI, whereby participants needed to integrate changes in rewards with past knowledge to optimally replan decisions. As predicted, we found that (a) multi-voxel pattern evidence for off-task replay predicts subsequent replanning; (b) neural sensitivity to uncertainty predicts subsequent replay and replanning; (c) off-task hippocampus and anterior cingulate activity increase when revaluation is required. These findings elucidate how the brain leverages offline mechanisms in planning and goal-directed behavior under uncertainty.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Novel Compensatory Mechanisms Enable the Mutant KCNT1 Channels to Induce Seizures</title>

	<description>Mutations in the sodium-activated potassium channel (KCNT1) gene are linked to epilepsy. Surprisingly, all KCNT1 mutations examined to date increase K+ current amplitude. These findings present a major neurophysiological paradox: how do gain-of-function KCNT1 mutations expected to silence neurons cause epilepsy? Here, we use Drosophila to show that expressing mutant KCNT1 in GABAergic neurons leads to seizures, consistent with the notion that silencing inhibitory neurons tips the balance towards hyperexcitation. Unexpectedly, mutant KCNT1 expressed in motoneurons also causes seizures. One striking observation is that mutant KCNT1 causes abnormally large and spontaneous EJPs (sEJPs). Our data suggest that these sEJPs result from local depolarization of synaptic terminals due to a reduction in Shaker channel levels and more active Na+ channels. Hence, we provide the first in vivo evidence that both disinhibition of inhibitory neurons and compensatory plasticity in motoneurons can account for the paradoxical effects of gain-of-function mutant KCNT1 in epilepsy.</description>

	<description>While clues have existed that endosomal trafficking is associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), whether it plays a central role in the disease and if so how has remained unknown. Here we rely on recent genetic and cellular findings to construct a model proposing that traffic jams in the early endosome can act as an upstream pathogenic hub in AD. We also rely on an independent series of findings to suggest how the traffic jams can act as a unified mediator of downstream pathophysiology. The model predicts, therefore, that interventions designed to unjam the endosome carry high therapeutic promise.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Assessment of the need for separate test set and number of medical images necessary for deep learning: a sub-sampling study</title>

	<description>Deep learning algorithms have tremendous potential utility in the classification of biomedical images. For example, images acquired with retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) can be used to accurately classify patients with adult macular degeneration (AMD), and distinguish them from healthy control patients. However, previous research has suggested that large amounts of data are required in order to train deep learning algorithms, because of the large number of parameters that need to be fit. Here, we show that a moderate amount of data (data from approximately 1,800 patients) may be enough to reach close- to-maximal performance in the classification of AMD patients from OCT images. These results suggest that deep learning algorithms can be trained on moderate amounts of data, provided that images are relatively homogenous, and the effective number of parameters is sufficiently small. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in this application, cross-validation with a separate test set that is not used in any part of the training does not differ substantially from cross-validation with a validation data-set used to determine the optimal stopping point for training.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Mapping Cortical Brain Asymmetry in 17,141 Healthy Individuals Worldwide via the ENIGMA Consortium</title>

	<description>Hemispheric asymmetry is a cardinal feature of human brain organization. Abnormal brain asymmetry is also linked to numerous cognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders. Here the ENIGMA consortium presents the largest ever analysis of cerebral cortical asymmetry and its variability across individuals. Cortical thickness and surface area were assessed in MRI scans of 17,141 healthy individuals from 99 datasets worldwide. Results revealed widespread asymmetries at both hemispheric and regional levels, with a generally thicker cortex but smaller surface area in the left hemisphere relative to the right. Regionally, asymmetries of cortical thickness and/or surface area were found in the inferior frontal gyrus, transverse temporal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, and entorhinal cortex. These regions are involved in lateralized functions, including language and visuospatial processing. In addition to population-level asymmetries, variability in the brain asymmetry was found related to sex, age, and brain size. Surprisingly, we did not find significant associations between asymmetries and handedness. Finally, with two independent pedigree datasets, we found several asymmetries showing considerable heritability. The structural asymmetries identified, and their variabilities and heritability provide a reference resource for future studies on the genetic basis of brain asymmetry and altered laterality in cognitive, neurological, and psychiatric disorders.</description>

	<description>The posterior medial network is at the apex of a temporal integration hierarchy in the brain, integrating information over many seconds of viewing intact, but not scrambled, movies. This has been interpreted as an effect of temporal structure. Such structure in movies depends on pre-existing event schemas, but temporal structure can also arise de novo from learning. Here we examined the relative role of schema-consistent temporal structure and arbitrary but learned temporal structure on the human posterior medial network. We tested whether, with repeated viewing, the network becomes engaged by scrambled movies with temporal structure. Replicating prior studies, posterior medial regions were immediately locked to stimulus structure upon exposure to intact but not scrambled movies. However, for temporally structured scrambled movies, functional coupling within the network increased across stimulus repetitions, rising to the level of intact movies. Thus, temporal structure is a key determinant of network dynamics and function.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Data-driven Assessment of Structural Image Quality [Revised]</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/125161v2?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/125161v2?rss=1</link>
	<description>Data quality is increasingly recognized as one of the most important confounding factors in brain imaging research. It is particularly important for studies of brain development, where age is systematically related to in-scanner motion and data quality. Prior work has demonstrated that in-scanner head motion biases estimates of structural neuroimaging measures. However, objective measures of data quality are not available for most structural brain images. Here we sought to identify quantitative measures of data quality for T1-weighted volumes, describe how such measures of quality relate to cortical thickness, and delineate how this in turn may bias inference regarding associations with age in youth. Three highly-trained raters provided manual ratings of 1,840 raw T1-weighted volumes. These images included a training set of 1,065 images from Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC), a test set of 533 images from the PNC, as well as an external test set of 242 adults acquired on a different scanner. Manual ratings were compared to automated quality measures provided by the Preprocessed Connectomes Project's Quality Assurance Protocol (QAP), as well as FreeSurfer's Euler number, which summarizes the topological complexity of the reconstructed cortical surface. Results revealed that the Euler number was consistently correlated with manual ratings across samples. Furthermore, the Euler number could be used to identify images scored &quot;unusable&quot; by human raters with a high degree of accuracy (AUC: 0.98-0.99), and out-performed proxy measures from functional timeseries acquired in the same scanning session. The Euler number also was significantly related to cortical thickness in a regionally heterogeneous pattern that was consistent across datasets and replicated prior results. Finally, data quality both inflated and obscured associations with age during adolescence. Taken together, these results indicate that reliable measures of data quality can be automatically derived from T1-weighted volumes, and that failing to control for data quality can systematically bias the results of studies of brain maturation.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Modulation of high frequency by low-frequency Oscillations in the basal ganglia</title>

	<description>Modulation of beta band oscillatory (15-30 Hz) by delta band oscillatory activity (1-3 Hz) in the cortico-basal ganglia loop is important for normal basal ganglia functions. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this modulation are poorly understood. To understand the mechanisms underlying such frequency modulations in the basal ganglia, we use large scale subthalamo-pallidal network model stimulated via a delta-frequency input signal. We show that inhibition of external Globus Pallidus (GPe) and excitation of the Subthalamic nucleus (STN) using the delta-band stimulation leads to the same delta-beta interactions in the network model as the experimental results observed in healthy basal ganglia. In addition, we show that pathological beta oscillations in the network model decorrelates the delta-beta link in the network model. In general, using our simulation results, we propose that striato-pallidal inhibition and cortico-subthalamic excitation are the potential sources of the delta-beta link observed in the intact basal ganglia.</description>

	<description>Decision making tasks in changing environments with probabilistic reward schemes present various challenges to the agents performing the task. These agents must use the experience gained in the past trials to characterize the environment which guides their actions. We present two models to predict an agent's behavior in these tasks -- a theoretical model which defines a Bayes optimal solution to the problem under realistic task conditions. The second is a computational model of the basal ganglia which presents a neural mechanism to solve the same. Both the models are shown to reproduce results in behavioral experiments and are compared to each other. This comparison allows us to characterize the theoretical model as a bound on the neural model and the neural model as a biologically plausible implementation of the theoretical model. Furthermore, we predict the performance of the agents in various stochastic regimes which could be tested in future studies.</description>

	<description>Phelan-McDermid syndrome (also known as 22q13 deletion syndrome) is a syndromic form of autism spectrum disorder and currently thought to be caused by heterozygous loss of SHANK3. However, patients most frequently present with large chromosomal deletions affecting several additional genes. We used human pluripotent stem cell technology and genome editing to further dissect molecular and cellular mechanisms. We found that loss of JIP2 (MAPK8IP2) may contribute to a distinct neurodevelopmental phenotype in neural progenitors (NPCs) affecting neuronal maturation. This is most likely due to simultaneous misregulation of JNK proteins, leading to impaired generation of mature neurons. Furthermore, semaphorin signaling is compromised in patient NPCs and neurons. Pharmacological stimulation of neuropilin receptor 1 (NRP1) rescued impaired semaphorin pathway activity and JNK expression in patient neurons. Our results suggest a novel disease-specific mechanism involving the JIP/JNK complex and identify NRP1 as potential therapeutic target.</description>

	<description>Bioelectronic Medicines that modulate the activity patterns on peripheral nerves have promise as a new way of treating diverse medical conditions from epilepsy to rheumatism. Progress in the field builds upon time consuming and expensive experiments in living organisms to evaluate spontaneous activity patterns, stimulation efficiency, and organ responses. To reduce experimentation load and allow for a faster, more detailed analysis of both recording from and stimulation of peripheral nerves, adaptable computational models incorporating insights won in experiments will be of great help. We present a peripheral nerve simulator that combines biophysical axon models and numerically solved and idealized extracellular space models in one environment. Two different scales of abstraction were merged. On the one hand we modeled the extracellular space in a finite element solver as a three dimensional resistive continuum governed by the electro-quasistatic approximation of the Maxwell equations. Potential distributions were precomputed for different media (homogeneous, nerve in saline, nerve in cuff). Axons, on the other hand, were modeled at a higher level of abstraction as one dimensional chains of compartments; each consisting of lumped linear elements and, for some, channels with non-linear dynamics. Unmyelinated fibres were based on the Hodgkin-Huxley model; for myelinated fibers, we instead adapted the model proposed by McIntyre et al. in 2002 to smaller diameters. To obtain realistic axon shapes, an iterative algorithm positioned fibers along the nerve with variable tortuosity, with tortuosity values fit to imaged trajectories. We validated our model with data from the stimulated rat vagus nerve. Simulation results predicted that tortuosity leads to differentiation in recorded signal shapes, with unmyelinated axons being the most affected. Tortuosity was further shown to increase the stimulation threshold. The model we developed can easily be adapted to different nerves, and may be of use for Bioelectronic Medicine research in the future.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Brief targeted memory reactivation during the awake state enhances memory stability and benefits the weakest memories</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/196436v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Reactivation of representations corresponding to recent experience is thought to be a critical mechanism supporting long-term memory stabilization. Targeted memory reactivation, or the re-exposure of recently learned cues, seeks to induce reactivation and has been shown to benefit later memory when it takes place during sleep. However, despite recent evidence for endogenous reactivation during post-encoding awake periods, less work has addressed whether awake targeted memory reactivation modulates memory. Here, we found that brief (50ms) visual stimulus re-exposure during a repetitive foil task enhanced the stability of cued versus uncued associations in memory. The extent of external or task-oriented attention prior to re-exposure was inversely related to cueing benefits, suggesting that an internally-orientated state may be most permissible to reactivation. Critically, cueing-related memory benefits were greatest in participants without explicit recognition of cued items and remained reliable when only considering associations not recognized as cued, suggesting that explicit cue-triggered retrieval processes did not drive cueing benefits. Cueing benefits were strongest for items and participants with the poorest initial learning. These findings expand our knowledge of the conditions under which targeted memory reactivation can benefit memory, and in doing so, support the notion that reactivation during awake time periods improves memory stabilization.</description>

	<description>Multi-photon laser scanning microscopy provides a powerful tool for monitoring the spatiotemporal dynamics of neural circuit activity. It is, however, intrinsically a point scanning technique. Standard raster scanning enables imaging at subcellular resolution; however, acquisition rates are limited by the size of the field of view to be scanned. Recently developed scanning strategies such as Travelling Salesman Scanning (TSS) have been developed to maximize cellular sampling rate by scanning only regions of interest in the field of view corresponding to locations of interest such as somata. However, such strategies are not optimized for the mechanical properties of galvanometric scanners. We describe here the Adaptive Spiral Scanning (SSA) algorithm, which fits a set of near-circular trajectories to the cellular distribution to avoid inertial drifts of galvanometer position. We compare its performance to raster scanning and TSS in terms of cellular sampling frequency and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Using surrogate neuron spatial position data, we show that SSA acquisition rates are an order of magnitude higher than those for raster scanning and generally exceed those achieved by TSS for neural densities comparable with those found in the cortex. We show that this result also holds true for in vitro hippocampal mouse brain slices bath loaded with the synthetic calcium dye Cal-520 AM. The ability of TSS to &quot;park&quot; the laser on each neuron along the scanning trajectory, however, enables higher SNR than SSA when all targets are precisely scanned. Raster scanning has the highest SNR but at a substantial cost in number of cells scanned. To understand the impact of sampling rate and SNR on functional calcium imaging, we used the Cramer-Rao Bound on evoked calcium traces recorded simultaneously with electrophysiology traces to calculate the lower bound estimate of the spike timing occurrence. The results show that TSS and SSA achieve comparable accuracy in spike time estimates compared to raster scanning despite their lower SNR. SSA is an easily implementable way for standard multi-photon laser scanning systems to gain temporal precision in the detection of action potentials while scanning hundreds of active cells.</description>

	<description>Mapping the spatiotemporal dynamics of brain atrophy in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) aids in discovering vulnerable brain networks. Various MRI-derived measures including hippocampal volume loss are commonly used as imaging biomarkers of AD progression. Multivariate methods such as independent component analysis (ICA) have recently shown promise in revealing more complex patterns of brain atrophy. Here, we aimed to extract a data-driven signature of brain atrophy in AD and its heralding risk factor, the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) state. Structural brain changes were quantified in 1,892 MRI scans from 1,100 participants of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) by Tensor-Based Morphometry (TBM). Brain morphometry maps of this population were fed into an ICA-based feature extraction algorithm which revealed that AD is associated with a characteristic signature of brain degeneration spanning several areas of the limbic system. The highest probability of brain atrophy in AD was localized to amygdalae (pICA z-score&amp;gt;22), followed by hippocampus (pICA z-score&amp;gt;14), and the mammillary bodies (pICA z-score&amp;gt;9) together with their white-matter connections including fimbrial and fornical tracts as a unified MRI endophenotype. This endophenotype performed better than the hippocampal volume measure in discriminating both AD and MCI subjects from the cognitively normal group, and we evaluated the potential for this feature set to serve as a disease-related endophenotype in a whole-genome association study. A protein-altering polymorphism in the synaptic scaffold gene, SHARPIN, affected loss of volume in this endophenotype among 8,852,807 whole-genome sequencing-based variants (rs34173062; p = 2.1x10-10). Other suggestive but subgenome-wide signals mapped to EPHA7 and FRMD4A, two known AD risk loci. In conclusion, by unsupervised decomposition of brain morphometry maps, we have provided a unified imaging endophenotype of AD that closely maps to the brain's memory center. Observation of bilateral amygdalae as the most vulnerable limbic structures spotlights impairment of emotional and memory processing integration in early AD.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Transcriptomic characterization of MRI contrast, focused on the T1-w/T2-w ratio in the cerebral cortex</title>

	<description>Magnetic resonance (MR) images of the brain are of immense clinical and research utility. At the atomic and subatomic levels, the sources of MR signals are well understood. However, at the macromolecular scale, we lack a comprehensive understanding of what determines MR signal contrast. To address this gap, we used genome-wide measurements to correlate gene expression with MR signal intensity across the cortex in the Allen Human Brain Atlas. We focused on the ratio of T1-weighted and T2-weighted intensities (T1-w/T2-w) which is considered to be a useful proxy for myelin content. Positive correlations between myelin-associated genes and the ratio supported its use as a myelin marker. However, stronger correlations were observed for neurofilaments, and genes linked to the production of formaldehyde (which cross-links protein to create larger molecules). There was also an association with protein mass, with genes coding for heavier proteins expressed in regions with high T1-w/T2-w values. Oligodendrocyte gene markers were strongly correlated but this was not driven by myelin-associated genes, suggesting this signal is from non-myelinating satellite oligodendrocytes. We find the strongest support for the previous finding of high aerobic glycolysis in regions with low T1-w/T2-w ratio. Specifically, many mitochondrial genes were negatively correlated with T1-w/T2-w ratio. Genes up-regulated by pH in the brain were also highly correlated with the ratio, suggesting the pH gradient in mitochondria may explain the aerobic glycolysis association. Expression of protease subunit genes was also inversely associated with the ratio, in agreement with the protein mass correlation. While we corroborate associations with myelin and synaptic plasticity, differences in the T1-w/T2-w ratio appear to be more attributable to molecule size, satellite oligodendrocyte proportion, mitochondrial number, alkalinity, and axon caliber. Using disease-associated gene lists, we observed an enrichment of negative T1-w/T2-w ratio correlations with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) associated genes. Expanding our analysis to the whole brain results in strong positive T1-w/T2-w associations for immune system, inflammatory disease, and microglial genes. In contrast, neuron markers and synaptic plasticity genes are negatively enriched. Lastly, our results vary little when our analysis is performed on T1-w or inverted T2-w intensities alone, possibly because the noise reduction properties of the ratio are not needed for postmortem brain scans. These results provide a molecular characterization of MR contrast that will aid interpretation of future MR studies of the brain.</description>

	<description>Mnemonic decision-making has long been hypothesized to rely on hippocampal dynamics that bias memory processing toward the formation of new memories or the retrieval of old ones. Successful memory encoding would be best optimized by pattern separation, whereby two highly similar experiences can be represented by underlying neural populations in an orthogonal manner. By contrast, successful memory retrieval is thought to be supported by a recovery of the same neural pattern laid down during encoding. Here we examined how hippocampal pattern completion and separation emerge over time during memory decisions. We measured electrocorticography activity in the human hippocampus and posterior occipitotemporal cortex (OTC) while participants performed continuous recognition of items that were new, repeated (old), or highly similar to a prior item (similar). During retrieval decisions of old items, both regions exhibited significant reinstatement of multivariate high frequency activity (HFA) associated with encoding. Further, the extent of reinstatement of encoding patterns during retrieval was correlated both with the strength (HFA power) of hippocampal encoding and with the strength of hippocampal retrieval. Evidence for encoding pattern reinstatement was also seen in OTC on trials requiring fine-grained discrimination of similar items. By contrast, hippocampal activity showed evidence for pattern separation during these trials. Together, these results underscore the critical role of the hippocampus in supporting both reinstatement of overlapping information and separation of similar events.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Features of spatial and functional segregation and integration of the primate connectome revealed by trade-off between wiring cost and efficiency</title>

The primate connectome, possessing a characteristic global topology and specific regional connectivity profiles, is well organized to support both segregated and integrated brain function. However, the organization mechanisms shaping the characteristic connectivity and its relationship to functional requirements remain unclear. The primate brain connectome is shaped by metabolic economy as well as functional values. Here, we explored the influence of two competing factors and additional advanced functional requirements on the primate connectome employing an optimal trade-off model between neural wiring cost and the representative functional requirement of processing efficiency. Moreover, we compared this model with a generative model combining spatial distance and topological similarity, with the objective of statistically reproducing multiple topological features of the network. The primate connectome indeed displays a cost-efficiency trade-off and that up to 67% of the connections were recovered by optimal combination of the two basic factors of wiring economy and processing efficiency, clearly higher than the proportion of connections (56%) explained by the generative model. While not explicitly aimed for, the trade-off model captured several key topological features of the real connectome as the generative model, yet better explained the connectivity of most regions. The majority of the remaining 33% of connections unexplained by the best trade-off model were long-distance links, which are concentrated on few cortical areas, termed long-distance connectors (LDCs). The LDCs are mainly non-hubs, but form a densely connected group overlapping on spatially segregated functional modalities. LDCs are crucial for both functional segregation and integration across different scales. These organization features revealed by the optimization analysis provide evidence that the demands of advanced functional segregation and integration among spatially distributed regions may play a significant role in shaping the cortical connectome, in addition to the basic cost-efficiency trade-off. These findings also shed light on inherent vulnerabilities of brain networks in diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oMv2ZR6W4S8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Multi-layer network utilizing rewarded spike time dependent plasticity to learn a foraging task</title>

Neural networks with a single plastic layer employing reward modulated spike time dependent plasticity (STDP) are capable of learning simple foraging tasks. Here we demonstrate advanced pattern discrimination and continuous learning in a network of spiking neurons with multiple plastic layers. The network utilized both reward modulated and non-reward modulated STDP and implemented multiple mechanisms for homeostatic regulation of synaptic efficacy, including heterosynaptic plasticity, gain control, output balancing, activity normalization of rewarded STDP and hard limits on synaptic strength. We found that addition of a hidden layer of neurons employing non-rewarded STDP created neurons that responded to the specific combinations of inputs and thus performed basic classification of the input patterns. When combined with a following layer of neurons implementing rewarded STDP, the network was able to learn, despite the absence of labeled training data, discrimination between rewarding patterns and the patterns designated as punishing. Synaptic noise allowed for trial-and-error learning that helped to identify the goal-oriented strategies which were effective in task solving. The study predicts a critical set of properties of the spiking neuronal network with STDP that was sufficient to solve a complex foraging task involving pattern classification and decision making.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2JhsvzSD8Y4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Effective learning is accompanied by increasingly efficient dimensionality of whole-brain responses. (arXiv:1709.10045v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Theories and tools to measure the efficiency of neural codes have been
important in understanding neural responses to external stimuli. However,
similar principles to describe the efficiency of brain responses to tasks
demanding higher-order cognitive processes remain underdeveloped. A key domain
to study such efficiency is learning, where patterns of activity across the
entire brain provide insight into the principles governing the acquisition of
knowledge about objects or concepts. We propose a mathematical framework for
studying the efficiency of spatially embedded whole-brain states reflected in
functional MRI, and demonstrate its utility in describing how human subjects
learn the values of novel objects. We find that quick learners develop both
higher dimensional and more compact responses to stimuli than slow learners,
suggesting a greater efficiency in embedding rich patterns of information.
Using a virtual lesioning approach, we identify which regions form the
strongest neurophysiological drivers of these differences in learning rate. We
complement our region-based approach with a voxel-level approach to uncover
structure in finer-scale responses, providing evidence that higher dimensional
responses also characterize patterns of activation within regions known to
process and represent objects and their values. Finally, for a full
investigation of complementary geometric approaches, we verify that quick
learners develop more assortative responses to stimuli: that is, whole-brain
responses that are more easily distinguishable from one another. Our work
offers a suite of geometric measures to represent a notion of efficient coding
for higher-order cognitive processes, and provide insight into the
dimensionality of neural responses characteristic of the successful
optimization of reward, that are applicable to the study of cognitive
performance more broadly.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We designed a grid world task to study human planning and re-planning
behavior in an unknown stochastic environment. In our grid world, participants
were asked to travel from a random starting point to a random goal position
while maximizing their reward. Because they were not familiar with the
environment, they needed to learn its characteristics from experience to plan
optimally. Later in the task, we randomly blocked the optimal path to
investigate whether and how people adjust their original plans to find a
detour. To this end, we developed and compared 12 different models. These
models were different on how they learned and represented the environment and
how they planned to catch the goal. The majority of our participants were able
to plan optimally. We also showed that people were capable of revising their
plans when an unexpected event occurred. The result from the model comparison
showed that the model-based reinforcement learning approach provided the best
account for the data and outperformed heuristics in explaining the behavioral
data in the re-planning trials.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Synaptic noise induces intermittent oscillatory-quiescent state transitions in a spiking network model. (arXiv:1709.09748v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spontaneous cortical population activity is often described as synchronous
during slow-wave sleep and under certain anesthetics, and asynchronous during
quiet wakefulness. The underlying mechanisms that control transitions between
these cortical states are not completely known. To study the effect of synaptic
noise on these transitions, we use a cortical network model with mixed neuronal
types, governed by deterministic equations, and introduce noise into the
dynamics of synaptic variables. In absence of noise, the network is known to
display spontaneous collective oscillations which resemble alternating up and
down states observed in synchronous cortical states. Records of noise-affected
activity in the network feature alternation of collective oscillations and
quiescent states, with irregular transitions between them. Systematic analysis
of firing rates, power spectra and voltage series shows that characteristics of
these two states are similar to those of synchronous and asynchronous cortical
states: in the synchronous-like state neurons display collective oscillatory
activity and their membrane voltages fluctuate between hyperpolarized (down)
and depolarized (up) states; in the asynchronous-like state neurons are weakly
correlated and display very low spiking activity with no collective dynamics.
By varying noise intensity and using mean duration at each state as a
prevalence criterion, we observe that noise facilitates transitions from the
asynchronous to the synchronous-like state and hinders the reverse transitions.
Our results suggest that synaptic noise may be an important mechanism
underlying transitions between asynchronous and rhythmic states in cortical
networks.

	<description>Over the past few years our understanding of estrogen signaling in the brain has expanded rapidly. Estrogens are synthesized in the periphery and in the brain, acting on multiple receptors to regulate gene transcription, neural function, and behavior. Various estrogen-sensitive signaling pathways often operate in concert within the same cell, increasing the complexity of the system. In females, estrogen concentrations fluctuate over the estrous/menstrual cycle, dynamically modulating estrogen receptor (ER) expression, activity, and trafficking.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A metabolic core model elucidates how enhanced utilization of glucose and glutamine, with enhanced glutamine-dependent lactate production, promotes cancer cell growth: The WarburQ effect</title>

Cancer cells share several metabolic traits, including aerobic production of lactate from glucose (Warburg effect), extensive glutamine utilization and impaired mitochondrial electron flow. It is still unclear how these metabolic rearrangements, which may involve different molecular events in different cells, contribute to a selective advantage for cancer cell proliferation. To ascertain which metabolic pathways are used to convert glucose and glutamine to balanced energy and biomass production, we performed systematic constraint-based simulations of a model of human central metabolism. Sampling of the feasible flux space allowed us to obtain a large number of randomly mutated cells simulated at different glutamine and glucose uptake rates. We observed that, in the limited subset of proliferating cells, most displayed fermentation of glucose to lactate in the presence of oxygen. At high utilization rates of glutamine, oxidative utilization of glucose was decreased, while the production of lactate from glutamine was enhanced. This emergent phenotype was observed only when the available carbon exceeded the amount that could be fully oxidized by the available oxygen. Under the latter conditions, standard Flux Balance Analysis indicated that: this metabolic pattern is optimal to maximize biomass and ATP production; it requires the activity of a branched TCA cycle, in which glutamine-dependent reductive carboxylation cooperates to the production of lipids and proteins; it is sustained by a variety of redox-controlled metabolic reactions. In a &lt;i&gt;K-ras&lt;/i&gt; transformed cell line we experimentally assessed glutamine-induced metabolic changes. We validated computational results through an extension of Flux Balance Analysis that allows prediction of metabolite variations. Taken together these findings offer new understanding of the logic of the metabolic reprogramming that underlies cancer cell growth.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JgTHxYjvtss&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Flexibility to contingency changes distinguishes habitual and goal-directed strategies in humans</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Julie J. Lee, Mehdi Keramati&lt;/p&gt;

Decision-making in the real world presents the challenge of requiring flexible yet prompt behavior, a balance that has been characterized in terms of a trade-off between a slower, prospective goal-directed model-based (MB) strategy and a fast, retrospective habitual model-free (MF) strategy. Theory predicts that flexibility to changes in both reward values and transition contingencies can determine the relative influence of the two systems in reinforcement learning, but few studies have manipulated the latter. Therefore, we developed a novel two-level contingency change task in which transition contingencies between states change every few trials; MB and MF control predict different responses following these contingency changes, allowing their relative influence to be inferred. Additionally, we manipulated the rate of contingency changes in order to determine whether contingency change volatility would play a role in shifting subjects between a MB and MF strategy. We found that human subjects employed a hybrid MB/MF strategy on the task, corroborating the parallel contribution of MB and MF systems in reinforcement learning. Further, subjects did not remain at one level of MB/MF behaviour but rather displayed a shift towards more MB behavior over the first two blocks that was not attributable to the rate of contingency changes but rather to the extent of training. We demonstrate that flexibility to contingency changes can distinguish MB and MF strategies, with human subjects utilizing a hybrid strategy that shifts towards more MB behavior over blocks, consequently corresponding to a higher payoff.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/208K789yh_A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

A deterministic population dynamics model involving birth and death for a two-species system, comprising a wild-type and more resistant species competing via logistic growth, is subjected to two distinct stress environments designed to mimic those that would typically be induced by temporal variation in the concentration of a drug (antibiotic or chemotherapeutic) as it permeates through the population and is progressively degraded. Different treatment regimes, involving single or periodical doses, are evaluated in terms of the minimal population size (a measure of the extinction probability), and the population composition (a measure of the selection pressure for resistance or tolerance during the treatment). We show that there exist timescales over which the low-stress regime is as effective as the high-stress regime, due to the competition between the two species. For multiple periodic treatments, competition can ensure that the minimal population size is attained during the first pulse when the high-stress regime is short, which implies that a single short pulse can be more effective than a more protracted regime. Our results suggest that when the duration of the high-stress environment is restricted, a treatment with one or multiple shorter pulses can produce better outcomes than a single long treatment. If ecological competition is to be exploited for treatments, it is crucial to determine these timescales, and estimate for the minimal population threshold that suffices for extinction. These parameters can be quantified by experiment.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LOJeo276zlc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A composite network of conserved and tissue specific gene interactions reveals possible genetic interactions in glioma</title>

Differential co-expression network analyses have recently become an important step in the investigation of cellular differentiation and dysfunctional gene-regulation in cell and tissue disease-states. The resulting networks have been analyzed to identify and understand pathways associated with disorders, or to infer molecular interactions. However, existing methods for differential co-expression network analysis are unable to distinguish between various forms of differential co-expression. To close this gap, here we define the three different kinds (conserved, specific, and differentiated) of differential co-expression and present a systematic framework, CSD, for differential co-expression network analysis that incorporates these interactions on an equal footing. In addition, our method includes a subsampling strategy to estimate the variance of co-expressions. Our framework is applicable to a wide variety of cases, such as the study of differential co-expression networks between healthy and disease states, before and after treatments, or between species. Applying the CSD approach to a published gene-expression data set of cerebral cortex and basal ganglia samples from healthy individuals, we find that the resulting CSD network is enriched in genes associated with cognitive function, signaling pathways involving compounds with well-known roles in the central nervous system, as well as certain neurological diseases. From the CSD analysis, we identify a set of prominent hubs of differential co-expression, whose neighborhood contains a substantial number of genes associated with glioblastoma. The resulting gene-sets identified by our CSD analysis also contain many genes that so far have not been recognized as having a role in glioblastoma, but are good candidates for further studies. CSD may thus aid in hypothesis-generation for functional disease-associations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/t0kho5rTTkQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Although systemic immunity is critical to the process of tumor rejection, cancer research has largely focused on immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. To understand molecular changes in the patient systemic response (SR) to the presence of BC, we profiled RNA in blood and matched tumor from 173 patients. We designed a system (MIxT, Matched Interactions Across Tissues) to systematically explore and link molecular processes expressed in each tissue. MIxT confirmed that processes active in the patient SR are especially relevant to BC immunogenicity. The nature of interactions across tissues (i.e. which biological processes are associated and their patterns of expression) varies highly with tumor subtype. For example, aspects of the immune SR are underexpressed proportionally to the level of expression of defined molecular processes specific to basal tumors. The catalog of subtype-specific interactions across tissues from BC patients provides promising new ways to tackle or monitor the disease by exploiting the patient SR.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ce-AuoGNX2E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We explore the main characteristics of big brain network data that offer
unique statistical challenges. The brain networks are biologically expected to
be both sparse and hierarchical. Such unique characterizations put specific
topological constraints onto statistical approaches and models we can use
effectively. We explore the limitations of the current models used in the field
and offer alternative approaches and explains new challenges.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Fitting of dynamic recurrent neural network models to sensory stimulus-response data. (arXiv:1709.09541v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.09541</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.09541</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We present a theoretical study aiming at model fitting for sensory neurons.
Conventional neural network training approaches are not applicable to this
problem due to lack of continuous data. Although the stimulus can be considered
as a smooth time dependent variable, the associated response will be a set of
neural spike timings (roughly the instants of successive action potential
peaks) which have no amplitude information. A recurrent neural network model
can be fitted to such a stimulus-response data pair by using maximum likelihood
estimation method where the likelihood function is derived from Poisson
statistics of neural spiking. The universal approximation feature of the
recurrent dynamical neuron network models allow us to describe
excitatory-inhibitory characteristics of an actual sensory neural network with
any desired number of neurons. The stimulus data is generated by a Phased
Cosine Fourier series having fixed amplitude and frequency but a randomly shot
phase. Various values of amplitude, stimulus component size and sample size are
applied in order to examine the effect of stimulus to the identification
process. Results are presented in tabular form at the end of this text.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A Simple Model of Attentional Blink. (arXiv:1611.08913v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08913</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08913</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The attentional blink (AB) effect is the reduced ability of subjects to
report a second target stimuli (T2) among a rapidly presented series of
non-target stimuli, when it appears within a time window of about 200-500 ms
after a first target (T1). We present a simple dynamical systems model
explaining the AB as resulting from the temporal response dynamics of a
stochastic, linear system with threshold, whose output represents the amount of
attentional resources allocated to the incoming sensory stimuli. The model
postulates that the available attention capacity is limited by activity of the
default mode network (DMN), a correlated set of brain regions related to task
irrelevant processing which is known to exhibit reduced activation following
mental training such as mindfulness meditation. The model provides a
parsimonious account relating key findings from the AB, DMN and meditation
research literature, and suggests some new testable predictions.

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Hypothalamic Tuberomammillary Nucleus Neurons: Electrophysiological Diversity and Essential Role in Arousal Stability</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/39/9574?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Histaminergic (HA) neurons, found in the posterior hypothalamic tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN), extend fibers throughout the brain and exert modulatory influence over numerous physiological systems. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the activity of HA neurons is important in the regulation of vigilance despite the lack of direct, causal evidence demonstrating its requirement for the maintenance of arousal during wakefulness. Given the strong correlation between HA neuron excitability and behavioral arousal, we investigated both the electrophysiological diversity of HA neurons in brain slices and the effect of their acute silencing &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in male mice. For this purpose, we first validated a transgenic mouse line expressing cre recombinase in histidine decarboxylase-expressing neurons (&lt;i&gt;Hdc&lt;/i&gt;-Cre) followed by a systematic census of the membrane properties of both HA and non-HA neurons in the ventral TMN (TMNv) region. Through unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis, we found electrophysiological diversity both between TMNv HA and non-HA neurons, and among HA neurons. To directly determine the impact of acute cessation of HA neuron activity on sleep–wake states in awake and behaving mice, we examined the effects of optogenetic silencing of TMNv HA neurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. We found that acute silencing of HA neurons during wakefulness promotes slow-wave sleep, but not rapid eye movement sleep, during a period of low sleep pressure. Together, these data suggest that the tonic firing of HA neurons is necessary for the maintenance of wakefulness, and their silencing not only impairs arousal but is sufficient to rapidly and selectively induce slow-wave sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The function of monoaminergic systems and circuits that regulate sleep and wakefulness is often disrupted as part of the pathophysiology of many neuropsychiatric disorders. One such circuit is the posterior hypothalamic histamine (HA) system, implicated in supporting wakefulness and higher brain function, but has been difficult to selectively manipulate owing to cellular heterogeneity in this region. Here we use a transgenic mouse to interrogate both the characteristic firing properties of HA neurons and their specific role in maintaining wakefulness. Our results demonstrate that the acute, cell type-specific silencing of HA neurons during wakefulness is sufficient to not only impair arousal but to rapidly and selectively induce slow-wave sleep. This work furthers our understanding of HA-mediated mechanisms that regulate behavioral arousal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;To investigate how hearing status, sign language experience, and task demands influence functional responses in the human superior temporal cortices (STC) we collected fMRI data from deaf and hearing participants (male and female), who either acquired sign language early or late in life. Our stimuli in all tasks were pictures of objects. We varied the linguistic and visuospatial processing demands in three different tasks that involved decisions about (1) the sublexical (phonological) structure of the British Sign Language (BSL) signs for the objects, (2) the semantic category of the objects, and (3) the physical features of the objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging data revealed that in participants who were deaf from birth, STC showed increased activation during visual processing tasks. Importantly, this differed across hemispheres. Right STC was consistently activated regardless of the task whereas left STC was sensitive to task demands. Significant activation was detected in the left STC only for the BSL phonological task. This task, we argue, placed greater demands on visuospatial processing than the other two tasks. In hearing signers, enhanced activation was absent in both left and right STC during all three tasks. Lateralization analyses demonstrated that the effect of deafness was more task-dependent in the left than the right STC whereas it was more task-independent in the right than the left STC. These findings indicate how the absence of auditory input from birth leads to dissociable and altered functions of left and right STC in deaf participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Those born deaf can offer unique insights into neuroplasticity, in particular in regions of superior temporal cortex (STC) that primarily respond to auditory input in hearing people. Here we demonstrate that in those deaf from birth the left and the right STC have altered and dissociable functions. The right STC was activated regardless of demands on visual processing. In contrast, the left STC was sensitive to the demands of visuospatial processing. Furthermore, hearing signers, with the same sign language experience as the deaf participants, did not activate the STCs. Our data advance current understanding of neural plasticity by determining the differential effects that hearing status and task demands can have on left and right STC function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Mutant Huntingtin Inhibits {alpha}B-Crystallin Expression and Impairs Exosome Secretion from Astrocytes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/39/9550?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the brain, astrocytes secrete diverse substances that regulate neuronal function and viability. Exosomes, which are vesicles produced through the formation of multivesicular bodies and their subsequent fusion with the plasma membrane, are also released from astrocytes via exocytotic secretion. Astrocytic exosomes carry heat shock proteins that can reduce the cellular toxicity of misfolded proteins and prevent neurodegeneration. Although mutant huntingtin (mHtt) affects multiple functions of astrocytes, it remains unknown whether mHtt impairs the production of exosomes from astrocytes. We found that mHtt is not present in astrocytic exosomes, but can decrease exosome secretion from astrocytes in HD140Q knock-in (KI) mice. N-terminal mHtt accumulates in the nuclei and forms aggregates, causing decreased secretion of exosomes from cultured astrocytes. Consistently, there is a significant decrease in secreted exosomes in both female and male HD KI mouse striatum in which abundant nuclear mHtt aggregates are present. Conversely, injection of astrocytic exosomes into the striatum of HD140Q KI mice reduces the density of mHtt aggregates. Further, mHtt in astrocytes decreased the expression of αB-crystallin, a small heat shock protein that is enriched in astrocytes and mediates exosome secretion, by reducing the association of Sp1 with the enhancer of the α&lt;i&gt;B-crystallin&lt;/i&gt; gene. Importantly, overexpression of αB-crystallin rescues defective exosome release from HD astrocytes as well as mHtt aggregates in the striatum of HD140Q KI mice. Our results demonstrate that mHtt reduces the expression of αB-crystallin in astrocytes to decrease exosome secretion in the HD brains, contributing to non–cell-autonomous neurotoxicity in HD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Huntington's disease (HD) is characterized by selective neurodegeneration that preferentially occurs in the striatal medium spiny neurons. Recent studies in different HD mouse models demonstrated that dysfunction of astrocytes, a major type of glial cell, leads to neuronal vulnerability. Emerging evidence shows that exosomes secreted from astrocytes contain neuroprotective cargoes that could support the survival of neighboring neurons. We found that mHtt in astrocytes impairs exosome secretion by decreasing αB-crystallin, a protein that is expressed mainly in glial cells and mediates exosome secretion. Overexpression of αB-crystallin could alleviate the deficient exosome release and neuropathology in HD mice. Our results revealed a new pathological pathway that affects the critical support of glial cells to neurons in the HD brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Glycinergic Input to the Mouse Basal Forebrain Cholinergic Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/39/9534?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/39/9534?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The basal forebrain (BF) receives afferents from brainstem ascending pathways, which has been implicated first by Moruzzi and Magoun (1949) to induce forebrain activation and cortical arousal/waking behavior; however, it is very little known about how brainstem inhibitory inputs affect cholinergic functions. In the current study, glycine, a major inhibitory neurotransmitter of brainstem neurons, and gliotransmitter of local glial cells, was tested for potential interaction with BF cholinergic (BFC) neurons in male mice. In the BF, glycine receptor α subunit-immunoreactive (IR) sites were localized in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-IR neurons. The effect of glycine on BFC neurons was demonstrated by bicuculline-resistant, strychnine-sensitive spontaneous IPSCs (sIPSCs; 0.81 ± 0.25 &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; Hz) recorded in whole-cell conditions. Potential neuronal as well as glial sources of glycine were indicated in the extracellular space of cholinergic neurons by glycine transporter type 1 (GLYT1)- and GLYT2-IR processes found in apposition to ChAT-IR cells. Ultrastructural analyses identified synapses of GLYT2-positive axon terminals on ChAT-IR neurons, as well as GLYT1-positive astroglial processes, which were localized in the vicinity of synapses of ChAT-IR neurons. The brainstem raphe magnus was determined to be a major source of glycinergic axons traced retrogradely from the BF. Our results indicate a direct effect of glycine on BFC neurons. Furthermore, the presence of high levels of plasma membrane glycine transporters in the vicinity of cholinergic neurons suggests a tight control of extracellular glycine in the BF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Basal forebrain cholinergic (BFC) neurons receive various activating inputs from specific brainstem areas and channel this information to the cortex via multiple projections. So far, very little is known about inhibitory brainstem afferents to the BF. The current study established glycine as a major regulator of BFC neurons by (1) identifying glycinergic neurons in the brainstem projecting to the BF, (2) showing glycine receptor α subunit-immunoreactive (IR) sites in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-IR neurons, (3) demonstrating glycine transporter type 2 (GLYT2)-positive axon terminals synapsing on ChAT-IR neurons, and (4) localizing GLYT1-positive astroglial processes in the vicinity of synapses of ChAT-IR neurons. The effect of glycine on BFC neurons was demonstrated by bicuculline-resistant, strychnine-sensitive spontaneous IPSCs recorded in whole-cell conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sodium Channel {beta}2 Subunits Prevent Action Potential Propagation Failures at Axonal Branch Points</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/39/9519?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurotransmitter release depends on voltage-gated Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels (Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;s) to propagate an action potential (AP) successfully from the axon hillock to a synaptic terminal. Unmyelinated sections of axon are very diverse structures encompassing branch points and numerous presynaptic terminals with undefined molecular partners of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. Using optical recordings of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and membrane voltage, we demonstrate here that Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel β2 subunits (Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;β2s) are required to prevent AP propagation failures across the axonal arborization of cultured rat hippocampal neurons (mixed male and female). When Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;β2 expression was reduced, we identified two specific phenotypes: (1) membrane excitability and AP-evoked Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry were impaired at synapses and (2) AP propagation was severely compromised with &amp;gt;40% of axonal branches no longer responding to AP-stimulation. We went on to show that a great deal of electrical signaling heterogeneity exists in AP waveforms across the axonal arborization independent of axon morphology. Therefore, Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;β2 is a critical regulator of axonal excitability and synaptic function in unmyelinated axons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels are fulcrums of neurotransmission that convert electrical inputs into chemical outputs in the form of vesicle fusion at synaptic terminals. However, the role of the electrical signal, the presynaptic action potential (AP), in modulating synaptic transmission is less clear. What is the fidelity of a propagating AP waveform in the axon and what molecules shape it throughout the axonal arborization? Our work identifies several new features of AP propagation in unmyelinated axons: (1) branches of a single axonal arborization have variable AP waveforms independent of morphology, (2) Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel β2 subunits modulate AP-evoked Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-influx, and (3) β2 subunits maintain successful AP propagation across the axonal arbor. These findings are relevant to understanding the flow of excitation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Human Amygdala Tracks a Feature-Based Valence Signal Embedded within the Facial Expression of Surprise</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/39/9510?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/39/9510?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human amygdala function has been traditionally associated with processing the affective valence (negative vs positive) of an emotionally charged event, especially those that signal fear or threat. However, this account of human amygdala function can be explained by alternative views, which posit that the amygdala might be tuned to either (1) general emotional arousal (activation vs deactivation) or (2) specific emotion categories (fear vs happy). Delineating the pure effects of valence independent of arousal or emotion category is a challenging task, given that these variables naturally covary under many circumstances. To circumvent this issue and test the sensitivity of the human amygdala to valence values specifically, we measured the dimension of valence within the single facial expression category of surprise. Given the inherent valence ambiguity of this category, we show that surprised expression exemplars are attributed valence and arousal values that are uniquely and naturally uncorrelated. We then present fMRI data from both sexes, showing that the amygdala tracks these consensus valence values. Finally, we provide evidence that these valence values are linked to specific visual features of the mouth region, isolating the signal by which the amygdala detects this valence information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; There is an open question as to whether human amygdala function tracks the valence value of cues in the environment, as opposed to either a more general emotional arousal value or a more specific emotion category distinction. Here, we demonstrate the utility of surprised facial expressions because exemplars within this emotion category take on valence values spanning the dimension of bipolar valence (positive to negative) at a consistent level of emotional arousal. Functional neuroimaging data showed that amygdala responses tracked the valence of surprised facial expressions, unconfounded by arousal. Furthermore, a machine learning classifier identified particular visual features of the mouth region that predicted this valence effect, isolating the specific visual signal that might be driving this neural valence response.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Spatiochromatic Interactions between Individual Cone Photoreceptors in the Human Retina</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/39/9498?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/39/9498?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A remarkable feature of human vision is that the retina and brain have evolved circuitry to extract useful spatial and spectral information from signals originating in a photoreceptor mosaic with trichromatic constituents that vary widely in their relative numbers and local spatial configurations. A critical early transformation applied to cone signals is horizontal-cell-mediated lateral inhibition, which imparts a spatially antagonistic surround to individual cone receptive fields, a signature inherited by downstream neurons and implicated in color signaling. In the peripheral retina, the functional connectivity of cone inputs to the circuitry that mediates lateral inhibition is not cone-type specific, but whether these wiring schemes are maintained closer to the fovea remains unsettled, in part because central retinal anatomy is not easily amenable to direct physiological assessment. Here, we demonstrate how the precise topography of the long (L)-, middle (M)-, and short (S)-wavelength-sensitive cones in the human parafovea (1.5° eccentricity) shapes perceptual sensitivity. We used adaptive optics microstimulation to measure psychophysical detection thresholds from individual cones with spectral types that had been classified independently by absorptance imaging. Measured against chromatic adapting backgrounds, the sensitivities of L and M cones were, on average, receptor-type specific, but individual cone thresholds varied systematically with the number of preferentially activated cones in the immediate neighborhood. The spatial and spectral patterns of these interactions suggest that interneurons mediating lateral inhibition in the central retina, likely horizontal cells, establish functional connections with L and M cones indiscriminately, implying that the cone-selective circuitry supporting red–green color vision emerges after the first retinal synapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We present evidence for spatially antagonistic interactions between individual, spectrally typed cones in the central retina of human observers using adaptive optics. Using chromatic adapting fields to modulate the relative steady-state activity of long (L)- and middle (M)-wavelength-sensitive cones, we found that single-cone detection thresholds varied predictably with the spectral demographics of the surrounding cones. The spatial scale and spectral pattern of these photoreceptor interactions were consistent with lateral inhibition mediated by retinal horizontal cells that receive nonselective input from L and M cones. These results demonstrate a clear link between the neural architecture of the visual system inputs—cone photoreceptors—and visual perception and have implications for the neural locus of the cone-specific circuitry supporting color vision.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Restoration of Motor Defects Caused by Loss of Drosophila TDP-43 by Expression of the Voltage-Gated Calcium Channel, Cacophony, in Central Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/39/9486?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/39/9486?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Defects in the RNA-binding protein, TDP-43, are known to cause a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar dementia. A variety of experimental systems have shown that neurons are sensitive to TDP-43 expression levels, yet the specific functional defects resulting from TDP-43 dysregulation have not been well described. Using the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; TDP-43 ortholog TBPH, we previously showed that TBPH-null animals display locomotion defects as third instar larvae. Furthermore, loss of TBPH caused a reduction in &lt;i&gt;cacophony&lt;/i&gt;, a Type II voltage-gated calcium channel, expression and that genetically restoring &lt;i&gt;cacophony&lt;/i&gt; in motor neurons in TBPH mutant animals was sufficient to rescue the locomotion defects. In the present study, we examined the relative contributions of neuromuscular junction physiology and the motor program to the locomotion defects and identified subsets of neurons that require &lt;i&gt;cacophony&lt;/i&gt; expression to rescue the defects. At the neuromuscular junction, we showed mEPP amplitudes and frequency require TBPH. &lt;i&gt;Cacophony&lt;/i&gt; expression in motor neurons rescued mEPP frequency but not mEPP amplitude. We also showed that TBPH mutants displayed reduced motor neuron bursting and coordination during crawling and restoring &lt;i&gt;cacophony&lt;/i&gt; selectively in two pairs of cells located in the brain, the AVM001b/2b neurons, also rescued the locomotion and motor defects, but not the defects in neuromuscular junction physiology. These results suggest that the behavioral defects associated with loss of TBPH throughout the nervous system can be associated with defects in a small number of genes in a limited number of central neurons, rather than peripheral defects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; TDP-43 dysfunction is a common feature in neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal lobar dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. Loss- and gain-of-function models have shown that neurons are sensitive to TDP-43 expression levels, but the specific defects caused by TDP-43 loss of function have not been described in detail. A &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; loss-of-function model displays pronounced locomotion defects that can be reversed by restoring the expression levels of a voltage-gated calcium channel, &lt;i&gt;cacophony.&lt;/i&gt; We show these defects can be rescued by expression of &lt;i&gt;cacophony&lt;/i&gt; in motor neurons and by expression in two pairs of neurons in the brain. These data suggest that loss of TDP-43 can disrupt the central circuitry of the CNS, opening up identification of alternative therapeutic targets for TDP-43 proteinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Angular Gyrus Involvement at Encoding and Retrieval Is Associated with Durable But Less Specific Memories</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/39/9474?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;After consolidation, information belonging to a mental schema is better remembered, but such memory can be less specific when it comes to details. A neuronal mechanism consistent with this behavioral pattern could result from a dynamic interaction that entails mediation by a specific cortical network with associated hippocampal disengagement. We now report that, in male and female adult human subjects, encoding and later consolidation of a series of objects embedded in a semantic schema was associated with a buildup of activity in the angular gyrus (AG) that predicted memory 24 h later. In parallel, the posterior hippocampus became less involved as schema objects were encoded successively. Hippocampal disengagement was related to an increase in falsely remembering objects that were not presented at encoding. During both encoding and retrieval, the AG and lateral occipital complex (LOC) became functionally connected and this interaction was beneficial for successful retrieval. Therefore, a network including the AG and LOC enhances the overnight retention of schema-related memories and their simultaneous detachment from the hippocampus reduces the specificity of the memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study provides the first empirical evidence on how the hippocampus and the neocortex interact dynamically when acquiring and then effectively retaining durable knowledge that is associated to preexisting knowledge, but they do so at the cost of memory specificity. This interaction is a fundamental mnemonic operation that has thus far been largely overlooked in memory research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Odorant Receptor Sensitivity Modulation in Drosophila</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to modulate sensitivity in sensory systems is essential for useful information to be extracted from fluctuating stimuli in a wide range of background conditions. The mechanisms underlying sensitivity regulation in insect primary olfactory neurons are poorly understood. Here we reveal that dephosphorylation of Orco&lt;sup&gt;S289&lt;/sup&gt; that occurs upon prolonged odor exposure is a mechanism underlying reduction in odorant sensitivity in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; primary olfactory neurons in both sexes. &lt;i&gt;Orco&lt;sup&gt;S289A&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mutants, unable to phosphorylate this position, have low intrinsic odorant sensitivity that is independent of altered expression or localization. A phosphomimetic allele, &lt;i&gt;Orco&lt;sup&gt;S289D&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, has enhanced odorant sensitivity compared with wild-type controls. To explore the functional ramifications of this phosphorylation &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, we generated phospho-specific antiserum to Orco&lt;sup&gt;S289&lt;/sup&gt; and show that phosphorylation at this residue is dynamically regulated by odorant exposure with concomitant modulation of odorant sensitivity. Orco&lt;sup&gt;S289&lt;/sup&gt; is phosphorylated in the sensitized state, and odorant exposure triggers dephosphorylation and desensitization without altering receptor localization. We further show that dephosphorylation of Orco&lt;sup&gt;S289&lt;/sup&gt; is triggered by neuronal activity, and not conformational changes in the receptor occurring upon ligand binding. Mutant flies unable to regulate Orco function through phosphorylation at S289 are defective for odor-guided behavior. These findings provide insight into the mechanisms underlying regulation of insect odorant receptors &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We have uncovered a mechanism underlying olfactory receptor sensitivity regulation in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. The phosphorylation state of Orco&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;S289&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is altered in an odorant-dependent manner and changes in phosphorylation affect receptor sensitivity without changing subcellular localization. We show that neuronal activity triggers the phosphorylation changes and that this phenomenon is important for odorant-guided behaviors in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. This phosphorylation site is conserved in other insects, including mosquitoes, indicating this mechanism may be a target for manipulation of insect behaviors in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Corelease of Inhibitory Neurotransmitters in the Mouse Auditory Midbrain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/39/9453?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/39/9453?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICC) of the auditory midbrain, which integrates most ascending auditory information from lower brainstem regions, receives prominent long-range inhibitory input from the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (VNLL), a region thought to be important for temporal pattern discrimination. Histological evidence suggests that neurons in the VNLL release both glycine and GABA in the ICC, but functional evidence for their corelease is lacking. We took advantage of the &lt;i&gt;GlyT2-Cre&lt;/i&gt; mouse line (both male and female) to target expression of ChR2 to glycinergic afferents in the ICC and made whole-cell recordings &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; while exciting glycinergic fibers with light. Using this approach, it was clear that a significant fraction of glycinergic boutons corelease GABA in the ICC. Viral injections were used to target ChR2 expression specifically to glycinergic fibers ascending from the VNLL, allowing for activation of fibers from a single source of ascending input in a way that has not been previously possible in the ICC. We then investigated aspects of the glycinergic versus GABAergic current components to probe functional consequences of corelease. Surprisingly, the time course and short-term plasticity of synaptic signaling were nearly identical for the two transmitters. We therefore conclude that the two neurotransmitters may be functionally interchangeable and that multiple receptor subtypes subserving inhibition may offer diverse mechanisms for maintaining inhibitory homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Corelease of neurotransmitters is a common feature of the brain. GABA and glycine corelease is particularly common in the spinal cord and brainstem, but its presence in the midbrain is unknown. We show corelease of GABA and glycine for the first time in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus of the auditory midbrain. Glycine and GABA are both inhibitory neurotransmitters involved in fast synaptic transmission, so we explored differences between the currents to establish a physiological foundation for functional differences &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. In contrast to the auditory brainstem, coreleased GABAergic and glycinergic currents in the midbrain are strikingly similar. This apparent redundancy may ensure homeostasis if one neurotransmitter system is compromised.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Dopamine Transporter Recycles via a Retromer-Dependent Postendocytic Mechanism: Tracking Studies Using a Novel Fluorophore-Coupling Approach</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Presynaptic reuptake, mediated by the dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT), terminates DAergic neurotransmission and constrains extracellular DA levels. Addictive and therapeutic psychostimulants inhibit DA reuptake and multiple DAT coding variants have been reported in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. These findings underscore that DAT is critical for DA neurotransmission and homeostasis. DAT surface availability is regulated acutely by endocytic trafficking, and considerable effort has been directed toward understanding mechanisms that govern DAT's plasma membrane expression and postendocytic fate. Multiple studies have demonstrated DAT endocytic recycling and enhanced surface delivery in response to various stimuli. Paradoxically, imaging studies have not detected DAT targeting to classic recycling endosomes, suggesting that internalized DAT targets to either degradation or an undefined recycling compartment. Here, we leveraged PRIME (PRobe Incorporation Mediated by Enzyme) labeling to couple surface DAT directly to fluorophore, and tracked DAT's postendocytic itinerary in immortalized mesencephalic cells. Following internalization, DAT robustly targeted to retromer-positive endosomes, and DAT/retromer colocalization was observed in male mouse dopaminergic somatodendritic and terminal regions. Short hairpin RNA-mediated Vps35 knockdown revealed that DAT endocytic recycling requires intact retromer. DAT also targeted rab7-positive endosomes with slow, linear kinetics that were unaffected by either accelerating DAT internalization or binding a high-affinity cocaine analog. However, cocaine increased DAT exit from retromer-positive endosomes significantly. Finally, we found that the DAT carboxy-terminal PDZ-binding motif was required for DAT recycling and exit from retromer. These results define the DAT recycling mechanism and provide a unifying explanation for previous, seemingly disparate, DAT endocytic trafficking findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The neuronal dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT) recaptures released DA and modulates DAergic neurotransmission, and a number of DAT coding variants have been reported in several DA-related disorders, including infantile parkinsonism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder. DAT is also competitively inhibited by psychostimulants with high abuse potential. Therefore, mechanisms that acutely affect DAT availability will likely exert significant impact on both normal and pathological DAergic homeostasis. Here, we explore the cellular mechanisms that acutely control DAT surface expression. Our results reveal the intracellular mechanisms that mediate DAT endocytic recycling following constitutive and regulated internalization. In addition to shedding light on this critical process, these findings resolve conflict among multiple, seemingly disparate, previous reports on DAT's postendocytic fate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Functional Segregation and Development of Mouse Higher Visual Areas</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent studies suggest that higher visual areas (HVAs) in the mouse visual cortex are segregated anatomically into two visual streams, likely analogous to the ventral and dorsal streams in primates. However, HVAs in mice have yet to be characterized functionally. Moreover, it is unknown when the functional segregation of HVAs occurs during development. Here, we investigated spatiotemporal selectivity of HVAs and their development using wide-field calcium imaging. We found that lateral HVAs in the anatomical ventral stream shared similar spatiotemporal selectivity, whereas the spatiotemporal selectivity of anterior and medial HVAs in the anatomical dorsal stream was not uniform and these areas were segregated functionally into multiple groups. This functional segregation of HVAs developed and reached an adult-like pattern ~10 d after eye opening (EO). These results suggest, not only the functional segregation of ventral and dorsal streams, but also the presence of multiple substreams in the dorsal stream, and indicate that the functional segregation of visual streams occurs gradually after EO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Investigation of the spatiotemporal selectivity of nine higher visual areas (HVAs) in adult and developing mice revealed that lateral HVAs belonging to the putative ventral stream shared similar spatiotemporal selectivity, whereas the spatiotemporal selectivity of anterior and medial HVAs belonging to the putative dorsal stream was not uniform and these areas were segregated functionally into multiple groups. These results suggest the presence of multiple substreams within the putative dorsal stream for visuospatial processing. Furthermore, we found that initially immature functional segregation among HVAs developed to an adult-like pattern ~10 d after eye opening. These results provide a foundation for using mouse HVAs as a model to understand parallel processing and its developmental mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Selective Modulation of Orbitofrontal Network Activity during Negative Occasion Setting</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Discrete cues can gain powerful control over behavior to help an animal anticipate and cope with upcoming events. This is important in conditions where understanding the relationship between complex stimuli provides a means to resolving situational ambiguity. However, it is unclear how cortical circuits generate and maintain these signals that conditionally regulate behavior. To address this, we established a Pavlovian serial feature-negative conditioning paradigm, where male mice are trained on a trial in which a conditioned stimulus (CS) is presented alone and followed by reward, or a feature-negative trial in which the CS is preceded by a feature cue indicating there is no reward. Mice learn to respond with anticipatory licking to a solitary CS, but significantly suppress their responding to the same cue during feature-negative trials. We show that the feature cue forms a selective association with its paired CS, because the ability of the feature to transfer its suppressive properties to a separately rewarded cue is limited. Next, to examine the underlying neural dynamics, we conduct recordings in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). We find that the feature cue significantly and selectively inhibits CS-evoked activity. Finally, we find that the feature triggers a distinct OFC network state during the delay period between the feature and CS, establishing a potential link between the feature and future events. Together, our findings suggest that OFC dynamics are modulated by the feature cue and its associated conditioned stimulus in a manner consistent with an occasion setting model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The ability of patterned cues to form an inhibitory relationship with ambiguously rewarded outcomes has been appreciated since early studies on learning and memory. However, it was often assumed that these cues, despite their hierarchical nature, still made direct associative links with neural rewarding events. This model was significantly challenged, largely by the work of Holland and colleagues, who demonstrated that under certain conditions cues can inherit occasion setting properties whereby they modulate the ability of a paired cue to elicit its conditioned response. Here we provide some of the first evidence that the activity of a cortical circuit is selectively modulated by such cues, thereby providing insight into the mechanisms of higher order learning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Stem Cell Marker Lgr5 Defines a Subset of Postmitotic Neurons in the Olfactory Bulb</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/39/9403?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Lgr5, leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5, is a &lt;i&gt;bona fide&lt;/i&gt; biomarker for stem cells in multiple tissues. Lgr5 is also expressed in the brain, but the identities and properties of these Lgr5&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells are still elusive. Using an Lgr5-EGFP reporter mouse line, we found that, from early development to adulthood, Lgr5 is highly expressed in the olfactory bulb (OB), an area with ongoing neurogenesis. Immunostaining with stem cell, glial, and neuronal markers reveals that Lgr5 does not label stem cells in the OB but instead labels a heterogeneous population of neurons with preference in certain subtypes. Patch-clamp recordings in OB slices reveal that Lgr5-EGFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells fire action potentials and display spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic events, indicating that these neurons are integrated into OB circuits. Interestingly, R-spondin 3, a potential ligand of Lgr5, is also expressed in the adult OB. Collectively, our data indicate that Lgr5-expressing cells in the OB are fully differentiated neurons and imply distinct roles of Lgr5 and its ligand in postmitotic cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Lgr5 (leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5) is a &lt;i&gt;bona fide&lt;/i&gt; stem cell marker in many body organs. Here we report that Lgr5 is also highly expressed in the olfactory bulb (OB), the first relay station in the brain for processing odor information and one of the few neural structures that undergo continuous neurogenesis. Surprisingly, Lgr5 is not expressed in the OB stem cells, but instead in a few subtypes of terminally differentiated neurons, which are incorporated into the OB circuit. This study reveals that Lgr5&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in the brain represent a nonstem cell lineage, implying distinct roles of Lgr5 in postmitotic neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Simultaneously Excitatory and Inhibitory Effects of Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation Revealed Using Selective Pulse-Train Stimulation in the Rat Motor Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/39/9389?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/39/9389?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) uses sinusoidal, subthreshold, electric fields to modulate cortical processing. Cortical processing depends on a fine balance between excitation and inhibition and tACS acts on both excitatory and inhibitory cortical neurons. Given this, it is not clear whether tACS should increase or decrease cortical excitability. We investigated this using transcranial current stimulation of the rat (all males) motor cortex consisting of a continuous subthreshold sine wave with short bursts of suprathreshold pulse-trains inserted at different phases to probe cortical excitability. We found that when a low-rate, long-duration, suprathreshold pulse-train was used, subthreshold cathodal tACS decreased cortical excitability and anodal tACS increased excitability. However, when a high-rate, short-duration, suprathreshold pulse-train was used this pattern was inverted. An integrate-and-fire model incorporating biophysical differences between cortical excitatory and inhibitory neurons could predict the experimental data and helped interpret these results. The model indicated that low-rate suprathreshold pulse-trains preferentially stimulate excitatory cortical neurons, whereas high-rate suprathreshold pulse-trains stimulate both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. If correct, this indicates that suprathreshold pulse-train stimulation may be able to selectively control the excitation–inhibition balance within a cortical network. The excitation–inhibition balance then likely plays an important role in determining whether subthreshold tACS will increase or decrease cortical excitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a noninvasive neuromodulation method that uses weak sinusoidal electric fields to modulate cortical activity. In healthy volunteers tACS can modulate perception, cognition, and motor function but the underlying neural mechanism is poorly understood. In this study, using rat motor cortex, we found that tACS effects are highly variable: applying the same tACS waveform to the same cortical area does not always give the same change in cortical excitability. An integrate-and-fire model incorporating excitatory pyramidal and inhibitory interneurons indicated that tACS effects likely depend on the cortical excitation–inhibition balance. When cortical activity is excitation dominated one particular tACS phase increases excitability, but when the cortical activity is inhibition dominated the same tACS phase actually decreases excitability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Thermosensory Perceptual Learning Is Associated with Structural Brain Changes in Parietal-Opercular (SII) Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/39/9380?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/39/9380?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The location of a sensory cortex for temperature perception remains a topic of substantial debate. Both the parietal–opercular (SII) and posterior insula have been consistently implicated in thermosensory processing, but neither region has yet been identified as the locus of fine temperature discrimination. Using a perceptual learning paradigm in male and female humans, we show improvement in discrimination accuracy for subdegree changes in both warmth and cool detection over 5 d of repetitive training. We found that increases in discriminative accuracy were specific to the temperature (cold or warm) being trained. Using structural imaging to look for plastic changes associated with perceptual learning, we identified symmetrical increases in gray matter volume in the SII cortex. Furthermore, we observed distinct, adjacent regions for cold and warm discrimination, with cold discrimination having a more anterior locus than warm. The results suggest that thermosensory discrimination is supported by functionally and anatomically distinct temperature-specific modules in the SII cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We provide behavioral and neuroanatomical evidence that perceptual learning is possible within the temperature system. We show that structural plasticity localizes to parietal–opercular (SII), and not posterior insula, providing the best evidence to date resolving a longstanding debate about the location of putative &quot;temperature cortex.&quot; Furthermore, we show that cold and warm pathways are behaviorally and anatomically dissociable, suggesting that the temperature system has distinct temperature-dependent processing modules.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Repulsive Guidance Molecule a (RGMa) Induces Neuropathological and Behavioral Changes That Closely Resemble Parkinson's Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/39/9361?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/39/9361?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Repulsive guidance molecule member a (RGMa) is a membrane-associated or released guidance molecule that is involved in axon guidance, cell patterning, and cell survival. In our previous work, we showed that RGMa is significantly upregulated in the substantia nigra of patients with Parkinson's disease. Here we demonstrate the expression of RGMa in midbrain human dopaminergic (DA) neurons. To investigate whether RGMa might model aspects of the neuropathology of Parkinson's disease in mouse, we targeted RGMa to adult midbrain dopaminergic neurons using adeno-associated viral vectors. Overexpression of RGMa resulted in a progressive movement disorder, including motor coordination and imbalance, which is typical for a loss of DA release in the striatum. In line with this, RGMa induced selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and affected the integrity of the nigrostriatal system. The degeneration of dopaminergic neurons was accompanied by a strong microglia and astrocyte activation. The behavioral, molecular, and anatomical changes induced by RGMa in mice are remarkably similar to the clinical and neuropathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease. Our data indicate that dysregulation of RGMa plays an important role in the pathology of Parkinson's disease, and antibody-mediated functional interference with RGMa may be a disease modifying treatment option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by severe motor dysfunction due to progressive degeneration of mesencephalic dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra. To date, there is no regenerative treatment available. We previously showed that repulsive guidance molecule member a (RGMa) is upregulated in the substantia nigra of PD patients. Adeno-associated virus-mediated targeting of RGMa to mouse DA neurons showed that overexpression of this repulsive axon guidance and cell patterning cue models the behavioral and neuropathological characteristics of PD in a remarkable way. These findings have implications for therapy development as interfering with the function of this specific axon guidance cue may be beneficial to the survival of DA neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Brief Novel Visual Experience Fundamentally Changes Synaptic Plasticity in the Mouse Visual Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/39/9353?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;LTP has been known to be a mechanism by which experience modifies synaptic responses in the neocortex. Visual deprivation in the form of dark exposure or dark rearing from birth enhances NMDAR-dependent LTP in layer 2/3 of visual cortex, a process often termed metaplasticity, which may involve changes in NMDAR subunit composition and function. However, the effects of reexposure to light after dark rearing from birth on LTP induction have not been explored. Here, we showed that the light exposure after dark rearing revealed a novel NMDAR independent form of LTP in the layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in visual cortex of mice of both sexes, which is dependent on mGluR5 activation and is associated with intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; rise, CaMKII activity, PKC activity, and intact protein synthesis. Moreover, the capacity to induce mGluR-dependent LTP is transient: it only occurs when mice of both sexes reared in the dark from birth are exposed to light for 10–12 h, and it does not occur in vision-experienced, male mice, even after prolonged exposure to dark. Thus, the mGluR5-LTP unmasked by short visual experience can only be observed after dark rearing but not after dark exposure. These results suggested that, as in hippocampus, in layer 2/3 of visual cortex, there is coexistence of two distinct activity-dependent systems of synaptic plasticity, NMDAR-LTP, and mGluR5-LTP. The mGluR5-LTP unmasked by short visual experience may play a critical role in the faster establishment of normal receptive field properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; LTP has been known to be a mechanism by which experience modifies synaptic responses in the neocortex. Visual deprivation in the form of dark exposure or dark rearing from birth enhances NMDAR-dependent LTP in layer 2/3 of visual cortex, a process often termed metaplasticity. NMDAR-dependent form of LTP in visual cortex has been well characterized. Here, we report that an NMDAR-independent form of LTP can be promoted by novel visual experience on dark-reared mice, characterized as dependent on intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; rise, PKC activity, and intact protein synthesis and also requires the activation of mGluR5. These findings suggest that, in layer 2/3 of visual cortex, as in hippocampus, there is coexistence of two distinct activity-dependent systems of synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
