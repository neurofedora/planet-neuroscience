	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Frequency locking and travelling bursts sequences in modular network of inhibitory neurons with differing time-scales. (arXiv:1711.06435v1 [nlin.CD])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We report the emergent dynamics of a community structured modular network of
chaotic Hindmarsh-Rose neurons with inhibitory synapses. We find the inhibitory
coupling between the neuronal modules leads to complete synchronization of
neurons in a module, and also pushes modules into interesting sequence of
travelling burst patterns. When differing dynamical time-scales are introduced
for neurons in each module, hence breaking the symmetry between them, we see
specific sequences of travelling burst patterns that are characteristic of the
time-scale mismatch and coupling strengths. For a modular network with only two
time-scales, the neuronal sub-ensembles enter into synchronized frequency
locked clusters with the bursting sequences having recurring patterns. Our
results have significance in the process of information coding in terms of
frequency of firing dynamics among neurons and in selective communication based
on the sequences of bursts.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Glutamatergic drive along the septo-temporal axis of hippocampus boosts prelimbic oscillations in the neonatal mouse</title>

	<description>The long-range coupling within prefrontal-hippocampal networks that account for cognitive performance emerges early in life. The discontinuous hippocampal theta bursts have been proposed to drive the generation of neonatal prefrontal oscillations, yet the cellular substrate of these early interactions is still unresolved. Here, we selectively target optogenetic manipulation of glutamatergic projection neurons in the CA1 area of either dorsal or intermediate/ventral hippocampus at neonatal age to elucidate their contribution to the emergence of prefrontal oscillatory entrainment. We show that despite stronger theta and ripples power in dorsal hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex is mainly coupled with intermediate/ventral hippocampus by phase-locking of neuronal firing via dense direct axonal projections. Theta band-confined activation by light of pyramidal neurons in intermediate/ventral but not dorsal CA1 that were transfected by in utero electroporation with high-efficiency channelrhodopsin boosts prefrontal oscillations. Our data causally elucidates the cellular origin of the long-range coupling in the developing brain.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Bayesian adaptive stimulus selection for dissociating models of psychophysical data [Revised]</title>

	<description>Comparing models facilitates testing different hypotheses regarding the computational basis of perception and action. Effective model comparison requires stimuli for which models make different predictions. Typically, experiments use a predetermined set of stimuli or sample stimuli randomly. Both methods have limitations; a predetermined set may not contain stimuli that dissociate the models whereas random sampling may be inefficient. To overcome these limitations, we expanded the psi-algorithm (Kontsevich &amp;amp; Tyler, 1999) from estimating the parameters of a psychometric curve to distinguishing models. To test our algorithm, we applied it to two distinct problems. First, we investigated dissociating sensory noise models. We simulated ideal observers with different noise models performing a 2-afc task. Stimuli were selected randomly or using our algorithm. We found using our algorithm improved the accuracy of model comparison. We also validated the algorithm in subjects by inferring which noise model underlies speed perception. Our algorithm converged quickly to the model previously proposed (Stocker &amp;amp; Simoncelli, 2006), whereas if stimuli were selected randomly model probabilities separated slower and sometimes supported alternative models. Second, we applied it to a different problem; comparing models of target selection under body acceleration. Previous work found target choice preference is modulated by whole body acceleration (Rincon-Gonzalez et al., 2016). However, the effect is subtle making model comparison difficult. We show that selecting stimuli adaptively could have led to stronger conclusions in model comparison. We conclude that our technique is more efficient and more reliable than current methods of stimuli selection for dissociating models.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A comparison of tests for quantifying sensory eye dominance</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/219816v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Purpose Clinicians rely heavily on stereoacuity to measure binocular visual function, but stereo-vision represents only one aspect of binocularity. Lab-based tests of sensory eye dominance (SED) are commonplace, but have not been translated to wider clinical practice. Here we compare several methods of quantifying SED in a format suitable for clinical use. Methods We tested 30 participants with ostensibly normal vision on 8 tests. Seven tests (#1-7) were designed to quantify SED in the form of an inter-ocular balance-point (BP). In tests #1-6, we estimated a contrast-BP, the inter-ocular difference in contrast required for observers to be equally likely to base their judgement on either eye, whereas in test #7 we measured binocular rivalry (inter-ocular ratio of sensory dominance duration). We compare test-retest reliability (intra-observer consistency) and test-validity (inter-observer discriminatory power) and compare BP to stereoacuity (test #8). Results The test that best preserved inter-observer differences in contrast balance while maintaining good test-retest reliability was a polarity judgement using superimposed opposite-contrast polarity same-identity optotypes. Conclusions A reliable and valid measure of SED can be obtained rapidly (20 trials) using a simple contrast-polarity judgement. Tests that use polarity-rivalrous stimuli elicit more reliable judgments than those that do not.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Recording neural activity in unrestrained animals with 3D tracking two photon microscopy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/213942v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Optical recordings of neural activity in behaving animals can reveal the neural correlates of decision making, but such recordings are compromised by brain motion that often accompanies behavior. Two-photon point scanning microscopy is especially sensitive to motion artifacts, and to date, two-photon recording of activity has required rigid mechanical coupling between the brain and microscope. To overcome these difficulties, we developed a two-photon tracking microscope with extremely low latency (360 microsecond) feedback implemented in hardware. We maintained continuous focus on neurons moving with velocities of 3 mm/s and accelerations of 1 m/s^2 both in-plane and axially, allowing high-bandwidth measurements with modest excitation power. We recorded from motor- and inter- neurons in unrestrained freely behaving fruit fly larvae, correlating neural activity with stimulus presentation and behavioral outputs. Our technique can be extended to stabilize recordings in a variety of moving substrates.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Superficial Slow Rhythms Integrate Cortical Processing in Humans</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/202549v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>The neocortex is composed of six anatomically and physiologically specialized layers. It has been proposed that integration of activity across cortical areas is mediated anatomically by associative connections terminating in superficial layers, and physiologically by slow cortical rhythms. However, the means through which neocortical anatomy and physiology interact to coordinate neural activity remains obscure. Using laminar microelectrode arrays in 19 human participants, we found that most EEG activity is below 10-Hz (delta/theta) and generated by superficial cortical layers during both wakefulness and sleep. Cortical surface grid, grid-laminar, and dual-laminar recordings demonstrate that these slow rhythms are synchronous within upper layers across broad cortical areas. The phase of this superficial slow activity is reset by infrequent stimuli and coupled to the amplitude of faster oscillations and neuronal firing across all layers. These findings support a primary role of superficial slow rhythms in generating the EEG and integrating cortical activity.</description>

Extensive works during the past decade yield ample insights into the molecular and cellular functions of MeCP2 in neural development. Furthermore, genetic manipulations in Mecp2 mouse models strongly suggested that deficiency in synaptic plasticity and various behaviors of Mecp2 null or transgenic mice could be rescued in adulthood. Further studies elucidating neural circuits responsible for symptoms in MECP2-associated disorders in rodent and non-human primate models will shed light on the development of potential therapeutic interventions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: October 2017&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 46&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Scott W   Linderman, Samuel J   Gershman&lt;br /&gt; Computational neuroscience is, to first order, dominated by two approaches: the ‘bottom-up’ approach, which searches for statistical patterns in large-scale neural recordings, and the ‘top-down’ approach, which begins with a theory of computation and considers plausible neural implementations. While this division is not clear-cut, we argue that these approaches should be much more intimately linked. From a Bayesian perspective, computational theories provide constrained prior distributions on neural data—albeit highly sophisticated ones. By connecting theory to observation via a probabilistic model, we provide the link necessary to test, evaluate, and revise our theories in a data-driven and statistically rigorous fashion. This review highlights examples of this theory-driven pipeline for neural data analysis in recent literature and illustrates it with a worked example based on the temporal difference learning model of dopamine. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

During development, glia keep neuronal cell numbers in check and ensure that mature neural circuits are appropriately sculpted by engulfing superfluous cells and projections. In the adult brain, glial cells offer metabolic sustenance and provide critical immune support in the face of acute and chronic challenges. Dysfunctional glial immune activity is believed to contribute to age-related cognitive decline, as well as neurodegenerative disease risk, but we still know surprisingly little about the specific molecular pathways that govern glia-neuron communication in the healthy or diseased brain. Drosophila offers a versatile in vivo model to explore the conserved molecular underpinnings of glial cell biology and glial cell contributions to brain function, health, and disease susceptibility. This review addresses recent findings describing how Drosophila glial cells influence neuronal activity in the adult fly brain to support optimal brain function and, importantly, highlights new insights into specific glial defects that may contribute to neuronal demise. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Understanding this limited response could enable the enhancement of it. In Drosophila, the glial progenitor state is maintained by Notch, an activator of cell division and Prospero (Pros), a repressor. Injury provokes the activation of NFκB and up-regulation of Kon-tiki (Kon), driving cell proliferation. Homeostatic switch-off comes about as two negative feedback loops involving Pros terminate the response. Importantly, the functions of the kon and pros homologues NG2 and prox1, respectively, are conserved in mammalian NG2 glia. Controlling these genes is key for therapeutic manipulation of progenitors and stem cells to promote regeneration of the damaged CNS. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Critical to progressing the field is the identification of molecular underpinnings necessary for microglia to carry out these important functions within neural circuits. Here, we focus a review specifically on roles for microglial cytokine signaling within developing and mature neural circuits. We review exciting new studies demonstrating essential roles for microglial cytokine signaling in axon outgrowth, synaptogenesis and synapse maturation during development, as well as synaptic transmission and plasticity in adulthood. Together, these studies identify microglia and cytokines as critical modulators of neural circuits within the healthy brain, with implications for a broad range of neurological disorders with disruptions in synaptic structure and function. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;h3&quot;&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; height=&quot;178&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S095943881730137X-fx1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;301&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

The morphological and molecular heterogeneity of oligodendrocytes and their progenitors point to functions beyond establishing saltatory nerve conduction. Here, we review the diversity in the oligodendroglial lineage as well as the classical and new functions identified for oligodendrocytes and their progenitors. Because oligodendroglia remain highly responsive to environmental changes, they likely contribute to various neurological and psychiatric diseases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Human neuroimaging studies consistently show a hunger-dependent, selective enhancement of responses to images of food in association cortex and amygdala. More recently, cellular-resolution imaging combined with circuit mapping experiments in behaving mice have revealed underlying neuronal population dynamics and enabled tracing of pathways by which hunger circuits influence the assignment of value to visual objects in visual association cortex, insular cortex, and amygdala. These experiments begin to provide a mechanistic understanding of motivation-specific neural processing of need-relevant cues in healthy humans and in disease states such as obesity and other eating disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Since the earliest days of embryology, lineage questions have been addressed with methods of increasing specificity, capacity, and resolution. Yet, a full realization of individual cell lineages remains challenging for complex systems. A recent explosion of technical advances in genome-editing and single-cell sequencing has enabled lineage analysis in an unprecedented scale, speed, and depth across different species. In this review, we discuss the application of available as well as future genetic labeling techniques for tracking neural lineages in vivo in the mammalian nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

During development, individual gene activity can dynamically engage different signaling networks; thus genetic mutations can lead to different functional changes at different times. Interpretation of phenotypes can be further complicated if initial functional changes trigger compensatory mechanisms. Examining genetic mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders reveals cellular phenotypes that change over the course of development and exist long before behavioral deficits are assessed. Correspondingly, earlier genetic interventions in these disorder models have often been more effective at improving behavioral deficits than late interventions. The restricted period of effective intervention demonstrates that identifying a target window is an essential component of treatment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Recent work suggests that they play a key role in regulating brain energy supply by increasing blood flow to regions where neurons are active, and setting the baseline level of blood flow. Controversy persists over whether lactate derived from astrocyte glycolysis is used to power oxidative phosphorylation in neurons, but astrocytes sustain neuronal ATP production by recycling neurotransmitter glutamate that would otherwise need to be resynthesised from glucose, and by providing a short-term energy store in the form of glycogen that can be mobilised when neurons are active. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

To achieve these precise shapes, glia and neurons exhibit coordinated morphological changes on the time scale of minutes and on size scales ranging from nanometers to hundreds of microns. Here, we review recent studies that reveal the highly dynamic, localized morphological changes of mammalian neuron–glia contacts. We then explore the power of Drosophila and C. elegans models to study coordinated changes at defined neuron–glia contacts, highlighting the use of innovative genetic and imaging tools to uncover the molecular mechanisms responsible for coordinated morphogenesis of neurons and glia. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Derived from the yolk sac during development, microglia self-renew, self-regulate their numbers during homeostatic conditions, and show a robust proliferative capacity even in adulthood. Together with monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), microglia coordinate the regeneration of CNS myelin around axons, termed remyelination. Gene expression analyses and experimental modelling have identified pro-remyelination roles for microglia/MDM in clearance of myelin debris, secretion of growth factors, and remodelling of the extracellular matrix. Further investigations into the molecular mechanisms controlling these regenerative functions will reveal novel therapeutic strategies to enhance remyelination, by harnessing the beneficial effects of the innate immune response to injury. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

However, microglia enter the brain during embryogenesis and recent studies have revealed additional early functions of these immune cells in prenatal and perinatal cerebral development. Such findings are of importance since prenatal inflammation and microglia dysfunction have been associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders. This review provides a selective overview of the early roles of microglia, their link with a specific spatiotemporal distribution and how they can be modulated by intrinsic factors or environmental signals. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: February 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Chao   Wang, Maria A   Telpoukhovskaia, Ben A   Bahr, Xu   Chen, Li   Gan&lt;br /&gt; Endo-lysosomal pathways are essential in maintaining protein homeostasis in the cell. Numerous genes in the endo-lysosomal pathways have been found to associate with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations of these genes lead to dysfunction in multiple steps of the endo-lysosomal network: autophagy, endocytic trafficking and lysosomal degradation, resulting in accumulation of pathogenic proteins. Although the exact pathogenic mechanism varies for different disease-associated genes, dysfunction of the endo-lysosomal pathways represents a converging mechanism shared by these diseases. Therefore, strategies that correct or compensate for endo-lysosomal dysfunction may be promising therapeutic approaches to treat neurodegenerative diseases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

The development of sophisticated genetic tools to manipulate its genome accelerates the discovery of the genetic basis of undiagnosed human diseases and the elucidation of molecular pathogenic events of known and novel diseases. Here, we discuss various approaches used in flies to assess the function of the fly homologues of disease-associated genes. We highlight how systematic and combinatorial approaches based on recently established methods provide us with integrated tool sets that can be applied to the study of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Our propensity to acclimate to new surroundings and choose a goal-directed behavior for maximal reward (i.e., optimal outcome) is natural, for it affects our survival. A line of studies suggested that anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a potential hub for regulating adaptive behaviors. For instance, an experimental study noted ACC contribution to selecting motor response for maximal reward; it found 1) that ACC neurons were selectively activated when reward was reduced and 2) that the suppression of ACC activity impaired monkeys' ability to change motor response to gain maximal reward. Then, how does ACC modulate motor responses? To address this question, we sought biologically-plausible mechanisms that can account for experimental findings mentioned above. Here, we built a computational model that can replicate the observed ACC activity patterns. Our simulation results raise the possibility that ACC can correct behavioral response by reading out and updating motor plans (guiding future motor responses) stored in prefrontal cortex (PFC).</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The Generation and Propagation of the Human Alpha Rhythm</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/202564v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>The alpha rhythm (7-13 Hz) is the longest studied brain oscillation and has been theorized to play a key role in cognition. Still, substantial uncertainty remains over its physiology. In this study, we used micro and macro electrodes in patients undergoing surgery for epilepsy to measure the intracortical and thalamic generators of the human alpha rhythm. We first found that alpha propagates from higher-order anterosuperior cortex towards the lower-order occipital poles, consistent with alpha effecting top-down processing. This cortical alpha drives thalamic alpha, reversing prevailing theories of a thalamic alpha pacemaker. Finally, alpha is dominated by currents and firing in supragranular cortex, contravening the popular conception of alpha as an infragranular rhythm. Together, these results demonstrate that the alpha rhythm reflects short-range supragranular feedback which propagates from higher-order to lower order cortex and cortex to thalamus. These physiological insights explain how alpha could mediate feedback throughout the thalamocortical system.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Natural History of Infantile-Onset Spinal Muscular Atrophy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25101</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Infantile-onset spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is the most common genetic cause of infant mortality, typically resulting in death prior to age 2. Clinical trials in this population require an understanding of disease progression and identification of meaningful biomarkers to hasten therapeutic development and predict outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A longitudinal, multi-center, prospective natural history study enrolled 26 SMA infants, and 27 control infants less than six months of age. Recruitment occurred at 14 centers over 21 months within the NINDS-sponsored NeuroNEXT Network. Infant motor function scales (TIMPSI, CHOP-INTEND and AIMS) and putative physiologic and molecular biomarkers were assessed prior to 6 months of age and at 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24-months with progression, correlations between motor function and biomarkers and hazard ratios were analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Motor function scores (MFS) and CMAP decreased rapidly in SMA infants, whereas MFS in all healthy infants rapidly increased. Correlations were identified between TIMPSI and CMAP in SMA infants. TIMPSI at first study visit was associated with risk of combined endpoint of death or permanent invasive ventilation in SMA infants. Post hoc analysis of survival to combined endpoint in SMA infants with 2 copies of &lt;em&gt;SMN2&lt;/em&gt; indicated a median age of 8 months at death (95%CI: 6,17).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: These data of SMA and control outcome measures delineates meaningful change in clinical trials in infantile-onset SMA. The power and utility of NeuroNEXT to provide “real world”, prospective natural history data sets to accelerate public and private drug development programs for rare disease is demonstrated.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Parkinson's disease (PD), mitochondrial dysfunction associates with nigral dopaminergic neuronal loss. Cholinergic neuronal loss co-occurs, particularly within a brainstem structure, the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN). We isolated single cholinergic neurons from post-mortem PPNs of aged controls and PD patients. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and mtDNA deletions were increased significantly in PD patients compared to controls. Furthermore, compared to controls the PD patients had significantly more PPN cholinergic neurons containing mtDNA deletion levels exceeding 60%, a level associated with deleterious effects on oxidative phosphorylation. The current results differ from studies reporting mtDNA depletion in nigral dopaminergic neurons of PD patients. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Trade-off and flexibility in the dynamic regulation of the cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase repertoire</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005869</guid>

Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) catalyze the ubiquitylation of substrates many of which are degraded by the 26S proteasome. Their modular architecture enables recognition of numerous substrates via exchangeable substrate receptors that competitively bind to a cullin scaffold with high affinity. Due to the plasticity of these interactions there is ongoing uncertainty how cells maintain a flexible CRL repertoire in view of changing substrate loads. Based on a series of &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies, different groups proposed that the exchange of substrate receptors is mediated by a protein exchange factor named Cand1. Here, we have performed mathematical modeling to provide a quantitative underpinning of this hypothesis. First we show that the exchange activity of Cand1 necessarily leads to a trade-off between high ligase activity and fast receptor exchange. Supported by measurements we argue that this trade-off yields an optimal Cand1 concentration in cells where the time scale for substrate degradation becomes minimal. In a second step we show through simulations that (i) substrates bias the CRL repertoire leading to preferential assembly of ligases for which substrates are available and (ii) differences in binding affinities or substrate receptor abundances create a temporal hierarchy for the degradation of substrates. Finally, we compare the Cand1-mediated exchange cycle with an alternative architecture lacking Cand1 which indicates superiority of a system with exchange factor if substrate receptors bind substrates and the cullin scaffold in a random order. Together, our results provide general constraints for the operating regimes of molecular exchange systems and suggest that Cand1 endows the CRL network with the properties of an “on demand” system allowing cells to dynamically adjust their CRL repertoire to fluctuating substrate abundances.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mEw-9pFCpBw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Modern time series gene expression and other omics data sets have enabled unprecedented resolution of the dynamics of cellular processes such as cell cycle and response to pharmaceutical compounds. In anticipation of the proliferation of time series data sets in the near future, we use the Hopfield model, a recurrent neural network based on spin glasses, to model the dynamics of cell cycle in HeLa (human cervical cancer) and &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; cells. We study some of the rich dynamical properties of these cyclic Hopfield systems, including the ability of populations of simulated cells to recreate experimental expression data and the effects of noise on the dynamics. Next, we use a genetic algorithm to identify sets of genes which, when selectively inhibited by local external fields representing gene silencing compounds such as kinase inhibitors, disrupt the encoded cell cycle. We find, for example, that inhibiting the set of four kinases &lt;i&gt;AURKB&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;NEK1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TTK&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;WEE1&lt;/i&gt; causes simulated HeLa cells to accumulate in the M phase. Finally, we suggest possible improvements and extensions to our model.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dik1D-o7ObU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Resection of the bulk of a tumour often cannot eliminate all cancer cells, due to their infiltration into the surrounding healthy tissue. This may lead to recurrence of the tumour at a later time. We use a reaction-diffusion equation based model of tumour growth to investigate how the invasion front is delayed by resection, and how this depends on the density and behaviour of the remaining cancer cells. We show that the delay time is highly sensitive to qualitative details of the proliferation dynamics of the cancer cell population. The typically assumed logistic type proliferation leads to unrealistic results, predicting immediate recurrence. We find that in glioblastoma cell cultures the cell proliferation rate is an increasing function of the density at small cell densities. Our analysis suggests that cooperative behaviour of cancer cells, analogous to the Allee effect in ecology, can play a critical role in determining the time until tumour recurrence.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/q0we1iWZQm4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Replay of large-scale spatio-temporal patterns from waking during subsequent slow-wave sleep in human cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/221275v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Animal studies support the hypothesis that in slow-wave sleep, replay of waking neocortical activity under hippocampal guidance leads to memory consolidation. However, no intracranial electrophysiological evidence for replay exists in humans. We identified consistent sequences of population firing peaks across widespread cortical regions during complete waking periods. The occurrence of these Motifs were compared between sleeps preceding the waking period (Sleep-Pre) when the Motifs were identified, and those following (Sleep-Post). In all subjects, the majority of waking Motifs (most of which were novel) had more matches in Sleep-Post than in Sleep-Pre. In rodents, hippocampal replay occurs during local sharp-wave ripples, and the associated neocortical replay tends to occur during local sleep spindles and down-to-up transitions. These waves may facilitate consolidation by sequencing cell-firing and encouraging plasticity. Similarly, we found that Motifs were coupled to neocortical spindles, down-to-up transitions, theta bursts, and hippocampal sharp-wave ripples. While Motifs occurring during cognitive task performance were more likely to have more matches in subsequent sleep, our studies provide no direct demonstration that the replay of Motifs contributes to consolidation. Nonetheless, these results confirm a core prediction of the dominant neurobiological theory of human memory consolidation.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Oxidative stress and loss of Fe-S proteins in Friedreich ataxia induced pluripotent stem cell-derived PSNs can be reversed by restoring FXN expression with a benzamide HDAC inhibitor.</title>

	<description>Epigenetic suppression of frataxin (FXN) expression caused by the presence of expanded GAA repeats at the FXN locus is the key pathogenic event in Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), a recessive neurodegenerative and systemic disease. FXN is involved in iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis in mitochondria, its deficiency causes multiple Fe-S protein deficiencies, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Primary sensory neurons (PSNs) in the dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) are the most vulnerable cells in FRDA, whose abnormal development and degeneration leads to the onset and early progression of ataxia. We generated PSNs from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from FRDA patients and showed that they recapitulate the key pathogenic events in FRDA, including low FXN levels, loss of Fe-S proteins and impaired antioxidant responses. We also showed that FXN deficiency in these cells may be partially corrected by a pimelic benzamide histone deacetylase inhibitor, a class of potential therapeutics for FRDA. We generated and validated a cellular model of the most vulnerable neurons in FRDA, which can be used for further studies on pathogenesis and treatment approaches.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Human-specific NOTCH-like genes in a region linked to neurodevelopmental disorders affect cortical neurogenesis [Revised]</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/221226v2?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/221226v2?rss=1</link>
	<description>Genetic changes causing dramatic brain size expansion in human evolution have remained elusive. Notch signaling is essential for radial glia stem cell proliferation and a determinant of neuronal number in the mammalian cortex. We find three paralogs of human-specific NOTCH2NL are highly expressed in radial glia cells. Functional analysis reveals different alleles of NOTCH2NL have varying potencies to enhance Notch signaling by interacting directly with NOTCH receptors. Consistent with a role in Notch signaling, NOTCH2NL ectopic expression delays differentiation of neuronal progenitors, while deletion accelerates differentiation. NOTCH2NL genes provide the breakpoints in typical cases of 1q21.1 distal deletion/duplication syndrome, where duplications are associated with macrocephaly and autism, and deletions with microcephaly and schizophrenia. Thus, the emergence of hominin-specific NOTCH2NL genes may have contributed to the rapid evolution of the larger hominin neocortex accompanied by loss of genomic stability at the 1q21.1 locus and a resulting recurrent neurodevelopmental disorder.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Motor selection dynamics in FEF explain the reaction time variance of saccades to single targets</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/221218v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/221218v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>In studies of voluntary movement, a most elemental quantity is the reaction time (RT) between the onset of a visual stimulus and a saccade toward it. However, this RT demonstrates extremely high variability, which in spite of extensive research remains unexplained. It is well established that, when a visual target appears, oculomotor activity gradually builds up until a critical level is reached, at which point a saccade is triggered. Here, we further characterize the dynamics of this rise-to-threshold process based on computational work and single-neuron recordings from the frontal eye field (FEF) of behaving monkeys. We find that the baseline activity, build-up rate, and threshold level show strong, nonlinear co-dependencies that explain the distinct RT distributions observed experimentally. The results indicate that intrinsic randomness contributes little to saccade variance, which results mainly from an intricate, fundamentally deterministic mechanism of motor conflict resolution that has subtle yet highly characteristic manifestations.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: LRRTM1 underlies synaptic convergence in visual thalamus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/221200v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>It has long been thought that the mammalian visual system is organized into parallel pathways, with incoming visual signals being parsed in the retina based on feature (e.g. color, contrast and motion) and then transmitted to the brain in unmixed, feature-specific channels. To faithfully convey feature-specific information from retina to cortex, thalamic relay cells must receive inputs from only a small number of functionally similar retinal ganglion cells. However, recent studies challenged this by revealing substantial levels of retinal convergence onto relay cells. Here, we sought to identify mechanisms responsible for the assembly of such convergence. Using an unbiased transcriptomics approach and targeted mutant mice, we discovered a critical role for the synaptic adhesion molecule Leucine Rich Repeat Transmembrane Neuronal 1 (LRRTM1) in the emergence of retinothalamic convergence. Importantly, LRRTM1 mutant mice display impairment in visual behaviors, suggesting a functional role of retinothalamic convergence in vision.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Selective attention modulates surface filling-in</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/221150v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The visual system is required to compute objects from partial image structure so that figures can be segmented from their backgrounds. Although early clinical, behavioral, and modeling data suggested that such computations are performed pre-attentively, recent neurophysiological evidence suggests that surface filling-in is influenced by attention. In the present study we developed a variant of the classical Kanizsa illusory triangle to investigate whether voluntary attention modulates perceptual filling-in. Our figure consists of &quot;pacmen&quot; positioned at the tips of an illusory 6-point star and alternating in polarity such that two illusory triangles are implied to compete with one another within the figure. On each trial, observers were cued to attend to only one triangle, and then compared its lightness with a matching texture-defined triangle. We found that perceived lightness of the illusory surface depended on the polarity of pacmen framing the attended triangle, although the magnitude of this effect was weaker than when all inducers were of the same polarity. Our findings thus reveal that voluntary attention can influence surface filling-in, and provide important data linking neurophysiological effects to phenomenology.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A neuronal theory of sequential economic choice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/221135v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/221135v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Principles derived from recent studies have begun to converge and point to a consensus for the neural basis of economic choice. These principles include the idea that evaluation is limited to the option within the focus of attention and that we accept or reject that option relative to the entire set of alternatives. Rejection leads attention to a new option, although it can later switch back to a previously rejected one. The referent of a value-coding neuron is dynamically determined by attention and not stably by labeled lines. Comparison results not from explicit competition between discrete representations, but from value-dependent changes in responsiveness. Consequently, comparison can occur within a single pool of neurons rather than by competition between two or more neuronal populations. Comparison may nonetheless occur at multiple levels (including premotor levels) simultaneously through a distributed consensus. This framework suggests a solution to a set of otherwise unresolved neuronal binding problems that result from the need to link options to values, comparisons to actions, and choices to outcomes.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Reconstruction of resting-state networks from macaqueelectrocorticographic data</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/221051v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/221051v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The discovery of haemodynamic (BOLD-fMRI) resting-state networks (RSNs) has brought about a fundamental shift in our thinking about the role of intrinsic brain activity. The electrophysiological underpinnings of RSNs remain largely elusive and it has been shown only recently that electrophysiological cortical rhythms are organized into RSNs. Most electrophysiological studies into RSNs use magnetoencephalography (MEG) or electroencephalography (EEG), which limits the spatial scale on which RSNs can be investigated. Due to their close proximity to the cortical surface, electroencephalographic (ECoG) recordings can potentially provide a more detailed picture of the functional organization of resting-state cortical rhythms. In this study we propose using source-space independent component analysis for identifying generators of resting-state cortical rhythms as recorded with ECoG and reconstructing their network structure. Their network structure is characterized by two kinds of connectivity: instantaneous correlations between band-limited amplitude envelopes and oscillatory phase-locking. Using simulated data, we find that the reconstruction of oscillatory phase-locking is more challenging than that of amplitude correlations, particularly for low signal-to-noise levels. Specifically, phase-lags can both be over- and underestimated as a consequence of first-order and higher-order volume-conduction effects, which troubles the interpretation of interaction measures based on imaginary phase-locking or coherence. The methodology is applied to resting-state beta (15-30 Hz) rhythms within the motor system of a macaque monkey and leads to the identification of a functional network of seven cortical generators that are distributed across the sensorimotor system. The spatial extent of the identified generators, together with consistent phase-lags, suggests that these rhythms can be viewed as being spatially continuous with complex dynamics including traveling waves. Our findings illustrate the level of spatial detail attainable with source-projected ECoG and motivates wider use of the methodology for studying resting-state as well as event-related cortical dynamics in macaque and human.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Self-organised attractor dynamics in the developing head direction circuit.</title>

	<description>Head direction (HD) cells signal the orientation of an animal's head relative to its environment. During post-natal development, HD cells are the earliest spatially modulated neurons in the hippocampal circuit to emerge. However, before eye-opening, HD cell responses in rat pups carry low directional information content and are directionally unstable. Using Bayesian decoding, we characterise this instability and identify its source: despite the directional signal being internally coherent, it consistently under-signals angular head velocity (AHV), incompletely shifting in proportion to head turns. We find evidence that geometric cues (corners) can be used to mitigate this under-signalling, and stabilise the directional signal even before eye-opening. Crucially, even when directional firing cannot be stabilised, ensembles of unstable HD cells show short-timescale (1-10 sec) temporal and spatial couplings consistent with an adult-like HD network, through which activity drifts unanchored to landmark cues. The existence of fixed spatial and temporal offsets across co-recorded cells and of an AHV-responsive signal, even before HD responses become spatially stable, suggests that the HD circuit is assembled through internal, self-organising processes, without reference to external landmarks. The HD network is widely modelled as a continuous attractor whose output is one coherent activity peak, updated during movement by angular head velocity (AHV) signals, and anchored by landmark cues. Our findings present strong evidence for this model, and demonstrate that the required network circuitry is in place and functional during development, independent of reference to landmark information.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A Multilevel Computational Characterization of Endophenotypes in Addiction</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/220905v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Substance use disorders are characterized by a profound intersubject (phenotypic) variability in the expression of addictive symptomatology and propensity to relapse following treatment. However, laboratory investigations have primarily focused on common neural substrates in addiction, and have not yet been able to identify mechanisms that can account for the multifaceted phenotypic behaviors reported in literature. To investigate this knowledge gap theoretically, here we simulated phenotypic variations in addiction symptomology and responses to putative treatments, using both a neural model based on cortico-striatal circuit dynamics, and an algorithmic model of reinforcement learning. These simulations rely on the widely accepted assumption that both the ventral, model-based, goal-directed system and the dorsal, model-free, habitual system are vulnerable to extra-physiologic dopamine reinforcements triggered by drug consumption. We found that endophenotypic differences in the balance between the two circuit or control systems resulted in an inverted U-shape in optimal choice behavior. Specifically, greater unbalance led to a higher likelihood of developing addiction and more severe drug-taking behaviors. Furthermore, endophenotypes with opposite asymmetrical biases among cortico-striatal circuits expressed similar addiction behaviors, but responded differently to simulated treatments, suggesting personalized treatment development could rely on endophenotypic rather than phenotypic differentiations. We propose our simulated results, confirmed across neural and algorithmic levels of analysis, inform on a fundamental and, to date, neglected quantitative method to characterize clinical heterogeneity in addiction.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Spontaneous eye blink rate and dopamine synthesis capacity: Preliminary evidence for an absence of positive correlation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/215178v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/215178v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Dopamine is central to a number of cognitive functions and brain disorders. Given the cost of neurochemical imaging in humans, behavioral proxy measures of dopamine have gained in popularity in the past decade, such as spontaneous eye blink rate (sEBR). Increased sEBR is commonly associated with increased dopamine function based on pharmacological evidence and patient studies. Yet, this hypothesis has not been validated using in vivo measures of dopamine function in humans. In order to fill this gap, we measured sEBR and striatal dopamine synthesis capacity using [18F]DOPA PET in 20 participants (9 healthy individuals and 11 pathological gamblers). Our results, based on frequentist and Bayesian statistics, as well as region-of-interest and voxel-wise analyses, argue against a positive relationship between sEBR and striatal dopamine synthesis capacity. They show that, if anything, the evidence is in favor of a negative relationship. These results, which complement findings from a recent study that failed to observe a relationship between sEBR and dopamine D2 receptor availability, suggest that caution and nuance are warranted when interpreting sEBR in terms of a proxy measure of striatal dopamine.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The use of ambient humidity conditions to improve influenza forecast</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jeffrey Shaman, Sasikiran Kandula, Wan Yang, Alicia Karspeck&lt;/p&gt;

Laboratory and epidemiological evidence indicate that ambient humidity modulates the survival and transmission of influenza. Here we explore whether the inclusion of humidity forcing in mathematical models describing influenza transmission improves the accuracy of forecasts generated with those models. We generate retrospective forecasts for 95 cities over 10 seasons in the United States and assess both forecast accuracy and error. Overall, we find that humidity forcing improves forecast performance (at 1–4 lead weeks, 3.8% more peak week and 4.4% more peak intensity forecasts are accurate than with no forcing) and that forecasts generated using daily climatological humidity forcing generally outperform forecasts that utilize daily observed humidity forcing (4.4% and 2.6% respectively). These findings hold for predictions of outbreak peak intensity, peak timing, and incidence over 2- and 4-week horizons. The results indicate that use of climatological humidity forcing is warranted for current operational influenza forecast.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/i0JXQofTLZQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Estimating the probabilities of rare arrhythmic events in multiscale computational models of cardiac cells and tissue</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005783</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Mark A. Walker, Viatcheslav Gurev, John J. Rice, Joseph L. Greenstein, Raimond L. Winslow&lt;/p&gt;

Ectopic heartbeats can trigger reentrant arrhythmias, leading to ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death. Such events have been attributed to perturbed Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; handling in cardiac myocytes leading to spontaneous Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release and delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs). However, the ways in which perturbation of specific molecular mechanisms alters the probability of ectopic beats is not understood. We present a multiscale model of cardiac tissue incorporating a biophysically detailed three-dimensional model of the ventricular myocyte. This model reproduces realistic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; waves and DADs driven by stochastic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release channel (RyR) gating and is used to study mechanisms of DAD variability. In agreement with previous experimental and modeling studies, key factors influencing the distribution of DAD amplitude and timing include cytosolic and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentrations, inwardly rectifying potassium current (I&lt;sub&gt;K1&lt;/sub&gt;) density, and gap junction conductance. The cardiac tissue model is used to investigate how random RyR gating gives rise to probabilistic triggered activity in a one-dimensional myocyte tissue model. A novel spatial-average filtering method for estimating the probability of extreme (i.e. rare, high-amplitude) stochastic events from a limited set of spontaneous Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release profiles is presented. These events occur when randomly organized clusters of cells exhibit synchronized, high amplitude Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release flux. It is shown how reduced I&lt;sub&gt;K1&lt;/sub&gt; density and gap junction coupling, as observed in heart failure, increase the probability of extreme DADs by multiple orders of magnitude. This method enables prediction of arrhythmia likelihood and its modulation by alterations of other cellular mechanisms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HW_jVhxIPps&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Pitch and timbre discrimination at wave-to-spike transition in the cochlea. (arXiv:1711.05596v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05596</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05596</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A new definition of musical pitch is proposed. A Finite-Difference Time
Domain (FDTM) model of the cochlea is used to calculate spike trains caused by
tone complexes and by a recorded classical guitar tone. All harmonic tone
complexes, musical notes, show a narrow-band Interspike Interval (ISI) pattern
at the respective fundamental frequency of the tone complex. Still this
fundamental frequency is not only present at the bark band holding the
respective best frequency of this fundamental frequency, but rather at all bark
bands driven by the tone complex partials. This is caused by drop-outs in the
basically regular, periodic spike train in the respective bands. These
drop-outs are caused by the energy distribution in the wave form, where time
spans of low energy are not able to drive spikes. The presence of the
fundamental periodicity in all bark bands can be interpreted as pitch. Contrary
to pitch, timbre is represented as a wide distribution of different ISIs over
bark bands. The definition of pitch is shown to also works with residue
pitches. The spike drop-outs in times of low energy of the wave form also cause
undertones, integer multiple subdivisions in periodicity, but in no case
overtones can appear. This might explain the musical minor scale, which was
proposed to be caused by undertones already in 1880 by Hugo Riemann, still
until now without knowledge about any physical realization of such undertones.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Altered structural connectivity of the left visual thalamus in developmental dyslexia. (arXiv:1711.05517v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Developmental dyslexia is characterized by persistent reading and spelling
deficits. Partly due to technical challenges with investigating subcortical
sensory structures, current research on dyslexia in humans by-and-large focuses
on the cerebral cortex. These studies found that dyslexia is typically
associated with functional and structural alterations of a distributed
left-hemispheric cerebral cortex network. However, findings from animal models
and post-mortem studies in humans suggest that developmental dyslexia might
also be associated with structural alterations in subcortical sensory pathways.
Whether these alterations also exist in developmental dyslexia in-vivo and how
they relate to dyslexia symptoms is currently unknown. Here we used ultra-high
resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion MRI and
probabilistic tractography to investigate the structural connections of the
visual sensory pathway in dyslexia in-vivo. We discovered that individuals with
developmental dyslexia have reduced structural connections in the direct
pathway between the left visual thalamus (LGN) and left middle temporal area
V5/MT, but not between the left LGN and left primary visual cortex (V1). In
addition, left V5/MT-LGN connectivity strength correlated with rapid naming
abilities - a key deficit in dyslexia [14]. These findings provide the first
evidence of specific structural alterations in the connections between the
sensory thalamus and cortex in developmental dyslexia. The results challenge
current standard models and provide novel evidence for the importance of
cortico-thalamic interactions in explaining dyslexia.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Statistical crossover and nonextensive behavior of the neuronal short-term depression. (arXiv:1701.03164v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03164</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The theoretical basis of neuronal coding, associated with short term
degradation in synaptic transmission, is a matter of debate in the literature.
In fact, electrophysiological signals are commonly characterized as inversely
proportional to stimulus intensity. Among theoretical descriptions of this
phenomenon, models based on $1/f$-dependency are employed to investigate the
biophysical properties of the short term synaptic depression. In this work we
formulated a model based on a paradigmatic \textit{q}-differential equation to
obtain a generalized formalism useful for investigation of nonextensivity in
this specific type of synaptic plasticity. Our analysis reveals nonextensivity
in data from electrophysiological recordings and also a statistical crossover
in neurotransmission. In particular, statistical transitions providesadditional
support to the hypothesis of heterogeneous release probability of
neurotransmitters. On the other hand, the simple vesicle model agrees with data
only at low frequency stimulations. Thus, the present work presents a method to
demonstrate that short-term depression is not only governed by random
mechanisms but also by a nonextensive behavior. Our findings also conciliate
morphological and electrophysiological investigations into a coherent
biophysical scenario.

	<description>How Wnt signaling coordinates vascular remodeling and barrier maturation in the retina is poorly understood. Mazzoni et al. demonstrate that mice lacking Apcdd1 exhibit decreased vessel pruning and precocious formation of the blood-retina barrier. Conversely, Apcdd1 overexpression in endothelial cells induces the opposite phenotype. Apcdd1 precisely sculpts Wnt activity to coordinate vascular pruning and barrier maturation.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Age-accelerated cognitive decline in asymptomatic adults with CSF {beta}-amyloid</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/220756v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Objective: Compare cognitive and hippocampal volume (HCV) trajectories in asymptomatic middle-aged and older adults with positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) or tau to adults without an AD-associated biomarker profile. Method: 392 adults enrolled in a longitudinal cohort study (Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention or Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center) completed a lumbar puncture and at least two biennial or annual neuropsychological evaluations. Cutoffs for A{beta}42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau were developed via receiver operating characteristic curve analyses on a sample of 78 participants (38 dementia, 40 controls). These cutoffs were applied to a separate sample of 314 cognitively healthy adults (mean age at CSF collection = 61.5) and mixed-effects regression analyses tested linear and quadratic interactions of biomarker group x age at each visit on cognitive and HCV outcomes. Results: 215 participants (69%) were biomarker negative (preclinical AD Stage 0), 46 (15%) were A{beta}+ only (preclinical AD Stage 1), 25 (8%) were A{beta}+ and tau+ (preclinical AD Stage 2), and 28 (9%) were tau+ only. Both Stage 1 and Stage 2 groups exhibited greater rates of linear decline on story memory and processing speed measures, and non-linear decline on list-learning and set-shifting measures compared to Stage 0. The tau+ only group did not significantly differ from Stage 0 in rates of cognitive decline. Conclusion: In an asymptomatic at-risk cohort, elevated CSF A{beta} (with or without elevated tau) was associated with greater rates of cognitive decline, with the specific pattern of decline varying across cognitive measures.</description>

	<description>Speech is a critical form of human communication and is central to our daily lives. Yet, despite decades of study, an understanding of the fundamental neural control of speech production remains incomplete. Current theories model speech production as a hierarchy from sentences and phrases down to words, syllables, speech sounds (phonemes) and the movements of speech articulator muscles used to produce these sounds (articulatory gestures). Here, we investigate the cortical representation of articulatory gestures and phonemes in speech motor, premotor, and inferior frontal cortices. Our results indicate that primary motor and premotor areas represent gestures to a greater extent than phonemes, while inferior frontal cortex represents both gestures and phonemes. These findings suggest that the cortical control of speech production shares a common representation with that of other types of movement, such as arm and hand movements.</description>

Compositional data consist of vectors of proportions normalized to a constant sum from a basis of unobserved counts. The sum constraint makes inference on correlations between unconstrained features challenging due to the information loss from normalization. However, such correlations are of long-standing interest in fields including ecology. We propose a novel Bayesian framework (BAnOCC: Bayesian Analysis of Compositional Covariance) to estimate a sparse precision matrix through a LASSO prior. The resulting posterior, generated by MCMC sampling, allows uncertainty quantification of any function of the precision matrix, including the correlation matrix. We also use a first-order Taylor expansion to approximate the transformation from the unobserved counts to the composition in order to investigate what characteristics of the unobserved counts can make the correlations more or less difficult to infer. On simulated datasets, we show that BAnOCC infers the true network as well as previous methods while offering the advantage of posterior inference. Larger and more realistic simulated datasets further showed that BAnOCC performs well as measured by type I and type II error rates. Finally, we apply BAnOCC to a microbial ecology dataset from the Human Microbiome Project, which in addition to reproducing established ecological results revealed unique, competition-based roles for Proteobacteria in multiple distinct habitats.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3ybTOXu3yrQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The olfactory bulb transforms not only the information content of the primary sensory representation, but also its underlying coding metric. High-variance, slow-timescale primary odor representations are transformed by bulbar circuitry into secondary representations based on principal neuron spike patterns that are tightly regulated in time. This emergent fast timescale for signaling is reflected in gamma-band local field potentials, presumably serving to efficiently integrate olfactory sensory information into the temporally regulated information networks of the central nervous system. To understand this transformation and its integration with interareal coordination mechanisms requires that we understand its fundamental dynamical principles. Using a biophysically explicit, multiscale model of olfactory bulb circuitry, we here demonstrate that an inhibition-coupled intrinsic oscillator framework, pyramidal resonance interneuron network gamma (PRING), best captures the diversity of physiological properties exhibited by the olfactory bulb. Most importantly, these properties include global zero-phase synchronization in the gamma band, the phase-restriction of informative spikes in principal neurons with respect to this common clock, and the robustness of this synchronous oscillatory regime to multiple challenging conditions observed in the biological system. These conditions include substantial heterogeneities in afferent activation levels and excitatory synaptic weights, high levels of uncorrelated background activity among principal neurons, and spike frequencies in both principal neurons and interneurons that are irregular in time and much lower than the gamma frequency. This coupled cellular oscillator architecture permits stable and replicable ensemble responses to diverse sensory stimuli under various external conditions as well as to changes in network parameters arising from learning-dependent synaptic plasticity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AGOv1I-gt9I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Common Synaptic Input to Motor Neurons and Neural Drive to Targeted Reinnervated Muscles</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11285?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We compared the behavior of motor neurons innervating their physiological muscle targets with motor neurons from the same spinal segment whose axons were surgically redirected to remnant muscles (targeted muscle reinnervation). The objective was to assess whether motor neurons with nonphysiological innervation receive similar synaptic input and could be voluntary controlled as motor neurons with natural innervation. For this purpose, we acquired high-density EMG signals from the biceps brachii in 5 male transhumeral amputees who underwent targeted reinnervation of this muscle by the ulnar nerve and from the first dorsal interosseous muscle of 5 healthy individuals to investigate the natural innervation of the ulnar nerve. The same recordings were also performed from the biceps brachii muscle of additional 5 able-bodied individuals. The EMG signals were decomposed into discharges of motor unit action potentials. Motor neurons were progressively recruited for the full range of submaximal muscle activation in all conditions. Moreover, their discharge rate significantly increased from recruitment to target activation level in a similar way across the subject groups. Motor neurons across all subject groups received common synaptic input as identified by coherence analysis of their spike trains. However, the relative strength of common input in both the delta (0.5–5 Hz) and alpha (5–13 Hz) bands was significantly smaller for the surgically reinnervated motor neuron pool with respect to the corresponding physiologically innervated one. The results support the novel approach of motor neuron interfacing for prosthesis control and provide new insights into the role of afferent input on motor neuron activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Targeted muscle reinnervation surgically redirects nerves that lost their target in the amputation into redundant muscles in the region of the stump. The study of the behavior of motor neurons following this surgery is needed for designing biologically inspired prosthetic control strategies. Moreover, targeted muscle reinnervation offers a human experimental framework for studying the control and behavior of motor neurons when changing their target innervated muscle fibers and sensory feedback. Here, we show that the control of motor neurons and their synaptic input, following reinnervation, was remarkably similar to that of the physiological innervation, although with reduced common drive at some frequencies. The results advance our knowledge on the role of sensory input in the generation of the neural drive to muscles and provide the basis for designing physiologically inspired methods for prosthesis control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Gain-of-Function Integrin {beta}3 Pro33 Variant Alters the Serotonin System in the Mouse Brain</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Engagement of integrins by the extracellular matrix initiates signaling cascades that drive a variety of cellular functions, including neuronal migration and axonal pathfinding in the brain. Multiple lines of evidence link the &lt;i&gt;ITGB3&lt;/i&gt; gene encoding the integrin β3 subunit with the serotonin (5-HT) system, likely via its modulation of the 5-HT transporter (SERT). The &lt;i&gt;ITGB3&lt;/i&gt; coding polymorphism Leu33Pro (rs5918, Pl&lt;sup&gt;A2&lt;/sup&gt;) produces hyperactive αvβ3 receptors that influence whole-blood 5-HT levels and may influence the risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Using a phenome-wide scan of psychiatric diagnoses, we found significant, male-specific associations between the Pro33 allele and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and ASDs. Here, we used knock-in (KI) mice expressing an &lt;i&gt;Itgb3&lt;/i&gt; variant that phenocopies the human Pro33 variant to elucidate the consequences of constitutively enhanced αvβ3 signaling to the 5-HT system in the brain. KI mice displayed deficits in multiple behaviors, including anxiety, repetitive, and social behaviors. Anatomical studies revealed a significant decrease in 5-HT synapses in the midbrain, accompanied by decreases in SERT activity and reduced localization of SERTs to integrin adhesion complexes in synapses of KI mice. Inhibition of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) rescued SERT function in synapses of KI mice, demonstrating that constitutive active FAK signaling downstream of the Pro32Pro33 integrin αvβ3 suppresses SERT activity. Our studies identify a complex regulation of 5-HT homeostasis and behaviors by integrin αvβ3, revealing an important role for integrins in modulating risk for neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The integrin β3 Leu33Pro coding polymorphism has been associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) within a subgroup of patients with elevated blood 5-HT levels, linking integrin β3, 5-HT, and ASD risk. We capitalized on these interactions to demonstrate that the Pro33 coding variation in the murine integrin β3 recapitulates the sex-dependent neurochemical and behavioral attributes of ASD. Using state-of-the-art techniques, we show that presynaptic 5-HT function is altered in these mice, and that the localization of 5-HT transporters to specific compartments within the synapse, disrupted by the integrin β3 Pro33 mutation, is critical for appropriate reuptake of 5-HT. Our studies provide fundamental insight into the genetic network regulating 5-HT neurotransmission in the CNS that is also associated with ASD risk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Activity-Dependent Facilitation of CaV1.3 Calcium Channels Promotes KCa3.1 Activation in Hippocampal Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11255?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1 L-type calcium channels are key to regulating neuronal excitability, with the range of functional roles enhanced by interactions with calmodulin, accessory proteins, or CaMKII that modulate channel activity. In hippocampal pyramidal cells, a prominent elevation of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1 activity is apparent in late channel openings that can last for seconds following a depolarizing stimulus train. The current study tested the hypothesis that a reported interaction among Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3 channels, the scaffolding protein densin, and CaMKII could generate a facilitation of channel activity that outlasts a depolarizing stimulus. We found that Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3 but not Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 channels exhibit a long-duration calcium-dependent facilitation (L-CDF) that lasts up to 8 s following a brief 50 Hz stimulus train, but only when coexpressed with densin and CaMKII. To test the physiological role for Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3 L-CDF, we coexpressed the intermediate-conductance KCa3.1 potassium channel, revealing a strong functional coupling to Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3 channel activity that was accentuated by densin and CaMKII. Moreover, the Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3–densin–CaMKII interaction gave rise to an outward tail current of up to 8 s duration following a depolarizing stimulus in both tsA-201 cells and male rat CA1 pyramidal cells. A slow afterhyperpolarization in pyramidal cells was reduced by a selective block of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1 channels by isradipine, a CaMKII blocker, and siRNA knockdown of densin, and spike frequency increased upon selective block of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1 channel conductance. The results are important in revealing a Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3–densin–CaMKII interaction that extends the contribution of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3 calcium influx to a time frame well beyond a brief input train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1 L-type calcium channels play a key role in regulating the output of central neurons by providing calcium influx during repetitive inputs. This study identifies a long-duration calcium-dependent facilitation (L-CDF) of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3 channels that depends on the scaffolding protein densin and CaMKII and that outlasts a depolarizing stimulus by seconds. We further show a tight functional coupling between Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3 calcium influx and the intermediate-conductance KCa3.1 potassium channel that promotes an outward tail current of up to 8 s following a depolarizing stimulus. Tests in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells reveal that a slow AHP is reduced by blocking different components of the Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3-densin-CaMKII interaction, identifying an important role for Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3 L-CDF in regulating neuronal excitability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dmrt5, a Novel Neurogenic Factor, Reciprocally Regulates Lhx2 to Control the Neuron-Glia Cell-Fate Switch in the Developing Hippocampus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11245?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11245?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Regulation of the neuron–glia cell-fate switch is a critical step in the development of the CNS. Previously, we demonstrated that Lhx2 is a necessary and sufficient regulator of this process in the mouse hippocampal primordium, such that Lhx2 overexpression promotes neurogenesis and suppresses gliogenesis, whereas loss of Lhx2 has the opposite effect. We tested a series of transcription factors for their ability to mimic Lhx2 overexpression and suppress baseline gliogenesis, and also to compensate for loss of Lhx2 and suppress the resulting enhanced level of gliogenesis in the hippocampus. Here, we demonstrate a novel function of Dmrt5/Dmrta2 as a neurogenic factor in the developing hippocampus. We show that Dmrt5, as well as known neurogenic factors Neurog2 and Pax6, can each not only mimic &lt;i&gt;Lhx2&lt;/i&gt; overexpression, but also can compensate for loss of Lhx2 to different extents. We further uncover a reciprocal regulatory relationship between Dmrt5 and Lhx2, such that each can compensate for loss of the other. Dmrt5 and Lhx2 also have opposing regulatory control on &lt;i&gt;Pax6&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Neurog2&lt;/i&gt;, indicating a complex bidirectionally regulated network that controls the neuron–glia cell-fate switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We identify Dmrt5 as a novel regulator of the neuron–glia cell-fate switch in the developing hippocampus. We demonstrate Dmrt5 to be neurogenic, and reciprocally regulated by Lhx2: loss of either factor promotes gliogenesis; overexpression of either factor suppresses gliogenesis and promotes neurogenesis; each can substitute for loss of the other. Furthermore, each factor has opposing effects on established neurogenic genes &lt;i&gt;Neurog2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pax6&lt;/i&gt;. Dmrt5 is known to suppress their expression, and we show that Lhx2 is required to maintain it. Our study reveals a complex regulatory network with bidirectional control of a fundamental feature of CNS development, the control of the production of neurons versus astroglia in the developing hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we confirm that Lhx2 binds a highly conserved putative enhancer of &lt;i&gt;Dmrt5&lt;/i&gt;, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved regulatory relationship between these factors. Our findings uncover a complex network that involves Lhx2, Dmrt5, Neurog2, and Pax6, and that ensures the appropriate amount and timing of neurogenesis and gliogenesis in the developing hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Baseline Levels of Rapid Eye Movement Sleep May Protect Against Excessive Activity in Fear-Related Neural Circuitry</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11233?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11233?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sleep, and particularly rapid eye movement sleep (REM), has been implicated in the modulation of neural activity following fear conditioning and extinction in both human and animal studies. It has long been presumed that such effects play a role in the formation and persistence of posttraumatic stress disorder, of which sleep impairments are a core feature. However, to date, few studies have thoroughly examined the potential effects of sleep prior to conditioning on subsequent acquisition of fear learning in humans. Furthermore, these studies have been restricted to analyzing the effects of a single night of sleep—thus assuming a state-like relationship between the two. In the current study, we used long-term mobile sleep monitoring and functional neuroimaging (fMRI) to explore whether trait-like variations in sleep patterns, measured in advance in both male and female participants, predict subsequent patterns of neural activity during fear learning. Our results indicate that higher baseline levels of REM sleep predict reduced fear-related activity in, and connectivity between, the hippocampus, amygdala and ventromedial PFC during conditioning. Additionally, skin conductance responses (SCRs) were weakly correlated to the activity in the amygdala. Conversely, there was no direct correlation between REM sleep and SCRs, indicating that REM may only modulate fear acquisition indirectly. In a follow-up experiment, we show that these results are replicable, though to a lesser extent, when measuring sleep over a single night just before conditioning. As such, baseline sleep parameters may be able to serve as biomarkers for resilience, or lack thereof, to trauma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Numerous studies over the past two decades have established a clear role of sleep in fear-learning processes. However, previous work has focused on the effects of sleep following fear acquisition, thus neglecting the potential effects of baseline sleep levels on the acquisition itself. The current study provides the first evidence in humans of such an effect. Specifically, the results of this study suggest that baseline rapid eye movement (REM) sleep may serve a protective function against enhanced fear encoding through the modulation of connectivity between the hippocampus, amygdala, and the ventromedial PFC. Building on this finding, baseline REM measurements may serve as a noninvasive biomarker for resilience to trauma or, conversely, to the potential development of posttraumatic stress disorder following trauma.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sensorimotor Processing in the Basal Ganglia Leads to Transient Beta Oscillations during Behavior</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11220?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11220?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brief epochs of beta oscillations have been implicated in sensorimotor control in the basal ganglia of task-performing healthy animals. However, which neural processes underlie their generation and how they are affected by sensorimotor processing remains unclear. To determine the mechanisms underlying transient beta oscillations in the LFP, we combined computational modeling of the subthalamo-pallidal network for the generation of beta oscillations with realistic stimulation patterns derived from single-unit data recorded from different basal ganglia subregions in rats performing a cued choice task. In the recordings, we found distinct firing patterns in the striatum, globus pallidus, and subthalamic nucleus related to sensory and motor events during the behavioral task. Using these firing patterns to generate realistic inputs to our network model led to transient beta oscillations with the same time course as the rat LFP data. In addition, our model can account for further nonintuitive aspects of beta modulation, including beta phase resets after sensory cues and correlations with reaction time. Overall, our model can explain how the combination of temporally regulated sensory responses of the subthalamic nucleus, ramping activity of the subthalamic nucleus, and movement-related activity of the globus pallidus leads to transient beta oscillations during behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Transient beta oscillations emerge in the normal functioning cortico-basal ganglia loop during behavior. Here, we used a unique approach connecting a computational model closely with experimental data. In this way, we achieved a simulation environment for our model that mimics natural input patterns in awake, behaving animals. We demonstrate that a computational model for beta oscillations in Parkinson's disease (PD) can also account for complex patterns of transient beta oscillations in healthy animals. Therefore, we propose that transient beta oscillations in healthy animals share the same mechanism with pathological beta oscillations in PD. This important result connects functional and pathological roles of beta oscillations in the basal ganglia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dissociation of Self-Motion and Object Motion by Linear Population Decoding That Approximates Marginalization</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11204?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11204?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We use visual image motion to judge the movement of objects, as well as our own movements through the environment. Generally, image motion components caused by object motion and self-motion are confounded in the retinal image. Thus, to estimate heading, the brain would ideally marginalize out the effects of object motion (or vice versa), but little is known about how this is accomplished neurally. Behavioral studies suggest that vestibular signals play a role in dissociating object motion and self-motion, and recent computational work suggests that a linear decoder can approximate marginalization by taking advantage of diverse multisensory representations. By measuring responses of MSTd neurons in two male rhesus monkeys and by applying a recently-developed method to approximate marginalization by linear population decoding, we tested the hypothesis that vestibular signals help to dissociate self-motion and object motion. We show that vestibular signals stabilize tuning for heading in neurons with congruent visual and vestibular heading preferences, whereas they stabilize tuning for object motion in neurons with discrepant preferences. Thus, vestibular signals enhance the separability of joint tuning for object motion and self-motion. We further show that a linear decoder, designed to approximate marginalization, allows the population to represent either self-motion or object motion with good accuracy. Decoder weights are broadly consistent with a readout strategy, suggested by recent computational work, in which responses are decoded according to the vestibular preferences of multisensory neurons. These results demonstrate, at both single neuron and population levels, that vestibular signals help to dissociate self-motion and object motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The brain often needs to estimate one property of a changing environment while ignoring others. This can be difficult because multiple properties of the environment may be confounded in sensory signals. The brain can solve this problem by marginalizing over irrelevant properties to estimate the property-of-interest. We explore this problem in the context of self-motion and object motion, which are inherently confounded in the retinal image. We examine how diversity in a population of multisensory neurons may be exploited to decode self-motion and object motion from the population activity of neurons in macaque area MSTd.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Correlated Disruption of Resting-State fMRI, LFP, and Spike Connectivity between Area 3b and S2 following Spinal Cord Injury in Monkeys</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11192?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11192?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This study aims to understand how functional connectivity (FC) between areas 3b and S2 alters following input deprivation and the neuronal basis of disrupted FC of resting-state fMRI signals. We combined submillimeter fMRI with microelectrode recordings to localize the deafferented digit regions in areas 3b and S2 by mapping tactile stimulus-evoked fMRI activations before and after cervical dorsal column lesion in each male monkey. An average afferent disruption of 97% significantly reduced fMRI, local field potential (LFP), and spike responses to stimuli in both areas. Analysis of resting-state fMRI signal correlation, LFP coherence, and spike cross-correlation revealed significantly reduced functional connectivity between deafferented areas 3b and S2. The degrees of reductions in stimulus responsiveness and FC after deafferentation differed across fMRI, LFP, and spiking signals. The reduction of FC was much weaker than that of stimulus-evoked responses. Whereas the largest stimulus-evoked signal drop (~80%) was observed in LFP signals, the greatest FC reduction was detected in the spiking activity (~30%). fMRI signals showed mild reductions in stimulus responsiveness (~25%) and FC (~20%). The overall deafferentation-induced changes were quite similar in areas 3b and S2 across signals. Here we demonstrated that FC strength between areas 3b and S2 was much weakened by dorsal column lesion, and stimulus response reduction and FC disruption in fMRI covary with those of LFP and spiking signals in deafferented areas 3b and S2. These findings have important implications for fMRI studies aiming to probe FC alterations in pathological conditions involving deafferentation in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; By directly comparing fMRI, local field potential, and spike signals in both tactile stimulation and resting states before and after severe disruption of dorsal column afferent, we demonstrated that reduction in fMRI responses to stimuli is accompanied by weakened resting-state fMRI functional connectivity (FC) in input-deprived and reorganized digit regions in area 3b of the S1 and S2. Concurrent reductions in local field potential and spike FC validated the use of resting-state fMRI signals for probing neural intrinsic FC alterations in pathological deafferented cortex, and indicated that disrupted FC between mesoscale functionally highly related regions may contribute to the behavioral impairments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Plasticity of Signaling by Spinal Estrogen Receptor {alpha}, {kappa}-Opioid Receptor, and Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors over the Rat Reproductive Cycle Regulates Spinal Endomorphin 2 Antinociception: Relevance of Endogenous-Biased Agonism</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11181?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11181?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We previously showed that intrathecal application of endomorphin 2 [EM2; the highly specific endogenous μ-opioid receptor (MOR) ligand] induces antinociception that varies with stage of the rat estrous cycle: minimal during diestrus and prominent during proestrus. Earlier studies, however, did not identify proestrus-activated signaling strategies that enable spinal EM2 antinociception. We now report that in female rats, increased spinal dynorphin release and -opioid receptor (KOR) signaling, as well as the emergence of glutamate-activated metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) signaling, are critical to the transition from an EM2 nonresponsive state (during diestrus) to an analgesically responsive state (during proestrus). Differential signaling by mGluR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, depending on its activation by membrane estrogen receptor α (mERα; during diestrus) versus glutamate (during proestrus), concomitant with the ebb and flow of spinal dynorphin/KOR signaling, functions as a switch, preventing or promoting, respectively, spinal EM2 antinociception. Importantly, EM2 and glutamate-containing varicosities appose spinal neurons that express MOR along with mGluRs and mERα, suggesting that signaling mechanisms regulating analgesic effectiveness of intrathecally applied EM2 also pertain to endogenous EM2. Regulation of spinal EM2 antinociception by both the nature of the endogenous mGluR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; activator (i.e., endogenous biased agonism at mGluR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and changes in spinal dynorphin/KOR signaling represent a novel mechanism for modulating analgesic responsiveness to endogenous EM2 (and perhaps other opioids). This points the way for developing noncanonical pharmacological approaches to pain management by harnessing endogenous opioids for pain relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The current prescription opioid abuse epidemic underscores the urgency to develop alternative pharmacotherapies for managing pain. We find that the magnitude of spinal endomorphin 2 (EM2) antinociception not only varies with stage of reproductive cycle, but is also differentially regulated during diestrus and proestrus. This finding highlights the need for sex-specific and cycle-specific approaches to pain management. Additionally, our finding that spinal EM2 antinociception in female rats is regulated by both the ebb and flow of spinal dynorphin/-opioid receptor signaling over the estrous cycle, as well as the nature of the endogenous mGluR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; activator, could encourage noncanonical pharmacological approaches to pain management, such as harnessing endogenous opioids for pain relief.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell shows unique dopamine (DA) signals &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and plays a unique role in DA-dependent behaviors such as reward-motivated learning and the response to drugs of abuse. A disynaptic mechanism for DA release was reported and shown to require synchronized firing of cholinergic interneurons (CINs) and activation of nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors (nAChRs) in DA neuron (DAN) axons. The properties of this disynaptic mechanism of DA transmission are not well understood in the NAc shell. In this study, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; fast-scan cyclic voltammetry was used to examine the modulation of DA transmission evoked by CINs firing in the shell of mice and compared with other striatal regions. We found that DA signals in the shell displayed significant degree of summation in response to train stimulation of CINs, contrary to core and dorsal striatum. The summation was amplified by a D2-like receptor antagonist and experiments with mice with targeted deletion of D2 receptors to DANs or CINs revealed that D2 receptors in CINs mediate a fast inhibition observed within 100 ms of the first pulse, whereas D2 autoreceptors in DAN terminals are engaged in a slower inhibition that peaks at ~500 ms. ACh also contributes to the use-dependent inhibition of DA release through muscarinic receptors only in the shell, where higher activity of acetylcholinesterase minimizes nAChR desensitization and promotes summation. These findings show that DA signals are modulated differentially by endogenous DA and ACh in the shell, which may underlie the unique features of shell DA signals &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The present study reports that dopamine (DA) release evoked by activation of cholinergic interneurons displays a high degree of summation in the shell and shows unique modulation by endogenous DA and acetylcholine. Desensitization of nicotinic receptors, which is a prevailing mechanism for use-dependent inhibition in the nucleus accumbens core and dorsal striatum, is also minimal in the shell in part due to elevated acetylcholinesterase activity. This distinctive modulation of DA transmission in the shell may have functional implications in the acquisition of reward-motivated behaviors and reward seeking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Mitochondrial Calcium Dysregulation Contributes to Dendrite Degeneration Mediated by PD/LBD-Associated LRRK2 Mutants</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) contribute to development of late-onset familial Parkinson's disease (PD), with clinical features of motor and cognitive dysfunction indistinguishable from sporadic PD. Calcium dysregulation plays an important role in PD pathogenesis, but the mechanisms of neurodegeneration remain unclear. Recent reports indicate enhanced excitatory neurotransmission in cortical neurons expressing mutant LRRK2, which occurs before the well-characterized phenotype of dendritic shortening. As mitochondria play a major role in the rapid buffering of cytosolic calcium, we hypothesized that altered mitochondrial calcium handling contributes to dendritic retraction elicited by the LRRK2-G2019S and -R1441C mutations. In primary mouse cortical neurons, we observed increased depolarization-induced mitochondrial calcium uptake. We found that expression of mutant LRRK2 elicited transcriptional upregulation of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) and the mitochondrial calcium uptake 1 protein (MICU1) with no change in levels of the mitochondrial calcium antiporter NCLX. Elevated MCU and MICU1 were also observed in LRRK2-mutated patient fibroblasts, along with increased mitochondrial calcium uptake, and in postmortem brains of sporadic PD/PDD patients of both sexes. Transcriptional upregulation of MCU and MICU1 was caused by activation of the ERK1/2 (MAPK3/1) pathway. Inhibiting ERK1/2 conferred protection against mutant LRRK2-induced neurite shortening. Pharmacological inhibitors or RNAi knockdown of MCU attenuated mitochondrial calcium uptake and dendritic/neuritic shortening elicited by mutant LRRK2, whereas expression of a constitutively active mutant of NCLX that enhances calcium export from mitochondria was neuroprotective. These data suggest that an increased susceptibility to mitochondrial calcium dysregulation contributes to dendritic injury in mutant LRRK2 pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cognitive dysfunction and dementia are common features of Parkinson's disease (PD), causing significant disability. Mutations in LRRK2 represent the most common known genetic cause of PD. We found that PD-linked LRRK2 mutations increased dendritic and mitochondrial calcium uptake in cortical neurons and familial PD patient fibroblasts, accompanied by increased expression of the mitochondrial calcium transporter MCU. Blocking the ERK1/2-dependent upregulation of MCU conferred protection against mutant LRRK2-elicited dendrite shortening, as did inhibiting MCU-mediated calcium import. Conversely, stimulating the export of calcium from mitochondria was also neuroprotective. These results implicate increased susceptibility to mitochondrial calcium overload in LRRK2-driven neurodegeneration, and suggest possible interventions that may slow the progression of cognitive dysfunction in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Overactivity of Liver-Related Neurons in the Paraventricular Nucleus of the Hypothalamus: Electrophysiological Findings in db/db Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11140?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Preautonomic neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus play a large role in the regulation of hepatic functions via the autonomic nervous system. Activation of hepatic sympathetic nerves increases glucose and lipid metabolism and contributes to the elevated hepatic glucose production observed in the type 2 diabetic condition. This augmented sympathetic output could originate from altered activity of liver-related PVN neurons. Remarkably, despite the importance of the brain-liver pathway, the cellular properties of liver-related neurons are not known. In this study, we provide the first evidence of overall activity of liver-related PVN neurons. Liver-related PVN neurons were identified with a retrograde, trans-synaptic, viral tracer in male lean and &lt;i&gt;db/db&lt;/i&gt; mice and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were conducted. In &lt;i&gt;db/db&lt;/i&gt; mice, the majority of liver-related PVN neurons fired spontaneously; whereas, in lean mice the majority of liver-related PVN neurons were silent, indicating that liver-related PVN neurons are more active in &lt;i&gt;db/db&lt;/i&gt; mice. Persistent, tonic inhibition was identified in liver-related PVN neurons; although, the magnitude of tonic inhibitory control was not different between lean and &lt;i&gt;db/db&lt;/i&gt; mice. In addition, our study revealed that the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1-dependent increase of excitatory neurotransmission was reduced in liver-related PVN neurons of &lt;i&gt;db/db&lt;/i&gt; mice. These findings demonstrate plasticity of liver-related PVN neurons and a shift toward excitation in a diabetic mouse model. Our study suggests altered autonomic circuits at the level of the PVN, which can contribute to autonomic dysfunction and dysregulation of neural control of hepatic functions including glucose metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; A growing body of evidence suggests the importance of the autonomic control in the regulation of hepatic metabolism, which plays a major role in the development and progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Despite the importance of the brain-liver pathway, the overall activity of liver-related neurons in control and diabetic conditions is not known. This is a significant gap in knowledge, which prevents developing strategies to improve glucose homeostasis via altering the brain-liver pathway. One of the key findings of our study is the overall shift toward excitation in liver-related hypothalamic neurons in the diabetic condition. This overactivity may be one of the underlying mechanisms of elevated sympathetic activity known in metabolically compromised patients and animal models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cadherin-10 Maintains Excitatory/Inhibitory Ratio through Interactions with Synaptic Proteins</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11127?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Appropriate excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance is essential for normal cortical function and is altered in some psychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Cell-autonomous molecular mechanisms that control the balance of excitatory and inhibitory synapse function remain poorly understood; no proteins that regulate excitatory and inhibitory synapse strength in a coordinated reciprocal manner have been identified. Using super-resolution imaging, electrophysiology, and molecular manipulations, we show that cadherin-10, encoded by &lt;i&gt;CDH10&lt;/i&gt; within the ASD risk locus 5p14.1, maintains both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic scaffold structure in cultured cortical neurons from rats of both sexes. Cadherin-10 localizes to both excitatory and inhibitory synapses in neocortex, where it is organized into nanoscale puncta that influence the size of their associated PSDs. Knockdown of cadherin-10 reduces excitatory but increases inhibitory synapse size and strength, altering the E/I ratio in cortical neurons. Furthermore, cadherin-10 exhibits differential participation in complexes with PSD-95 and gephyrin, which may underlie its role in maintaining the E/I ratio. Our data provide a new mechanism whereby a protein encoded by a common ASD risk factor controls E/I ratios by regulating excitatory and inhibitory synapses in opposing directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The correct balance between excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) is crucial for normal brain function and is altered in psychiatric disorders such as autism. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie this balance remain elusive. To address this, we studied cadherin-10, an adhesion protein that is genetically linked to autism and understudied at the cellular level. Using a combination of advanced microscopy techniques and electrophysiology, we show that cadherin-10 forms nanoscale puncta at excitatory and inhibitory synapses, maintains excitatory and inhibitory synaptic structure, and is essential for maintaining the correct balance between excitation and inhibition in neuronal dendrites. These findings reveal a new mechanism by which E/I balance is controlled in neurons and may bear relevance to synaptic dysfunction in autism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Protein Kinase A Deregulation in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex Impairs Working Memory in Murine Oligophrenin-1 Deficiency</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Classical and systems genetics have identified wide networks of genes associated with cognitive and neurodevelopmental diseases. In parallel to deciphering the role of each of these genes in neuronal or synaptic function, evaluating the response of neuronal and molecular networks to gene loss of function could reveal some pathophysiological mechanisms potentially accessible to nongenetic therapies. Loss of function of the Rho-GAP oligophrenin-1 is associated with cognitive impairments in both human and mouse. Upregulation of both PKA and ROCK has been reported in &lt;i&gt;Ophn1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice, but it remains unclear whether kinase hyperactivity contributes to the behavioral phenotypes. In this study, we thoroughly characterized a prominent perseveration phenotype displayed by &lt;i&gt;Ophn1&lt;/i&gt;-deficient mice using a Y-maze spatial working memory (SWM) test. We report that &lt;i&gt;Ophn1&lt;/i&gt; deficiency in the mouse generated severe cognitive impairments, characterized by both a high occurrence of perseverative behaviors and a lack of deliberation during the SWM test. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; pharmacological experiments suggest that PKA dysregulation in the mPFC underlies cognitive dysfunction in &lt;i&gt;Ophn1&lt;/i&gt;-deficient mice, as assessed using a delayed spatial alternation task results. Functionally, mPFC neuronal networks appeared to be affected in a PKA-dependent manner, whereas hippocampal-PFC projections involved in SWM were not affected in &lt;i&gt;Ophn1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/y&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Thus, we propose that discrete gene mutations in intellectual disability might generate &quot;secondary&quot; pathophysiological mechanisms, which are prone to become pharmacological targets for curative strategies in adult patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Here we report that &lt;i&gt;Ophn1&lt;/i&gt; deficiency generates severe impairments in performance at spatial working memory tests, characterized by a high occurrence of perseverative behaviors and a lack of decision making. This cognitive deficit is consecutive to PKA deregulation in the mPFC that prevents &lt;i&gt;Ophn1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice to exploit a correctly acquired rule. Functionally, mPFC neuronal networks appear to be affected in a PKA-dependent manner, whereas behaviorally important hippocampal projections were preserved by the mutation. Thus, we propose that discrete gene mutations in intellectual disability can generate &quot;secondary&quot; pathophysiological mechanisms prone to become pharmacological targets for curative strategies in adults.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Strength of Temporal White Matter Pathways Predicts Semantic Learning</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Learning the associations between words and meanings is a fundamental human ability. Although the language network is cortically well defined, the role of the white matter pathways supporting novel word-to-meaning mappings remains unclear. Here, by using contextual and cross-situational word learning, we tested whether learning the meaning of a new word is related to the integrity of the language-related white matter pathways in 40 adults (18 women). The arcuate, uncinate, inferior-fronto-occipital and inferior-longitudinal fasciculi were virtually dissected using manual and automatic deterministic fiber tracking. Critically, the automatic method allowed assessing the white matter microstructure along the tract. Results demonstrate that the microstructural properties of the left inferior-longitudinal fasciculus predict contextual learning, whereas the left uncinate was associated with cross-situational learning. In addition, we identified regions of special importance within these pathways: the posterior middle temporal gyrus, thought to serve as a lexical interface and specifically related to contextual learning; the anterior temporal lobe, known to be an amodal hub for semantic processing and related to cross-situational learning; and the white matter near the hippocampus, a structure fundamental for the initial stages of new-word learning and, remarkably, related to both types of word learning. No significant associations were found for the inferior-fronto-occipital fasciculus or the arcuate. While previous results suggest that learning new phonological word forms is mediated by the arcuate fasciculus, these findings show that the temporal pathways are the crucial neural substrate supporting one of the most striking human abilities: our capacity to identify correct associations between words and meanings under referential indeterminacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The language-processing network is cortically (i.e., gray matter) well defined. However, the role of the white matter pathways that support novel word learning within this network remains unclear. In this work, we dissected language-related (arcuate, uncinate, inferior-fronto-occipital, and inferior-longitudinal) fasciculi using manual and automatic tracking. We found the left inferior-longitudinal fasciculus to be predictive of word-learning success in two word-to-meaning tasks: contextual and cross-situational learning paradigms. The left uncinate was predictive of cross-situational word learning. No significant correlations were found for the arcuate or the inferior-fronto-occipital fasciculus. While previous results showed that learning new phonological word forms is supported by the arcuate fasciculus, these findings demonstrate that learning new word-to-meaning associations is mainly dependent on temporal white matter pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dysregulation of the Mitochondrial Unfolded Protein Response Induces Non-Apoptotic Dopaminergic Neurodegeneration in C. elegans Models of Parkinson's Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11085?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Due to environmental insult or innate genetic deficiency, protein folding environments of the mitochondrial matrix are prone to dysregulation, prompting the activation of a specific organellar stress-response mechanism, the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR&lt;sup&gt;MT&lt;/sup&gt;). In &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, mitochondrial damage leads to nuclear translocation of the ATFS-1 transcription factor to activate the UPR&lt;sup&gt;MT&lt;/sup&gt;. After short-term acute stress has been mitigated, the UPR&lt;sup&gt;MT&lt;/sup&gt; is eventually suppressed to restore homeostasis to &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; hermaphrodites. In contrast, and reflective of the more chronic nature of progressive neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), here, we report the consequences of prolonged, cell-autonomous activation of the UPR&lt;sup&gt;MT&lt;/sup&gt; in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; dopaminergic neurons. We reveal that neuronal function and integrity decline rapidly with age, culminating in activity-dependent, non-apoptotic cell death. In a PD-like context wherein transgenic nematodes express the Lewy body constituent protein α-synuclein (αS), we not only find that this protein and its PD-associated disease variants have the capacity to induce the UPR&lt;sup&gt;MT&lt;/sup&gt;, but also that coexpression of αS and ATFS-1-associated dysregulation of the UPR&lt;sup&gt;MT&lt;/sup&gt; synergistically potentiate dopaminergic neurotoxicity. This genetic interaction is in parallel to mitophagic pathways dependent on the &lt;i&gt;C. elegans PINK1&lt;/i&gt; homolog, which is necessary for cellular resistance to chronic malfunction of the UPR&lt;sup&gt;MT&lt;/sup&gt;. Given the increasingly recognized role of mitochondrial quality control in neurodegenerative diseases, these studies illustrate, for the first time, an insidious aspect of mitochondrial signaling in which the UPR&lt;sup&gt;MT&lt;/sup&gt; pathway, under disease-associated, context-specific dysregulation, exacerbates disruption of dopaminergic neurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, resulting in the neurodegeneration characteristic of PD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Disruptions or alterations in the activation of pathways that regulate mitochondrial quality control have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases due in part to the central role of mitochondria in metabolism, ROS regulation, and proteostasis. The extent to which these pathways, including the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR&lt;sup&gt;MT&lt;/sup&gt;) and mitophagy, are active may predict severity and progression of these disorders, as well as sensitivity to compounding stressors. Furthermore, therapeutic strategies that aim to induce these pathways may benefit from increased study into cellular responses that arise from long-term or ectopic stimulation, especially in neuronal compartments. By demonstrating the detrimental consequences of prolonged cellular activation of the UPR&lt;sup&gt;MT&lt;/sup&gt;, we provide evidence that this pathway is not a universally beneficial mechanism because dysregulation has neurotoxic consequences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Ste20 Family Kinases MAP4K4, MINK1, and TNIK Converge to Regulate Stress-Induced JNK Signaling in Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The c-Jun-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway regulates nervous system development, axon regeneration, and neuronal degeneration after acute injury or in chronic neurodegenerative disease. Dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK) is required for stress-induced JNK signaling in neurons, yet the factors that initiate DLK/JNK pathway activity remain poorly defined. In the present study, we identify the Ste20 kinases MAP4K4, misshapen-like kinase 1 (MINK1 or MAP4K6) and TNIK Traf2- and Nck-interacting kinase (TNIK or MAP4K7), as upstream regulators of DLK/JNK signaling in neurons. Using a trophic factor withdrawal-based model of neurodegeneration in both male and female embryonic mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons, we show that MAP4K4, MINK1, and TNIK act redundantly to regulate DLK activation and downstream JNK-dependent phosphorylation of c-Jun in response to stress. Targeting MAP4K4, MINK1, and TNIK, but not any of these kinases individually, is sufficient to protect neurons potently from degeneration. Pharmacological inhibition of MAP4Ks blocks stabilization and phosphorylation of DLK within axons and subsequent retrograde translocation of the JNK signaling complex to the nucleus. These results position MAP4Ks as important regulators of the DLK/JNK signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neuronal degeneration occurs in disparate circumstances: during development to refine neuronal connections, after injury to clear damaged neurons, or pathologically during disease. The dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK)/c-Jun-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway represents a conserved regulator of neuronal injury signaling that drives both neurodegeneration and axon regeneration, yet little is known about the factors that initiate DLK activity. Here, we uncover a novel role for a subfamily of MAP4 kinases consisting of MAP4K4, Traf2- and Nck-interacting kinase (TNIK or MAP4K7), and misshapen-like kinase 1 (MINK1 or MAP4K6) in regulating DLK/JNK signaling in neurons. Inhibition of these MAP4Ks blocks stress-induced retrograde JNK signaling and protects from neurodegeneration, suggesting that these kinases may represent attractive therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A memory mechanism based on two dimensional code of neurosome pattern. (arXiv:1711.05042v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We have recognized that 2D codes, i.e., a group of strongly connected
neurosomes that can be simultaneously excited, are the basic data carriers for
memory in a brain. An echoing mechanism between two neighboring layers of
neurosomes is assumed to establish temporary memory, and repeating processes
enhance the formation of long-term memory. Creation and degradation of memory
information are statistically. The maximum capacity of memory storage in a
human brain is estimated to be one billion of 2D codes. By triggering one or
more neurosomes in a neurosome-based 2D code, the whole strongly connected
neurosome network is capable of exciting simultaneously and projecting its
excitation onto an analysis layer of neurons in cortex, thus retrieving the
stored memory data. The capability of comparing two 2D codes in the analysis
layer is one of the major brain functions.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Modelling stochastic resonance in humans: the influence of lapse rate. (arXiv:1711.04950v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Adding noise to a sensory signal generally decreases human performance.
However noise can improve performance too, due to a process called stochastic
resonance (SR). This paradoxical effect may be exploited in psychophysical
experiments, to provide additional insights into how the sensory system deals
with noise. Here, I develop a model for stochastic resonance to study the
influence of noise on human perception, in which the biological parameter of
`lapse rate' was included. I show that the inclusion of lapse rate allows for
the occurrence of stochastic resonance in terms of the performance metric d'.
At the same time, I show that high levels of lapse rate cause stochastic
resonance to disappear. It is also shown that noise generated in the brain
(i.e., internal noise) may obscure any effect of stochastic resonance in
experimental settings. I further relate the model to a standard equivalent
noise model, the linear amplifier model, and show that the lapse rate can
function to scale the threshold versus noise (TvN) curve, similar to the
efficiency parameter in equivalent noise (EN) models. Therefore, lapse rate
provides a psychophysical explanation for reduced efficiency in EN paradigms.
Furthermore, I note that ignoring lapse rate may lead to an overestimation of
internal noise in equivalent noise paradigms. Overall, describing stochastic
resonance in terms of signal detection theory, with the inclusion of lapse
rate, may provide valuable new insights into how human performance depends on
internal and external noise.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A model of electrical impedance tomography on peripheral nerves for a neural-prosthetic control interface. (arXiv:1711.04377v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04377</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04377</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: A model is presented to evaluate the viability of using electrical
impedance tomography (EIT) with a nerve cuff to record neural activity in
peripheral nerves. Approach: Established modelling approaches in neural-EIT are
expanded on to be used, for the first time, on myelinated fibres which are
abundant in mammalian peripheral nerves and transmit motor commands. Main
results: Fibre impedance models indicate activity in unmyelinated fibres can be
screened out using operating frequencies above 100 Hz. At 1 kHz and 10 mm
electrode spacing, impedance magnitude of inactive intra-fascicle tissue and
the fraction changes during neural activity are estimated to be 1,142
{\Omega}.cm and -8.8x10-4, respectively, with a transverse current, and 328
{\Omega}.cm &amp;amp; -0.30, respectively with a longitudinal current. We show that a
novel EIT drive and measurement electrode pattern which utilises longitudinal
current and longitudinal differential boundary voltage measurements could
distinguish activity in different fascicles of a three-fascicle mammalian nerve
using pseudo-experimental data synthesised to replicate real operating
conditions. Significance: The results of this study provide an estimate of the
transient change in impedance of intra-fascicle tissue during neural activity
in mammalian nerve, and present a viable EIT electrode pattern, both of which
are critical steps towards implementing EIT in a nerve cuff for neural
prosthetics interfaces.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Convolutional neural network (CNN) driven by image recognition has been shown
to be able to explain cortical responses to static pictures at ventral-stream
areas. Here, we further showed that such CNN could reliably predict and decode
functional magnetic resonance imaging data from humans watching natural movies,
despite its lack of any mechanism to account for temporal dynamics or feedback
processing. Using separate data, encoding and decoding models were developed
and evaluated for describing the bi-directional relationships be-tween the CNN
and the brain. Through the encoding models, the CNN-predicted areas covered not
only the ventral stream, but also the dorsal stream, albe-it to a lesser
degree; single-voxel response was visualized as the specific pixel pattern that
drove the response, revealing the distinct representation of individual
cortical location; cortical activation was synthesized from natural images with
high-throughput to map category representation, con-trast, and selectivity.
Through the decoding models, fMRI signals were directly decoded to estimate the
feature representations in both visual and semantic spaces, for direct visual
reconstruction and seman-tic categorization, respectively. These results
cor-roborate, generalize, and extend previous findings, and highlight the value
of using deep learning, as an all-in-one model of the visual cortex, to
understand and decode natural vision.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A free-boundary model of a motile cell explains turning behavior</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Masoud Nickaeen, Igor L. Novak, Stephanie Pulford, Aaron Rumack, Jamie Brandon, Boris M. Slepchenko, Alex Mogilner&lt;/p&gt;

To understand shapes and movements of cells undergoing lamellipodial motility, we systematically explore minimal free-boundary models of actin-myosin contractility consisting of the force-balance and myosin transport equations. The models account for isotropic contraction proportional to myosin density, viscous stresses in the actin network, and constant-strength viscous-like adhesion. The contraction generates a spatially graded centripetal actin flow, which in turn reinforces the contraction via myosin redistribution and causes retraction of the lamellipodial boundary. Actin protrusion at the boundary counters the retraction, and the balance of the protrusion and retraction shapes the lamellipodium. The model analysis shows that initiation of motility critically depends on three dimensionless parameter combinations, which represent myosin-dependent contractility, a characteristic viscosity-adhesion length, and a rate of actin protrusion. When the contractility is sufficiently strong, cells break symmetry and move steadily along either straight or circular trajectories, and the motile behavior is sensitive to conditions at the cell boundary. Scanning of a model parameter space shows that the contractile mechanism of motility supports robust cell turning in conditions where short viscosity-adhesion lengths and fast protrusion cause an accumulation of myosin in a small region at the cell rear, destabilizing the axial symmetry of a moving cell.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/F3soywyLL-A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Proteoglycans (PGs) in the extracellular matrix (ECM) play vital roles in axon growth and navigation, plasticity, and regeneration of injured neurons. Different classes of PGs may support or inhibit cell growth, and their functions are determined in part by highly specific structural features. Among these, the pattern of sulfation on the PG sugar chains is a paramount determinant of a diverse and flexible set of outcomes. Recent studies of PG sulfation illustrate the challenges of attributing biological actions to specific sulfation patterns, and suggest ways in which highly similar molecules may exert opposing effects on neurons.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A model-based clustering method to detect infectious disease transmission outbreaks from sequence variation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Rosemary M. McCloskey, Art F. Y. Poon&lt;/p&gt;

Clustering infections by genetic similarity is a popular technique for identifying potential outbreaks of infectious disease, in part because sequences are now routinely collected for clinical management of many infections. A diverse number of nonparametric clustering methods have been developed for this purpose. These methods are generally intuitive, rapid to compute, and readily scale with large data sets. However, we have found that nonparametric clustering methods can be biased towards identifying clusters of diagnosis—where individuals are sampled sooner post-infection—rather than the clusters of rapid transmission that are meant to be potential foci for public health efforts. We develop a fundamentally new approach to genetic clustering based on fitting a Markov-modulated Poisson process (MMPP), which represents the evolution of transmission rates along the tree relating different infections. We evaluated this model-based method alongside five nonparametric clustering methods using both simulated and actual HIV sequence data sets. For simulated clusters of rapid transmission, the MMPP clustering method obtained higher mean sensitivity (85%) and specificity (91%) than the nonparametric methods. When we applied these clustering methods to published sequences from a study of HIV-1 genetic clusters in Seattle, USA, we found that the MMPP method categorized about half (46%) as many individuals to clusters compared to the other methods. Furthermore, the mean internal branch lengths that approximate transmission rates were significantly shorter in clusters extracted using MMPP, but not by other methods. We determined that the computing time for the MMPP method scaled linearly with the size of trees, requiring about 30 seconds for a tree of 1,000 tips and about 20 minutes for 50,000 tips on a single computer. This new approach to genetic clustering has significant implications for the application of pathogen sequence analysis to public health, where it is critical to robustly and accurately identify clusters for the most cost-effective deployment of outbreak management and prevention resources.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DCiNkk7egBE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Automated visualization of rule-based models</title>

Frameworks such as BioNetGen, Kappa and Simmune use “reaction rules” to specify biochemical interactions compactly, where each rule specifies a mechanism such as binding or phosphorylation and its structural requirements. Current rule-based models of signaling pathways have tens to hundreds of rules, and these numbers are expected to increase as more molecule types and pathways are added. Visual representations are critical for conveying rule-based models, but current approaches to show rules and interactions between rules scale poorly with model size. Also, inferring design motifs that emerge from biochemical interactions is an open problem, so current approaches to visualize model architecture rely on manual interpretation of the model. Here, we present three new visualization tools that constitute an automated visualization framework for rule-based models: (i) a &lt;i&gt;compact rule visualization&lt;/i&gt; that efficiently displays each rule, (ii) the &lt;i&gt;atom-rule graph&lt;/i&gt; that conveys regulatory interactions in the model as a bipartite network, and (iii) a tunable &lt;i&gt;compression pipeline&lt;/i&gt; that incorporates expert knowledge and produces compact diagrams of model architecture when applied to the atom-rule graph. The compressed graphs convey network motifs and architectural features useful for understanding both small and large rule-based models, as we show by application to specific examples. Our tools also produce more readable diagrams than current approaches, as we show by comparing visualizations of 27 published models using standard graph metrics. We provide an implementation in the open source and freely available BioNetGen framework, but the underlying methods are general and can be applied to rule-based models from the Kappa and Simmune frameworks also. We expect that these tools will promote communication and analysis of rule-based models and their eventual integration into comprehensive whole-cell models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WVjQXIOWt00&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Mechanical strain is a potent stimulus for growth and remodeling in cells. Although many pathways have been implicated in stretch-induced remodeling, the control structures by which signals from distinct mechano-sensors are integrated to modulate hypertrophy and gene expression in cardiomyocytes remain unclear. Here, we constructed and validated a predictive computational model of the cardiac mechano-signaling network in order to elucidate the mechanisms underlying signal integration. The model identifies calcium, actin, Ras, Raf1, PI3K, and JAK as key regulators of cardiac mechano-signaling and characterizes crosstalk logic imparting differential control of transcription by AT1R, integrins, and calcium channels. We find that while these regulators maintain mostly independent control over distinct groups of transcription factors, synergy between multiple pathways is necessary to activate all the transcription factors necessary for gene transcription and hypertrophy. We also identify a PKG-dependent mechanism by which valsartan/sacubitril, a combination drug recently approved for treating heart failure, inhibits stretch-induced hypertrophy, and predict further efficacious pairs of drug targets in the network through a network-wide combinatorial search.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EWjJVc3m438&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Simultaneous electrical stimulation and recording using multi-electrode arrays can provide a valuable technique for studying circuit connectivity and engineering neural interfaces. However, interpreting these measurements is challenging because the spike sorting process (identifying and segregating action potentials arising from different neurons) is greatly complicated by electrical stimulation artifacts across the array, which can exhibit complex and nonlinear waveforms, and overlap temporarily with evoked spikes. Here we develop a scalable algorithm based on a structured Gaussian Process model to estimate the artifact and identify evoked spikes. The effectiveness of our methods is demonstrated in both real and simulated 512-electrode recordings in the peripheral primate retina with single-electrode and several types of multi-electrode stimulation. We establish small error rates in the identification of evoked spikes, with a computational complexity that is compatible with real-time data analysis. This technology may be helpful in the design of future high-resolution sensory prostheses based on tailored stimulation (e.g., retinal prostheses), and for closed-loop neural stimulation at a much larger scale than currently possible.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/umiUooXyYhQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Characterizing steady states of genome-scale metabolic networks in continuous cell cultures</title>

In the continuous mode of cell culture, a constant flow carrying fresh media replaces culture fluid, cells, nutrients and secreted metabolites. Here we present a model for continuous cell culture coupling intra-cellular metabolism to extracellular variables describing the state of the bioreactor, taking into account the growth capacity of the cell and the impact of toxic byproduct accumulation. We provide a method to determine the steady states of this system that is tractable for metabolic networks of arbitrary complexity. We demonstrate our approach in a toy model first, and then in a genome-scale metabolic network of the Chinese hamster ovary cell line, obtaining results that are in qualitative agreement with experimental observations. We derive a number of consequences from the model that are independent of parameter values. The ratio between cell density and dilution rate is an ideal control parameter to fix a steady state with desired metabolic properties. This conclusion is robust even in the presence of multi-stability, which is explained in our model by a negative feedback loop due to toxic byproduct accumulation. A complex landscape of steady states emerges from our simulations, including multiple metabolic switches, which also explain why cell-line and media benchmarks carried out in batch culture cannot be extrapolated to perfusion. On the other hand, we predict invariance laws between continuous cell cultures with different parameters. A practical consequence is that the chemostat is an ideal experimental model for large-scale high-density perfusion cultures, where the complex landscape of metabolic transitions is faithfully reproduced.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JAaq3NMYju8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Improving virtual screening of G protein-coupled receptors via ligand-directed modeling</title>

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) play crucial roles in cell physiology and pathophysiology. There is increasing interest in using structural information for virtual screening (VS) of libraries and for structure-based drug design to identify novel agonist or antagonist leads. However, the sparse availability of experimentally determined GPCR/ligand complex structures with diverse ligands impedes the application of structure-based drug design (SBDD) programs directed to identifying new molecules with a select pharmacology. In this study, we apply ligand-directed modeling (LDM) to available GPCR X-ray structures to improve VS performance and selectivity towards molecules of specific pharmacological profile. The described method refines a GPCR binding pocket conformation using a single known ligand for that GPCR. The LDM method is a computationally efficient, iterative workflow consisting of protein sampling and ligand docking. We developed an extensive benchmark comparing LDM-refined binding pockets to GPCR X-ray crystal structures across seven different GPCRs bound to a range of ligands of different chemotypes and pharmacological profiles. LDM-refined models showed improvement in VS performance over origin X-ray crystal structures in 21 out of 24 cases. In all cases, the LDM-refined models had superior performance in enriching for the chemotype of the refinement ligand. This likely contributes to the LDM success in all cases of inhibitor-bound to agonist-bound binding pocket refinement, a key task for GPCR SBDD programs. Indeed, agonist ligands are required for a plethora of GPCRs for therapeutic intervention, however GPCR X-ray structures are mostly restricted to their inactive inhibitor-bound state.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_oVl-6F8HtM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: An optimization method for estimating functional connectivity and electrophysiology within a biological neuronal network. (arXiv:1711.03834v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03834</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We employ an optimization procedure to estimate parameters of a small model
biological neuronal network. The input to the network and resulting network
output are: time series of stimulating electrical current delivered to each
constituent neuron, and time series of membrane voltage of each neuron,
respectively. We write a cost function in terms of a measurement and a model
error. An iterative reweighting of these terms permits a systematic method to
identify the lowest-minimum, within a specific region of state-and-parameter
space, on the surface of a non-convex cost function. We use the estimates
corresponding to the lowest minimum of the cost function to predict the
particular mode of activity that the network is expressing, where each mode is
known to be associated with a particular set of parameter values. Finally, we
show how this method can prune a model of unnecessarily high complexity down to
a representation that contains the maximum dimensionality required to explain
the available experimental measurements. The design of simulated experiments
presented in this paper might apply in an experimental laboratory, to estimate
properties of extremely small biological circuits.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The specificity and robustness of long-distance connections in weighted, interareal connectomes. (arXiv:1711.03809v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain areas' functional repertoires are shaped by their incoming and outgoing
structural connections. In empirically measured networks, most connections are
short, reflecting spatial and energetic constraints. Nonetheless, a small
number of connections span long distances, consistent with the notion that the
functionality of these connections must outweigh their cost. While the precise
function of these long-distance connections is not known, the leading
hypothesis is that they act to reduce the topological distance between brain
areas and facilitate efficient interareal communication. However, this
hypothesis implies a non-specificity of long-distance connections that we
contend is unlikely. Instead, we propose that long-distance connections serve
to diversify brain areas' inputs and outputs, thereby promoting complex
dynamics. Through analysis of five interareal network datasets, we show that
long-distance connections play only minor roles in reducing average interareal
topological distance. In contrast, areas' long-distance and short-range
neighbors exhibit marked differences in their connectivity profiles, suggesting
that long-distance connections enhance dissimilarity between regional inputs
and outputs. Next, we show that -- in isolation -- areas' long-distance
connectivity profiles exhibit non-random levels of similarity, suggesting that
the communication pathways formed by long connections exhibit redundancies that
may serve to promote robustness. Finally, we use a linearization of
Wilson-Cowan dynamics to simulate the covariance structure of neural activity
and show that in the absence of long-distance connections, a common measure of
functional diversity decreases. Collectively, our findings suggest that
long-distance connections are necessary for supporting diverse and complex
brain dynamics.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A variant in PPP4R3A protects against Alzheimer-related metabolic decline</title>

	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25094</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objectives&lt;/b&gt;: A reduction in glucose metabolism in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) predicts conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and tracks disease progression, signifying its importance in AD. We aimed to use decline in PCC glucose metabolism as a proxy for the development and progression of AD to discover common genetic variants associated with disease vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of decline in PCC [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F] FDG PET measured in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;=606). We then performed follow-up analyses to assess the impact of significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on disease risk and longitudinal cognitive performance in a large independent dataset (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;=870). Lastly, we assessed whether significant SNPs influence gene expression using two RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) datasets (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;=210 &amp;amp; &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;=159).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: We demonstrate a novel genome-wide significant association between rs2273647-T in the gene &lt;em&gt;PPP4R3A&lt;/em&gt; and reduced [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F] FDG decline (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;= 4.44 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;). In a follow-up analysis using an independent dataset, we demonstrate a protective effect of this variant against risk of conversion to MCI or AD (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;=0.038) and against cognitive decline in individuals who develop dementia (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 3.41 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt;). Furthermore, this variant is associated with altered gene expression in peripheral blood and altered &lt;em&gt;PPPP4R3A&lt;/em&gt; transcript expression in temporal cortex, suggesting a role at the molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretations&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;em&gt;PPP4R3A&lt;/em&gt; is a gene involved in AD risk and progression. Given the protective effect of this variant &lt;em&gt;PPP4R3A&lt;/em&gt; should be further investigated as a gene of interest in neurodegenerative diseases and as a potential target for AD therapies.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Heterogenous migraine aura symptoms correlate with visual cortex fMRI responses</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25096</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25096</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Migraine aura is sparsely studied due to the highly challenging task of capturing patients during aura. Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is likely the underlying phenomenon of aura. The possible correlation between the multifaceted phenomenology of aura symptoms and the effects of CSD on the brain has not been ascertained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Five migraine patients were studied during various forms of aura symptoms induced by hypoxia, sham or physical exercise and photostimulation. The blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) signal response to visual stimulation was measured in retinotopic mapping defined visual cortex area V1 - V4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: We found reduced BOLD response in patients reporting scotoma and increased response in patients who only experienced positive symptoms. Furthermore, patients with bilateral visual symptoms had corresponding bi-hemispherical changes in BOLD response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: These findings suggest that different aura symptoms reflect different types of cerebral dysfunction, which correspond to specific changes in BOLD signal reactivity. Furthermore, we provide evidence of bilateral CSD recorded by fMRI during bilateral aura symptoms. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A localized pallidal physiomarker in cervical dystonia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25095</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25095</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) allows for direct recordings of neuronal activity from the human basal ganglia. In Parkinson's disease, a disease-specific physiomarker was identified that is now used to investigate adaptive closed-loop stimulation in first studies. In dystonia such a physiomarker is missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Pallidal oscillations were recorded from 153 contact pairs in 27 patients. We investigated whether power amplitudes in theta and beta bands correlate with dystonic symptom severity across patients. We then projected theta power from each contact pair onto standard subcortical anatomy. This way, we defined a theta hot spot on a group level and investigated whether proximity of the active DBS contacts to it correlates with clinical improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Dystonic symptom severity significantly correlated with theta, but not beta oscillatory amplitudes (ρ=0.4; P=0.009) and interhemispheric coherence (ρ=0.5; P=0.002). The sweet spot of theta activity localized to the posterior third of the internal pallidum and theta power correlated with proximity to this location (ρ=0.23; P=0.002), which coincided with three previously published coordinates describing optimal stimulation targets. Finally, motor improvement through pallidal long term DBS correlated with theta peak amplitude (ρ=0.38; P=0.018).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: Our findings suggest that theta oscillations in the internal pallidum are robustly associated with dystonic symptoms in cervical dystonia and may be a useful biomarker for adaptive closed-loop stimulation. Furthermore, theta oscillatory activity may have a predictive value for the clinical benefit after chronic DBS that could be used to improve intraoperative neurophysiological target mapping during electrode implantation.

Microglial dysfunction has long been implicated in pathogenesis of brain disease, but its role in the spinal cord is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25085-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We assessed spinal cord microglia in humans and mice with AMN and investigated the role of ABCD1 in microglial activity toward neuronal phagocytosis in cell culture. Because mutations in ABCD1 lead to incorporation of very-long-chain fatty acids into phospholipids, we separately examined the effects of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) upon microglia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25085-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the spinal cord of humans and mice with AMN, upregulation of several phagocytosis-related markers, such as MFGE8 and TREM2, precedes complement activation and synapse loss. Unexpectedly, this occurs in the absence of overt inflammation. LPC C26:0 added to ABCD1-deficient microglia in culture further enhances MFGE8 expression, aggravates phagocytosis, and leads to neuronal injury. Furthermore, exposure to a MFGE8-blocking antibody reduces phagocytic activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25085-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spinal cord microglia lacking ABCD1 are primed for phagocytosis, affecting neurons within an altered metabolic milieu. Blocking phagocytosis or specific phagocytic receptors may alleviate synapse loss and axonal degeneration. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Stimulation of the mesencephalic locomotor region for gait recovery after stroke</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25086-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;One-third of all stroke survivors are unable to walk, even after intensive physiotherapy. Thus, other concepts to restore walking are needed. Because electrical stimulation of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) is known to elicit gait movements, this area might be a promising target for restorative neurostimulation in stroke patients with gait disability. The present study aims to delineate the effect of high-frequency stimulation of the MLR (MLR-HFS) on gait impairment in a rodent stroke model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25086-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Male Wistar rats underwent photothrombotic stroke of the right sensorimotor cortex and chronic implantation of a stimulating electrode into the right MLR. Gait was assessed using clinical scoring of the beam-walking test and video-kinematic analysis (CatWalk) at baseline and on days 3 and 4 after experimental stroke with and without MLR-HFS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25086-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kinematic analysis revealed significant changes in several dynamic and static gait parameters resulting in overall reduced gait velocity. All rats exhibited major coordination deficits during the beam-walking challenge and were unable to cross the beam. Simultaneous to the onset of MLR-HFS, a significantly higher walking speed and improvements in several dynamic gait parameters were detected by the CatWalk system. Rats regained the ability to cross the beam unassisted, showing a reduced number of paw slips and misses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25086-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;MLR-HFS can improve disordered locomotor function in a rodent stroke model. It may act by shielding brainstem and spinal locomotor centers from abnormal cortical input after stroke, thus allowing for compensatory and independent action of these circuits.

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25081-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mean age at SEEG or surgery was 28.3 years (range, 2–50). PMG was bilateral in 9 (16%) patients and unilateral in 49, including 17 (29%) unilobar, 12 (21%) multilobar, 15 (26%) perisylvian, and only 5 (9%) hemispheric. Twenty-eight (48%) patients additionally had schizencephaly, heterotopia, or focal cortical dysplasia. The SEEG-determined EZ was fully concordant with the PMG in only 8 (16%) cases, partially concordant in 74%, and discordant in 10%. The EZ included remote cortical areas in 21 (43%) cases and was primarily localized in those in 5 (10%), all related to the mesial temporal structures. All but 1 PMG patient with corticectomy or hemispherotomy had a unilateral PMG. At last follow-up (mean, 4.6 years; range, 1–16), 28 (72%) patients remained seizure free. Shorter epilepsy duration to surgery was an independent predictor of seizure freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Seizure freedom is feasible in a large proportion of patients. PMG extent should not deter from exploring the possibility of epilepsy surgery. Our data support the early consideration of epilepsy surgery in this patient group. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Significant associations between driver gene mutations and DNA methylation alterations across many cancer types</title>

Recent evidence shows that mutations in several driver genes can cause aberrant methylation patterns, a hallmark of cancer. In light of these findings, we hypothesized that the landscapes of tumor genomes and epigenomes are tightly interconnected. We measured this relationship using principal component analyses and methylation-mutation associations applied at the nucleotide level and with respect to genome-wide trends. We found that a few mutated driver genes were associated with genome-wide patterns of aberrant hypomethylation or CpG island hypermethylation in specific cancer types. In addition, we identified associations between 737 mutated driver genes and site-specific methylation changes. Moreover, using these mutation-methylation associations, we were able to distinguish between two uterine and two thyroid cancer subtypes. The driver gene mutation–associated methylation differences between the thyroid cancer subtypes were linked to differential gene expression in JAK-STAT signaling, NADPH oxidation, and other cancer-related pathways. These results establish that driver gene mutations are associated with methylation alterations capable of shaping regulatory network functions. In addition, the methodology presented here can be used to subdivide tumors into more homogeneous subsets corresponding to underlying molecular characteristics, which could improve treatment efficacy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Lpa6elrCmFE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Are there physicochemical differences between allosteric and competitive ligands?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005813</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/hJZ5tkpR4r8/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Richard D. Smith, Jing Lu, Heather A. Carlson&lt;/p&gt;

Previous studies have compared the physicochemical properties of allosteric compounds to non-allosteric compounds. Those studies have found that allosteric compounds tend to be smaller, more rigid, more hydrophobic, and more drug-like than non-allosteric compounds. However, previous studies have not properly corrected for the fact that some protein targets have much more data than other systems. This generates concern regarding the possible skew that can be introduced by the inherent bias in the available data. Hence, this study aims to determine how robust the previous findings are to the addition of newer data. This study utilizes the Allosteric Database (ASD v3.0) and ChEMBL v20 to systematically obtain large datasets of both allosteric and competitive ligands. This dataset contains 70,219 and 9,511 unique ligands for the allosteric and competitive sets, respectively. Physically relevant compound descriptors were computed to examine the differences in their chemical properties. Particular attention was given to removing redundancy in the data and normalizing across ligand diversity and varied protein targets. The resulting distributions only show that allosteric ligands tend to be more aromatic and rigid and do not confirm the increase in hydrophobicity or difference in drug-likeness. These results are robust across different normalization schemes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hJZ5tkpR4r8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25087-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease mostly caused by autoantibodies against acetylcholine receptor associated with thymus abnormalities. Thymectomy has been proven to be an efficacious treatment for patients with MG, but postoperative myasthenic crisis often occurs and is a major complication. We aimed to develop and validate a simple scoring system based on clinical characteristics in the preoperative status to predict the risk of postoperative myasthenic crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25087-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We studied 393 patients with MG who underwent thymectomy at 6 tertiary centers in Japan (275 patients for derivation and 118 for validation). Clinical characteristics, such as gender, age at onset and operation, body mass index, disease duration, MG subtype, severity, symptoms, preoperative therapy, operative data, and laboratory data, were reviewed retrospectively. A multivariate logistic regression with LASSO penalties was used to determine the factors associated with postoperative myasthenic crisis, and a score was assigned. Finally, the predictive score was evaluated using bootstrapping technique in the derivation and validation groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25087-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multivariate logistic regression identified 3 clinical factors for predicting postoperative myasthenic crisis risk: (1) vital capacity &amp;lt; 80%, (2) disease duration &amp;lt; 3 months, and (3) bulbar symptoms immediately before thymectomy. The postoperative myasthenic crisis predictive score, ranging from 0 to 6 points, had areas under the curve of 0.84 (0.66–0.96) in the derivation group and 0.80 (0.62–0.95) in the validation group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25087-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A simple scoring system based on 3 preoperative clinical characteristics can predict the possibility of postoperative myasthenic crisis.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Axonal spike initiation can be maintained with low axonal Na channel density, but temporal precision of spiking is lost. (arXiv:1711.03383v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03383</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03383</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In central neurons, action potentials (APs) originate in the axon initial
segment (AIS) presumably due to its high concentration of voltage-dependent
sodium (NaV) channels. In the AIS, NaV and their cytoskeletal anchoring
proteins display a highly periodical nanoscale arrangement with unknown
functional relevance. In mouse hippocampal neurons, we examined a mutation of
the AIS-specific protein $\beta$IV-spectrin and assessed AP initiation locus,
AIS molecular organization, and the precision of in vivo-like AP encoding. In
mutants, NaV concentration was strongly reduced in AIS but not soma, while AIS
nanoscale organization was preserved. Surprisingly, APs still originated in the
axon, even if the axonal channel density was as low as in the somatic membrane.
However, the timing of those APs was less precise, therefore the neuron's
encoding bandwidth was substantially decreased. Therefore, the high NaV density
in the AIS is not required for axonal AP initiation, it is crucial for AP
timing precision.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A comparative study of the robustness of frequency--domain connectivity measures to finite data length. (arXiv:1711.03332v1 [q-bio.QM])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03332</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03332</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this work we use numerical simulation to investigate how the temporal
length of the data affects the reliability of the estimates of brain
connectivity from EEG time--series. We assume that the neural sources follow a
stable MultiVariate AutoRegressive model, and consider three connectivity
metrics: Imaginary part of Coherency (IC), generalized Partial Directed
Coherence (gPDC) and frequency--domain Granger Causality (fGC). In order to
assess the statistical significance of the estimated values, we use the
surrogate data test by generating phase--randomized and autoregressive
surrogate data. We first consider the ideal case where we know the source time
courses exactly. Here we show how, expectedly, even exact knowledge of the
source time courses is not sufficient to provide reliable estimates of the
connectivity when the number of samples gets small; however, while gPDC and fGC
tend to provide a larger number of false positives, the IC becomes less
sensitive to the presence of connectivity. Then we proceed with more realistic
simulations, where the source time courses are estimated using eLORETA, and the
EEG signal is affected by biological noise of increasing intensity. Using the
ideal case as a reference, we show that the impact of biological noise on IC
estimates is qualitatively different from the impact on gPDC and fGC.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Plasticity is one of the most important features of the nervous systems that
enable animals to adjust their behavior to an ever-changing external world. A
major mechanism of plasticity is the changes in synaptic efficacy between
neurons, and therefore estimation of neural connections is crucial for
investigating information processing in the brain. Although many analysis
methods have been proposed to this end, most of them suffer from a mathematical
difficulty that stems from the fact that activity of only a limited number of
neurons are available. That is, many existing methods ignore effects from
unobserved neurons. To overcome this difficulty, a novel probabilistic
framework is proposed for estimating neural connections from partially observed
spikes. In this study, we estimate influence on observed neurons from
unobserved neurons based on probabilistic firing model and abstract the
connections among observed neurons. Our numerical experiment supports
usefulness of our proposed method.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A modeling study of budding yeast colony formation and its relationship to budding pattern and aging</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Yanli Wang, Wing-Cheong Lo, Ching-Shan Chou&lt;/p&gt;

Budding yeast, which undergoes polarized growth during budding and mating, has been a useful model system to study cell polarization. Bud sites are selected differently in haploid and diploid yeast cells: haploid cells bud in an axial manner, while diploid cells bud in a bipolar manner. While previous studies have been focused on the molecular details of the bud site selection and polarity establishment, not much is known about how different budding patterns give rise to different functions at the population level. In this paper, we develop a two-dimensional agent-based model to study budding yeast colonies with cell-type specific biological processes, such as budding, mating, mating type switch, consumption of nutrients, and cell death. The model demonstrates that the axial budding pattern enhances mating probability at an early stage and the bipolar budding pattern improves colony development under nutrient limitation. Our results suggest that the frequency of mating type switch might control the trade-off between diploidization and inbreeding. The effect of cellular aging is also studied through our model. Based on the simulations, colonies initiated by an aged haploid cell show declined mating probability at an early stage and recover as the rejuvenated offsprings become the majority. Colonies initiated with aged diploid cells do not show disadvantage in colony expansion possibly due to the fact that young cells contribute the most to colony expansion.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PXks6MGAEWo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Matrix-normal models for fMRI analysis. (arXiv:1711.03058v2 [stat.ML] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03058</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03058</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multivariate analysis of fMRI data has benefited substantially from advances
in machine learning. Most recently, a range of probabilistic latent variable
models applied to fMRI data have been successful in a variety of tasks,
including identifying similarity patterns in neural data (Representational
Similarity Analysis and its empirical Bayes variant, RSA and BRSA; Intersubject
Functional Connectivity, ISFC), combining multi-subject datasets (Shared
Response Mapping; SRM), and mapping between brain and behavior (Joint
Modeling). Although these methods share some underpinnings, they have been
developed as distinct methods, with distinct algorithms and software tools. We
show how the matrix-variate normal (MN) formalism can unify some of these
methods into a single framework. In doing so, we gain the ability to reuse
noise modeling assumptions, algorithms, and code across models. Our primary
theoretical contribution shows how some of these methods can be written as
instantiations of the same model, allowing us to generalize them to flexibly
modeling structured noise covariances. Our formalism permits novel model
variants and improved estimation strategies: in contrast to SRM, the number of
parameters for MN-SRM does not scale with the number of voxels or subjects; in
contrast to BRSA, the number of parameters for MN-RSA scales additively rather
than multiplicatively in the number of voxels. We empirically demonstrate
advantages of two new methods derived in the formalism: for MN-RSA, we show up
to 10x improvement in runtime, up to 6x improvement in RMSE, and more
conservative behavior under the null. For MN-SRM, our method grants a modest
improvement to out-of-sample reconstruction while relaxing an orthonormality
constraint of SRM. We also provide a software prototyping tool for MN models
that can flexibly reuse noise covariance assumptions and algorithms across
models.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Measuring functional connectivity from fMRI is important in understanding
processing in cortical networks. However, because brain's connection pattern is
complex, currently used methods are prone to produce false connections. We
introduce here a new method that uses derivative for estimating functional
connectivity. Using simulations, we benchmarked our method with other commonly
used methods. Our method achieves better results in complex network
simulations. This new method provides an alternative way to estimate functional
connectivity.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated impressive
performance on visual object classification tasks. In addition, it is a useful
model for predication of neuronal responses recorded in visual system. However,
there is still no clear understanding of what CNNs learn in terms of visual
neuronal circuits. Visualizing CNN's features to obtain possible connections to
neuronscience underpinnings is not easy due to highly complex circuits from the
retina to higher visual cortex. Here we address this issue by focusing on
single retinal ganglion cells with a simple model and electrophysiological
recordings from salamanders. By training CNNs with white noise images to
predicate neural responses, we found that convolutional filters learned in the
end are resembling to biological components of the retinal circuit. Features
represented by these filters tile the space of conventional receptive field of
retinal ganglion cells. These results suggest that CNN could be used to reveal
structure components of neuronal circuits.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Substantial evidence indicates that the brain uses principles of non-linear
dynamics in neural processes, providing inspiration for computing with
nanoelectronic devices. However, training neural networks composed of dynamical
nanodevices requires finely controlling and tuning their coupled oscillations.
In this work, we show that the outstanding tunability of spintronic
nano-oscillators can solve this challenge. We successfully train a hardware
network of four spin-torque nano-oscillators to recognize spoken vowels by
tuning their frequencies according to an automatic real-time learning rule. We
show that the high experimental recognition rates stem from the high frequency
tunability of the oscillators and their mutual coupling. Our results
demonstrate that non-trivial pattern classification tasks can be achieved with
small hardware neural networks by endowing them with non-linear dynamical
features: here, oscillations and synchronization. This demonstration is a
milestone for spintronics-based neuromorphic computing.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Imaging spinal cord atrophy in progressive myelopathies: HTLV-I-associated neurological disease (HAM/TSP) and multiple sclerosis (MS)</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25072-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous work measures spinal cord thinning in chronic progressive myelopathies, including human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1)-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) and multiple sclerosis (MS). Quantitative measurements of spinal cord atrophy are important in fully characterizing these and other spinal cord diseases. We aimed to investigate patterns of spinal cord atrophy and correlations with clinical markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25072-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spinal cord cross-sectional area was measured in individuals (24 healthy controls [HCs], 17 asymptomatic carriers of HTLV-1 (AC), 47 HAM/TSP, 74 relapsing-remitting MS [RRMS], 17 secondary progressive MS [SPMS], and 40 primary progressive MS [PPMS]) from C1 to T10. Clinical disability scores, viral markers, and immunological parameters were obtained for patients and correlated with representative spinal cord cross-sectional area regions at the C2 to C3, C4 to C5, and T4 to T9 levels. In 2 HAM/TSP patients, spinal cord cross-sectional area was measured over 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25072-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;All spinal cord regions are thinner in HAM/TSP (56 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; [standard deviation, 10], 59 [10], 23 [5]) than in HC (76 [7], 83 [8], 38 [4]) and AC (71 [7], 78 [9], 36 [7]). SPMS (62 [9], 66 [9], 32 [6]) and PPMS (65 [11], 68 [10], 35 [7]) have thinner cervical cords than HC and RRMS (73 [9], 77 [10], 37 [6]). Clinical disability scores (Expanded Disability Status Scale [&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.009] and Instituto de Pesquisas de Cananeia [&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.03]) and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell frequency (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.04) correlate with T4 to T9 spinal cord cross-sectional area in HAM/TSP. Higher cerebrospinal fluid HTLV-1 proviral load (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.01) was associated with thinner spinal cord cross-sectional area. Both HAM/TSP patients followed longitudinally showed thoracic thinning followed by cervical thinning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25072-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Group average spinal cord cross-sectional area in HAM/TSP and progressive MS show spinal cord atrophy. We further hypothesize in HAM/TSP that is possible that neuroglial loss from a thoracic inflammatory process results in anterograde and retrograde degeneration of axons, leading to the temporal progression of thoracic to cervical atrophy described here.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Neural system identification for large populations separating &quot;what&quot; and &quot;where&quot;. (arXiv:1711.02653v1 [stat.ML])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02653</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02653</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists classify neurons into different types that perform similar
computations at different locations in the visual field. Traditional methods
for neural system identification do not capitalize on this separation of 'what'
and 'where'. Learning deep convolutional feature spaces that are shared among
many neurons provides an exciting path forward, but the architectural design
needs to account for data limitations: While new experimental techniques enable
recordings from thousands of neurons, experimental time is limited so that one
can sample only a small fraction of each neuron's response space. Here, we show
that a major bottleneck for fitting convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to
neural data is the estimation of the individual receptive field locations, a
problem that has been scratched only at the surface thus far. We propose a CNN
architecture with a sparse readout layer factorizing the spatial (where) and
feature (what) dimensions. Our network scales well to thousands of neurons and
short recordings and can be trained end-to-end. We evaluate this architecture
on ground-truth data to explore the challenges and limitations of CNN-based
system identification. Moreover, we show that our network model outperforms
current state-of-the art system identification models of mouse primary visual
cortex.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Cortical microcircuits as gated-recurrent neural networks. (arXiv:1711.02448v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02448</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02448</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cortical circuits exhibit intricate recurrent architectures that are
remarkably similar across different brain areas. Such stereotyped structure
suggests the existence of common computational principles. However, such
principles have remained largely elusive. Inspired by gated-memory networks,
namely long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), we introduce a recurrent neural
network in which information is gated through inhibitory cells that are
subtractive (subLSTM). We propose a natural mapping of subLSTMs onto known
canonical excitatory-inhibitory cortical microcircuits. Our empirical
evaluation across sequential image classification and language modelling tasks
shows that subLSTM units can achieve similar performance to LSTM units. These
results suggest that cortical circuits can be optimised to solve complex
contextual problems and proposes a novel view on their computational function.
Overall our work provides a step towards unifying recurrent networks as used in
machine learning with their biological counterparts.

	<description>Several experimental procedures are currently used to investigate the impact of the environment on brain plasticity under physiological and pathological conditions. The available methodologies are aimed at obtaining global or specific reductions or intensifications of the stimuli, with initial standardization in animal models being paralleled by translational applications to humans. More procedures can be combined together or applied in series to obtain powerful experimental paradigms, and the choice of a given setting should take into account the specific genetic background, age, and phenotypic vulnerabilities of the target subjects.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Rebalancing the Addicted Brain: Oxytocin Interference with the Neural Substrates of Addiction</title>

	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30200-X?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Drugs that act on the brain oxytocin (OXT) system may provide a much-needed treatment breakthrough for substance-use disorders. Targeting the brain OXT system has the potential to treat addiction to all major classes of addictive substance and to intervene across all stages of the addiction cycle. Emerging evidence suggests that OXT is able to interfere with such a wide range of addictive behaviours for such a wide range of addictive substances by rebalancing core neural systems that become dysregulated over the course of addiction.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Stroke-induced chronic systolic dysfunction driven by sympathetic overactivity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25073</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25073</link>
	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25073-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiac diseases are established risk factors for ischemic stroke incidence and severity. Conversely, there is increasing evidence that brain ischemia can cause cardiac dysfunction. The mechanisms underlying this neurogenic heart disease are incompletely understood. Although it is established that ischemic stroke is associated with cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial damage, elevated cardiac enzymes, and plasma catecholamines in the acute phase, nothing is known about the delayed consequences of ischemic stroke on cardiovascular function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25073-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine the long-term cardiac consequences of a focal cerebral ischemia, we subjected young and aged mice to a 30-minute transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and analyzed cardiac function by serial transthoracic echocardiography and hemodynamic measurements up to week 8 after surgery. Finally, animals were treated with metoprolol to evaluate a pharmacologic treatment option to prevent the development of heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25073-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focal cerebral ischemia induced a long-term cardiac dysfunction with a reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction and an increase in left ventricular volumes; this development was associated with higher peripheral sympathetic activity. Metoprolol treatment prevented the development of chronic cardiac dysfunction by decelerating extracellular cardiac remodeling and inhibiting sympathetic signaling relevant to chronic autonomic dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25073-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focal cerebral ischemia in mice leads to the development of chronic systolic dysfunction driven by increased sympathetic activity. If these results can be confirmed in a clinical setting, treating physicians should be attentive to clinical signs of heart failure in every patient after ischemic stroke. Therapeutically, the successful β-blockade with metoprolol in mice could also have future clinical implications. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

                        Arid1b haploinsufficiency causes autism and intellectual disability, yet the neurobiological basis of this is unknown. The authors demonstrate that Arid1b-heterozygous mice have impaired cortical interneuron development and epigenetic signatures. These mice also have cognitive and social deficits, which are reversed by treatment with a GABA&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;-receptor-positive allosteric modulator.&lt;/p&gt;, isJats=true)&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/aXWe6_DqvAE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Using optical imaging, electrophysiology, and local pharmacological infusions, Winder et al. found that resting hemodynamic signals were weakly correlated with neural activity and that these hemodynamic fluctuations persisted when neural activity was silenced.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/SopjUiopxeg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Serum tau and neurological outcome in cardiac arrest</title>

	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25067</link>
	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25067-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test serum tau as a predictor of neurological outcome after cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25067-sec-0102&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We measured the neuronal protein tau in serum at 24, 48, and 72 hours after cardiac arrest in 689 patients in the prospective international Target Temperature Management trial. The main outcome was poor neurological outcome, defined as Cerebral Performance Categories 3–5 at 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25067-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increased tau was associated with poor outcome at 6 months after cardiac arrest (median = 38.5, interquartile range [IQR] = 5.7–245ng/l in poor vs median = 1.5, IQR = 0.7–2.4ng/l in good outcome, for tau at 72 hours, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). Tau improved prediction of poor outcome compared to using clinical information (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). Tau cutoffs had low false-positive rates (FPRs) for good outcome while retaining high sensitivity for poor outcome. For example, tau at 72 hours had FPR = 2% (95% CI = 1–4%) with sensitivity = 66% (95% CI = 61–70%). Tau had higher accuracy than serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE; the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.91 for tau vs 0.86 for NSE at 72 hours, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.00024). During follow-up (up to 956 days), tau was significantly associated with overall survival. The accuracy in predicting outcome by serum tau was equally high for patients randomized to 33 °C and 36 °C targeted temperature after cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25067-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serum tau is a promising novel biomarker for prediction of neurological outcome in patients with cardiac arrest. It may be significantly better than serum NSE, which is recommended in guidelines and currently used in clinical practice in several countries to predict outcome after cardiac arrest.

&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This paper examines the serious shortcomings that characterize the current taxonomy of post-comatose disorders of consciousness (DoC), and it provides guidelines for how an improved DoC taxonomy might be developed. In particular, it is argued that behavioural criteria for the application of DoC categories should be supplemented with brain-based criteria (e.g., information derived from EEG and fMRI), and that the categorical framework that currently characterizes DoC should be replaced by a more complex framework that better captures the performance of patients across a range of cognitive and behavioural tasks.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Effect of sensory and motor connectivity on hand function in pediatric hemiplegia</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25080-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tested the hypothesis that somatosensory system injury would more strongly affect movement than motor system injury in children with unilateral cerebral palsy (USCP). This hypothesis was based on how somatosensory and corticospinal circuits adapt to injury during development; whereas the motor system can maintain connections to the impaired hand from the uninjured hemisphere, this does not occur in the somatosensory system. As a corollary, cortical injury strongly impairs sensory function, so we hypothesized that cortical lesions would impair hand function more than subcortical lesions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25080-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-four children with unilateral cerebral palsy had physiological and anatomical measures of the motor and somatosensory systems and lesion classification. Motor physiology was performed with transcranial magnetic stimulation and somatosensory physiology with vibration-evoked electroencephalographic potentials. Tractography of the corticospinal tract and the medial lemniscus was performed with diffusion tensor imaging, and lesions were classified by magnetic resonance imaging. Anatomical and physiological results were correlated with measures of hand function using 2 independent statistical methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25080-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children with disruptions in the somatosensory connectivity and cortical lesions had the most severe upper extremity impairments, particularly somatosensory function. Motor system connectivity was significantly correlated with bimanual function, but not unimanual function or somatosensory function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25080-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both sensory and motor connectivity impact hand function in children with USCP. Somatosensory connectivity could be an important target for recovery of hand function in children with USCP. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Does smoking impact dopamine neuronal loss in de novo Parkinson disease?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25082</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25082</link>
	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study analyzed data from dopamine transporter (DAT) positron emission tomographic scans of 282 male patients with de novo Parkinson disease to investigate whether smoking impacts striatal dopamine neuronal degeneration. Mean DAT activity in the posterior (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.016) and ventral putamen (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.028) was higher in 44 current smokers in comparison to 105 ex-smokers and 133 never-smokers. The severity of baseline motor deficits and the longitudinal increases in levodopa-equivalent doses during follow-up were similar among the 3 groups. These results suggest that current smoking, but not past smoking, protects dopamine neuronal degeneration in the sensorimotor striatum with no additional clinical benefits.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Oral Anticoagulation and Functional Outcome after Intracerebral Hemorrhage</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25079-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oral anticoagulation treatment (OAT) resumption is a therapeutic dilemma in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) care, particularly for lobar hemorrhages related to amyloid angiopathy. We sought to determine whether OAT resumption after ICH is associated with long-term outcome, accounting for ICH location (ie, lobar vs nonlobar).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25079-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We meta-analyzed individual patient data from: (1) the multicenter RETRACE study (n = 542), (2) a U.S.-based single-center ICH study (n = 261), and (3) the Ethnic/Racial Variations of Intracerebral Hemorrhage study (n = 209). We determined whether, within 1 year from ICH, OAT resumption was associated with: (1) mortality, (2) favorable functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale = 0–3), and (3) stroke incidence. We separately analyzed nonlobar and lobar ICH cases using propensity score matching and Cox regression models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25079-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We included 1,012 OAT-related ICH survivors (633 nonlobar and 379 lobar). Among nonlobar ICH survivors, 178/633 (28%) resumed OAT, whereas 86/379 (23%) lobar ICH survivors did. In multivariate analyses, OAT resumption after nonlobar ICH was associated with decreased mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.14–0.44, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) and improved functional outcome (HR = 4.22, 95% CI = 2.57–6.94, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). OAT resumption after lobar ICH was also associated with decreased mortality (HR = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.17–0.45, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) and favorable functional outcome (HR = 4.08, 95% CI = 2.48–6.72, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). Furthermore, OAT resumption was associated with decreased all-cause stroke incidence in both lobar and nonlobar ICH (both &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25079-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results suggest novel evidence of an association between OAT resumption and outcome following ICH, regardless of hematoma location. These findings support conducting randomized trials to explore risks and benefits of OAT resumption after ICH. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>The brain has the ability to sense, coordinate, and respond to environmental changes through biological processes involving activity-dependent gene expression. cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB)-regulated transcription coactivators (CRTCs) have recently emerged as novel transcriptional regulators of essential biological functions, while their deregulation is linked to age-related human diseases. In the brain, CRTCs are unique signaling factors that act as sensors and integrators of hormonal, metabolic, and neural signals contributing to brain plasticity and brain–body communication.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elucidating the underlying components of food valuation in the human orbitofrontal cortex&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature Neuroscience, Published online: 23 October 2017; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-017-0008-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-017-0008-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suzuki et al. found that food valuation is related to beliefs about nutritive attributes. Functional MRI revealed these attribute codes in lateral orbitofrontal cortex, suggesting a mechanism by which value signals are constructed from constituent attributes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/pLtac5bSDAo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Predicting Age Using Neuroimaging: Innovative Brain Ageing Biomarkers</title>

	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30187-X?rss=yes</link>
	<description>The brain changes as we age and these changes are associated with functional deterioration and neurodegenerative disease. It is vital that we better understand individual differences in the brain ageing process; hence, techniques for making individualised predictions of brain ageing have been developed. We present evidence supporting the use of neuroimaging-based ‘brain age’ as a biomarker of an individual’s brain health. Increasingly, research is showing how brain disease or poor physical health negatively impacts brain age.</description>
