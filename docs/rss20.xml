	<title>Annals of Neurology: Fetal Growth and Premature Delivery in Pregnant Women on Anti-epileptic Drugs</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25031</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25031</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; To evaluate the effects of epilepsy and antiepileptic drugs (AED) use during pregnancy on fetal growth and preterm delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; This study included singleton liveborns born to women enrolled in the North American Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry between 1997 and 2016. Data were collected prospectively through telephone interviews. The prevalence of preterm birth (&amp;lt;37 weeks) and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) among infants exposed prenatally to AED when used by women with epilepsy (WWE) or women without epilepsy (WWOE) was compared with that among infants unexposed to AEDs and born to WWOE. Multivariable log-binomial regression models were used to estimate relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; The study population included infants born to 6,777 AED-WWE, 696 AED-WWOE, and 486 no-AED WWOE. The risk of prematurity was 6.2% for no-AED-WWOE, 9.3% for AED-WWE (RR 1.5, 95%CI: 1.0-2.1) and 10.5% for AED-WWOE (RR 1.5: 1.0-2.4). Prenatal exposure to AED in WWE and WWOE was associated with a mean lower birth weight of 110 and 136 grams, respectively, as compared to no-AED WWOE. The prevalence of SGA was 5.0% for no-AED-WWOE, 10.9% for AED-WWE (RR 2.0: 1.3-3.0) and 11.0% for AED-WWOE (RR 1.9: 1.2-2.9). Within users of AEDs in monotherapy, the prevalence of SGA ranged from 7.3% for lamotrigine to 18.5% for topiramate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interpretation&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; Women on AEDs during pregnancy, whether for epilepsy or for other neuropsychiatric indications, are at a higher risk of delivering prematurely and giving birth to SGA newborns. The risk may vary by drug. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Degeneration of serotonin neurons triggers spasticity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25030</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25030</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Spasticity occurs in a wide range of neurological diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, after trauma or after stroke and is characterized by increased reflexes leading to muscle hypertonia. Spasticity is a painful symptom and can severely restrict everyday life, but might also participate in maintaining a low level of motor function in severely impaired patients. Constitutive activity of the serotonin receptors 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B/C&lt;/sub&gt; is required for the development of spasticity after spinal cord injury or during amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We sought here to provide direct evidence for a role of brainstem serotonin neurons in spasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;em&gt;SOD1&lt;/em&gt;(G37R) mice expressing a conditional allele of an ALS-linked SOD1 mutation were crossed to Tph2-CRE mice expressing CRE in serotonergic neurons. Measurement of long lasting reflex using EMG, behavioural follow up and histological techniques were used to characterize spasticity and motor phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Deleting mutant SOD1 expression selectively in brainstem serotonin neurons was sufficient to rescue loss of TPH2 immunoreactivity and largely preserve serotonin innervation of motor neurons in the spinal cord. Furthermore, this abrogated constitutive activity of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B/C&lt;/sub&gt; receptors and abolished spasticity in end-stage mice. Consistent with spasticity mitigating motor symptoms, selective deletion worsened motor function and accelerated the onset of paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Degeneration of serotonin neurons is necessary to trigger spasticity through the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B/C&lt;/sub&gt; receptor. The wide range of drugs targeting the serotonergic system could be useful to treat spasticity in neurological diseases. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: GABBR2 mutations determine phenotype in Rett syndrome and epileptic encephalopathy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25032</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25032</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Rett syndrome (RTT) and epileptic encephalopathy (EE) are devastating neurodevelopmental disorders with distinct diagnostic criteria. However, highly heterogeneous and overlapping clinical features often allocate patients into the boundary of the two conditions, complicating accurate diagnosis and appropriate medical interventions. Therefore, we investigated the specific molecular mechanism that allows an understanding of the pathogenesis and relationship of these two conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We screened novel genetic factors from 34 RTT-like patients without &lt;em&gt;MECP2&lt;/em&gt; mutations, which account for ∼90% of RTT cases, by whole exome sequencing. The biological function of the discovered variants was assessed in cell culture and &lt;em&gt;Xenopus tropicalis&lt;/em&gt; models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: We identified a recurring &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; variant in GABAB receptor R2 (&lt;em&gt;GABBR2&lt;/em&gt;) that reduces the receptor function, whereas different &lt;em&gt;GABBR2&lt;/em&gt; variants in EE patients possess a more profound effect in reducing receptor activity and are more responsive to agonist rescue in an animal model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;em&gt;GABBR2&lt;/em&gt; is a genetic factor that determines RTT- or EE-like phenotype expression depending on the variant positions. &lt;em&gt;GABBR2&lt;/em&gt;-mediated GABA signaling is a crucial factor in determining the severity and nature of neurodevelopmental phenotypes.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Seizure activity per se does not induce tissue damage markers in human neocortical focal epilepsy</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25005-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contribution of recurring seizures to the progression of epileptogenesis is debated. Seizure-induced brain damage is not conclusively demonstrated either in humans or in animal models of epilepsy. We evaluated the expression of brain injury biomarkers on postsurgical brain tissue obtained from 20 patients with frequent seizures and a long history of drug-resistant focal epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25005-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expression patterns of specific glial, neuronal, and inflammatory molecules were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in the core of type II focal cortical dysplasias (FCD-II), at the FCD boundary (perilesion), and in the adjacent normal-appearing area included in the epileptogenic region. We also analyzed surgical specimens from cryptogenic patients not presenting structural alterations at imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25005-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Astroglial and microglial activation, reduced neuronal density, perivascular CD3-positive T-lymphocyte clustering, and fibrinogen extravasation were demonstrated in the core of FCD-II lesions. No pathological immunoreactivity was observed outside the FCD-II or in cryptogenetic specimens, where the occurrence of interictal and ictal epileptiform activity was confirmed by either stereo-electroencephalography or intraoperative electrocorticography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25005-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recurrent seizures do not induce the expression of brain damage markers in nonlesional epileptogenic cortex studied in postsurgical tissue from cryptogenic and FCD patients. This evidence argues against the hypothesis that epileptiform activity per se contributes to focal brain injury, at least in the neocortical epilepsies considered here.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Gustatory and olfactory responses to stimulation of the human insula</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25010-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite numerous studies suggesting the role of insular cortex in the processing of gustatory and olfactory inputs, the exact location of olfactogustatory representation in the insula remains controversial. Here we provide a functional mapping of olfactory–gustatory responses to stimulation of the human insular cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25010-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We reviewed 651 electrical stimulations of the insula that were performed in 221 patients, using stereotactically implanted depth electrodes, during the presurgical evaluation of drug-refractory epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25010-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gustatory sensations were evoked in 15 (2.7%) of the 550 stimulations that elicited a clinical response. They were exclusively obtained after stimulation of a relatively delimited zone of insula, located in its mid-dorsal part (posterior short gyrus). Six olfactory sensations (1.1%) could be obtained during stimulations of an insular region that partially overlapped with the gustatory representation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25010-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study provides a functional mapping of gustatory representation in the insular posterior short gyrus and the first detailed description of olfactory sensations obtained by direct stimulation of mid-dorsal insula. Our data also show a spatial overlap between gustatory, olfactory, and oral somatosensory representation in the mid-dorsal insula, and suggest that this part of the insula may be an integrated oral sensory region that plays a key role in flavor perception. It also indicates that dysfunction in this region should be considered during the evaluation of gustatory and olfactory epileptic seizures.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primary and secondary conditions leading to thiamine deficiency have overlapping features in children, presenting with acute episodes of encephalopathy, bilateral symmetric brain lesions, and high excretion of organic acids that are specific of thiamine-dependent mitochondrial enzymes, mainly lactate, alpha-ketoglutarate, and branched chain keto-acids. Undiagnosed and untreated thiamine deficiencies are often fatal or lead to severe sequelae. Herein, we describe the clinical and genetic characterization of 79 patients with inherited thiamine defects causing encephalopathy in childhood, identifying outcome predictors in patients with pathogenic &lt;em&gt;SLC19A3&lt;/em&gt; variants, the most common genetic etiology. We propose diagnostic criteria that will aid clinicians to establish a faster and accurate diagnosis so that early vitamin supplementation is considered.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite great progress in neuroscience, there are still fundamental
unanswered questions about the brain, including the origin of subjective
experience and consciousness. Some answers might rely on new physical
mechanisms. Given that biophotons have been discovered in the brain, it is
interesting to explore if neurons use photonic communication in addition to the
well-studied electro-chemical signals. Such photonic communication in the brain
would require waveguides. Here we review recent work [S. Kumar, K. Boone, J.
Tuszynski, P. Barclay, and C. Simon, Scientific Reports 6, 36508 (2016)]
suggesting that myelinated axons could serve as photonic waveguides. The light
transmission in the myelinated axon was modeled, taking into account its
realistic imperfections, and experiments were proposed both in-vivo and
in-vitro to test this hypothesis. Potential implications for quantum biology
are discussed.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Pain is a complex and subjective experience that poses a number of
measurement challenges. While self-report by the patient is viewed as the gold
standard of pain assessment, this approach fails when patients cannot verbally
communicate pain intensity or lack normal mental abilities. Here, we present a
pain intensity measurement method based on physiological signals. Specifically,
we implement a multi-task learning approach based on neural networks that
accounts for individual differences in pain responses while still leveraging
data from across the population. We test our method in a dataset containing
multi-modal physiological responses to nociceptive pain.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Synchrony-induced modes of oscillation of a neural field model. (arXiv:1708.08672v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.08672</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.08672</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We investigate the modes of oscillation of heterogeneous ring-networks of
quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons with non-local, space-dependent coupling.
Perturbations of the equilibrium state with a particular wave number produce
transient standing waves with a specific frequency, analogous to those in a
tense string. In the neuronal network, the equilibrium corresponds to a
spatially homogeneous, asynchronous state. Perturbations of this state excite
the network's oscillatory modes, which reflect the interplay of episodes of
synchronous spiking with the excitatory-inhibitory spatial interactions. In the
thermodynamic limit, an exact low-dimensional neural field model describing the
macroscopic dynamics of the network is derived. This allows us to obtain
formulas for the Turing eigenvalues of the spatially-homogeneous state, and
hence to obtain its stability boundary. We find that the frequency of each
Turing mode depends on the corresponding Fourier coefficient of the synaptic
pattern of connectivity. The decay rate instead, is identical for all
oscillation modes as a consequence of the heterogeneity-induced
desynchronization of the neurons. Finally, we numerically compute the spectrum
of spatially-inhomogeneous solutions branching from the Turing bifurcation,
showing that similar oscillatory modes operate in neural bump states, and are
maintained away from onset.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Fluctuation analysis in nonstationary conditions: single Ca channel current in cortical pyramidal neurons. (arXiv:1603.02007v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02007</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02007</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fluctuation analysis is a method which allows measurement of the single
channel current of ion channels even when it is too small to be resolved
directly with the patch clamp technique. This is the case for voltage-gated
Ca2+ channels (VGCCs). They are present in all mammalian central neurons,
controlling presynaptic release of transmitter, postsynaptic signaling and
synaptic integration. The amplitudes of their single channel currents in a
physiological concentration of extracellular Ca2+, however, are small and not
well determined. But measurement of this quantity is essential for estimating
numbers of functional VGCCs in the membrane and the size of channel-associated
Ca2+ signaling domains, and for understanding the stochastic nature of Ca2+
signaling. Here, we recorded the VGCC current in nucleated patches from layer 5
pyramidal neurons in rat neocortex, in physiological external Ca2+ (1-2 mM).
The ensemble-averaging of current responses required for conventional
fluctuation analysis proved impractical because of the rapid rundown of VGCC
currents. We therefore developed a more robust method, using mean current
fitting of individual current responses and band-pass filtering. Furthermore,
voltage ramp stimulation proved useful. We validated the accuracy of the method
by analyzing simulated data. At an external Ca2+ concentration of 1 mM, and a
membrane potential of -20 mV, we found that the average single channel current
amplitude was about 0.04 pA, increasing to 0.065 pA at 2 mM external Ca2+, and
0.12 pA at 5 mM. The relaxation time constant of the fluctuations was in the
range 0.2-0.8 ms. The results are relevant to understanding the stochastic
properties of dendritic Ca2+ spikes in neocortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons.
With the reported method, single channel current amplitude of native VGCCs can
be resolved accurately despite conditions of unstable rundown.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Neurons in primate entorhinal cortex represent gaze position in multiple spatial reference frames</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/182220v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/182220v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Primates predominantly rely on vision to gather information from the environment, and neurons representing visual space and gaze position are found in many brain areas. Within the medial temporal lobe, a brain region critical for memory, neurons in the entorhinal cortex of macaque monkeys exhibit spatial selectivity for gaze position. Specifically, the firing rate of single neurons reflects fixation location within a visual image (Killian et al., 2012). In the rodents, entorhinal cells such as grid cells, border cells, and head direction cells show spatial representations aligned to visual environmental features instead of the body (Hafting et al., 2005, Solstad et al. 2008, Sargolini et al., 2006, Diehl et al., 2017). However, it is not known whether similar allocentric representations exist in primate entorhinal cortex. Here, we recorded neural activity in the entorhinal cortex in two male rhesus monkeys during a naturalistic, free-viewing task. Our data reveal that a majority of entorhinal neurons represent gaze position, and that simultaneously recorded neurons exhibit distinct spatial reference frames, with some neurons aligning to the visual image and others aligning to the monkey's head position. Our results also show that entorhinal neural activity can be used to predict gaze position with a high degree of accuracy. These findings demonstrate that visuospatial representation is a fundamental property of entorhinal neurons in primates, and suggest that entorhinal cortex may support relational memory and motor planning by coding attentional locus in distinct, behaviorally relevant frames of reference.</description>

	<description>The timing of the diversification of placental mammals relative to the Cretaceous–Paleogene (KPg) boundary mass extinction remains highly controversial. In particular, there have been seemingly irreconcilable differences in the dating of the early placental radiation not only between fossil-based and molecular datasets but also among molecular datasets.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We review our current software tools and theoretical methods for applying the
Neural Engineering Framework to state-of-the-art neuromorphic hardware. These
methods can be used to implement linear and nonlinear dynamical systems that
exploit axonal transmission time-delays, and to fully account for nonideal
mixed-analog-digital synapses that exhibit higher-order dynamics with
heterogeneous time-constants. This summarizes earlier versions of these methods
that have been discussed in a more biological context (Voelker &amp;amp; Eliasmith,
2017) or regarding a specific neuromorphic architecture (Voelker et al., 2017).

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07958</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Network neuroscience is the emerging discipline concerned with investigating
the complex patterns of interconnections found in neural systems, and to
identify principles with which to understand them. Within this discipline, one
particularly powerful approach is network generative modeling, in which wiring
rules are algorithmically implemented to produce synthetic network
architectures with the same properties as observed in empirical network data.
Successful models can highlight the principles by which a network is organized
and potentially uncover the mechanisms by which it grows and develops. Here we
review the prospects and promise of generative models for network neuroscience.
We begin with a primer on network generative models, with a discussion of
compressibility and predictability, utility in intuiting mechanisms, and a
short history on their use in network science broadly. We then discuss
generative models in practice and application, paying particular attention to
the critical need for cross-validation. Next, we review generative models of
biological neural networks, both at the cellular and large-scale level, and
across a variety of species including \emph{C. elegans}, \emph{Drosophila},
mouse, rat, cat, macaque, and human. We offer a careful treatment of a few
relevant distinctions, including differences between generative models and null
models, sufficiency and redundancy, inferring and claiming mechanism, and
functional and structural connectivity. We close with a discussion of future
directions, outlining exciting frontiers both in empirical data collection
efforts as well as in method and theory development that, together, further the
utility of the generative network modeling approach for network neuroscience.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Advanced statistical methods for eye movement analysis and modeling: a gentle introduction. (arXiv:1506.07194v4 [physics.data-an] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.07194</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.07194</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this Chapter we show that by considering eye movements, and in particular,
the resulting sequence of gaze shifts, a stochastic process, a wide variety of
tools become available for analyses and modelling beyond conventional
statistical methods. Such tools encompass random walk analyses and more complex
techniques borrowed from the pattern recognition and machine learning fields.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a brief, though critical, probabilistic tour of current computational
models of eye movements and visual attention, we lay down the basis for gaze
shift pattern analysis. To this end, the concepts of Markov Processes, the
Wiener process and related random walks within the Gaussian framework of the
Central Limit Theorem will be introduced. Then, we will deliberately violate
fundamental assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem to elicit a larger
perspective, rooted in statistical physics, for analysing and modelling eye
movements in terms of anomalous, non-Gaussian, random walks and modern foraging
theory.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, by resorting to machine learning techniques, we discuss how the
analyses of movement patterns can develop into the inference of hidden patterns
of the mind: inferring the observer's task, assessing cognitive impairments,
classifying expertise.

&lt;p&gt;Hexanucleotide repeat expansions in C9orf72 gene locus create double jeopardy, first by leading to DNA–RNA R-loops that spawn double-strand breaks and second by the synthesis of dipeptide repeats that hinder DNA repair. This two-pronged mechanism may explain neurodegeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Drug discovery to counteract antinociceptive tolerance with mu-opioid receptor endocytosis</title>

	<description>Morphine antinociceptive tolerance is highly correlated with its poor ability to promote mu-opioid-receptor (MOR) endocytosis. Our objective was to discover a novel positive allosteric modulator of MOR to enhance morphine-induced MOR endocytosis. We used high-throughput screening to identify several cardiotonic steroids as positive allosteric modulators of morphine-induced MOR endocytosis having high potency and efficacy, independently of Na+/K+-ATPase inhibition. Convallatoxin was found to enhance morphine-induced MOR endocytosis through an adaptor protein 2/clathrin-dependent mechanism without regulating G protein- or {beta}-arrestin-mediated pathways. Both F243 and I292 residues of MOR were essential to the effect of convallatoxin on MOR endocytosis. Co-treatment with chronic morphine and convallatoxin reduced morphine tolerance in animal models of acute thermal pain and chronic inflammatory pain. Acute convallatoxin administration reversed morphine tolerance in morphine-tolerant mice. These findings suggest that cardiotonic steroids are potentially therapeutic for morphine side effects and open a new avenue for the study of MOR trafficking.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Posterior parietal cortex represents sensory stimulus history and is necessary for its effects on behavior</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/182246v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/182246v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Many models of cognition and of neural computations posit the use and estimation of prior stimulus statistics: it has long been known that working memory and perception are strongly impacted by previous sensory experience, even when that sensory history is irrelevant for the current task at hand. Nevertheless, the neural mechanisms and brain regions necessary for computing and using such priors are unknown. Here we report that the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is a critical locus for the representation and use of prior stimulus information. We trained rats in an auditory Parametric Working Memory (PWM) task, and found that rats displayed substantial and readily quantifiable behavioral effects of sensory stimulus history, similar to those observed in humans and monkeys. Earlier proposals that PPC supports working memory predict that optogenetic silencing of the PPC would lead to a behavioral impairment in our working memory task. Contrary to this prediction, silencing PPC produced a significant performance improvement. Quantitative analyses of behavior revealed that this improvement was due to the selective reduction of the effects of prior sensory stimuli. Electrophysiological recordings showed that PPC neurons carried far more information about sensory stimuli of previous trials than about stimuli of the current trial. Furthermore, the more information about previous trial sensory history in the neural firing rates of a given rat's PPC, the greater the behavioral effect of sensory history in that rat, suggesting a tight link between behavior and PPC representations of stimulus history. Our results indicate that the PPC is a central component in the processing of sensory stimulus history, and open a window for neurobiological investigation of long-standing questions regarding how perception and working memory are affected by prior sensory information.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: An individual differences approach to semantic cognition: Divergent effects of age on representation, retrieval and selection</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/182170v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/182170v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Semantic cognition refers to our ability to use acquired knowledge to make sense of the environment and to guide behaviour. This requires representation of knowledge as well as control processes which ensure that currently-relevant aspects of this knowledge are retrieved and selected in any given situation. These abilities can be impaired selectively following brain damage; however, the relationship between them in healthy individuals is not known. In addition, it is commonly assumed that semantic cognition is preserved in later life, because older people have greater reserves of knowledge. However, this claim overlooks the possibility of decline in semantic control processes, which has not been investigated. The study addressed these issues by assessing verbal semantic cognition in 100 young and older adults. Despite having a broader base of semantic knowledge (i.e., wider vocabulary), older people showed specific impairments in semantic control, performing more poorly than young people when required to select among competing semantic representations. Conversely, they showed improved controlled retrieval of less salient information from the semantic store. Within each age group, breadth of semantic knowledge was positively correlated with controlled retrieval but was unrelated to semantic selection ability, which was instead correlated with non-semantic executive function. These findings indicate that three distinct elements contribute to semantic cognition: (a) a store of representations which accumulates throughout the lifespan, (b) processes for controlled retrieval of less salient information from this store, which are also more developed in later life and (c) domain-general executive selection mechanisms that decline in old age. These results provide a new framework for interpreting patterns of spared and impaired verbal abilities in old age.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Deep grey matter volume loss drives disability worsening in multiple sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/182006v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/182006v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Objective: Grey matter (GM) atrophy occurs in all multiple sclerosis (MS) phenotypes. We investigated whether there is a spatiotemporal pattern of GM atrophy that is associated with faster disability accumulation in MS. Methods: We analysed 3,604 brain high-resolution T1-weighted MRI scans from 1,417 participants: 1,214 MS patients (253 clinically-isolated syndrome [CIS], 708 relapsing-remitting [RRMS], 128 secondary-progressive [SPMS], 125 primary-progressive [PPMS]), over an average follow-up of 2.41 years (standard deviation [SD]=1.97), and 203 healthy controls (HCs) [average follow-up=1.83 year, SD=1.77], attending 7 European centres. Disability was assessed with the Expanded-Disability Status Scale (EDSS). We obtained volumes of the deep GM (DGM), temporal, frontal, parietal, occipital and cerebellar GM, brainstem and cerebral white matter. Hierarchical mixed-models assessed annual percentage rate of regional tissue loss and identified regional volumes associated with time-to-EDSS progression. Results: SPMS showed the lowest baseline volumes of cortical GM and DGM. Of all baseline regional volumes, only that of the DGM predicted time-to-EDSS progression (hazard ratio=0.73, 95% CIs 0.65, 0.82; p&amp;lt;0.001): for every standard deviation decrease in baseline DGM volume, the risk of presenting a shorter time to EDSS worsening during follow-up increased by 27%. Of all longitudinal measures, DGM showed the fastest annual rate of atrophy, which was faster in SPMS (-1.45%), PPMS (-1.66%), and RRMS (-1.34%) than CIS (-0.88%) and HCs (-0.94%) [p&amp;lt;0.01]. The rate of temporal GM atrophy in SPMS (-1.21%) was significantly faster than RRMS (-0.76%), CIS (-0.75%), and HCs (-0.51%). Similarly, the rate of parietal GM atrophy in SPMS (-1.24%) was faster than CIS (-0.63%) and HCs (-0.23%) (all p values &amp;lt;0.05). Only the atrophy rate in DGM in patients was significantly associated with disability accumulation (beta=0.04, p&amp;lt;0.001). Interpretation: This large multi-centre and longitudinal study shows that DGM volume loss drives disability accumulation in MS, and that temporal cortical GM shows accelerated atrophy in SPMS than RRMS. The difference in regional GM atrophy development between phenotypes needs to be taken into account when evaluating treatment effect of therapeutic interventions.</description>

	<description>Human motor control requires the coordination of muscle activity under the anatomical constraints imposed by the musculoskeletal system. Interactions within the central nervous system are fundamental to motor coordination, but the principles governing functional integration remain poorly understood. We use network analysis to investigate the relationship between anatomical and functional connectivity amongst 36 muscles during postural tasks. We find a modular structure of functional networks that is strongly shaped by the anatomical constraints of the musculoskeletal system. Muscle networks exhibit a multilayer architecture with distinct spectral fingerprints in which functional interactions are established across multiple timescales. Changes in postural tasks are associated with a reconfiguration in the coupling between functional modules. These results identify a distributed neural circuitry in which parallel pathways give rise to different functional modes that facilitate flexible motor behaviours. This multi-level network approach to the motor system offers a unique window into the neural basis for human movement.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Covert Shift of Attention Modulates the Value Encoding in the Orbitofrontal Cortex</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/181784v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>During value-based decision making, we often evaluate the value of each option sequentially by shifting our attention, even when the options are presented simultaneously. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has been suggested to encode value during value-based decision making. Yet it is not known how its activity is modulated by attention shifts. We investigated this question by employing a passive viewing task that allowed us to disentangle effects of attention, value, choice and eye movement. We found that the attention modulated OFC activity through a winner-take-all mechanism. When we attracted the monkeys' attention covertly, the OFC neuronal activity reflected the reward value of the newly attended cue. The shift of attention could be explained by a normalization model. Our results strongly argue for the hypothesis that the OFC neuronal activity represents the value of covertly attended item. They provide important insights toward the neural mechanism of value-based decision making.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Domain-based prediction of the human isoform interactome provides insights into the functional impact of alternative splicing</title>

Alternative splicing is known to remodel protein-protein interaction networks (“interactomes”), yet large-scale determination of isoform-specific interactions remains challenging. We present a domain-based method to predict the isoform interactome from the reference interactome. First, we construct the domain-resolved reference interactome by mapping known domain-domain interactions onto experimentally-determined interactions between reference proteins. Then, we construct the isoform interactome by predicting that an isoform loses an interaction if it loses the domain mediating the interaction. Our prediction framework is of high-quality when assessed by experimental data. The predicted human isoform interactome reveals extensive network remodeling by alternative splicing. Protein pairs interacting with different isoforms of the same gene tend to be more divergent in biological function, tissue expression, and disease phenotype than protein pairs interacting with the same isoforms. Our prediction method complements experimental efforts, and demonstrates that integrating structural domain information with interactomes provides insights into the functional impact of alternative splicing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pOE3h8IZjMI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The spread of pathogens into new environments poses a considerable threat to human, animal, and plant health, and by extension, human and animal wellbeing, ecosystem function, and agricultural productivity, worldwide. Early detection through effective surveillance is a key strategy to reduce the risk of their establishment. Whilst it is well established that statistical and economic considerations are of vital importance when planning surveillance efforts, it is also important to consider epidemiological characteristics of the pathogen in question—including heterogeneities within the epidemiological system itself. One of the most pronounced realisations of this heterogeneity is seen in the case of vector-borne pathogens, which spread between ‘hosts’ and ‘vectors’—with each group possessing distinct epidemiological characteristics. As a result, an important question when planning surveillance for emerging vector-borne pathogens is where to place sampling resources in order to detect the pathogen as early as possible. We answer this question by developing a statistical function which describes the probability distributions of the prevalences of infection at first detection in both hosts and vectors. We also show how this method can be adapted in order to maximise the probability of early detection of an emerging pathogen within imposed sample size and/or cost constraints, and demonstrate its application using two simple models of vector-borne citrus pathogens. Under the assumption of a linear cost function, we find that sampling costs are generally minimised when either hosts or vectors, but not both, are sampled.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HsuotfhBM24&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: HLA class I haplotype diversity is consistent with selection for frequent existing haplotypes</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Idan Alter, Loren Gragert, Stephanie Fingerson, Martin Maiers, Yoram Louzoun&lt;/p&gt;

The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) contains the most polymorphic genetic system in humans, the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes of the adaptive immune system. High allelic diversity in HLA is argued to be maintained by balancing selection, such as negative frequency-dependent selection or heterozygote advantage. Selective pressure against immune escape by pathogens can maintain appreciable frequencies of many different HLA alleles. The selection pressures operating on combinations of HLA alleles across loci, or haplotypes, have not been extensively evaluated since the high HLA polymorphism necessitates very large sample sizes, which have not been available until recently. We aimed to evaluate the effect of selection operating at the HLA haplotype level by analyzing HLA A~C~B~DRB1~DQB1 haplotype frequencies derived from over six million individuals genotyped by the National Marrow Donor Program registry. In contrast with alleles, HLA haplotype diversity patterns suggest purifying selection, as certain HLA allele combinations co-occur in high linkage disequilibrium. Linkage disequilibrium is positive (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'&amp;gt;0) among frequent haplotypes and negative (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'&amp;lt;0) among rare haplotypes. Fitting the haplotype frequency distribution to several population dynamics models, we found that the best fit was obtained when significant positive frequency-dependent selection (FDS) was incorporated. Finally, the Ewens-Watterson test of homozygosity showed excess homozygosity for 5-locus haplotypes within 23 US populations studied, with an average &lt;i&gt;Fnd&lt;/i&gt; of 28.43. Haplotype diversity is most consistent with purifying selection for HLA Class I haplotypes (HLA-A, -B, -C), and was not inferred for HLA Class II haplotypes (-DRB1 and—DQB1). We discuss our empirical results in the context of evolutionary theory, exploring potential mechanisms of selection that maintain high linkage disequilibrium in MHC haplotype blocks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/983RcTGNU5k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;It is commonly assumed in neuronal coding that repeated presentations of a
stimulus to a coding neuron elicit similar responses. One common way to assess
similarity are spike train distances. These can be divided into spike-resolved,
such as the Victor-Purpura and the van Rossum distance, and time-resolved, e.g.
the ISI-, the SPIKE- and the RI-SPIKE-distance. We use independent steady-rate
Poisson processes as surrogates for spike trains with fixed rate and no timing
information to address two basic questions: How does the sensitivity of the
different spike train distances to temporal coding depend on the rates of the
two processes and how do the distances deal with very low rates? Spike-resolved
distances always contain rate information even for parameters indicating time
coding. This is an issue for reasonably high rates but beneficial for very low
rates. In contrast, the operational range for detecting time coding of
time-resolved distances is superior at normal rates, but these measures produce
artefacts at very low rates. The RI-SPIKE-distance is the only measure that is
sensitive to timing information only. While our results on rate-dependent
expectation values for the spike-resolved distances agree with Chicharro et al.
(2011), we here go one step further and specifically investigate applicability
for very low rates. The most appropriate measure depends on the rates of the
data being analysed. Accordingly, we summarize our results in one table that
allows an easy selection of the preferred measure for any kind of data.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Putting the &quot;dynamic&quot; back into dynamic functional connectivity</title>

	<description>The study of fluctuations in time-resolved functional connectivity is a topic of substantial current interest. As the term 'dynamic functional connectivity' implies, such fluctuations are believed to arise from dynamics in the neuronal systems generating these signals. While considerable activity currently attends to methodological and statistical issues regarding dynamic functional connectivity, less attention has been paid toward its candidate causes. Here, we review candidate scenarios for dynamic (functional) connectivity that arise in dynamical systems with two or more subsystems; generalized synchronization, itinerancy (a form of metastability), and multistability. Each of these scenarios arise under different configurations of local dynamics and inter-system coupling: We show how they generate time series data with nonlinear and/or non-stationary multivariate statistics. The key issue is that time series generated by coupled nonlinear systems contain a richer temporal structure than matched multivariate (linear) stochastic processes. In turn, this temporal structure yields many of the phenomena proposed as important to large-scale communication and computation in the brain, such as phase-amplitude coupling, complexity and flexibility. The code for simulating these dynamics is available in a freeware software platform, the Brain Dynamics Toolbox.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Common features in plastic changes rather than constructed structures in recurrent neural network prefrontal cortex models</title>

	<description>We have flexible control over our cognition depending on the context or surrounding environments. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) controls this cognitive flexibility; however, the detailed underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Recent developments in machine learning techniques have allowed simple recurrent neural network PFC models to perform human- or animal-like behavioral tasks. These systems allow us to acquire parameters, which we could not in biological experiments, for performing the tasks. We compared four models, in which a flexible cognition task, called context-dependent integration task, was performed; subsequently, we searched for common features. In all the models, we observed that high plastic synapses were concentrated in the small neuronal population and the more concentrated neuronal units contributed further to the performance. However, there were no common properties in the constructed structures. These results suggest that plastic changes can be more general and important to accomplish cognitive tasks than features of the constructed structures.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: On the relationship between instantaneous phase synchrony and correlation-based sliding windows for time-resolved fMRI connectivity analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/179820v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Correlation-based sliding window analysis (CSWA) is the most commonly used method to estimate time-resolved functional MRI (fMRI) connectivity. However, instantaneous phase synchrony analysis (IPSA) is gaining popularity mainly because it offers single time-point resolution of time-resolved fMRI connectivity. We aim to provide a systematic comparison between these two approaches, on both temporal and topological levels. For this purpose, we used resting-state fMRI data from two separate cohorts with different temporal resolutions (45 healthy subjects from Human Connectome Project fMRI data with repetition time of 0.72 s and 25 healthy subjects from a separate validation fMRI dataset with a repetition time of 3 s). For time-resolved functional connectivity analysis, we calculated tapered CSWA over a wide range of different window lengths that were temporally and topologically compared to IPSA. We found a strong association in connectivity dynamics between IPSA and CSWA when considering the absolute values of CSWA. This association peaked at a CSWA window length of ~20 seconds, irrespective of the sampling rate of the underlying fMRI data. Narrow-band filtering of fMRI data (0.03-0.07 Hz) yielded a stronger relationship between IPSA and CSWA than wider-band (0.01-0.1 Hz). On a topological level, time-averaged IPSA and CSWA nodes were non-linearly correlated, mainly because nodes with strong negative correlations (CSWA) displayed high phase synchrony (IPSA). Our results suggest that IPSA and CSWA provide comparable characterizations of time-resolved fMRI connectivity for appropriately chosen window lengths. Although IPSA requires narrow-band fMRI filtering, we recommend the use of IPSA given that it does not mandate a (semi-)arbitrary choice of window length and window overlap. A MATLAB code for calculating IPSA is provided.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Hierarchical recruitment of competition alleviates working memory overload in a fronto-parietal model</title>

	<description>Working memory capacity has long been the subject of intense research interest, but few studies have systematically investigated the dependence of capacity on memory load that exceeds our retention abilities. Under this real-world scenario, WM performance typically declines beyond a critical load among low-capacity subjects, a phenomenon known as working memory overload. We used a fronto-parietal cortical model to test the hypothesis that high-capacity subjects select a manageable number of items for storage, thereby avoiding overload. The model accounts for behavioural and electrophysiological data from high-capacity subjects in a parameter regime where competitive encoding in its prefrontal network selects items for storage, inter-aerial projections sustain their representations after stimulus offset, and weak dynamics in its parietal network limit their mutual interference. Violation of these principles accounts for these data among low-capacity subjects, implying that poor working memory performance reflects poor control over fronto-parietal circuitry, and making testable predictions for experiments.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Slot-like capacity and resource-like coding in a neural model of multiple-item working memory</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/181354v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/181354v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>For the past decade, research on the storage limitations of working memory has been dominated by two fundamentally different hypotheses. On the one hand, the contents of working memory may be stored in a limited number of  slots, each with a fixed resolution. On the other hand, any number of items may be stored, but with decreasing resolution. These two hypotheses have been invaluable in characterizing the computational structure of working memory, but neither provides a complete account of the available experimental data, nor speaks to the neural basis of the limitations it characterizes. To address these shortcomings, we simulated a multiple-item working memory task with a cortical network model, the cellular resolution of which allowed us to quantify the coding fidelity of memoranda as a function of memory load, as measured by the discriminability, regularity and reliability of simulated neural spiking. Our simulations account for a wealth of neural and behavioural data from human and non-human primate studies, and they demonstrate that feedback inhibition not only lowers capacity, but also lowers coding fidelity by all three measures. Because the strength of inhibition scales with the number of items stored by the network, increasing this number progressively lowers fidelity until capacity is reached. As such, the model provides a mechanistic explanation for experimental data showing that working memory precision decreases with increasing memory load before levelling off at capacity. Crucially, the model makes specific, testable predictions for neural activity on multiple-item working memory tasks.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Dysregulation of LIMK-1/Cofilin-1 pathway: A possible basis for alteration of neuronal morphology in experimental cerebral malaria</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25028</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Loss of cognition even after survival is the salient feature of cerebral malaria (CM). Currently, the fate of neuronal morphology is not studied at the ultra-structural level in CM. Recent studies suggest that maintenance of neuronal morphology and dendritic spine density (actin dynamics in particular) are essential for proper cognitive functions. LIMK-1/Cofilin-1signaling pathway is known to involve in the maintenance of actin dynamics through regulation of cofilin-1, in executing learning and memory functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Using experimental mouse model, we analyzed the behavioural parameters of CM, asymptomatic mice by performing Rapid Murine Coma Behaviour Scale experiment (RMCBS). We performed Golgi-Cox staining to assess neuronal morphology, dendritic spine density and arborization in the brain cortex subjected to &lt;em&gt;Plasmodium berghei ANKA&lt;/em&gt; infection compared to asymptomatic, anemic and control groups. We studied the neural gene expression pattern of LIMK-1, cofilin-1 and β-actin in all the experimental groups by semi-quantitative, quantitative PCR followed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: We observed significant loss of dendritic spine density, abnormal spine morphology, reduced dendritic arborization; extensive dendritic varicosities in the cortical neurons of CM infected brain. Further, these observations correlated with diminished protein levels of LIMK-1, cofilin-1, phospho-cofilin-1 and β-actin in the whole brain lysates as well as formation of actin-cofilin rods in the brain sections of mice symptomatic to CM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Overall, our findings suggest that the altered neuronal morphology and dysregulation of LIMK-1/cofilin-1 pathway could affect the cognitive outcome after experimental CM. Therefore, this study could help to establish newer therapeutic strategies aiming long-term cognitive impairment after CM. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: NMDA receptor-dependent dynamics of hippocampal place cell ensembles</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/181131v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Activity patterns of hippocampal neural population gradually change over time when the same event is repeated. This temporal dynamics of population activity may support to retain distinct memories of spatially identical, but temporally different, episodes. However, whether difference in population activity for the same event is principally dependent on time or also dependent on event rate in unit time is unknown. Long-term imaging of hippocampal CA1 neurons of mice was performed during repeated performance in a spatial memory task. Overlap of place cell population was independent of the number of tasks performed in a fixed time period, but it was dependent on the duration between the sessions. This time-dependent change of hippocampal ensemble code was suppressed by the administration of an NMDA receptor antagonist. These results suggested that the gradual change of activity pattern in the hippocampus works as a code for time, and NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity serves to form the code.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Opposite effects of lateralised transcranial alpha versus gamma stimulation on spatial attention</title>

	<description>Spatial attention relatively increases the power of neural 10-Hz alpha oscillations in the hemisphere ipsilateral to attention. The functional roles of lateralised oscillations for attention are unclear. Here, 20 human participants performed a dichotic listening task under continuous transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) at alpha (10 Hz, vs sham) or gamma (47 Hz, vs sham) frequency, targeting left temporo-parietal cortex. Participants attended to four spoken numbers presented to one ear, while ignoring numbers on the other ear. As predicted, we found that alpha-tACS contralateral to the attended ear decreased recall of attended targets. Notably, gamma-tACS reversed the effect. Results provide a proof of concept that externally amplified oscillations can enhance spatial attention and facilitate attentional selection of speech. Furthermore, opposite effects of alpha versus gamma oscillations support the view that, across modalities, states of high alpha are incommensurate with active neural processing as reflected by states of high gamma.</description>

	<description>Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability worldwide, with up to two-thirds of individuals experiencing long-term disabilities. Large-scale neuroimaging studies have shown promise in identifying robust biomarkers (e.g., measures of brain structure) of stroke recovery. However, analyzing large datasets is problematic due to barriers in accurate stroke lesion segmentation. Manually-traced lesions are currently the gold standard for lesion segmentation, but are labor intensive and require anatomical expertise. While algorithms have been developed to automate this process, the results often lack accuracy. Newer algorithms that employ machine-learning techniques are promising, yet these require large training datasets to optimize performance. Here we present ATLAS (Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke), an open-source dataset of 304 T1-weighted MRIs with manually segmented lesions and metadata. This large, diverse dataset can be used to train and test lesion segmentation algorithms and provides a standardized dataset for comparing the performance of different segmentation methods. We hope ATLAS R1.1 will be a useful resource to assess and improve the accuracy of current lesion segmentation methods.</description>

An ideal observer will give equivalent weight to sources of information that are equally reliable. However, when averaging visual information, human observers tend to downweight or discount features that are relatively outlying or deviant (‘robust averaging’). Why humans adopt an integration policy that discards important decision information remains unknown. Here, observers were asked to judge the average tilt in a circular array of high-contrast gratings, relative to an orientation boundary defined by a central reference grating. Observers showed robust averaging of orientation, but the extent to which they did so was a positive predictor of their overall performance. Using computational simulations, we show that although robust averaging is suboptimal for a perfect integrator, it paradoxically enhances performance in the presence of “late” noise, i.e. which corrupts decisions during integration. In other words, robust decision strategies increase the brain’s resilience to noise arising in neural computations during decision-making.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9-7Oog0_4kM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Towards a category theory approach to analogy: Analyzing re-representation and acquisition of numerical knowledge</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jairo A. Navarrete, Pablo Dartnell&lt;/p&gt;

Category Theory, a branch of mathematics, has shown promise as a modeling framework for higher-level cognition. We introduce an algebraic model for &lt;i&gt;analogy&lt;/i&gt; that uses the language of category theory to explore analogy-related cognitive phenomena. To illustrate the potential of this approach, we use this model to explore three objects of study in cognitive literature. First, (a) we use &lt;i&gt;commutative diagrams&lt;/i&gt; to analyze an effect of playing particular educational board games on the learning of numbers. Second, (b) we employ a notion called &lt;i&gt;coequalizer&lt;/i&gt; as a formal model of re-representation that explains a property of computational models of analogy called “flexibility” whereby non-similar representational elements are considered matches and placed in structural correspondence. Finally, (c) we build a formal learning model which shows that re-representation, language processing and analogy making can explain the acquisition of knowledge of rational numbers. These objects of study provide a picture of acquisition of numerical knowledge that is compatible with empirical evidence and offers insights on possible connections between notions such as relational knowledge, analogy, learning, conceptual knowledge, re-representation and procedural knowledge. This suggests that the approach presented here facilitates mathematical modeling of cognition and provides novel ways to think about analogy-related cognitive phenomena.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sBo6FmxKjSc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Multivariate decoding methods, such as multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA), are highly effective at extracting information from brain imaging data. Yet, the precise nature of the information that MVPA draws upon remains controversial. Most current theories emphasize the enhanced sensitivity imparted by aggregating across voxels that have mixed and weak selectivity. However, beyond the selectivity of individual voxels, neural variability is correlated across voxels, and such noise correlations may contribute importantly to accurate decoding. Indeed, a recent computational theory proposed that noise correlations enhance multivariate decoding from heterogeneous neural populations. Here we extend this theory from the scale of neurons to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and show that noise correlations between heterogeneous populations of voxels (i.e., voxels selective for different stimulus variables) contribute to the success of MVPA. Specifically, decoding performance is enhanced when voxels with high vs. low noise correlations (measured during rest or in the background of the task) are selected during classifier training. Conversely, voxels that are strongly selective for one class in a GLM or that receive high classification weights in MVPA tend to exhibit high noise correlations with voxels selective for the other class being discriminated against. Furthermore, we use simulations to show that this is a general property of fMRI data and that selectivity and noise correlations can have distinguishable influences on decoding. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that if there is signal in the data, the resulting above-chance classification accuracy is modulated by the magnitude of noise correlations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MRF7w8Pk05Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A Mixed Finite Element Method to Solve the EEG Forward Problem. (arXiv:1604.05764v2 [math.NA] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.05764</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.05764</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Finite element methods have been shown to achieve high accuracies in
numerically solving the EEG forward problem and they enable the realistic
modeling of complex geometries and important conductive features such as
anisotropic conductivities. To date, most of the presented approaches rely on
the same underlying formulation, the continuous Galerkin (CG)-FEM. In this
article, a novel approach to solve the EEG forward problem based on a mixed
finite element method (Mixed-FEM) is introduced. To obtain the Mixed-FEM
formulation, the electric current is introduced as an additional unknown
besides the electric potential. As a consequence of this derivation, the
Mixed-FEM is, by construction, current preserving, in contrast to the CG-FEM.
Consequently, a higher simulation accuracy can be achieved in certain
scenarios, e.g., when the diameter of thin insulating structures, such as the
skull, is in the range of the mesh resolution.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A theoretical derivation of the Mixed-FEM approach for EEG forward
simulations is presented, and the algorithms implemented for solving the
resulting equation systems are described. Subsequently, first evaluations in
both sphere and realistic head models are presented, and the results are
compared to previously introduced CG-FEM approaches. Additional visualizations
are shown to illustrate the current preserving property of the Mixed-FEM.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on these results, it is concluded that the newly presented Mixed-FEM
can at least complement and in some scenarios even outperform the established
CG-FEM approaches, which motivates a further evaluation of the Mixed-FEM for
applications in bioelectromagnetism.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The lawful imprecision of human surface tilt estimation in natural scenes</title>

	<description>Estimating local surface orientation (slant and tilt) is fundamental to recovering the three-dimensional structure of the environment, but it is unknown how well humans perform this task in natural scenes. Here, with a high-fidelity database of natural stereo-images with groundtruth surface orientation at each pixel, we find dramatic differences in human tilt estimation with natural and artificial stimuli. With artificial stimuli, estimates are precise and unbiased. With natural stimuli, estimates are imprecise and strongly biased. An image-computable normative model grounded in natural scene statistics predicts human bias, precision, and trial-by-trial errors without fitting parameters to the human data. These similarities suggest that the complex human performance patterns with natural stimuli are lawful, and that human visual systems have internalized local image and scene statistics to optimally infer the three-dimensional structure of the environment. The current results help generalize our understanding of human vision from the lab to the real world.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Contributions of different prefrontal cortical regions to abstract rule acquisition and reversal in monkeys</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/180893v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>It is thought that the ability to learn and follow abstract rules relies on intact prefrontal regions including the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). To learn more about the differences between LPFC and OFC in rule learning, we tested monkeys with bilateral removals of either LPFC or OFC on a rapidly learned task requiring the formation of the abstract concept of same/different. While monkeys with OFC removals were significantly slower than controls at both acquiring and reversing the concept-based rule, monkeys with LPFC removals were not impaired in acquiring the task, but were significantly slower at rule reversal. Neither group was impaired in the acquisition or reversal of a delayed visual cue-outcome association task without a concept-based rule. These results suggest that OFC is essential for the implementation of a concept-based rule, whereas LPFC seems essential for its modification once established.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Optogenetic inhibition reveals distinct roles for basolateral amygdala activity at discrete timepoints during risky decision making</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/180885v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/180885v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Decision making is a multifaceted process, consisting of several distinct phases that likely require different cognitive operations. Previous work showed that the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a critical substrate for decision making involving risk of punishment; however, it is unclear how the BLA is recruited at different stages of the decision process. To this end, the current study used optogenetics to inhibit the BLA during specific task phases in a model of risky decision making (Risky Decision-making Task; RDT) in which rats choose between a small, safe reward and a large reward accompanied by varying probabilities of footshock punishment. Rats received intra-BLA microinjections of viral vectors carrying either halorhodopsin (eNpHR3.0-mCherry) or mCherry alone (control) followed by optic fiber implants and were trained in the RDT. Laser stimulation during the task occurred during either intertrial interval, deliberation, or reward outcome phases, the latter of which was further divided into the three possible outcomes (small, safe; large, unpunished; large, punished). Inhibition of the BLA selectively during the deliberation phase decreased choice of the large, risky outcome (decreased risky choice). In contrast, BLA inhibition selectively during delivery of the large, punished outcome increased risky choice. Inhibition had no effect during the other phases, nor did it affect performance in control rats. Collectively, these data indicate that the BLA can either inhibit or promote choice of risky options, depending on the phase of the decision process in which it is active.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The psychological arrow of time and the human brain dynamics of event ordering</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/180711v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/180711v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>When navigating the real-world, the spatiotemporal sequencing of events is intrinsically bound to one's physical trajectory; when recollecting the past or imagining the future, the temporal and spatial dimension of events can be independently manipulated. Yet, the rules enabling the flexible use of spatial and temporal cognitive maps likely differ in one major way as time is directional (oriented from past-to-future) whereas space is not. Using combined magneto- and electroencephalography, we sought to capture such differences by characterizing time-resolved brain activity while participants mentally ordered memories from different mental perspectives in time (past/future) or space (west/east). We report two major neural dissociations underlying the mental ordering of events in time and in space: first, brain responses evoked by the temporal order and the temporal distance of events-to-self dissociated at early and late latencies, respectively whereas spatial order and distance of events-to-self elicited late brain responses simultaneously. Second, brain responses distinguishing self-position in time and the temporal order of events involved sources in the hippocampal formation; spatial perspective, order and distance did not. These results suggest that the neural dynamics evoked by the temporal ordering of a series of events retrieved from long-term memory, i.e. the psychological time arrow, entails dedicated cognitive processes in the hippocampal formation that are fundamentally distinct from the mapping of spatial location.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Quasi-Periodic Patterns of Intrinsic Brain Activity in Individuals and their Relationship to Global Signal</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/180596v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/180596v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Quasiperiodic patterns (QPPs) as reported by Majeed et al., 2011 are prominent features of the brain intrinsic activity that involve important large-scale networks (default mode, DMN; task positive, TPN) and are likely to be major contributors to widely used measures of functional connectivity. We examined the variability of these patterns in 470 individuals from the Human Connectome Project resting state functional MRI dataset. The QPPs from individuals can be coarsely categorized into two types: one where strong anti-correlation between the DMN and TPN is present, and another without this anti-correlation. QPP type could be predicted by an individual global signal, with higher global signal corresponding to QPPs without anti-correlation. After global signal regression, all QPPs showed strong anti-correlation between DMN and TPN. QPP occurrence and type was similar between a subgroup of individuals with extremely low motion and the rest of the sample, which shows that motion is not a major contributor to the QPPs. QPP occurrence only weakly correlates with the estimate of slow respiratory-induced fMRI signal fluctuations, an indication that physiological noise is not the primary source of the QPP. QPPs were more similar for the same subjects scanned on different days than for different subjects. These results provide the first assessment of the variability in individual QPPs and their relationship to physiological parameters.</description>

Protein design remains an important problem in computational structural biology. Current computational protein design methods largely use physics-based methods, which make use of information from a single protein structure. This is despite the fact that multiple structures of many protein folds are now readily available in the PDB. While ensemble protein design methods can use multiple protein structures, they treat each structure independently. Here, we introduce a flexible backbone strategy, FlexiBaL-GP, which learns global protein backbone movements directly from multiple protein structures. FlexiBaL-GP uses the machine learning method of Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models to learn a lower dimensional representation of the protein coordinates that best represent backbone movements. These learned backbone movements are used to explore alternative protein backbones, while engineering a protein within a parallel tempered MCMC framework. Using the human ubiquitin–USP21 complex as a model we demonstrate that our design strategy outperforms current strategies for the interface design task of identifying tight binding ubiquitin variants for USP21.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/t6T6ch57tGE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

In recent years, there have been many computational simulations of spontaneous neural dynamics. Here, we describe a simple model of spontaneous neural dynamics that controls an agent moving in a simple virtual environment. These dynamics generate interesting brain-environment feedback interactions that rapidly destabilize neural and behavioral dynamics demonstrating the need for homeostatic mechanisms. We investigate roles for homeostatic plasticity both locally (local inhibition adjusting to balance excitatory input) as well as more globally (regional “task negative” activity that compensates for “task positive”, sensory input in another region) balancing neural activity and leading to more stable behavior (trajectories through the environment). Our results suggest complementary functional roles for both local and macroscale mechanisms in maintaining neural and behavioral dynamics and a novel functional role for macroscopic “task-negative” patterns of activity (e.g., the default mode network).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kCaFdi-3S6Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs), including emerging multi-drug resistant organisms, threaten healthcare systems worldwide. Efficient containment measures of HAIs must mobilize the entire healthcare network. Thus, to best understand how to reduce the potential scale of HAI epidemic spread, we explore patient transfer patterns in the French healthcare system. Using an exhaustive database of all hospital discharge summaries in France in 2014, we construct and analyze three patient networks based on the following: transfers of patients with HAI (HAI-specific network); patients with suspected HAI (suspected-HAI network); and all patients (general network). All three networks have heterogeneous patient flow and demonstrate small-world and scale-free characteristics. Patient populations that comprise these networks are also heterogeneous in their movement patterns. Ranking of hospitals by centrality measures and comparing community clustering using community detection algorithms shows that despite the differences in patient population, the HAI-specific and suspected-HAI networks rely on the same underlying structure as that of the general network. As a result, the general network may be more reliable in studying potential spread of HAIs. Finally, we identify transfer patterns at both the French regional and departmental (county) levels that are important in the identification of key hospital centers, patient flow trajectories, and regional clusters that may serve as a basis for novel wide-scale infection control strategies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Hha9dvbFa6M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Histologic and biochemical alterations predict pulmonary mechanical dysfunction in aging mice with chronic lung inflammation</title>

Both aging and chronic inflammation produce complex structural and biochemical alterations to the lung known to impact work of breathing. Mice deficient in surfactant protein D (Sftpd) develop progressive age-related lung pathology characterized by tissue destruction/remodeling, accumulation of foamy macrophages and alteration in surfactant composition. This study proposes to relate changes in tissue structure seen in normal aging and in chronic inflammation to altered lung mechanics using a computational model. Alterations in lung function in aging and Sftpd -/- mice have been inferred from fitting simple mechanical models to respiratory impedance data (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;rs&lt;/sub&gt;), however interpretation has been confounded by the simultaneous presence of multiple coexisting pathophysiologic processes. In contrast to the inverse modeling approach, this study uses simulation from experimental measurements to recapitulate how aging and inflammation alter &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;rs&lt;/sub&gt;. Histologic and mechanical measurements were made in C57BL6/J mice and congenic Sftpd-/- mice at 8, 27 and 80 weeks of age (n = 8/group). An anatomic computational model based on published airway morphometry was developed and &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;rs&lt;/sub&gt; was simulated between 0.5 and 20 Hz. End expiratory pressure dependent changes in airway caliber and recruitment were estimated from mechanical measurements. Tissue elements were simulated using the constant phase model of viscoelasticity. Baseline elastance distribution was estimated in 8-week-old wild type mice, and stochastically varied for each condition based on experimentally measured alteration in elastic fiber composition, alveolar geometry and surfactant composition. Weighing reduction in model error against increasing model complexity allowed for identification of essential features underlying mechanical pathology and their contribution to &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;rs&lt;/sub&gt;. Using a maximum likelihood approach, alteration in lung recruitment and diminished elastic fiber density were shown predictive of mechanical alteration at airway opening, to a greater extent than overt acinar wall destruction. Model-predicted deficits in PEEP-dependent lung recruitment correlate with altered lung lining fluid composition independent of age or genotype.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/W_PqHjUd6fU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Uncovering hidden functional brain organization by random matrix theory. (arXiv:1708.07046v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the brain, systems are organized in a modular way, serving different
functionalities. We present a novel method, based on random matrix theory, for
the detection of functional modules in neural systems. Our method can
efficiently filter out both local unit-specific noise and global system- wide
dependencies that typically obfuscate the presence of sub-structures, thus
unveiling a hidden functional structure. Using correlation-based community
detection, the method yields an optimally contrasted mesoscopic functional
structure, i.e. groups of neurons (or small brain regions) that are positively
correlated internally, while at the same time negatively correlated with each
other. The method is purely data driven and does not use any presumptions or
network representation. In an experimental dataset containing time series of
neuronal gene expression, the method detects two hidden functional modules
which are recognized as existing anatomical regions, without any prior
anatomical knowledge(, showing the potential of the method to be used on brain
data).

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Fluctuations between high- and low-modularity topology in time-resolved functional connectivity. (arXiv:1511.06427v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06427</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06427</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Modularity is an important topological attribute for functional brain
networks. Recent studies have reported that modularity of functional networks
varies not only across individuals being related to demographics and cognitive
performance, but also within individuals co-occurring with fluctuations in
network properties of functional connectivity, estimated over short time
intervals. However, characteristics of these time-resolved functional networks
during periods of high and low modularity have remained largely unexplored. In
this study we investigate spatiotemporal properties of time-resolved networks
in the high and low modularity periods during rest, with a particular focus on
their spatial connectivity patterns, temporal homogeneity and test-retest
reliability. We show that spatial connectivity patterns of time-resolved
networks in the high and low modularity periods are represented by increased
and decreased dissociation of the default mode network module from
task-positive network modules, respectively. We also find that the instances of
time-resolved functional connectivity sampled from within the high (low)
modularity period are relatively homogeneous (heterogeneous) over time,
indicating that during the low modularity period the default mode network
interacts with other networks in a variable manner. We confirmed that the
occurrence of the high and low modularity periods varies across individuals
with moderate inter-session test-retest reliability and that it is correlated
with previously-reported individual differences in the modularity of functional
connectivity estimated over longer timescales. Our findings illustrate how
time-resolved functional networks are spatiotemporally organized during periods
of high and low modularity, allowing one to trace individual differences in
long-timescale modularity to the variable occurrence of network configurations
at shorter timescales.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Deciphering HLA-I motifs across HLA peptidomes improves neo-antigen predictions and identifies allostery regulating HLA specificity</title>

The precise identification of Human Leukocyte Antigen class I (HLA-I) binding motifs plays a central role in our ability to understand and predict (neo-)antigen presentation in infectious diseases and cancer. Here, by exploiting co-occurrence of HLA-I alleles across ten newly generated as well as forty public HLA peptidomics datasets comprising more than 115,000 unique peptides, we show that we can rapidly and accurately identify many HLA-I binding motifs and map them to their corresponding alleles without any &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; knowledge of HLA-I binding specificity. Our approach recapitulates and refines known motifs for 43 of the most frequent alleles, uncovers new motifs for 9 alleles that up to now had less than five known ligands and provides a scalable framework to incorporate additional HLA peptidomics studies in the future. The refined motifs improve neo-antigen and cancer testis antigen predictions, indicating that unbiased HLA peptidomics data are ideal for &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; predictions of neo-antigens from tumor exome sequencing data. The new motifs further reveal distant modulation of the binding specificity at P2 for some HLA-I alleles by residues in the HLA-I binding site but outside of the B-pocket and we unravel the underlying mechanisms by protein structure analysis, mutagenesis and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; binding assays.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PyX3xsSmxSk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Ischemia/Reperfusion Induces Interferon-Stimulated Gene Expression in Microglia</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Innate immune signaling is important in the pathophysiology of ischemia/reperfusion (stroke)-induced injury and recovery. Several lines of evidence support a central role for microglia in these processes. Recent work has identified Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and type I interferon (IFN) signaling in both ischemia/reperfusion-induced brain injury and ischemic preconditioning-mediated neuroprotection. To determine the effects of &quot;ischemia/reperfusion-like&quot; conditions on microglia, we performed genomic analyses on wild-type (WT) and &lt;i&gt;TLR4&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; cultured microglia after sequential exposure to hypoxia/hypoglycemia and normoxia/normoglycemia (H/H–N/N). We observed increased expression of type 1 IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) as the predominant transcriptomal feature of H/H–N/N-exposed WT, but not &lt;i&gt;TLR4&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;, microglia. Microarray analysis on &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; sorted microglia from ipsilateral male mouse cortex after a transient &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; ischemic pulse also demonstrated robust expression of ISGs. Type 1 IFNs, including the IFN-αs and IFN-β, activate the interferon-α/β receptor (IFNAR) complex. We confirmed both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; H/H–N/N- and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; ischemia/reperfusion-induced microglial ISG responses by quantitative real-time PCR and demonstrated that both were dependent on IFNAR1. We characterized the effects of hypoxia/hypoglycemia on phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), release of type 1 IFNs, and surface expression of IFNAR1 in microglia. We demonstrated that IFN-β induces dose-dependent secretion of ISG chemokines in cultured microglia and robust ISG expression in microglia both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Finally, we demonstrated that the microglial ISG chemokine responses to TLR4 agonists were dependent on TLR4 and IFNAR1. Together, these data suggest novel ischemia/reperfusion-induced pathways for both TLR4-dependent and -independent, IFNAR1-dependent, type 1 IFN signaling in microglia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States and is a leading cause of serious long-term disability worldwide. Innate immune responses are critical in stroke pathophysiology, and microglia are key cellular effectors in the CNS response to ischemia/reperfusion. Using a transcriptional analysis approach, we identified a robust interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene response within microglia exposed to ischemia/reperfusion in both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; experimental paradigms. Using a number of complementary techniques, we have demonstrated that these responses are dependent on innate immune signaling components including Toll-like receptor-4 and type I IFNs. We have also elucidated several novel ischemia/reperfusion-induced microglial signaling mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Feeding Releases Endogenous Opioids in Humans</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8284?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8284?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The endogenous opioid system supports a multitude of functions related to appetitive behavior in humans and animals, and it has been proposed to govern hedonic aspects of feeding thus contributing to the development of obesity. Here we used positron emission tomography to investigate whether feeding results in hedonia-dependent endogenous opioid release in humans. Ten healthy males were recruited for the study. They were scanned with the μ-opioid-specific ligand [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]carfentanil three times, as follows: after a palatable meal, a nonpalatable meal, and after an overnight fast. Subjective mood, satiety, and circulating hormone levels were measured. Feeding induced significant endogenous opioid release throughout the brain. This response was more pronounced following a nonpalatable meal versus a palatable meal, and independent of the subjective hedonic responses to feeding. We conclude that feeding consistently triggers cerebral opioid release even in the absence of subjective pleasure associated with feeding, suggesting that metabolic and homeostatic rather than exclusively hedonic responses play a role in the feeding-triggered cerebral opioid release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The endogenous opioid system supports both hedonic and homeostatic functions. It has been proposed that overeating and concomitant opioid release could downregulate opioid receptors and promote the development of obesity. However, it remains unresolved whether feeding leads to endogenous opioid release in humans. We used &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; positron emission tomography to test whether feeding triggers cerebral opioid release and whether this response is associated with pleasurable sensations. We scanned volunteers using the μ-opioid receptor-specific radioligand [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]carfentanil three times, as follows: after an overnight fast, after consuming a palatable meal, and after consuming a nonpalatable meal. Feeding led to significant endogenous opioid release, and this occurred also in the absence of feeding-triggered hedonia. Feeding-triggered opioid release thus also reflects metabolic and homeostatic responses rather than hedonic responses exclusively.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Information-Theoretic Evidence for Predictive Coding in the Face-Processing System</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8273?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8273?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Predictive coding suggests that the brain infers the causes of its sensations by combining sensory evidence with internal predictions based on available prior knowledge. However, the neurophysiological correlates of (pre)activated prior knowledge serving these predictions are still unknown. Based on the idea that such preactivated prior knowledge must be maintained until needed, we measured the amount of maintained information in neural signals via the active information storage (AIS) measure. AIS was calculated on whole-brain beamformer-reconstructed source time courses from MEG recordings of 52 human subjects during the baseline of a Mooney face/house detection task. Preactivation of prior knowledge for faces showed as α-band-related and β-band-related AIS increases in content-specific areas; these AIS increases were behaviorally relevant in the brain's fusiform face area. Further, AIS allowed decoding of the cued category on a trial-by-trial basis. Our results support accounts indicating that activated prior knowledge and the corresponding predictions are signaled in low-frequency activity (&amp;lt;30 Hz).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Our perception is not only determined by the information our eyes/retina and other sensory organs receive from the outside world, but strongly depends also on information already present in our brains, such as prior knowledge about specific situations or objects. A currently popular theory in neuroscience, predictive coding theory, suggests that this prior knowledge is used by the brain to form internal predictions about upcoming sensory information. However, neurophysiological evidence for this hypothesis is rare, mostly because this kind of evidence requires strong a priori assumptions about the specific predictions the brain makes and the brain areas involved. Using a novel, assumption-free approach, we find that face-related prior knowledge and the derived predictions are represented in low-frequency brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Calcineurin Dysregulation Underlies Spinal Cord Injury-Induced K+ Channel Dysfunction in DRG Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8256?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8256?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dysfunction of the fast-inactivating Kv3.4 potassium current in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons contributes to the hyperexcitability associated with persistent pain induced by spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the underlying mechanism is not known. In light of our previous work demonstrating modulation of the Kv3.4 channel by phosphorylation, we investigated the role of the phosphatase calcineurin (CaN) using electrophysiological, molecular, and imaging approaches in adult female Sprague Dawley rats. Pharmacological inhibition of CaN in small-diameter DRG neurons slowed repolarization of the somatic action potential (AP) and attenuated the Kv3.4 current. Attenuated Kv3.4 currents also exhibited slowed inactivation. We observed similar effects on the recombinant Kv3.4 channel heterologously expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, supporting our findings in DRG neurons. Elucidating the molecular basis of these effects, mutation of four previously characterized serines within the Kv3.4 N-terminal inactivation domain eliminated the effects of CaN inhibition on the Kv3.4 current. SCI similarly induced concurrent Kv3.4 current attenuation and slowing of inactivation. Although there was little change in CaN expression and localization after injury, SCI induced upregulation of the native regulator of CaN 1 (RCAN1) in the DRG at the transcript and protein levels. Consistent with CaN inhibition resulting from RCAN1 upregulation, overexpression of RCAN1 in naive DRG neurons recapitulated the effects of pharmacological CaN inhibition on the Kv3.4 current and the AP. Overall, these results demonstrate a novel regulatory pathway that links CaN, RCAN1, and Kv3.4 in DRG neurons. Dysregulation of this pathway might underlie a peripheral mechanism of pain sensitization induced by SCI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Pain sensitization associated with spinal cord injury (SCI) involves poorly understood maladaptive modulation of neuronal excitability. Although central mechanisms have received significant attention, recent studies have identified peripheral nerve hyperexcitability as a driver of persistent pain signaling after SCI. However, the ion channels and signaling molecules responsible for this change in primary sensory neuron excitability are still not well defined. To address this problem, this study used complementary electrophysiological and molecular methods to determine how Kv3.4, a voltage-gated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel robustly expressed in dorsal root ganglion neurons, becomes dysfunctional upon calcineurin (CaN) inhibition. The results strongly suggest that CaN inhibition underlies SCI-induced dysfunction of Kv3.4 and the associated excitability changes through upregulation of the native regulator of CaN 1 (RCAN1).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sound-Evoked Activity Influences Myelination of Brainstem Axons in the Trapezoid Body</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8239?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8239?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Plasticity of myelination represents a mechanism to tune the flow of information by balancing functional requirements with metabolic and spatial constraints. The auditory system is heavily myelinated and operates at the upper limits of action potential generation frequency and speed observed in the mammalian CNS. This study aimed to characterize the development of myelin within the trapezoid body, a central auditory fiber tract, and determine the influence sensory experience has on this process in mice of both sexes. We find that &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; conduction speed doubles following hearing onset and the ability to support high-frequency firing increases concurrently. Also in this time, the diameter of trapezoid body axons and the thickness of myelin double, reaching mature-like thickness between 25 and 35 d of age. Earplugs were used to induce ~50 dB elevation in auditory thresholds. If introduced at hearing onset, trapezoid body fibers developed thinner axons and myelin than age-matched controls. If plugged during adulthood, the thickest trapezoid body fibers also showed a decrease in myelin. These data demonstrate the need for sensory activity in both development and maintenance of myelin and have important implications in the study of myelin plasticity and how this could relate to sensorineural hearing loss following peripheral impairment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The auditory system has many mechanisms to maximize the dynamic range of its afferent fibers, which operate at the physiological limit of action potential generation, precision, and speed. In this study we demonstrate for the first time that changes in peripheral activity modifies the thickness of myelin in sensory neurons, not only in development but also in mature animals. The current study suggests that changes in CNS myelination occur as a downstream mechanism following peripheral deficit. Given the required submillisecond temporal precision for binaural auditory processing, reduced myelination might augment sensorineural hearing impairment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cognition is compromised by white matter (WM) injury but the neurophysiological alterations linking them remain unclear. We hypothesized that reduced neural synchronization caused by disruption of neural signal propagation is involved. To test this, we evaluated group differences in: diffusion tensor WM microstructure measures within the optic radiations, primary visual area (V1), and cuneus; neural phase synchrony to a visual attention cue during visual-motor task; and reaction time to a response cue during the same task between 26 pediatric patients (17/9: male/female) treated with cranial radiation treatment for a brain tumor (12.67 ± 2.76 years), and 26 healthy children (16/10: male/female; 12.01 ± 3.9 years). We corroborated our findings using a corticocortical computational model representing perturbed signal conduction from myelin. Patients show delayed reaction time, WM compromise, and reduced phase synchrony during visual attention compared with healthy children. Notably, using partial least-squares–path modeling we found that WM insult within the optic radiations, V1, and cuneus is a strong predictor of the slower reaction times via disruption of neural synchrony in visual cortex. Observed changes in synchronization were reproduced in a computational model of WM injury. These findings provide new evidence linking cognition with WM via the reliance of neural synchronization on propagation of neural signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; By comparing brain tumor patients to healthy children, we establish that changes in the microstructure of the optic radiations and neural synchrony during visual attention predict reaction time. Furthermore, by testing the directionality of these links through statistical modeling and verifying our findings with computational modeling, we infer a causal relationship, namely that changes in white matter microstructure impact cognition in part by disturbing the ability of neural assemblies to synchronize. Together, our human imaging data and computer simulations show a fundamental connection between WM microstructure and neural synchronization that is critical for cognitive processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Altered Balance of Receptive Field Excitation and Suppression in Visual Cortex of Amblyopic Macaque Monkeys</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In amblyopia, a visual disorder caused by abnormal visual experience during development, the amblyopic eye (AE) loses visual sensitivity whereas the fellow eye (FE) is largely unaffected. Binocular vision in amblyopes is often disrupted by interocular suppression. We used 96-electrode arrays to record neurons and neuronal groups in areas V1 and V2 of six female macaque monkeys (&lt;i&gt;Macaca nemestrina&lt;/i&gt;) made amblyopic by artificial strabismus or anisometropia in early life, as well as two visually normal female controls. To measure suppressive binocular interactions directly, we recorded neuronal responses to dichoptic stimulation. We stimulated both eyes simultaneously with large sinusoidal gratings, controlling their contrast independently with raised-cosine modulators of different orientations and spatial frequencies. We modeled each eye's receptive field at each cortical site using a difference of Gaussian envelopes and derived estimates of the strength of central excitation and surround suppression. We used these estimates to calculate ocular dominance separately for excitation and suppression. Excitatory drive from the FE dominated amblyopic visual cortex, especially in more severe amblyopes, but suppression from both the FE and AEs was prevalent in all animals. This imbalance created strong interocular suppression in deep amblyopes: increasing contrast in the AE decreased responses at binocular cortical sites. These response patterns reveal mechanisms that likely contribute to the interocular suppression that disrupts vision in amblyopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Amblyopia is a developmental visual disorder that alters both monocular vision and binocular interaction. Using microelectrode arrays, we examined binocular interaction in primary visual cortex and V2 of six amblyopic macaque monkeys (&lt;i&gt;Macaca nemestrina&lt;/i&gt;) and two visually normal controls. By stimulating the eyes dichoptically, we showed that, in amblyopic cortex, the binocular combination of signals is altered. The excitatory influence of the two eyes is imbalanced to a degree that can be predicted from the severity of amblyopia, whereas suppression from both eyes is prevalent in all animals. This altered balance of excitation and suppression reflects mechanisms that may contribute to the interocular perceptual suppression that disrupts vision in amblyopes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Acute Increases in Protein O-GlcNAcylation Dampen Epileptiform Activity in Hippocampus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8207?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8207?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;O-GlcNAcylation is a ubiquitous and dynamic post-translational modification involving the O-linkage of β-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylglucosamine to serine/threonine residues of membrane, cytosolic, and nuclear proteins. This modification is similar to phosphorylation and regarded as a key regulator of cell survival and homeostasis. Previous studies have shown that phosphorylation of serine residues on synaptic proteins is a major regulator of synaptic strength and long-term plasticity, suggesting that O-GlcNAcylation of synaptic proteins is likely as important as phosphorylation; however, few studies have investigated its role in synaptic efficacy. We recently demonstrated that acutely increasing O-GlcNAcylation induces a novel form of LTD at CA3-CA1 synapses, O-GlcNAc LTD. Here, using hippocampal slices from young adult male rats and mice, we report that epileptiform activity at CA3-CA1 synapses, generated by GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R inhibition, is significantly attenuated when protein O-GlcNAcylation is pharmacologically increased. This dampening effect is lost in slices from GluA2 KO mice, indicating a requirement of GluA2-containing AMPARs, similar to expression of O-GlcNAc LTD. Furthermore, we find that increasing O-GlcNAcylation decreases spontaneous CA3 pyramidal cell activity under basal and hyperexcitable conditions. This dampening effect was also observed on cortical hyperexcitability during &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; EEG recordings in awake mice where the effects of the proconvulsant pentylenetetrazole are attenuated by acutely increasing O-GlcNAcylation. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the post-translational modification, O-GlcNAcylation, is a novel mechanism by which neuronal and synaptic excitability can be regulated, and suggest the possibility that increasing O-GlcNAcylation could be a novel therapeutic target to treat seizure disorders and epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We recently reported that an acute pharmacological increase in protein O-GlcNAcylation induces a novel form of long-term synaptic depression at hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses (O-GlcNAc LTD). This synaptic dampening effect on glutamatergic networks suggests that increasing O-GlcNAcylation will depress pathological hyperexcitability. Using &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; models of epileptiform activity, we show that acutely increasing O-GlcNAc levels can significantly attenuate ongoing epileptiform activity and prophylactically dampen subsequent seizure activity. Together, our findings support the conclusion that protein O-GlcNAcylation is a regulator of neuronal excitability, and it represents a promising target for further research on seizure disorder therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Why New Spinal Cord Plasticity Does Not Disrupt Old Motor Behaviors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8198?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8198?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;When new motor learning changes the spinal cord, old behaviors are not impaired; their key features are preserved by additional compensatory plasticity. To explore the mechanisms responsible for this compensatory plasticity, we transected the spinal dorsal ascending tract before or after female rats acquired a new behavior—operantly conditioned increase or decrease in the right soleus H-reflex—and examined an old behavior—locomotion. Neither spinal dorsal ascending tract transection nor H-reflex conditioning alone impaired locomotion. Nevertheless, when spinal dorsal ascending tract transection and H-reflex conditioning were combined, the rats developed a limp and a tilted posture that correlated in direction and magnitude with the H-reflex change. When the right H-reflex was increased by conditioning, the right step lasted longer than the left and the right hip was higher than the left; when the right H-reflex was decreased by conditioning, the opposite occurred. These results indicate that ascending sensory input guides the compensatory plasticity that normally prevents the plasticity underlying H-reflex change from impairing locomotion. They support the concept of the state of the spinal cord as a negotiated equilibrium that reflects the concurrent influences of all the behaviors in an individual's repertoire; and they support the new therapeutic strategies this concept introduces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The spinal cord provides a reliable final common pathway for motor behaviors throughout life. Until recently, its reliability was explained by the assumption that it is hardwired; but it is now clear that the spinal cord changes continually as new behaviors are acquired. Nevertheless, old behaviors are preserved. This study shows that their preservation depends on sensory feedback from the spinal cord to the brain: if feedback is removed, the acquisition of a new behavior may disrupt an old behavior. In sum, when a new behavior changes the spinal cord, sensory feedback to the brain guides further change that preserves old behaviors. This finding contributes to a new understanding of spinal cord function and to development of new rehabilitation therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Gain Modulation as a Mechanism for Coding Depth from Motion Parallax in Macaque Area MT</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8180?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8180?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Observer translation produces differential image motion between objects that are located at different distances from the observer's point of fixation [motion parallax (MP)]. However, MP can be ambiguous with respect to depth sign (near vs far), and this ambiguity can be resolved by combining retinal image motion with signals regarding eye movement relative to the scene. We have previously demonstrated that both extra-retinal and visual signals related to smooth eye movements can modulate the responses of neurons in area MT of macaque monkeys, and that these modulations generate neural selectivity for depth sign. However, the neural mechanisms that govern this selectivity have remained unclear. In this study, we analyze responses of MT neurons as a function of both retinal velocity and direction of eye movement, and we show that smooth eye movements modulate MT responses in a systematic, temporally precise, and directionally specific manner to generate depth-sign selectivity. We demonstrate that depth-sign selectivity is primarily generated by multiplicative modulations of the response gain of MT neurons. Through simulations, we further demonstrate that depth can be estimated reasonably well by a linear decoding of a population of MT neurons with response gains that depend on eye velocity. Together, our findings provide the first mechanistic description of how visual cortical neurons signal depth from MP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Motion parallax is a monocular cue to depth that commonly arises during observer translation. To compute from motion parallax whether an object appears nearer or farther than the point of fixation requires combining retinal image motion with signals related to eye rotation, but the neurobiological mechanisms have remained unclear. This study provides the first mechanistic account of how this interaction takes place in the responses of cortical neurons. Specifically, we show that smooth eye movements modulate the gain of responses of neurons in area MT in a directionally specific manner to generate selectivity for depth sign from motion parallax. We also show, through simulations, that depth could be estimated from a population of such gain-modulated neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Selective Silencing of Hippocampal Parvalbumin Interneurons Induces Development of Recurrent Spontaneous Limbic Seizures in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8166?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most frequent form of focal epilepsies and is generally associated with malfunctioning of the hippocampal formation. Recently, a preferential loss of parvalbumin (PV) neurons has been observed in the subiculum of TLE patients and in animal models of TLE. To demonstrate a possible causative role of defunct PV neurons in the generation of TLE, we permanently inhibited GABA release selectively from PV neurons of the ventral subiculum by injecting a viral vector expressing tetanus toxin light chain in male mice. Subsequently, mice were subjected to telemetric EEG recording and video monitoring. Eighty-eight percent of the mice presented clusters of spike-wave discharges (C-SWDs; 40.0 ± 9.07/month), and 64% showed spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRSs; 5.3 ± 0.83/month). Mice injected with a control vector presented with neither C-SWDs nor SRSs. No neurodegeneration was observed due to vector injection or SRS. Interestingly, mice that presented with only C-SWDs but no SRSs, developed SRSs upon injection of a subconvulsive dose of pentylenetetrazole after 6 weeks. The initial frequency of SRSs declined by ~30% after 5 weeks. In contrast to permanent silencing of PV neurons, transient inhibition of GABA release from PV neurons through the designer receptor hM4Di selectively expressed in PV-containing neurons transiently reduced the seizure threshold of the mice but induced neither acute nor recurrent seizures. Our data demonstrate a critical role for perisomatic inhibition mediated by PV-containing interneurons, suggesting that their sustained silencing could be causally involved in the development of TLE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Development of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) generally takes years after an initial insult during which maladaptation of hippocampal circuitries takes place. In human TLE and in animal models of TLE, parvalbumin neurons are selectively lost in the subiculum, the major output area of the hippocampus. The present experiments demonstrate that specific and sustained inhibition of GABA release from parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (mostly basket cells) in sector CA1/subiculum is sufficient to induce hyperexcitability and spontaneous recurrent seizures in mice. As in patients with nonlesional TLE, these mice developed epilepsy without signs of neurodegeneration. The experiments highlight the importance of the potent inhibitory action mediated by parvalbumin cells in the hippocampus and identify a potential mechanism in the development of TLE.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Steady-State Free Ca2+ in Astrocytes Is Decreased by Experience and Impacts Arteriole Tone</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8150?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8150?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes can control basal synaptic strength and arteriole tone via their resting Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activity. However, whether resting astrocyte Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; can adjust to a new steady-state level, with an impact on surrounding brain cells, remains unknown. Using two-photon Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging in male rat acute brain slices of the somatosensory neocortex, we found that theta burst neural activity produced an unexpected long-lasting reduction in astrocyte free Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the soma and endfeet. The drop in intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; was attenuated by antagonists targeting multiple ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors, and intracellular cascades involved Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; stores and nitric oxide. The reduction in astrocyte endfoot Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; was coincident with an increase in arteriole tone, and both the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; drop and the tone change were prevented by an NMDA receptor antagonist. Astrocyte patch-clamp experiments verified that the glutamate receptors in question were located on astrocytes and that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; changes within astrocytes were responsible for the long-lasting change in arteriole diameter caused by theta burst neural activity. In astrocytes from animals that lived in an enriched environment, we measured a relatively lower resting Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; level that occluded any further drop in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in response to theta burst activity. These data suggest that electrically evoked patterns of neural activity or natural experience can adjust steady-state resting astrocyte Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and that the effect has an impact on basal arteriole diameter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The field of astrocyte-neuron and astrocyte-arteriole interactions is currently in a state of refinement. Experimental evidence &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; suggests that direct manipulation of astrocyte-free Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; regulates synaptic signaling and local blood flow control; however, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; experiments fail to link synaptically evoked astrocyte Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients and immediate changes to various astrocyte-mediated processes. To clarify this discrepancy, we examined a different aspect of astrocyte Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;: the resting, steady-state free Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; of astrocytes, its modulation, and its potential role in the tonic regulation of surrounding brain cells. We found that &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; neural activity induced a long-lasting reduction in resting free astrocyte Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and that this phenomenon changed arteriole tone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Role for the Left Angular Gyrus in Episodic Simulation and Memory</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8142?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8142?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies indicate that episodic simulation (i.e., imagining specific future experiences) and episodic memory (i.e., remembering specific past experiences) are associated with enhanced activity in a common set of neural regions referred to as the core network. This network comprises the hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex, and left angular gyrus, among other regions. Because fMRI data are correlational, it is unknown whether activity increases in core network regions are critical for episodic simulation and episodic memory. In the current study, we used MRI-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to assess whether temporary disruption of the left angular gyrus would impair both episodic simulation and memory (16 participants, 10 females). Relative to TMS to a control site (vertex), disruption of the left angular gyrus significantly reduced the number of internal (i.e., episodic) details produced during the simulation and memory tasks, with a concomitant increase in external detail production (i.e., semantic, repetitive, or off-topic information), reflected by a significant detail by TMS site interaction. Difficulty in the simulation and memory tasks also increased after TMS to the left angular gyrus relative to the vertex. In contrast, performance in a nonepisodic control task did not differ statistically as a function of TMS site (i.e., number of free associates produced or difficulty in performing the free associate task). Together, these results are the first to demonstrate that the left angular gyrus is critical for both episodic simulation and episodic memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Humans have the ability to imagine future episodes (i.e., episodic simulation) and remember episodes from the past (i.e., episodic memory). A wealth of neuroimaging studies have revealed that these abilities are associated with enhanced activity in a core network of neural regions, including the hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex, and left angular gyrus. However, neuroimaging data are correlational and do not tell us whether core regions support critical processes for simulation and memory. In the current study, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation and demonstrated that temporary disruption of the left angular gyrus leads to impairments in simulation and memory. The present study provides the first causal evidence to indicate that this region is critical for these fundamental abilities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Polysialylation at Early Stages of Oligodendrocyte Differentiation Promotes Myelin Repair</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8131?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8131?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Polysialic acid is a glycan modification of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) produced by the polysialyltransferases ST8SIA2 and ST8SIA4. Polysialic acid has been detected in multiple sclerosis plaques, but its beneficial or adverse role in remyelination is elusive. Here, we show that, despite a developmental delay, myelination at the onset and during cuprizone-induced demyelination was unaffected in male &lt;i&gt;Ncam1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; or &lt;i&gt;St8sia2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. However, remyelination, restoration of oligodendrocyte densities, and motor recovery after the cessation of cuprizone treatment were compromised. Impaired differentiation of NCAM- or ST8SIA2-negative oligodendrocyte precursors suggested an underlying cell-autonomous mechanism. In contrast, premature differentiation in ST8SIA4-negative cultures explained the accelerated remyelination previously observed in &lt;i&gt;St8sia4&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. mRNA profiling during differentiation of human stem cell-derived and primary murine oligodendrocytes indicated that the opposing roles of ST8SIA2 and ST8SIA4 arise from sequential expression. We also provide evidence that potentiation of ST8SIA2 by 9-&lt;i&gt;cis-&lt;/i&gt;retinoic acid and artificial polysialylation of oligodendrocyte precursors by a bacterial polysialyltransferase are mechanisms to promote oligodendrocytic differentiation. Thus, differential targeting of polysialyltransferases and polysialic acid engineering are promising strategies to advance the treatment of demyelinating diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The beneficial or adverse role of polysialic acid (polySia) in myelin repair is a long-standing question. As a modification of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), polySia is produced by the polysialyltransferases ST8SIA2 and ST8SIA4. Here we demonstrate that NCAM and ST8SIA2 promote oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin repair as well as motor recovery after cuprizone-induced demyelination. In contrast, ST8SIA4 delays oligodendrocyte differentiation, explaining its adverse role in remyelination. These opposing roles of the polysialyltransferases are based on different expression profiles. 9-&lt;i&gt;cis-&lt;/i&gt;retinoic acid enhances ST8SIA2 expression, providing a mechanism for understanding how it supports oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination. Furthermore, artificial polysialylation of the cell surface promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation. Thus, boosting ST8SIA2 and engineering of polySia are promising strategies for improving myelin repair.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Pattern Analyses Reveal Separate Experience-Based Fear Memories in the Human Right Amygdala</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Learning fear via the experience of contingencies between a conditioned stimulus (CS) and an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) is often assumed to be fundamentally different from learning fear via instructions. An open question is whether fear-related brain areas respond differently to experienced CS–US contingencies than to merely instructed CS–US contingencies. Here, we contrasted two experimental conditions where subjects were instructed to expect the same CS–US contingencies while only one condition was characterized by prior experience with the CS–US contingency. Using multivoxel pattern analysis of fMRI data, we found CS-related neural activation patterns in the right amygdala (but not in other fear-related regions) that dissociated between whether a CS–US contingency had been instructed and experienced versus merely instructed. A second experiment further corroborated this finding by showing a category-independent neural response to instructed and experienced, but not merely instructed, CS presentations in the human right amygdala. Together, these findings are in line with previous studies showing that verbal fear instructions have a strong impact on both brain and behavior. However, even in the face of fear instructions, the human right amygdala still shows a separable neural pattern response to experience-based fear contingencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In our study, we addressed a fundamental problem of the science of human fear learning and memory, namely whether fear learning via experience in humans relies on a neural pathway that can be separated from fear learning via verbal information. Using two new procedures and recent advances in the analysis of brain imaging data, we localized purely experience-based fear processing and memory in the right amygdala, thereby making a direct link between human and animal research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: ERK/MAPK Signaling Is Required for Pathway-Specific Striatal Motor Functions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8102?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ERK/MAPK intracellular signaling pathway is hypothesized to be a key regulator of striatal activity via modulation of synaptic plasticity and gene transcription. However, prior investigations into striatal ERK/MAPK functions have yielded conflicting results. Further, these studies have not delineated the cell-type-specific roles of ERK/MAPK signaling due to the reliance on globally administered pharmacological ERK/MAPK inhibitors and the use of genetic models that only partially reduce total ERK/MAPK activity. Here, we generated mouse models in which ERK/MAPK signaling was completely abolished in each of the two distinct classes of medium spiny neurons (MSNs). ERK/MAPK deletion in D1R-MSNs (direct pathway) resulted in decreased locomotor behavior, reduced weight gain, and early postnatal lethality. In contrast, loss of ERK/MAPK signaling in D2R-MSNs (indirect pathway) resulted in a profound hyperlocomotor phenotype. ERK/MAPK-deficient D2R-MSNs exhibited a significant reduction in dendritic spine density, markedly suppressed electrical excitability, and suppression of activity-associated gene expression even after pharmacological stimulation. Our results demonstrate the importance of ERK/MAPK signaling in governing the motor functions of the striatal direct and indirect pathways. Our data further show a critical role for ERK in maintaining the excitability and plasticity of D2R-MSNs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Alterations in ERK/MAPK activity are associated with drug abuse, as well as neuropsychiatric and movement disorders. However, genetic evidence defining the functions of ERK/MAPK signaling in striatum-related neurophysiology and behavior is lacking. We show that loss of ERK/MAPK signaling leads to pathway-specific alterations in motor function, reduced neuronal excitability, and the inability of medium spiny neurons to regulate activity-induced gene expression. Our results underscore the potential importance of the ERK/MAPK pathway in human movement disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Structural Basis of Large-Scale Functional Connectivity in the Mouse</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Translational neuroimaging requires approaches and techniques that can bridge between multiple different species and disease states. One candidate method that offers insights into the brain's functional connectivity (FC) is resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI). In both humans and nonhuman primates, patterns of FC (often referred to as the functional connectome) have been related to the underlying structural connectivity (SC; also called the structural connectome). Given the recent rise in preclinical neuroimaging of mouse models, it is an important question whether the mouse functional connectome conforms to the underlying SC. Here, we compared FC derived from rs-fMRI in female mice with the underlying monosynaptic structural connectome as provided by the Allen Brain Connectivity Atlas. We show that FC between interhemispheric homotopic cortical and hippocampal areas, as well as in cortico-striatal pathways, emerges primarily via monosynaptic structural connections. In particular, we demonstrate that the striatum (STR) can be segregated according to differential rs-fMRI connectivity patterns that mirror monosynaptic connectivity with isocortex. In contrast, for certain subcortical networks, FC emerges along polysynaptic pathways as shown for left and right STR, which do not share direct anatomical connections, but high FC is putatively driven by a top-down cortical control. Finally, we show that FC involving cortico-thalamic pathways is limited, possibly confounded by the effect of anesthesia, small regional size, and tracer injection volume. These findings provide a critical foundation for using rs-fMRI connectivity as a translational tool to study complex brain circuitry interactions and their pathology due to neurological or psychiatric diseases across species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; A comprehensive understanding of how the anatomical architecture of the brain, often referred to as the &quot;connectome,&quot; corresponds to its function is arguably one of the biggest challenges for understanding the brain and its pathologies. Here, we use the mouse as a model for comparing functional connectivity (FC) derived from resting-state fMRI with gold standard structural connectivity measures based on tracer injections. In particular, we demonstrate high correspondence between FC measurements of cortico-cortical and cortico-striatal regions and their anatomical underpinnings. This work provides a critical foundation for studying the pathology of these circuits across mouse models and human patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Depressed Synaptic Transmission and Reduced Vesicle Release Sites in Huntington's Disease Neuromuscular Junctions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8077?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive and fatal degenerative disorder that results in debilitating cognitive and motor dysfunction. Most HD studies have focused on degeneration of the CNS. We previously discovered that skeletal muscle from transgenic R6/2 HD mice is hyperexcitable due to decreased chloride and potassium conductances. The progressive and early onset of these defects suggest a primary myopathy in HD. In this study, we examined the relationship between neuromuscular transmission and skeletal muscle hyperexcitability. We used an &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; preparation of the levator auris longus muscle from male and female late-stage R6/2 mice and age-matched wild-type controls. Immunostaining of the synapses and molecular analyses revealed no evidence of denervation. Physiologically, we recorded spontaneous miniature endplate currents (mEPCs) and nerve-evoked EPCs (eEPCs) under voltage-clamp, which, unlike current-clamp records, were independent of the changes in muscle membrane properties. We found a reduction in the number of vesicles released per action potential (quantal content) in R6/2 muscle, which analysis of eEPC variance and morphology indicate is caused by a reduction in the number of vesicle release sites (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;) rather than a change in the probability of release (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;rel&lt;/sub&gt;). Furthermore, analysis of high-frequency stimulation trains suggests an impairment in vesicle mobilization. The depressed neuromuscular transmission in R6/2 muscle may help compensate for the muscle hyperexcitability and contribute to motor impersistence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Recent evidence indicates that Huntington's disease (HD) is a multisystem disorder. Our examination of neuromuscular transmission in this study reveals defects in the motor nerve terminal that may compensate for the muscle hyperexcitability in HD. The technique we used eliminates the effects of the altered muscle membrane properties on synaptic currents and thus provides hitherto the most detailed analysis of synaptic transmission in HD. Clinically, the striking depression of neurotransmission we found may help explain the motor impersistence in HD patients. Therapies that target the highly accessible peripheral nerve and muscle system provide a promising new avenue to lessen the debilitating motor symptoms of HD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Place and Grid Cells in a Loop: Implications for Memory Function and Spatial Coding</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8062?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Place cells in the hippocampus and grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex have different codes for space. However, how one code relates to the other is ill understood. Based on the anatomy of the entorhinal-hippocampal circuitry, we constructed a model of place and grid cells organized in a loop to investigate their mutual influence in the establishment of their codes for space. Using computer simulations, we first replicated experiments in rats that measured place and grid cell activity in different environments, and then assessed which features of the model account for different phenomena observed in neurophysiological data, such as pattern completion and pattern separation, global and rate remapping of place cells, and realignment of grid cells. We found that (1) the interaction between grid and place cells converges quickly; (2) the spatial code of place cells does not require, but is altered by, grid cell input; (3) plasticity in sensory inputs to place cells is key for pattern completion but not pattern separation; (4) grid realignment can be explained in terms of place cell remapping as opposed to the other way around; (5) the switch between global and rate remapping is self-organized; and (6) grid cell input to place cells helps stabilize their code under noisy and/or inconsistent sensory input. We conclude that the hippocampus-entorhinal circuit uses the mutual interaction of place and grid cells to encode the surrounding environment and propose a theory on how such interdependence underlies the formation and use of the cognitive map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The mammalian brain implements a positional system with two key pieces: place and grid cells. To gain insight into the dynamics of place and grid cell interaction, we built a computational model with the two cell types organized in a loop. The proposed model accounts for differences in how place and grid cells represent different environments and provides a new interpretation in which place and grid cells mutually interact to form a coupled code for space.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper uses a simple optogenetic model to compare the timing distortion
between a randomly-generated target spike sequence and an externally-stimulated
neuron spike sequence. Optogenetics is an emerging field of neuroscience where
neurons are genetically modified to express light-sensitive receptors that
enable external control over when the neurons fire. Given the prominence of
neuronal signaling within the brain and throughout the body, optogenetics has
significant potential to improve the understanding of the nervous system and to
develop treatments for neurological diseases. This paper primarily considers
two different distortion measures. The first measure is the delay in
externally-stimulated spikes. The second measure is the root mean square error
between the filtered outputs of the target and stimulated spike sequences. The
mean and the distribution of the distortion is derived in closed form when the
target sequence generation rate is sufficiently low. All derived results are
supported with simulations. This work is a step towards an analytical model to
predict whether different spike trains were observed from the same stimulus,
and the broader goal of understanding the quantity and reliability of
information that can be carried by neurons.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;While the ultrastructure of the myelin has been considered to be a
quasi-crystalline stable system, nowadays its multiscale complex dynamics
appears to play a key role for its functionality, degeneration and repair
processes following neurological diseases and trauma. In this work, we have
investigated the axons interactions associated to the nerve functionality,
measuring the spatial distribution of the orientational fluctuations of axons
in a Xenopus Laevis sciatic nerve. At this aim, we have used Scanning micro
X-ray Diffraction (SmXRD), a non-invasive already applied to other
heterogeneous systems presenting complex geometries from microscale to
nanoscale. We have found that the orientational spatial fluctuations of fresh
axons show a correlated disorder described by Levy flight distribution. Thus,
we have studied how this correlated disorder evolves during the degeneration of
the nerve. Our results show that the spatial distribution of axons
orientational fluctuations in unfresh, aged nerve loose the correlated disorder
assuming a randomly disordered behaviour. This work allows a deeper
understanding of nerve states and paves the way to study other materials and
biomaterials with the same technique to detect and to characterize their states
and supramolecular structure, associated with dynamic structural changes at the
nanoscale and mesoscale.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: EEG-based Intention Recognition from Spatio-Temporal Representations via Cascade and Parallel Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks. (arXiv:1708.06578v1 [cs.HC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06578</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a system empowering humans to communicate
with or control the outside world with exclusively brain intentions.
Electroencephalography (EEG) based BCIs are promising solutions due to their
convenient and portable instruments. Motor imagery EEG (MI-EEG) is a kind of
most widely focused EEG signals, which reveals a subjects movement intentions
without actual actions. Despite the extensive research of MI-EEG in recent
years, it is still challenging to interpret EEG signals effectively due to the
massive noises in EEG signals (e.g., low signal noise ratio and incomplete EEG
signals), and difficulties in capturing the inconspicuous relationships between
EEG signals and certain brain activities. Most existing works either only
consider EEG as chain-like sequences neglecting complex dependencies between
adjacent signals or performing simple temporal averaging over EEG sequences. In
this paper, we introduce both cascade and parallel convolutional recurrent
neural network models for precisely identifying human intended movements by
effectively learning compositional spatio-temporal representations of raw EEG
streams. The proposed models grasp the spatial correlations between physically
neighboring EEG signals by converting the chain like EEG sequences into a 2D
mesh like hierarchy. An LSTM based recurrent network is able to extract the
subtle temporal dependencies of EEG data streams. Extensive experiments on a
large-scale MI-EEG dataset (108 subjects, 3,145,160 EEG records) have
demonstrated that both models achieve high accuracy near 98.3% and outperform a
set of baseline methods and most recent deep learning based EEG recognition
models, yielding a significant accuracy increase of 18% in the cross-subject

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Based on the visceral theory of sleep by I.N. Pigarev, we hypothesize that
mental illnesses are caused due to errors in the commutation of external and
internal information flows in the brain. As a consequence of these errors,
visceral information is constantly present in the cerebral cortex and during
wakefulness, on the one hand, is misinterpreted as coming from the outside
world, and on the other hand creates a persistent noise overload in
exteroceptive (visual and auditory) and proprioceptive channels leading in a
long run to the over-strain and malfunction of the adaptive mechanisms of the
brain.

	<description>Amputees who wish to rid themselves of a phantom limb must weaken the neural representation of the absent limb. Conversely, amputees who wish to replace a lost limb must assimilate a neuroprosthetic with the existing neural representation. Whether we wish to remove a phantom limb or assimilate a synthetic one, we will benefit from knowing more about the developmental process that enables embodiment. A potentially critical contributor to that process is the spontaneous activity – in the form of limb twitches – that occurs exclusively and abundantly during active (REM) sleep, a particularly prominent state in early development.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Temperature manipulation of neuronal dynamics in a forebrain motor control nucleus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005699</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Matías A. Goldin, Gabriel B. Mindlin&lt;/p&gt;

Different neuronal types within brain motor areas contribute to the generation of complex motor behaviors. A widely studied songbird forebrain nucleus (HVC) has been recognized as fundamental in shaping the precise timing characteristics of birdsong. This is based, among other evidence, on the stretching and the “breaking” of song structure when HVC is cooled. However, little is known about the temperature effects that take place in its neurons. To address this, we investigated the dynamics of HVC both experimentally and computationally. We developed a technique where simultaneous electrophysiological recordings were performed during temperature manipulation of HVC. We recorded spontaneous activity and found three effects: widening of the spike shape, decrease of the firing rate and change in the interspike interval distribution. All these effects could be explained with a detailed conductance based model of all the neurons present in HVC. Temperature dependence of the ionic channel time constants explained the first effect, while the second was based in the changes of the maximal conductance using single synaptic excitatory inputs. The last phenomenon, only emerged after introducing a more realistic synaptic input to the inhibitory interneurons. Two timescales were present in the interspike distributions. The behavior of one timescale was reproduced with different input balances received form the excitatory neurons, whereas the other, which disappears with cooling, could not be found assuming poissonian synaptic inputs. Furthermore, the computational model shows that the bursting of the excitatory neurons arises naturally at normal brain temperature and that they have an intrinsic delay at low temperatures. The same effect occurs at single synapses, which may explain song stretching. These findings shed light on the temperature dependence of neuronal dynamics and present a comprehensive framework to study neuronal connectivity. This study, which is based on intrinsic neuronal characteristics, may help to understand emergent behavioral changes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mXYitYBBMvs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Dopamine transporter imaging deficit predicts early transition to synucleinopathy in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25026</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25026</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: To determine the usefulness of dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging to identify idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (IRBD) patients at risk for short-term development of clinically-defined synucleinopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Eighty-seven patients with polysomnography-confirmed IRBD underwent &lt;sup&gt;123&lt;/sup&gt;I-FP-CIT DAT-SPECT. Results were compared with 20 matched controls without RBD who underwent DAT-SPECT. In patients, FP-CIT uptake was considered abnormal when values were two standard deviations below controls' mean uptake. After DAT-SPECT, patients were followed-up during 5.7 ± 2.2 (range, 2.6-9.9) years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Baseline DAT deficit was found in 51 (58.6%) patients. During follow-up 25 (28.7%) subjects developed clinically-defined synucleinopathy (Parkinson disease in 11, dementia with Lewy bodies in 13, multiple system atrophy in one) with mean latency of 3.2 ± 1.9 years from imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed increased risk of incident synucleinopathy in patients with abnormal DAT-SPECT than with normal DAT-SPECT (20% vs. 6% at three years, 33% vs. 18% at five years; log rank test, p=0.006).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Receiver operating characteristics curve revealed that reduction of FP-CIT uptake in putamen greater than 25% discriminated patients with DAT deficit who developed synucleinopathy from patients with DAT deficit that remained disease-free after three years of follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 5-year follow-up, DAT-SPECT had 75% sensitivity, 51% specificity, 44% positive predictive value, 80% negative predictive value, and like-hood ratio 1.54 to predict synucleinopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: DAT-SPECT identifies IRBD patients at short-term risk for synucleinopathy. Decreased FP-CIT putamen uptake greater than 25% predicts synucleinopathy after three years follow-up. These observations may be useful to select candidates for disease-modification trials in IRBD.

We hypothesized that interictal VHFOs are more specific biomarkers for epileptogenic zone compared to traditional HFOs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25006-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forty patients with focal epilepsy who underwent presurgical stereo-EEG (SEEG) were included in the study. SEEG data were recorded with a sampling rate of 25kHz, and a 30-minute resting period was analyzed for each patient. Ten patients met selected criteria for analyses of correlations with surgical outcome: detection of interictal ripples (Rs), fast ripples (FRs), and VHFOs; resective surgery; and at least 1 year of postoperative follow-up. Using power envelope computation and visual inspection of power distribution matrixes, electrode contacts with HFOs and VHFOs were detected and analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25006-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interictal very fast ripples (VFRs; 500–1,000Hz) were detected in 23 of 40 patients and ultrafast ripples (UFRs; 1,000–2,000Hz) in almost half of investigated subjects (n = 19). VFRs and UFRs were observed only in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and were recorded exclusively from mesiotemporal structures. The UFRs were more spatially restricted in the brain than lower-frequency HFOs. When compared to R oscillations, significantly better outcomes were observed in patients with a higher percentage of removed contacts containing FRs, VFRs, and UFRs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unintended weight loss is a hallmark of Huntington disease (HD), but it is unknown to what extent weight loss impacts the rate of disease progression. Therefore, using longitudinal data from the Enroll-HD study, we assessed the association between baseline body mass index (BMI) and the rate of clinical progression in 5,821 HD mutation carriers. We found that high baseline BMI was associated with a significantly slower rate of functional, motor, and cognitive deterioration (all &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), independent of mutant &lt;em&gt;HTT&lt;/em&gt; CAG repeat size. Our findings provide strong rationale for exploration of systemic metabolism as a therapeutic target in HD. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Opto-magnetic imaging of neural network activity in brain slices at high resolution using color centers in diamond. (arXiv:1708.06158v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06158</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06158</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We suggest a novel approach for wide-field imaging of the neural network
dynamics of brain slices that uses highly sensitivity magnetometry based on
nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. In-vitro recordings in brain slices
is a proven method for the characterization of electrical neural activity and
has strongly contributed to our understanding of the mechanisms that govern
neural information processing. However, traditional recordings can only acquire
signals from a few positions simultaneously, which severely limits their
ability to characterize the dynamics of the underlying neural networks. We
suggest to radically extend the scope of this method using the wide-field
imaging of the neural magnetic fields across the slice by means of NV
magnetometry. Employing comprehensive computational simulations and theoretical
analyses, we characterize the spatiotemporal characteristics of the neural
magnetic fields and derive the required key performance parameters of an
imaging setup based on NV magnetometry. In particular, we determine how the
technical parameters determine the achievable spatial resolution for an optimal
reconstruction of the neural currents from the measured field distributions.
Finally, we compare the imaging of neural slice activity with that of a single
planar pyramidal cell. Our results suggest that imaging of neural slice
activity will be possible with the upcoming generation of NV magnetic field
sensors, while imaging of the activity of a single planar cell remains more
challenging.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Innovations orthogonalization: a solution to the major pitfalls of EEG/MEG &quot;leakage correction&quot;. (arXiv:1708.05931v2 [stat.ME] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05931</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05931</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The problem of interest here is the study of brain functional and effective
connectivity based on non-invasive EEG-MEG inverse solution time series. These
signals generally have low spatial resolution, such that an estimated signal at
any one site is an instantaneous linear mixture of the true, actual, unobserved
signals across all cortical sites. False connectivity can result from analysis
of these low-resolution signals. Recent efforts toward &quot;unmixing&quot; have been
developed, under the name of &quot;leakage correction&quot;. One recent noteworthy
approach is that by Colclough et al (2015 NeuroImage, 117:439-448), which
forces the inverse solution signals to have zero cross-correlation at lag zero.
One goal is to show that Colclough's method produces false human connectomes
under very broad conditions. The second major goal is to develop a new
solution, that appropriately &quot;unmixes&quot; the inverse solution signals, based on
innovations orthogonalization. The new method first fits a multivariate
autoregression to the inverse solution signals, giving the mixed innovations.
Second, the mixed innovations are orthogonalized. Third, the mixed and
orthogonalized innovations allow the estimation of the &quot;unmixing&quot; matrix, which
is then finally used to &quot;unmix&quot; the inverse solution signals. It is shown that
under very broad conditions, the new method produces proper human connectomes,
even when the signals are not generated by an autoregressive model.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Given the structure of a novel molecule, there is still no one who can
reliably predict what odor percept that molecule will evoke. The challenge
comes from both the difficulty in quantitatively characterizing molecular
structure, and the inadequacy of language to fully characterize olfactory
perception. Here, we present a novel approach to both problems.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3744</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Maximum entropy models are increasingly being used to describe the collective
activity of neural populations with measured mean neural activities and
pairwise correlations, but the full space of probability distributions
consistent with these constraints has not been explored. We provide upper and
lower bounds on the entropy for the {\em minimum} entropy distribution over
arbitrarily large collections of binary units with any fixed set of mean values
and pairwise correlations. We also construct specific low-entropy distributions
for several relevant cases. Surprisingly, the minimum entropy solution has
entropy scaling logarithmically with system size for any set of first- and
second-order statistics consistent with arbitrarily large systems. We further
demonstrate that some sets of these low-order statistics can only be realized
by small systems. Our results show how only small amounts of randomness are
needed to mimic low-order statistical properties of highly entropic
distributions, and we discuss some applications for engineered and biological
information transmission systems.

	<description>To date, studies have demonstrated the dynamic influence of exogenous environmental stimuli on multiple regions of the brain. This environmental influence positively and negatively impacts programs governing myelination, and acts on myelinating oligodendrocyte (OL) cells across the human lifespan. Developmentally, environmental manipulation of OL progenitor cells (OPCs) has profound effects on the establishment of functional cognitive, sensory, and motor programs. Furthermore, central nervous system (CNS) myelin remains an adaptive entity in adulthood, sensitive to environmentally induced structural changes.</description>

Epigenomic mapping of enhancer-associated chromatin modifications facilitates the genome-wide discovery of tissue-specific enhancers &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. However, reliance on single chromatin marks leads to high rates of false-positive predictions. More sophisticated, integrative methods have been described, but commonly suffer from limited accessibility to the resulting predictions and reduced biological interpretability. Here we present the Limb Enhancer Genie (LEG), a collection of highly accurate, genome-wide predictions of enhancers in the developing limb, available through a user-friendly online interface. We predict limb enhancers using a combination of &amp;gt;50 published limb-specific datasets and clusters of evolutionarily conserved transcription factor binding sites, taking advantage of the patterns observed at previously &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; validated elements. By combining different statistical models, our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and provides interpretable measures of feature importance. Our results indicate that including a previously unappreciated score that quantifies tissue-specific nuclease accessibility significantly improves prediction performance. We demonstrate the utility of our approach through &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; validation of newly predicted elements. Moreover, we describe general features that can guide the type of datasets to include when predicting tissue-specific enhancers genome-wide, while providing an accessible resource to the general biological community and facilitating the functional interpretation of genetic studies of limb malformations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Tbw5zd-eLMc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Polymodal allosteric regulation of Type 1 Serine/Threonine Kinase Receptors via a conserved electrostatic lock</title>

Type 1 Serine/Threonine Kinase Receptors (STKR1) transduce a wide spectrum of biological signals mediated by TGF-β superfamily members. The STKR1 activity is tightly controlled by their regulatory glycine-serine rich (GS) domain adjacent to the kinase domain. Despite decades of studies, it remains unknown how physiological or pathological GS domain modifications are coupled to STKR1 kinase activity. Here, by performing molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculation of Activin-Like Kinase 2 (ALK2), we found that GS domain phosphorylation, FKBP12 dissociation, and disease mutations all destabilize a D354-R375 salt-bridge, which normally acts as an electrostatic lock to prevent coordination of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the catalytic site. We developed a WAFEX-guided principal analysis and unraveled how phosphorylation destabilizes this highly conserved salt-bridge in temporal and physical space. Using current-flow betweenness scores, we identified an allosteric network of residue-residue contacts between the GS domain and the catalytic site that controls the formation and disruption of this salt bridge. Importantly, our novel network analysis approach revealed how certain disease-causing mutations bypass FKBP12-mediated kinase inhibition to produce leaky signaling in the absence of ligand. We further provide experimental evidence that this salt-bridge lock exists in other STKR1s, and acts as a general safety mechanism in STKR1 to prevent pathological leaky signaling. In summary, our study provides a compelling and unifying allosteric activation mechanism in STKR1 kinases that reconciles a large number of experimental studies and sheds light on a novel therapeutic avenue to target disease-related STKR1 mutants.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KkneVn381dc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Host population structure impedes reversion to drug sensitivity after discontinuation of treatment</title>

Intense use of antibiotics for the treatment of diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; or gonorrhea has led to rapidly increasing population levels of drug resistance. This has generally necessitated a switch to new drugs and the discontinuation of older ones, after which resistance often only declines slowly or even persists indefinitely. These long-term effects are usually ascribed to low fitness costs of resistance in absence of the drug. Here we show that structure in the host population, in particular heterogeneity in number of contacts, also plays an important role in the reversion dynamics. Host contact structure acts both during the phase of intense treatment, leading to non-random distributions of the resistant strain among the infected population, and after the discontinuation of the drug, by affecting the competition dynamics resulting in a mitigation of fitness advantages. As a consequence, we observe both a lower rate of reversion and a lower probability that reversion to sensitivity on the population level occurs after treatment is stopped. Our simulations show that the impact of heterogeneity in the host structure is maximal in the biologically most plausible parameter range, namely when fitness costs of resistance are small.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aEDhdmGO1Us&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

A major force contributing to the emergence of novelty in nature is the presence of cooperative interactions, where two or more components of a system act in synergy, sometimes leading to higher-order, emergent phenomena. Within molecular evolution, the so called &lt;i&gt;hypercycle&lt;/i&gt; defines the simplest model of an autocatalytic cycle, providing major theoretical insights on the evolution of cooperation in the early biosphere. These closed cooperative loops have also inspired our understanding of how catalytic loops appear in ecological systems. In both cases, hypercycle and ecological cooperative loops, the role played by space seems to be crucial for their stability and resilience against parasites. However, it is difficult to test these ideas in natural ecosystems, where time and spatial scales introduce considerable limitations. Here, we use engineered bacteria as a model system to a variety of environmental scenarios identifying trends that transcend the specific model system, such an enhanced genetic diversity in environments requiring mutualistic interactions. Interestingly, we show that improved environments can slow down mutualistic range expansions as a result of genetic drift effects preceding local resource depletion. Moreover, we show that a parasitic strain is excluded from the population during range expansions (which acknowledges a classical prediction). Nevertheless, environmental deterioration can reshape population interactions, this same strain becoming part of a three-species mutualistic web in scenarios in which the two-strain mutualism becomes non functional. The evolutionary and ecological implications for the design of synthetic ecosystems are outlined.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-lmZyb2t8MA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Neuron’s eye view: Inferring features of complex stimuli from neural responses</title>

Experiments that study neural encoding of stimuli at the level of individual neurons typically choose a small set of features present in the world—contrast and luminance for vision, pitch and intensity for sound—and assemble a stimulus set that systematically varies along these dimensions. Subsequent analysis of neural responses to these stimuli typically focuses on regression models, with experimenter-controlled features as predictors and spike counts or firing rates as responses. Unfortunately, this approach requires knowledge in advance about the relevant features coded by a given population of neurons. For domains as complex as social interaction or natural movement, however, the relevant feature space is poorly understood, and an arbitrary &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; choice of features may give rise to confirmation bias. Here, we present a Bayesian model for exploratory data analysis that is capable of automatically identifying the features present in unstructured stimuli based solely on neuronal responses. Our approach is unique within the class of latent state space models of neural activity in that it assumes that firing rates of neurons are sensitive to multiple discrete time-varying features tied to the &lt;i&gt;stimulus&lt;/i&gt;, each of which has Markov (or semi-Markov) dynamics. That is, we are modeling neural activity as driven by multiple simultaneous stimulus features rather than intrinsic neural dynamics. We derive a fast variational Bayesian inference algorithm and show that it correctly recovers hidden features in synthetic data, as well as ground-truth stimulus features in a prototypical neural dataset. To demonstrate the utility of the algorithm, we also apply it to cluster neural responses and demonstrate successful recovery of features corresponding to monkeys and faces in the image set.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/y_WuW3DO4Dw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: Chronic sleep restriction is highly prevalent in modern society and is in its clinical form, insufficient sleep syndrome, one of the most prevalent diagnoses in clinical sleep laboratories, with substantial negative impact on health and community burden. It reflects every-day sleep loss better than acute sleep deprivation, but its effects and particularly the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown for a variety of critical cognitive domains, as for example risky decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We assessed financial risk-taking behavior after 7 consecutive nights of sleep restriction and after one night of acute sleep deprivation compared to a regular sleep condition in a within-subject design. We further investigated potential underlying mechanisms of sleep loss induced changes in behavior by high-density electroencephalography recordings during restricted sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We show that chronic sleep restriction increases risk-seeking, while this was not observed after acute sleep deprivation. This increase was subjectively not noticed and was related to locally lower values of slow wave energy during preceding sleep, an electrophysiological marker of sleep intensity and restoration, in electrodes over the right prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: This study provides for the first time evidence that insufficient sleep restoration over circumscribed cortical areas leads to aberrant behavior. In chronically sleep restricted subjects, low slow wave sleep intensity over the right prefrontal cortex - which has been shown to be linked to risk behavior – may lead to increased and subjectively unnoticed risk-seeking.

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24996-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients had autopsy-confirmed FTLD with tauopathy (n = 31), TDP-43 proteinopathy (n = 49), or AD (n = 26) with antemortem CSF. CSF tau levels were compared between groups and correlated with digital histology measurement of postmortem tau pathology averaged from three cerebral regions (angular gyrus, mid-frontal cortex, and anterior cingulate gyrus). Multivariate linear regression tested the association of ante mortem CSF tau levels with postmortem tau pathology adjusting for demographics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24996-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multivariate regression found an independent association of ante mortem CSF phosphorylated tau levels with postmortem cerebral tau pathology in FTLD (Beta = 1.3; 95% confidence interval = 0.2-2.4; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.02). After excluding patients with coincident AD-associated tau pathology accompanying sporadic FTLD, we found lower CSF phosphorylated tau levels in the TDP-43 group (median = 7.4pg/ml; interquartile range [IQR] = 6.0, 12.3; n = 26) compared to the tauopathy group (median = 12.5pg/ml; IQR = 10.7, 15.0; n = 23; Z = 2.6; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In vivo detection of AD copathology in sporadic FTLD patients may help stratify clinical cohorts with pure neuropathology in which low CSF phosphorylated-tau levels may have diagnostic utility to distinguish TDP-43 proteinopathy from tauopathy. Autopsy-confirmed samples are critical for FTLD biomarker development and validation. Ann Neurol 2017;82:247–258&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Our work focuses on the stability, resilience, and response to perturbation of the bacterial communities in the human gut. Informative flash flood-like disturbances that eliminate most gastrointestinal biomass can be induced using a clinically-relevant iso-osmotic agent. We designed and executed such a disturbance in human volunteers using a dense longitudinal sampling scheme extending before and after induced diarrhea. This experiment has enabled a careful multidomain analysis of a controlled perturbation of the human gut microbiota with a new level of resolution. These new longitudinal multidomain data were analyzed using recently developed statistical methods that demonstrate improvements over current practices. By imposing sparsity constraints we have enhanced the interpretability of the analyses and by employing a new adaptive generalized principal components analysis, incorporated modulated phylogenetic information and enhanced interpretation through scoring of the portions of the tree most influenced by the perturbation. Our analyses leverage the taxa-sample duality in the data to show how the gut microbiota recovers following this perturbation. Through a holistic approach that integrates phylogenetic, metagenomic and abundance information, we elucidate patterns of taxonomic and functional change that characterize the community recovery process across individuals. We provide complete code and illustrations of new sparse statistical methods for high-dimensional, longitudinal multidomain data that provide greater interpretability than existing methods.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bi_0OACHraE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Lingfei Wang, Tom Michoel&lt;/p&gt;

Mapping gene expression as a quantitative trait using whole genome-sequencing and transcriptome analysis allows to discover the functional consequences of genetic variation. We developed a novel method and ultra-fast software Findr for higly accurate causal inference between gene expression traits using cis-regulatory DNA variations as causal anchors, which improves current methods by taking into consideration hidden confounders and weak regulations. Findr outperformed existing methods on the DREAM5 Systems Genetics challenge and on the prediction of microRNA and transcription factor targets in human lymphoblastoid cells, while being nearly a million times faster. Findr is publicly available at https://github.com/lingfeiwang/findr.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jwKwMNrRg0w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Extracting replicable associations across multiple studies: Empirical Bayes algorithms for controlling the false discovery rate</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005700</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/YRu4NDFR8Wk/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by David Amar, Ron Shamir, Daniel Yekutieli&lt;/p&gt;

In almost every field in genomics, large-scale biomedical datasets are used to report associations. Extracting associations that recur across multiple studies while controlling the false discovery rate is a fundamental challenge. Here, we propose a new method to allow joint analysis of multiple studies. Given a set of p-values obtained from each study, the goal is to identify associations that recur in at least &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 1 studies while controlling the false discovery rate. We propose several new algorithms that differ in how the study dependencies are modeled, and compare them and extant methods under various simulated scenarios. The top algorithm, SCREEN (Scalable Cluster-based REplicability ENhancement), is our new algorithm that works in three stages: (1) clustering an estimated correlation network of the studies, (2) learning replicability (e.g., of genes) within clusters, and (3) merging the results across the clusters. When we applied SCREEN to two real datasets it greatly outperformed the results obtained via standard meta-analysis. First, on a collection of 29 case-control gene expression cancer studies, we detected a large set of consistently up-regulated genes related to proliferation and cell cycle regulation. These genes are both consistently up-regulated across many cancer studies, and are well connected in known gene networks. Second, on a recent pan-cancer study that examined the expression profiles of patients with and without mutations in the HLA complex, we detected a large active module of up-regulated genes that are both related to immune responses and are well connected in known gene networks. This module covers thrice more genes as compared to the original study at a similar false discovery rate, demonstrating the high power of SCREEN. An implementation of SCREEN is available in the supplement.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YRu4NDFR8Wk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Tamas Horvath studies how the brain controls energy metabolism and how the peripheral tissue governs a multitude of complex behaviors. In an interview with Neuron, he shares his “eureka” moment, talks about the blurred boundaries of science and art, and questions the neuronal doctrine as a sufficient conceptual framework, advocating for an in-depth interaction between researchers to learn from each other in the quest to pursue the unknown.</description>

	<title>Neuron: LTP at Hilar Mossy Cell-Dentate Granule Cell Synapses Modulates Dentate Gyrus Output by Increasing Excitation/Inhibition Balance</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30650-5?rss=yes</guid>
	<link>http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30650-5?rss=yes</link>
	<description>By establishing excitatory synapses with a large number of dentate granule cells, hilar mossy cells may contribute significantly to learning and epilepsy. Hashimotodani et al. report a novel form of LTP at these synapses that can critically alter dentate gyrus output.</description>

	<description>In physiological conditions, adult neurons have low intracellular Cl− [(Cl−)I] levels underlying the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic inhibitory drive. In contrast, neurons have high (Cl−)I levels and excitatory GABA actions in a wide range of pathological conditions including spinal cord lesions, chronic pain, brain trauma, cerebrovascular infarcts, autism, Rett and Down syndrome, various types of epilepsies, and other genetic or environmental insults. The diuretic highly specific NKCC1 chloride importer antagonist bumetanide (PubChem CID: 2461) efficiently restores low (Cl−)I levels and attenuates many disorders in experimental conditions and in some clinical trials.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Seizing Control of KCC2: A New Therapeutic Target for Epilepsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30123-6?rss=yes</guid>
	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30123-6?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Deficits in GABAergic inhibition result in the abnormal neuronal activation and synchronization that underlies seizures. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for transforming a normal brain into an epileptic one remain largely unknown. Hyperpolarizing inhibition mediated by type A GABA (GABAA) receptors is dependent on chloride extrusion by the neuron-specific type 2K+–Cl− cotransporter (KCC2). Loss-of-function mutations in KCC2 are a known cause of infantile epilepsy in humans and KCC2 dysfunction is present in patients with both idiopathic and acquired epilepsy.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Neurons have diverse molecular, morphological, connectional and functional properties. We believe that the only realistic way to manage this complexity — and thereby pave the way for understanding the structure, function and development of brain circuits — is to group neurons into types, which can &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly used antidepressants; however, their mechanism of action is elusive. The authors here show that activation of serotonin 5-HT1B receptors on cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons (CCK neurons) in the dentate gyrus underlies the effects of acute SSRI treatment on &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neuronal loss is a hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD), but the mechanisms through which the neurons die are unclear. Here, the authors described evidence for the activation of necroptosis — a programmed form of necrosis that has been implicated in multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functional connectivity analyses of group data have revealed several large-scale distributed brain networks, including the default network (DN), frontoparietal control network (FPN) and dorsal attention network (dATN); however, few studies have examined network organization within individual subjects. The authors performed multiple functional MRI scans in &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neuropathic pain is a common adverse effect of chemotherapeutic agents, such as oxaliplatin. The authors here showed that antibiotic-mediated eradication of the gut microbiota protects mice against both oxaliplatin-induced inflammation in the dorsal root ganglia and mechanical hyperalgesia. The permissive effect of the gut microbiota &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The likelihood of winning a bout of competitive behaviour is increased by past wins, and the neural circuitry underlying this crucial determinant of social rank in a group of mice is identified as a projection from the mediodorsal thalamus to the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Acute or Chronic? A Stressful Question</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30136-4?rss=yes</guid>
	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30136-4?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Stress is a primary risk factor for neuropsychiatric disorders; at times, even a single trauma can trigger psychopathology. Many rodent models of neuropsychiatric disorders use chronic stress, measuring readouts at the end of long protocols. In a way, traditional chronic models overlook a crucial question: how does the physiological response to stressor(s) turn into a maladaptive pathway that may verge towards psychopathology? Recent evidence suggests that studying the long-term consequences of acute stress would provide critical information on the role of stress in psychopathology.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is associated with neurological disorders of both the CNS and peripheral nervous systems (PNS), yet few studies have directly examined PNS infection. Here we show that intraperitoneally or intraventricularly injected ZIKV in the mouse can infect and impact peripheral neurons in vivo. Moreover, ZIKV productively infects stem-cell-derived human neural crest cells and peripheral neurons in vitro, leading to increased cell death, transcriptional dysregulation and cell-type-specific molecular pathology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authors: Erika K Harding &amp;amp; Michael W Salter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loss of inhibition in a circuit in the primary somatosensory cortex that controls the activity of layer 5 neurons drives pain hypersensitivity. Restoring this inhibition resets the inhibitory–excitatory balance, producing analgesia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors: Rolf Warta &amp;amp; Christel Herold-Mende&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effectiveness of EGFR treatment is impaired through an early adaptive response. TNF–JNK–Axl–ERK signaling contributes to this primary resistance to EGFR inhibition and might serve as novel target to improve EGFR inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author: Amit Etkin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A combination of computational modeling, neuroimaging and a causal manipulation of brain activity in humans reveals how the brain represents beliefs about how our choices will affect those of others we interact with.&lt;/p&gt;
