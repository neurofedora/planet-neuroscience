	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive demyelination due to deficiency of the enzyme arylsulfatase A (ARSA) in leukocytes, and consequently leads to impaired degradation and accumulation of cerebroside-3-sulfate (sulfatide). This study aimed to sequence the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ARSA&lt;/em&gt; gene in a total of 43 patients with metachromatic leukodystrophy descendant from 40 Egyptian families. In addition, four carrier parents from two families with children who had died from MLD came to the clinic for genetic analysis. Prenatal diagnosis was performed for four families with molecularly diagnosed MLD sibs. Different mutations were characterized in our cohort, including missense, nonsense, splice, and deletion. Overall, 21 different mutations in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ARSA&lt;/em&gt; gene were detected, with 12 novel mutations, i.e. p.Arg60Pro, p.Tyr65*, p.Val112Asp, p.Arg116*, p.Gly124Asp, p.Pro193Ser, p.Gln238*, p.Gln456*, p.Thr276Lys, and p.Gly311Arg, in addition to two new acceptor splice-site mutations 685-1G &amp;gt; A and c.954_956 delCTT. The amniotic fluid samples revealed two carrier fetuses with heterozygous monoallelic mutations, and two affected fetuses had the homozygous biallelic mutations. In conclusion, the current study sheds light on the underlying &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ARSA&lt;/em&gt; gene defect, with an expansion of the mutation spectrum. To our knowledge, this is the first molecular study of MLD among the Egyptian population.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Rodent Models of Vascular Cognitive Impairment</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) refers to the entire spectrum of vascular brain pathologies that contribute to cognitive deficits, ranging from subjective cognitive decline to dementia. The main pathologies in VCI are infarcts and white matter hyperintensities due to ischemia. VCI rodent models can be divided into surgical models (e.g., MCAO, BCAO, BCAS, 2-VO, 4-VO) and genetic models (e.g., SHR/SP, T2DM, CAA, CADASIL) based on construction methods. However, no single model can fully recapitulate the pathogenesis of VCI, and choosing the appropriate model for different research purposes would be of crucial importance. Here, we have summarized the commonly used rodent VCI models and discussed their advantages and limitations to provide a necessary reference for selecting suitable animal models to investigate the molecular pathways involved in VCI and develop therapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Investigation of the Role of Stimulation and Blockade of 5-HT 7 Receptors in Ketamine Anesthesia.</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Although several pieces of evidence have indicated the ability of the serotonin-7 receptor (5-HTR&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;) to modulate N-methyl-&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activation, the possible impact on ketamine anesthesia has not been examined directly. The purpose of the present study is thus to investigate the possible role of the 5-HTR&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; in ketamine anesthesia using a 5-HTR&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; agonist and/or antagonist. The influence of a 5-HTR&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; agonist/antagonist on ketamine anesthesia for behavioral impact was assessed by testing potential anesthetic parameters. Its functional impact was assessed by mRNA expression with real-time PCR and immunostaining in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of mice. Two different doses of ketamine—high and low—were administered to induce anesthesia. In the high-dose ketamine-applied group in particular, the administration of both the 5-HTR&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; agonist and antagonist intensified the anesthetic effect of ketamine. The reflection of the change in anesthesia parameters to 5-HTR&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; expression was observed as an increase in the hippocampus and a decrease in the prefrontal cortex in the anesthetized groups by stimulation of 5-HTR&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;. It is noteworthy that the results of NMDAR expressions are parallel to the results of the 5-HTR&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; expressions of both the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. The 5-HTR&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; may play a role in ketamine anesthesia. It may act through NMDAR in ketamine anesthesia, depending on the parallelism between both receptors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Sex-dimorphic Rostro-caudal Patterns of 5′-AMP-activated Protein Kinase Activation and Glucoregulatory Transmitter Marker Protein Expression in the Ventrolateral Ventromedial Hypothalamic Nucleus (VMNvl) in Hypoglycemic Male and Female Rats: Impact of Estradiol</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus-ventrolateral part (VMNvl) is an estradiol-sensitive structure that controls sex-specific behavior. Electrical reactivity of VMNvl neurons to hypoglycemia infers that cellular energy stability is monitored there. Current research investigated the hypothesis that estradiol elicits sex-dimorphic patterns of VMNvl metabolic sensor activation and gluco-regulatory neurotransmission during hypoglycemia. Rostral-, middle-, and caudal-VMNvl tissue was separately micropunch-dissected from letrozole (Lz)- or vehicle-injected male and estradiol- or vehicle-implanted ovariectomized (OVX) female rats for Western blot analysis of total and phosphorylated 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) protein expression and gluco-stimulatory [neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS); steroidogenic factor-1 (SF1) or -inhibitory (glutamate decarboxylase&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;65/67&lt;/sub&gt; (GAD)] transmitter marker proteins after &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;sc&lt;/em&gt; insulin (INS) or vehicle injection. In both sexes, hypoglycemic up-regulation of phosphoAMPK was estradiol-dependent in rostral and middle, but not caudal VMNvl. AMPK activity remained elevated after recovery from hypoglycemia over the rostro-caudal VMNvl in female, but only in the rostral segment in male. In each sex, hypoglycemia correspondingly augmented or suppressed nNOS profiles in rostral and middle versus caudal VMNvl; these segmental responses persisted longer in female. Rostral and middle segment SF1 protein was inhibited by estradiol-independent mechanisms in hypoglycemic males, but increased by estradiol-reliant mechanisms in female. After INS injection, GAD expression was inhibited in the male rostral VMNvl without estradiol involvement, but this hormone was required for broader suppression of this profile in the female. Neuroanatomical variability of VMNvl metabolic transmitter reactivity to hypoglycemia underscores the existence of functionally different subgroups in that structure. The regional distribution and estradiol sensitivity of hypoglycemia-sensitive VMNvl neurons of each neurochemical phenotype evidently vary between sexes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Oxidative Stress Profile in Genetically Confirmed Cases of Leber’s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01729-y</guid>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01729-y</link>
	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The mechanisms of the complex pathophysiology of Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) are still insufficiently clarified. The role of oxidative stress as an etiological factor has been proposed and demonstrated in vitro, but without conclusive data that rely on clinical samples. The aim of the study was to evaluate and characterize the existence of oxidative stress in the plasma of LHON patients and healthy individuals. Whole mitochondrial genome sequencing has been performed in order to identify primary LHON mutations. For the assessment of oxidative stress, the following biomarkers were determined in plasma: total oxidant status (TOS), total antioxidant status (TAS), and oxidative stress index (OSI), while oxidative damage of cellular proteins was estimated by quantifying advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP). All three primary LHON mutations (m.3460G &amp;gt; A, m.11778G &amp;gt; A and m.14484 T &amp;gt; C) were identified as a genetic cause of the disease, where the most prevalent one was m.11778G &amp;gt; A. LHON patients have a highly significant increase of TOS and a marked decrease of TAS levels, which suggests the existence of substantial oxidative stress. OSI is high in LHON patients, which definitely implies the presence of redox imbalance. Elevated level of AOPP in LHON patients refers to the significant deleterious effects of oxidative stress on cellular proteins. Oxidative stress parameters do not significantly differ between LHON individuals with different primary mutations. Both symptomatic and asymptomatic LHON patients have an augmented level of oxidative stress which suggests that primary mutations exhibit a pro-oxidative phenotype. Gender and smoking habit significantly influence examined biochemical parameters when LHON patients are compared with the control group. Different mitochondrial haplogroups are characterized by altered levels of OSI in LHON group. The absence of physiological correlations between redox parameters reflects the deregulation of homeostatic oxidative/antioxidative balance in LHON patients. This is the greatest series of LHON patients that were evaluated for oxidative stress and the first case-controlled study that evaluated TOS, TAS, OSI, and AOPP and their influence on disease phenotype. It is evident that the presence of oxidative stress represents an important pathophysiological event in LHON and that it could potentially serve as a circulatory biomarker for a therapy efficacy understanding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: A Functional Polymorphism in HIF-3α Is Related to an Increased Risk of Ischemic Stroke</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Hypoxia-inducible factor-3α (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;HIF-3α&lt;/em&gt;), a member of HIF family, can mediate adaptive responses to low oxygen and ischemia. It is believed that HIF plays crucial roles in stroke-related diseases. However, there are no reports on the association between HIF-3α genetic variants and ischemic stroke (IS) susceptibility. Therefore, we examined the association between &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;HIF-&lt;/em&gt;3α gene polymorphisms (rs3826795, rs2235095, and rs3764609) and IS risk. The study population included 302 controls and 310 patients with ischemic stroke. Three polymorphisms in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;HIF-&lt;/em&gt;3α (rs3826795, rs2235095, and rs3764609) were genotyped using SNPscan technique. Our study showed a strong association of rs3826795 in HIF-3α with the risk of IS. The genotype and allele frequencies were shown to differ between the two groups. The rs3826795 in an intron of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;HIF-3α&lt;/em&gt; was related to a prominent increased IS risk (AA vs GG adjusted odd ratio [OR], 2.21; 95% confidence intervals [95% CI], 1.10–4.44; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.03; AA vs AG/GG OR = 1.74, 95% CI, 1.02–2.97, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.04; A vs G OR = 1.48, 95% CI, 1.05–2.07, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.02). Logistic regression analysis suggested that rs3826795 posed a risk factor for IS in addition to common factors. Furthermore, when compared to controls, increased levels of homocysteic acid and level of non-esterified fatty acid were found in the cases (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). However, no significant association was found between rs2235095 or rs3264609 and IS risk. These findings indicated that the rs3826795 polymorphism may be a potential target for predicting the risk of IS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Bioinformatics Gene Analysis of Potential Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets for Unstable Atherosclerotic Plaque-Related Stroke</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Atherosclerotic plaque instability is a major cause of ischemic stroke. Researchers must develop novel strategies for the detection and treatment of unstable atherosclerotic plaque (UAP)-related stroke. We aimed to identify potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets of UAP-related stroke. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of UAP, ischemic stroke and smoking were identified by microarray analyses from the Gene Expression Omnibus. Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway functional enrichment analyses of DEGs were performed to analyze plaque destabilization and ischemic stroke physiopathology. An integrative analysis of UAP, ischemic stroke and smoking DEGs and functional annotations was performed to identify the underlying physiopathology and hub genes in UAP-related stroke and the relationship with smoking. Online search databases were applied to confirm hub gene biofunctions and their relationships with atherosclerosis and cerebrovascular diseases. Following integrative analysis, 18 co-DEGs of UAP and ischemic stroke, including 17 upregulated and one downregulated, were identified. Inflammation, immunity, extracellular matrix degradation, blood coagulation, apoptosis and nerve degeneration were the primary physiopathological processes in UAP-related stroke. Hub genes included MMP9, ITGAM, CCR1, NCF2 and CD163, among which MMP9 and ITGAM were top 10 genes for both UAP and stroke. Smoking may upregulate MMP9, NCF2, C5AR1 and ANPEP to accelerate plaque destabilization and UAP-related stroke. MMP9, ITGAM, CCR1, NCF2, CD163, hsa-miR-3123 and hsa-miR-144-3p are potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of UAP-related stroke. MMP9 and ITGAM are potential therapeutic targets of UAP-related stroke, which will contribute to the development of novel management strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The main objective of current work was to determine the effects of treadmill-running and swimming exercise on passive avoidance learning (PAL) and blood biochemical parameters in rats with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. Male Wistar rats were divided into the following 6 groups (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 6–8 per group): CON, healthy rats without exercise (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 8); STZ, diabetic rats without exercise (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 8); CON-SE, healthy rats subjected to swimming exercise (2 months; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 6); STZ-SE, diabetic rats subjected to swimming exercise (2 months; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 7); CON-TE, healthy rats subjected to treadmill exercise (2 months; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 8); STZ-TE, diabetic rats subjected to treadmill exercise (2 months; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 8). Diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg/kg STZ. Our results showed that STZ decreased the step-through latency in the retention test (STLr) and increased the time spent in the dark compartment (TDC) when compared with the CON group. However, treadmill-running and swimming exercise in STZ-treated rats increased the STLr and decreased the TDC when compared with STZ-treated rats without exercise in PAL. Blood low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglyceride (TG) levels in the STZ group were significantly higher than those in the CON group, whereas plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and levels of catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were lower in the STZ group compared with the CON group. The levels of LDL and TG decreased and the levels of TAC, CAT, and GPx increased in the exercise groups in comparison with the STZ group. The present results indicate that regular exercise enhances learning and memory in diabetic rats and that these effects may occur through activation of the antioxidant system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Phenotype Heterogeneity and Genotype Correlation of MAPT Mutations in a Chinese PUMCH Cohort</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a heterogeneous disease both clinically and pathologically. Genetic mutation in microtubule-associated protein tau (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;MAPT&lt;/em&gt;) is the most common cause of FTD, and the phenotype is related to the mutation location. However, the phenotype and genotype correlation varies somewhat among different cohorts and ethnicities. Whole-genome next-generation sequencing (NGS) was carried out for 1351 patients with dementia at Peking Union Medical College Hospital. &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;MAPT&lt;/em&gt; variations classified as pathogenic and of uncertain significance were identified. Demographic information, clinical presentations, and neuroimaging were collected, and the phenotype-genotype correlation was analyzed with a concurrent literature review. Twenty-four patients were enrolled; 8 patients carrying the D177V mutation are discussed separately. The average onset age was young, and most of them had a positive family history. Cognitive dysfunction, behavior, and personality changes as well as aphasia were the most common presentations. Most structural MRIs showed asymmetrical atrophy of the temporal lobe, with/without similar changes in the frontal lobe. L266V carriers presented with youngest onset typical behavior variant FTD or aphasia; P301L carriers presented with behavior variant FTD or aphasia. Functional MRI and molecular imaging also showed that the involved areas were similar to those with structural atrophy. D296N carriers presented atypical parkinsonism and cognitive dysfunction at older ages. Eight D177V carriers had extraordinarily different manifestations. The clinical phenotype of most of them was not FTD, though cerebral vascular lesions were obvious in some of them. &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;MAPT&lt;/em&gt; mutation is rare in Chinese dementia patients. The phenotype and genotype correlation is specific and overlaps. The D177V mutation is possibly not directly pathogenic in our cohort. Some of the variants might increase the genetic risk of neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The vertebrate brain-derived neurotrophic factor (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;BDNF&lt;/em&gt;) gene produces a number of alternatively spliced transcripts only some of which generate the BDNF protein required for synaptic plasticity and learning. Many of the transcripts are uncharacterized and are of unknown biological significance. Previously, we described alternative splicing within the protein-coding sequence of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;BDNF&lt;/em&gt; gene in the pond turtle (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;tBDNF&lt;/em&gt;) that generates a functionally distinct truncated protein isoform (trcBDNF) that is regulated during a neural correlate of eyeblink classical conditioning in ex vivo brainstem preparations. We hypothesized that trcBDNF has a dominant negative function because of its anticorrelated expression pattern compared to its full-length BDNF counterpart. The data presented here suggests that trcBDNF functions as a transcriptional repressor of a conditioning-inducible downstream &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;tBDNF&lt;/em&gt; promoter that controls expression of full-length BDNF required for learning. First, expression of full-length transcripts is negatively correlated with trcBDNF; transcripts are inhibited when endogenous trcBDNF is ectopically induced and expressed when trcBDNF is inhibited. Second, ChIP-qPCR assays of a recombinant trcBDNF protein, RtrcBDNF, show strong binding to the downstream &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;tBDNF&lt;/em&gt; exon III promoter that corresponds with inhibition of conditioning. Third, deletions of the C-terminus of RtrcBDNF result in inhibition of promoter binding and conditioning acquisition when a tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) binding site is accounted for. Finally, microinjection of RtrcBDNF directly into brainstem preparations inhibits conditioning. These data reveal a new mechanism of activity-dependent &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;BDNF&lt;/em&gt; transcriptional regulation and suggest that &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;BDNF&lt;/em&gt; is an autoregulatory gene. How generalizable this mechanism is across plasticity genes remains to be elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have crucial roles in the pathogenesis of immune-related disorders. However, their role in the pathobiology of inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathies remains unclear. In the current study, we measured peripheral expression of four lncRNAs, namely &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TUG1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;FAS-AS1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;NEAT1&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;GAS5&lt;/em&gt;, in patients with acute/chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathies (AIDP/CIDP) compared with healthy subjects. Notably, all lncRNAs were over-expressed in patients compared with controls (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001 for all lncRNAs). When assessing their expressions in AIDP and CIDP groups separately, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TUG1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;NEAT1&lt;/em&gt; were up-regulated in both patient groups compared with controls, yet &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;FAS-AS1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;GAS5&lt;/em&gt; were only up-regulated in CIDP cases. There were remarkable pairwise correlations between expression levels of these lncRNAs in all study groups. Based on the above-mentioned data, we suggest participation of these for lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathies. Moreover, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;FAS-AS1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;GAS5&lt;/em&gt; lncRNAs have type-specific roles in this regard. Future functional studies are needed to elaborate the molecular mechanisms of the contribution of these transcripts in AIDP/CIDP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute inflammatory polyradiculoneuropathy syndrome. Several genetic and environmental risk factors have been recognized for GBS. AS GBS is an immune-related disorder, abnormal functions of T cells, production of autoantibodies, and dysregulation of gene expression have been detected in GBS patients. Based on the critical role of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) in the regulation of immune responses, HLA alleles are among the mostly investigated loci in GBS. A number of polymorphisms within different genes, especially those linked with the regulation of immune responses, have been associated with GBS in different populations. Moreover, several studies have demonstrated abnormal expression of cytokine-coding genes in this disorder. Investigations in the animal model of GBS have also verified the aberrant regulation of Th1/Th2/Th17/Treg cytokines. In the current review, we describe the information about the role of these factors in GBS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Bsm I- Apa I- Taq I TAC (BAt) Haplotype of Vitamin D Receptor Gene Is Associated with Increased Risk of Major Depressive Disorder</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01719-0</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Heritability of major depressive disorder (MDD) is between 36 and 44%, suggesting that up to nearly half of the phenotypic variability is attributable to genes. A number of genetic polymorphisms have been shown to predispose certain individuals to depression. Of particular interest are the polymorphisms of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene. Although the VDR gene has been well characterized and a vast number of polymorphisms have been identified, the association between &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Bsm&lt;/em&gt;I (rs1544410), &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Apa&lt;/em&gt;I (rs7975232) and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Taq&lt;/em&gt;I (rs731236) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), together with their haplotypes, and MDD risk have yet to be established. We conducted a matched case–control study with a total of 600 participants comprising 300 major depressive disorder (MDD) cases and 300 controls matched by age, gender and ethnicity in a 1:1 ratio, in four public hospitals in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor. Three adjacent SNPs of the VDR gene—&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Bsm&lt;/em&gt;I (rs1544410), &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Apa&lt;/em&gt;I (rs7975232) and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Taq&lt;/em&gt;I (rs731236)—were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained from conditional logistic regression using Stata 16. Linkage disequilibrium and haplotype association with MDD were analyzed using the online SNPStats program. None of the genotypes of the three SNPs was significantly associated with risk of developing MDD after adjusting for confounding factors. However, the TAC (BAt) haplotype was associated with increased odds of MDD (adjusted OR = 2.17, 95% CI = 1.30–3.61, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.003) using CCT (baT) as reference haplotype. The findings suggest that the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Bsm&lt;/em&gt;I-&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Apa&lt;/em&gt;I-&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Taq&lt;/em&gt;I TAC (BAt) haplotype of the VDR gene increases susceptibility to MDD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Accumulating evidence has elucidated that human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) exert profound analgesic effects on numerous animal models of neuropathic pain, including drug-induced peripheral nerves, diabetes-induced neuropathy, and chronic constriction injury. We aimed to address whether forcing expression of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) can enhance the efficacy of hMSCs on alleviation of pain sensation. A rat model of chronic constriction injury (CCI) mimicking peripheral nerve injury was incorporated in the study. Paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) and paw withdrawal latency (PWL) testing were used to measure pain-related behavior. Our results demonstrated that SIRT1 was decreased post-CCI surgery. Compared to hMSCs-control implantation, the hMSCs-SIRT1 (hMSCs overexpressing SIRT1) implantation exhibited superior effects on reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in serum and spinal dorsal horn, while ameliorating neuropathic pain in CCI rat. Engineering hMSCs such as overexpressing SIRT1 may serve as a promising strategy for the treatment of patients with neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Effects of Ghrelin on Olfactory Ensheathing Cell Viability and Neural Marker Expression</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Ghrelin (Ghre), a gut–brain peptide hormone, plays an important role in the entire olfactory system and in food behavior regulation. In the last years, it has aroused particular interest for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties. Our previous research showed that Ghre and its receptor are expressed by peculiar glial cells of the olfactory system: Olfactory Ensheathing Cells (OECs). These cells are able to secrete different neurotrophic factors, promote axonal growth, and show stem cell characteristics. The aim of this work was to study, in an in vitro model, the effect of Ghre on both cell viability and the expression of some neural markers, such as Nestin (Ne), Glial Fibrillary Acid Protein (GFAP), Neuregulin (Neu), and β-III-tubulin (Tuj1), in primary mouse OEC cultures. The MTT test and immunocytochemical procedures were used to highlight cell viability and marker expression, respectively. Our results demonstrate that Ghre, after 7 days of treatment, exerted a positive effect, stimulating OEC viability compared with cells without Ghre treatment. In addition, Ghre was able to modify the expression of some biomarkers, increasing Neu and Tuj1 expression, while GFAP was constant; on the contrary, the presence of positive Ne cells was drastically reduced after 7 days, and this showed a loss of stem cell characteristic and therefore the possible orientation towards an adult neural phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Microbes like viruses, bacteria, and fungi have all been reported in the brain of Alzheimer’s postmortem patients and/or AD mouse model; however, the relationship between brain microbes and Aβ plaque deposition remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we first analyzed bacteria populations in the brain of 4-, 5-, and 6-month-old APP/PS1 mice and then examined the Aβ-positive loads of APP/PS1 mouse at 9 months old to identify bacteria in the brain by 16S rDNA sequencing. Finally, blood–brain barrier permeability was measured by injecting dextrans through the tail vein. Surprisingly, the diversity of microbial community gradually decreased in APP/PS1 mouse while wild-type mouse showed no obvious regularity. Moreover, Aβ-positive deposits in the brain showed a significantly higher relative abundance of microbiota than Aβ-negative tissues and age-matched wild-type mouse brain tissues. In addition, an increase in blood–brain barrier permeability was also observed in APP/PS1 mouse. The present study revealed the exact location of microbes within the Aβ plaques in the brain and suggested the potential antimicrobial effect of the Aβ peptide. We strongly recommend that future research on microbiota-related AD pathology should focus on the migration route of microbiota into the brain and how the microbiota enhance AD progression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Neurodegenerative disorders have become the leading cause of chronic pain and death. Treatments available are not sufficient to help the patients as they only alleviate the symptoms and not the cause. In this regard, stem cells therapy has emerged as an upcoming option for the replacement of dead and damaged neurons. Stem cells, in general, are characterized as cells exhibiting potency properties, i.e., on being subjected to specific conditions they transform into cells of another lineage. Of all the types, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known for their pluripotent nature without the obstacle of ethical concern surrounding the procurement of other cell types. Although fibroblasts are quite similar to MSCs morphologically, certain markers like CD73, CD 90 are specific to MSCs, making both the cell types distinguishable from each other. This is implemented while procuring MSCs from a plethora of sources like umbilical cord blood, adipose tissue, bone marrow, etc. Among these, bone marrow MSCs are the most widely used type for neural regeneration. Neural regeneration is achieved via transdifferentiation. Several studies have either transplanted the stem cells into rodent models or have carried out transdifferentiation in vitro. The process involves a combination of growth factors, pre-treatment factors, and neuronal differentiation inducing mediums. The results obtained are characterized by neuron-like morphology, expression of markers, along with electrophysical activity in some. Recent attempts involve exploring biomaterials that may mimic the native ECM and therefore can be directly introduced at the site of interest. The review gives a brief description of MSCs, their sources and markers, and the different attempts that have been made towards achieving the goal of differentiating MSCs into neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Functional Analysis of a Compound Heterozygous Mutation in the VPS13B Gene in a Chinese Pedigree with Cohen Syndrome</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cohen syndrome (CS) is an autosomal recessive congenital disorder characterized by mutation in the vacuolar protein sorting 13 homolog B (VPS13B; formerly COH1) gene. In the current study, a Chinese family has two young sibling cases having a developmental delay, physical obesity, high myopia, and a special face, which suspected to be CS. The purpose of the study was to identify variants and further analyze their pathogenicity for CS. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) revealed a compound heterozygous mutation in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;VPS13B&lt;/em&gt; gene in the proband, which comprises a frameshift mutation in NM_017890.4: c.10076_10077delCA (p.T3359fs*29) and a putative splice site mutation in c.6940 + 1G &amp;gt; T. Both Minigene assay in vitro and splicing assay in vivo confirmed that the splicing mutation in c.6940 + 1G &amp;gt; T generates a frameshift transcript with whole exon 38 skipping. Eventually, quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated that either of the two mutations can lead to degradation of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;VPS13B&lt;/em&gt; gene at the transcriptional level. Functional studies of variants identified in CS patients are essential for their subsequent genetic counseling and prenatal diagnoses and could also be the start point for new therapeutic approaches, currently based only on symptomatic treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Inflammatory Responses of Astrocytes Are Independent from Lipocalin 2</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The central nervous system (CNS) responds to diverse neurologic injuries with a vigorous activation of astrocytes. In addition to their role in the maintenance of CNS homeostasis and neuronal function, astrocytes are thought to participate in the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses in the CNS. Following antigen recognition, reactive astrocytes may participate in the initiation of innate immune responses, and modulate adaptive immune response leading to the recruitment of peripheral immune cells. Among activation, astrocytes undergo morphological changes and express several molecules, e.g., chemokines. Lipocalin 2 (LCN2) is involved in the control of innate immune responses, regulation of excess iron, and reactive oxygen production. Here, we investigated the influence of LCN2 on basic astrocytic functions linked to inflammatory responses. In vitro studies revealed a similar chemokine expression pattern in wild-type and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Lcn2&lt;/em&gt;-deficient astrocyte cultures after treatment with lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Increased wound closure and morphological changes upon LPS treatment are independent of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Lcn2&lt;/em&gt; expression. We conclude that LCN2 is not necessary for basic astrocytic functions in the context of inflammation. However, CNS-derived LCN2 might have a regulatory effect on other cells, e.g., endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Computational Neuroscience: Constraint-induced intervention as an emergent phenomenon from synaptic competition in biological systems</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10827-021-00782-9</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The principle of constraint-induced therapy is widely practiced in rehabilitation. In hemiplegic cerebral palsy (CP) with impaired contralateral corticospinal projection due to unilateral injury, function improves after imposing a temporary constraint on limbs from the less affected hemisphere. This type of partially-reversible impairment in motor control by early brain injury bears a resemblance to the experience-dependent plastic acquisition and modification of neuronal response selectivity in the visual cortex. Previously, such mechanism was modeled within the framework of BCM (Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro) theory, a rate-based synaptic modification theory. Here, we demonstrate a minimally complex yet sufficient neural network model which provides a fundamental explanation for inter-hemispheric competition using a simplified spike-based model of information transmission and plasticity. We emulate the restoration of function in hemiplegic CP by simulating the competition between cells of the ipsilateral and contralateral corticospinal tracts. We use a high-speed hardware neural simulation to provide realistic numbers of spikes and realistic magnitudes of synaptic modification. We demonstrate that the phenomenon of constraint-induced partial reversal of hemiplegia can be modeled by simplified neural descending tracts with 2 layers of spiking neurons and synapses with spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). We further demonstrate that persistent hemiplegia following unilateral cortical inactivation or deprivation is predicted by the STDP-based model but is inconsistent with BCM model. Although our model is a highly simplified and limited representation of the corticospinal system, it offers an explanation of how constraint as an intervention can help the system to escape from a suboptimal solution. This is a display of an emergent phenomenon from the synaptic competition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Pain is a complex, multidimensional experience that involves dynamic interactions between sensory-discriminative and affective-emotional processes. Pain experiences have a high degree of variability depending on their context and prior anticipation. Viewing pain perception as a perceptual inference problem, we propose a predictive coding paradigm to characterize evoked and non-evoked pain. We record the local field potentials (LFPs) from the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of freely behaving rats—two regions known to encode the sensory-discriminative and affective-emotional aspects of pain, respectively. We further use predictive coding to investigate the temporal coordination of oscillatory activity between the S1 and ACC. Specifically, we develop a phenomenological predictive coding model to describe the macroscopic dynamics of bottom-up and top-down activity. Supported by recent experimental data, we also develop a biophysical neural mass model to describe the mesoscopic neural dynamics in the S1 and ACC populations, in both naive and chronic pain-treated animals. Our proposed predictive coding models not only replicate important experimental findings, but also provide new prediction about the impact of the model parameters on the physiological or behavioral read-out—thereby yielding mechanistic insight into the uncertainty of expectation, placebo or nocebo effect, and chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;An important problem in systems neuroscience is to understand how information is communicated among brain regions, and it has been proposed that communication is mediated by neuronal oscillations, such as rhythms in the gamma band. We sought to investigate this idea by using a network model with two components, a source (sending) and a target (receiving) component, both built to resemble local populations in the cerebral cortex. To measure the effectiveness of communication, we used population-level correlations in spike times between the source and target. We found that after correcting for a response time that is independent of initial conditions, spike-time correlations between the source and target are significant, due in large measure to the alignment of firing events in their gamma rhythms. But, we also found that regular oscillations cannot produce the results observed in our model simulations of cortical neurons. Surprisingly, it is the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;irregularity&lt;/em&gt; of gamma rhythms, the absence of internal clocks, together with the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;malleability&lt;/em&gt; of these rhythms and their tendency to align with external pulses — features that are known to be present in gamma rhythms in the real cortex — that produced the results observed. These findings and the mechanistic explanations we offered are our primary results. Our secondary result is a mathematical relationship between correlations and the sizes of the samples used for their calculation. As improving technology enables recording simultaneously from increasing numbers of neurons, this relationship could be useful for interpreting results from experimental recordings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Computational Neuroscience: Energetics of stochastic BCM type synaptic plasticity and storing of accurate information</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Excitatory synaptic signaling in cortical circuits is thought to be metabolically expensive. Two fundamental brain functions, learning and memory, are associated with long-term synaptic plasticity, but we know very little about energetics of these slow biophysical processes. This study investigates the energy requirement of information storing in plastic synapses for an extended version of BCM plasticity with a decay term, stochastic noise, and nonlinear dependence of neuron’s firing rate on synaptic current (adaptation). It is shown that synaptic weights in this model exhibit bistability. In order to analyze the system analytically, it is reduced to a simple dynamic mean-field for a population averaged plastic synaptic current. Next, using the concepts of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, we derive the energy rate (entropy production rate) for plastic synapses and a corresponding Fisher information for coding presynaptic input. That energy, which is of chemical origin, is primarily used for battling fluctuations in the synaptic weights and presynaptic firing rates, and it increases steeply with synaptic weights, and more uniformly though nonlinearly with presynaptic firing. At the onset of synaptic bistability, Fisher information and memory lifetime both increase sharply, by a few orders of magnitude, but the plasticity energy rate changes only mildly. This implies that a huge gain in the precision of stored information does not have to cost large amounts of metabolic energy, which suggests that synaptic information is not directly limited by energy consumption. Interestingly, for very weak synaptic noise, such a limit on synaptic coding accuracy is imposed instead by a derivative of the plasticity energy rate with respect to the mean presynaptic firing, and this relationship has a general character that is independent of the plasticity type. An estimate for primate neocortex reveals that a relative metabolic cost of BCM type synaptic plasticity, as a fraction of neuronal cost related to fast synaptic transmission and spiking, can vary from negligible to substantial, depending on the synaptic noise level and presynaptic firing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;An inverse procedure is developed and tested to recover functional and structural information from global signals of brains activity. The method assumes a leaky-integrate and fire model with excitatory and inhibitory neurons, coupled via a directed network. Neurons are endowed with a heterogenous current value, which sets their associated dynamical regime. By making use of a heterogenous mean-field approximation, the method seeks to reconstructing from global activity patterns the distribution of in-coming degrees, for both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, as well as the distribution of the assigned currents. The proposed inverse scheme is first validated against synthetic data. Then, time-lapse acquisitions of a zebrafish larva recorded with a two-photon light sheet microscope are used as an input to the reconstruction algorithm. A power law distribution of the in-coming connectivity of the excitatory neurons is found. Local degree distributions are also computed by segmenting the whole brain in sub-regions traced from annotated atlas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm has undergone countless
modifications and adaptations since its original formulation in 1995. Some of
these have become mainstream whereas many others have not been adopted and
faded away. Thus, a myriad of alternative formulations have been proposed to
the extent that the question arises as to what the basic features of an
algorithm must be to belong in the PSO family. The aim of this paper is to
establish what defines a PSO algorithm and to attempt to formulate it in such a
way that it encompasses many existing variants. Therefore, different versions
of the method may be posed as settings within the proposed unified framework.
In addition, the proposed formulation generalises, decouples and incorporates
features to the method providing more flexibility to the behaviour of each
particle. The closed forms of the trajectory difference equation are obtained,
different types of behaviour are identified, stochasticity is decoupled, and
traditionally global features such as sociometries and constraint-handling are
re-defined as particle's attributes.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Neurodynamical Role of STDP in Storage and Retrieval of Associative Information. (arXiv:2104.12249v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12249</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12249</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is a biological process in which the
precise order and timing of neuronal spikes affect the degree of synaptic
modification. While there has been numerous research focusing on the role of
STDP in neural coding, the functional implications of STDP at the macroscopic
level in the brain have not been fully explored yet. In this work, we propose
that STDP in an ensemble of spiking neurons renders storing high dimensional
information in the form of a `memory plane'. Neural activity based on STDP
transforms periodic spatio-temporal input patterns into the corresponding
memory plane, where the stored information can be dynamically revived with a
proper cue. Using the dynamical systems theory that shows the analytic relation
between the input and the memory plane, we were able to demonstrate a specific
memory process for high-dimensional associative data sets. In the
auto-associative memory task, a group of images that were continuously streamed
to the system can be retrieved from the oscillating neural state. The second
application deals with the process of semantic memory components that are
embedded from sentences. The results show that words can recall multiple
sentences simultaneously or one exclusively, depending on their grammatical
relations. This implies that the proposed framework is apt to process multiple
groups of associative memories with a composite structure.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Frequency Superposition -- A Multi-Frequency Stimulation Method in SSVEP-based BCIs. (arXiv:2104.12187v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) is one of the most widely
used modalities in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) due to its many advantages.
However, the existence of harmonics and the limited range of responsive
frequencies in SSVEP make it challenging to further expand the number of
targets without sacrificing other aspects of the interface or putting
additional constraints on the system. This paper introduces a novel
multi-frequency stimulation method for SSVEP and investigates its potential to
effectively and efficiently increase the number of targets presented. The
proposed stimulation method, obtained by the superposition of the stimulation
signals at different frequencies, is size-efficient, allows single-step target
identification, puts no strict constraints on the usable frequency range, can
be suited to self-paced BCIs, and does not require specific light sources. In
addition to the stimulus frequencies and their harmonics, the evoked SSVEP
waveforms include frequencies that are integer linear combinations of the
stimulus frequencies. Results of decoding SSVEPs collected from nine subjects
using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) with only the frequencies and
harmonics as reference, also demonstrate the potential of using such a
stimulation paradigm in SSVEP-based BCIs.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Designing optimal soft modular robots is difficult, due to non-trivial
interactions between morphology and controller. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs),
combined with physical simulators, represent a valid tool to overcome this
issue. In this work, we investigate algorithmic solutions to improve the
Quality Diversity of co-evolved designs of Tensegrity Soft Modular Robots
(TSMRs) for two robotic tasks, namely goal reaching and squeezing trough a
narrow passage. To this aim, we use three different EAs, i.e., MAP-Elites and
two custom algorithms: one based on Viability Evolution (ViE) and NEAT
(ViE-NEAT), the other named Double Map MAP-Elites (DM-ME) and devised to seek
diversity while co-evolving robot morphologies and neural network (NN)-based
controllers. In detail, DM-ME extends MAP-Elites in that it uses two distinct
feature maps, referring to morphologies and controllers respectively, and
integrates a mechanism to automatically define the NN-related feature
descriptor. Considering the fitness, in the goal-reaching task ViE-NEAT
outperforms MAP-Elites and results equivalent to DM-ME. Instead, when
considering diversity in terms of &quot;illumination&quot; of the feature space, DM-ME
outperforms the other two algorithms on both tasks, providing a richer pool of
possible robotic designs, whereas ViE-NEAT shows comparable performance to
MAP-Elites on goal reaching, although it does not exploit any map.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many platforms for benchmarking optimization algorithms offer users the
possibility of sharing their experimental data with the purpose of promoting
reproducible and reusable research. However, different platforms use different
data models and formats, which drastically inhibits identification of relevant
data sets, their interpretation, and their interoperability. Consequently, a
semantically rich, ontology-based, machine-readable data model is highly
desired.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report in this paper on the development of such an ontology, which we name
OPTION (OPTImization algorithm benchmarking ONtology). Our ontology provides
the vocabulary needed for semantic annotation of the core entities involved in
the benchmarking process, such as algorithms, problems, and evaluation
measures. It also provides means for automated data integration, improved
interoperability, powerful querying capabilities and reasoning, thereby
enriching the value of the benchmark data. We demonstrate the utility of OPTION
by annotating and querying a corpus of benchmark performance data from the BBOB
workshop data - a use case which can be easily extended to cover other
benchmarking data collections.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The brain must extract behaviorally relevant latent variables from the
signals streamed by the sensory organs. Such latent variables are often encoded
in the dynamics that generated the signal rather than in the specific
realization of the waveform. Therefore, one problem faced by the brain is to
segment time series based on underlying dynamics. We present two algorithms for
performing this segmentation task that are biologically plausible, which we
define as acting in a streaming setting and all learning rules being local. One
algorithm is model-based and can be derived from an optimization problem
involving a mixture of autoregressive processes. This algorithm relies on
feedback in the form of a prediction error, and can also be used for
forecasting future samples. In some brain regions, such as the retina, the
feedback connections necessary to use the prediction error for learning are
absent. For this case, we propose a second, model-free algorithm that uses a
running estimate of the autocorrelation structure of the signal to perform the
segmentation. We show that both algorithms do well when tasked with segmenting
signals drawn from autoregressive models with piecewise-constant parameters. In
particular, the segmentation accuracy is similar to that obtained from
oracle-like methods in which the ground-truth parameters of the autoregressive
models are known. We provide implementations of our algorithms at
https://github.com/ttesileanu/bio-time-series.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain stimulation is a core method in neuroscience. Numerous non-invasive
brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques are currently in use in basic and clinical
research, and recent advances promise the ability to non-invasively access deep
brain structures. While encouraging, there is a surprising gap in our
understanding of precisely how NIBS perturbs neural activity throughout an
interconnected network, and how such perturbed neural activity ultimately links
to behaviour. In this review, we will consider why non-human primate (NHP)
models of NIBS are ideally situated to address this gap in knowledge, and will
consider why the oculomotor network that moves our line of sight offers a
particularly valuable platform in which to empirically test hypothesis
regarding NIBS-induced changes in brain and behaviour. NHP models of NIBS will
enable investigation of the complex, dynamic effects of brain stimulation
across multiple hierarchically interconnected brain areas, networks, and
effectors. By establishing such links between brain and behavioural output,
work in NHPs can help optimize experimental and therapeutic approaches, improve
NIBS efficacy, and reduce side-effects of NIBS.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We investigate the use of Genetic Programming (GP) as a convolutional
predictor for missing pixels in images. The training phase is performed by
sweeping a sliding window over an image, where the pixels on the border
represent the inputs of a GP tree. The output of the tree is taken as the
predicted value for the central pixel. We consider two topologies for the
sliding window, namely the Moore and the Von Neumann neighborhood. The best GP
tree scoring the lowest prediction error over the training set is then used to
predict the pixels in the test set. We experimentally assess our approach
through two experiments. In the first one, we train a GP tree over a subset of
1000 complete images from the MNIST dataset. The results show that GP can learn
the distribution of the pixels with respect to a simple baseline predictor,
with no significant differences observed between the two neighborhoods. In the
second experiment, we train a GP convolutional predictor on two degraded
images, removing around 20% of their pixels. In this case, we observe that the
Moore neighborhood works better, although the Von Neumann neighborhood allows
for a larger training set.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cloud and cloud shadow segmentation are fundamental processes in optical
remote sensing image analysis. Current methods for cloud/shadow identification
in geospatial imagery are not as accurate as they should, especially in the
presence of snow and haze. This paper presents a deep learning-based framework
for the detection of cloud/shadow in Landsat 8 images. Our method benefits from
a convolutional neural network, Cloud-Net+ (a modification of our previously
proposed Cloud-Net \cite{myigarss}) that is trained with a novel loss function
(Filtered Jaccard Loss). The proposed loss function is more sensitive to the
absence of foreground objects in an image and penalizes/rewards the predicted
mask more accurately than other common loss functions. In addition, a sunlight
direction-aware data augmentation technique is developed for the task of cloud
shadow detection to extend the generalization ability of the proposed model by
expanding existing training sets. The combination of Cloud-Net+, Filtered
Jaccard Loss function, and the proposed augmentation algorithm delivers
superior results on four public cloud/shadow detection datasets. Our
experiments on Pascal VOC dataset exemplifies the applicability and quality of
our proposed network and loss function in other computer vision applications.

A new host defence is reported, in which adult Drosophila accelerate mating behaviour at the sight of certain parasitoid wasps, mediated by the upregulation of a nervous system gene that encodes a 41-amino acid micropeptide.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/IOXCyo_2auk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Developing Proprioceptive Countermeasures to Mitigate Postural and Locomotor Control Deficits After Long-Duration Spaceflight</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.658985</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Astronauts experience post-flight disturbances in postural and locomotor control due to sensorimotor adaptations during spaceflight. These alterations may have adverse consequences if a rapid egress is required after landing. Although current exercise protocols can effectively mitigate cardiovascular and muscular deconditioning, the benefits to post-flight sensorimotor dysfunction are limited. Furthermore, some exercise capabilities like treadmill running are currently not feasible on exploration spaceflight vehicles. Thus, new in-flight operational countermeasures are needed to mitigate postural and locomotor control deficits after exploration missions. Data from spaceflight and from analog studies collectively suggest that body unloading decreases the utilization of proprioceptive input, and this adaptation strongly contributes to balance dysfunction after spaceflight. For example, on return to Earth, an astronaut’s vestibular input may be compromised by adaptation to microgravity, but their proprioceptive input is compromised by body unloading. Since proprioceptive and tactile input are important for maintaining postural control, keeping these systems tuned to respond to upright balance challenges during flight may improve functional task performance after flight through dynamic reweighting of sensory input. Novel approaches are needed to compensate for the challenges of balance training in microgravity and must be tested in a body unloading environment such as head down bed rest. Here, we review insights from the literature and provide observations from our laboratory that could inform the development of an in-flight proprioceptive countermeasure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Unbiased Label-Free Quantitative Proteomics of Cells Expressing Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Mutations in CCNF Reveals Activation of the Apoptosis Pathway: A Workflow to Screen Pathogenic Gene Mutations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.627740</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The past decade has seen a rapid acceleration in the discovery of new genetic causes of ALS, with more than 20 putative ALS-causing genes now cited. These genes encode proteins that cover a diverse range of molecular functions, including free radical scavenging (e.g., SOD1), regulation of RNA homeostasis (e.g., TDP-43 and FUS), and protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (e.g., ubiquilin-2 and cyclin F) and autophagy (TBK1 and sequestosome-1/p62). It is likely that the various initial triggers of disease (either genetic, environmental and/or gene-environment interaction) must converge upon a common set of molecular pathways that underlie ALS pathogenesis. Given the complexity, it is not surprising that a catalog of molecular pathways and proteostasis dysfunctions have been linked to ALS. One of the challenges in ALS research is determining, at the early stage of discovery, whether a new gene mutation is indeed disease-specific, and if it is linked to signaling pathways that trigger neuronal cell death. We have established a proof-of-concept proteogenomic workflow to assess new gene mutations, using CCNF (cyclin F) as an example, in cell culture models to screen whether potential gene candidates fit the criteria of activating apoptosis. This can provide an informative and time-efficient output that can be extended further for validation in a variety of in vitro and in vivo models and/or for mechanistic studies. As a proof-of-concept, we expressed cyclin F mutations (K97R, S195R, S509P, R574Q, S621G) in HEK293 cells for label-free quantitative proteomics that bioinformatically predicted activation of the neuronal cell death pathways, which was validated by immunoblot analysis. Proteomic analysis of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from patient fibroblasts bearing the S621G mutation showed the same activation of these pathways providing compelling evidence for these candidate gene mutations to be strong candidates for further validation and mechanistic studies (such as E3 enzymatic activity assays, protein–protein and protein–substrate studies, and neuronal apoptosis and aberrant branching measurements in zebrafish). Our proteogenomics approach has great utility and provides a relatively high-throughput screening platform to explore candidate gene mutations for their propensity to cause neuronal cell death, which will guide a researcher for further experimental studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Neuronal and Glial Distribution of Tau Protein in the Adult Rat and Monkey</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.607303</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Tau is a microtubule-associated protein for which the physiological functions remain a topic of vigorous investigation. Additionally, tau is a central player in the pathogenesis of several diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and several frontotemporal dementias. A critical variable to understanding tau in physiological and disease contexts is its normal localization within cells of the adult CNS. Tau is often described as an axon-specific (or enriched) and neuron-specific protein with little to no expression in glial cells, all of which are untrue. Understanding normal tau distribution also impacts interpretation of experimental results and hypotheses regarding its role in disease. Thus, we set out to help clarify the normal localization of tau in the adult CNS of middle-aged rats and rhesus macaque using the hippocampus as a representative brain structure. The physiological concentration of tau in the rat hippocampus was 6.6 μM and in white matter was 3.6 μM as determined by quantitative sandwich ELISAs. We evaluated the cellular localization of tau using multiple tau-specific antibodies with epitopes to different regions, including Tau1, Tau5, Tau7, R1, and two novel primate-specific antibodies NT9 and NT15. In the rat and monkey, tau was localized within the somatodendritic and axonal compartments, as well as a subset of neuronal nuclei. Semi-quantitative fluorescence intensity measurements revealed that depending on the specific reagent used the somatodendritic tau is relatively equal to, higher than, or lower than axonal tau, highlighting differential labeling of tau with various antibodies despite its distribution throughout the neuron. Tau was strongly expressed in mature oligodendrocytes and displayed little to no expression in oligodendrocyte precursor cells, astrocytes or microglia. Collectively, the data indicate tau is ∼3 – 7 μM under physiological conditions, is not specifically enriched in axons, and is normally found in both neurons and mature oligodendrocytes in the adult CNS. The full landscape of tau distribution is not revealed by all antibodies suggesting availability of the epitopes is different within specific neuronal compartments. These findings set the stage for better understanding normal tau distributions and interpreting data regarding the presence of tau in different compartments or cell types within disease conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Comparing the Clinical and Neuropsychological Characteristics of Parkinson’s Disease With and Without Freezing of Gait</title>

	<description>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Freezing of gait (FOG) is one of the most common walking problems in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Impaired cognitive function is believed to play an important role in developing and aggravating FOG in PD. But some evidence suggests that motor function discrepancy may affect testing results. Therefore, we think it is necessary for PD-FOG(+) and PD-FOG(−) patients to complete neuropsychological tests under similar motor conditions.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;This study recruited 44 idiopathic PD patients [PD-FOG(+) n = 22, PD-FOG(−) n = 22] and 20 age-matched healthy controls (HC). PD-FOG(+) and PD-FOG(−) patients were matched for age, year of education, and Hoehn and Yahr score (H&amp;amp;Y). All participants underwent a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological assessment, and demographical and clinical information was also collected.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;PD patients showed poorer cognitive function, higher risks of depression and anxiety, and more neuropsychiatric symptoms compared with HC. When controlling for age, years of education, and H&amp;amp;Y, there were no statistical differences in cognitive function between PD-FOG(+) and PD-FOG(−) patients. But PD-FOG(+) patients had worse motor and non-motor symptoms than PD-FOG(−) patients. PD patients whose motor symptoms initiated with rigidity and initiated unilaterally were more likely to experience FOG.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Traditional neuropsychological testing may not be sensitive enough to detect cognitive impairment in PD. Motor symptoms initiated with rigidity and initiated unilaterally might be an important predictor of FOG.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Disruption of the function of the primary motor cortex (M1) is thought to play a critical role in motor dysfunction in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Detailed information regarding the specific aspects of M1 circuits that become abnormal is lacking. We recorded single units and local field potentials (LFPs) of M1 neurons in unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion rats and control rats to assess the impact of dopamine (DA) cell loss during rest and a forelimb reaching task. Our results indicated that M1 neurons can be classified into two groups (putative pyramidal neurons and putative interneurons) and that 6-OHDA could modify the activity of different M1 subpopulations to a large extent. Reduced activation of putative pyramidal neurons during inattentive rest and reaching was observed. In addition, 6-OHDA intoxication was associated with an increase in certain LFP frequencies, especially those in the beta range (broadly defined here as any frequency between 12 and 35 Hz), which become pathologically exaggerated throughout cortico-basal ganglia circuits after dopamine depletion. Furthermore, assessment of different spike-LFP coupling parameters revealed that the putative pyramidal neurons were particularly prone to being phase-locked to ongoing cortical oscillations at 12–35 Hz during reaching. Conversely, putative interneurons were neither hypoactive nor synchronized to ongoing cortical oscillations. These data collectively demonstrate a neuron type-selective alteration in the M1 in hemiparkinsonian rats. These alterations hamper the ability of the M1 to contribute to motor conduction and are likely some of the main contributors to motor impairments in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Prognostic Factors and Models for Changes in Cognitive Performance After Multi-Domain Cognitive Training in Healthy Older Adults: A Systematic Review</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.636355</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Cognitive Training (CT) may contribute to the maintenance and even enhancement of cognitive functions in healthy older adults. However, the question who benefits most from multi-domain CTs is still highly under-investigated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: The goal is to investigate prognostic factors and models for changes in cognitive test performance in healthy older adults after a multi-domain CT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The data bases MEDLINE, Web of Science Core Collection, CENTRAL, and PsycInfo were searched up to July 2019. Studies investigating prognostic factors and/or models on cognitive outcomes (global cognition, memory, attention, executive functions, language, visuo-spatial abilities) after conducting a multi-domain CT in healthy older adults were included. Risk of Bias was assessed using the QUIPS and the PROBAST tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: 23 prognostic factor and model studies were included. Results indicate a high heterogeneity regarding the conducted multi-domain CTs, the investigated prognostic factors, the investigated outcomes, and the used statistical approaches. Age and neuropsychological performance at study entry were the most investigated predictors, yet they show inconsistent results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Data on prognostic factors and models of changes after multi-domain CT are still too rare and inconsistent to draw clear conclusions due to statistical shortcomings and low reporting quality. Approaches for future research are outlined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Registration:https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, ID: CRD42020147531&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Phonological Variations Are Compensated at the Lexical Level: Evidence From Auditory Neural Activity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.622904</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.622904</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dealing with phonological variations is important for speech processing. This article addresses whether phonological variations introduced by assimilatory processes are compensated for at the pre-lexical or lexical level, and whether the nature of variation and the phonological context influence this process. To this end, Swedish nasal regressive place assimilation was investigated using the mismatch negativity (MMN) component. In nasal regressive assimilation, the coronal nasal assimilates to the place of articulation of a following segment, most clearly with a velar or labial place of articulation, as in utan mej “without me” &amp;gt; [ʉːtam mɛjː]. In a passive auditory oddball paradigm, 15 Swedish speakers were presented with Swedish phrases with attested and unattested phonological variations and contexts for nasal assimilation. Attested variations – a coronal-to-labial change as in utan “without” &amp;gt; [ʉːtam] – were contrasted with unattested variations – a labial-to-coronal change as in utom “except” &amp;gt; &lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;[ʉːtɔn] – in appropriate and inappropriate contexts created by mej “me” [mɛjː] and dej “you” [dɛjː]. Given that the MMN amplitude depends on the degree of variation between two stimuli, the MMN responses were expected to indicate to what extent the distance between variants was tolerated by the perceptual system. Since the MMN response reflects not only low-level acoustic processing but also higher-level linguistic processes, the results were predicted to indicate whether listeners process assimilation at the pre-lexical and lexical levels. The results indicated no significant interactions across variations, suggesting that variations in phonological forms do not incur any cost in lexical retrieval; hence such variation is compensated for at the lexical level. However, since the MMN response reached significance only for a labial-to-coronal change in a labial context and for a coronal-to-labial change in a coronal context, the compensation might have been influenced by the nature of variation and the phonological context. It is therefore concluded that while assimilation is compensated for at the lexical level, there is also some influence from pre-lexical processing. The present results reveal not only signal-based perception of phonological units, but also higher-level lexical processing, and are thus able to reconcile the bottom-up and top-down models of speech processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Large Acid-Evoked Currents, Mediated by ASIC1a, Accompany Differentiation in Human Dopaminergic Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.668008</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are proton-gated Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. They contribute to synaptic transmission, neuronal differentiation and neurodegeneration. ASICs have been mainly characterized in neurons from mice or rats and our knowledge of their properties in human neurons is scarce. Here, we functionally characterized ASICs in differentiating LUHMES cells, a human mesencephalic cell line with characteristics of dopaminergic neurons. We find that LUHMES cells express functional ASICs, predominantly homomeric ASIC1a. Expression starts early during differentiation with a striking surge in current amplitude at days 4–6 of differentiation, a time point where—based on published data—LUHMES cells start expressing synaptic markers. Peak ASIC expression therefore coincides with a critical period of LUHMES cell differentiation. It was associated with increased excitability, but not paralleled by an increase in ASIC1 mRNA or protein. In differentiating as well as in terminally differentiated LUHMES cells, ASIC activation by slight acidification elicited large currents, action potentials and a rise in cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Applying the ASIC pore blocker diminazene during differentiation reduced the length of neurites, consistent with the hypothesis that ASICs play a critical role in LUHMES cell differentiation. In summary, our study establishes LUHMES cells as a valuable model to study the role of ASICs for neuronal differentiation and potentially also cell death in a human cell line.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: npc2-Deficient Zebrafish Reproduce Neurological and Inflammatory Symptoms of Niemann-Pick Type C Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.647860</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.647860</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease that is caused by a mutation of the NPC1 or NPC2 gene, in which un-esterified cholesterol and sphingolipids accumulate mainly in the liver, spleen, and brain. Abnormal lysosomal storage leads to cell damage, neurological problems, and premature death. The time of onset and severity of symptoms of NPC disease are highly variable. The molecular mechanisms that are responsible for NPC disease pathology are far from being understood. The present study generated and characterized a zebrafish mutant that lacks Npc2 protein that may be useful for studies at the organismal, cellular, and molecular levels and both small-scale and high-throughput screens. Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we knocked out the zebrafish homolog of NPC2. Five-day-old npc2 mutants were morphologically indistinguishable from wildtype larvae. We found that live npc2&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; larvae exhibited stronger Nile blue staining. The npc2&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; larvae exhibited low mobility and a high anxiety-related response. These behavioral changes correlated with downregulation of the mcu (mitochondrial calcium uniporter) gene, ppp3ca (calcineurin) gene, and genes that are involved in myelination (mbp and mpz). Histological analysis of adult npc2&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; zebrafish revealed that pathological changes in the nervous system, kidney, liver, and pancreas correlated with inflammatory responses (i.e., the upregulation of il1, nfκβ, and mpeg; i.e., hallmarks of NPC disease). These findings suggest that the npc2 mutant zebrafish may be a model of NPC disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Visual Deprivation Retards the Maturation of Dendritic Fields and Receptive Fields of Mouse Retinal Ganglion Cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.640421</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.640421</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;It was well documented that both the size of the dendritic field and receptive field of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are developmentally regulated in the mammalian retina, and visual stimulation is required for the maturation of the dendritic and receptive fields of mouse RGCs. However, it is not clear whether the developmental changes of the RGC receptive field correlate with the dendritic field and whether visual stimulation regulates the maturation of the dendritic field and receptive field of RGCs in a correlated manner. The present work demonstrated that both the dendritic and receptive fields of RGCs continuously develop after eye opening. However, the correlation between the developmental changes in the receptive field size and the dendritic field varies among different RGC types. These results suggest a continuous change of synaptic converging of RGC synaptic inputs in an RGC type-dependent manner. Besides, light deprivation impairs both the development of dendritic and receptive fields.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Effects of CSF Neurogranin and APOE ε4 on Cognition and Neuropathology in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.667899</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.667899</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measurements of neurogranin (Ng) have emerged as a promising biomarker for cognitive decline in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE ε4) allele is by far the most consistent genetic risk factor for AD. However, it is not known whether the pathophysiological roles of Ng in MCI or AD are related to APOEε4. We stratified 250 participants from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database into cognitively normal (CN) ε4 negative (CN ε4−), CN ε4 positive (CN ε4+), MCI ε4 negative (MCI ε4−), MCI ε4 positive (MCI ε4+), AD ε4 negative (AD ε4−), and AD ε4 positive (AD ε4+). CSF Ng levels were significantly increased in APOE ε4 carriers compared to APOE ε4 non-carriers with MCI. In addition, CSF Ng identified MCI ε4+ versus CN ε4−, but not MCI ε4− versus CN ε4−. Similarly, CSF Ng negatively correlated with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores at baseline in the MCI ε4+ group. Our findings support the use of CSF Ng as a biomarker of synaptic pathology for AD. We propose that the roles of CSF Ng in the pathophysiology of MCI may be related to APOE ε4.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Cognitive and Structural Correlates of Conversational Speech Timing in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Mild-to-Moderate Alzheimer’s Disease: Relevance for Early Detection Approaches</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.637404</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.637404</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Increasing efforts have focused on the establishment of novel biomarkers for the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and prediction of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)-to-AD conversion. Behavioral changes over the course of healthy ageing, at disease onset and during disease progression, have been recently put forward as promising markers for the detection of MCI and AD. The present study examines whether the temporal characteristics of speech in a collaborative referencing task are associated with cognitive function and the volumes of brain regions involved in speech production and known to be reduced in MCI and AD pathology. We then explore the discriminative ability of the temporal speech measures for the classification of MCI and AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: Individuals with MCI, mild-to-moderate AD and healthy controls (HCs) underwent a structural MRI scan and a battery of neuropsychological tests. They also engaged in a collaborative referencing task with a caregiver. The associations between the conversational speech timing features, cognitive function (domain-specific) and regional brain volumes were examined by means of linear mixed-effect modeling. Genetic programming was used to explore the discriminative ability of the conversational speech features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: MCI and mild-to-moderate AD are characterized by a general slowness of speech, attributed to slower speech rate and slower turn-taking in conversational settings. The speech characteristics appear to be reflective of episodic, lexico-semantic, executive functioning and visuospatial deficits and underlying volume reductions in frontal, temporal and cerebellar areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The implementation of conversational speech timing-based technologies in clinical and community settings may provide additional markers for the early detection of cognitive deficits and structural changes associated with MCI and AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Comparing Pre-trained and Feature-Based Models for Prediction of Alzheimer's Disease Based on Speech</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.635945</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.635945</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Research related to the automatic detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is important, given the high prevalence of AD and the high cost of traditional diagnostic methods. Since AD significantly affects the content and acoustics of spontaneous speech, natural language processing, and machine learning provide promising techniques for reliably detecting AD. There has been a recent proliferation of classification models for AD, but these vary in the datasets used, model types and training and testing paradigms. In this study, we compare and contrast the performance of two common approaches for automatic AD detection from speech on the same, well-matched dataset, to determine the advantages of using domain knowledge vs. pre-trained transfer models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Audio recordings and corresponding manually-transcribed speech transcripts of a picture description task administered to 156 demographically matched older adults, 78 with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and 78 cognitively intact (healthy) were classified using machine learning and natural language processing as “AD” or “non-AD.” The audio was acoustically-enhanced, and post-processed to improve quality of the speech recording as well control for variation caused by recording conditions. Two approaches were used for classification of these speech samples: (1) using domain knowledge: extracting an extensive set of clinically relevant linguistic and acoustic features derived from speech and transcripts based on prior literature, and (2) using transfer-learning and leveraging large pre-trained machine learning models: using transcript-representations that are automatically derived from state-of-the-art pre-trained language models, by fine-tuning Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer (BERT)-based sequence classification models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We compared the utility of speech transcript representations obtained from recent natural language processing models (i.e., BERT) to more clinically-interpretable language feature-based methods. Both the feature-based approaches and fine-tuned BERT models significantly outperformed the baseline linguistic model using a small set of linguistic features, demonstrating the importance of extensive linguistic information for detecting cognitive impairments relating to AD. We observed that fine-tuned BERT models numerically outperformed feature-based approaches on the AD detection task, but the difference was not statistically significant. Our main contribution is the observation that when tested on the same, demographically balanced dataset and tested on independent, unseen data, both domain knowledge and pretrained linguistic models have good predictive performance for detecting AD based on speech. It is notable that linguistic information alone is capable of achieving comparable, and even numerically better, performance than models including both acoustic and linguistic features here. We also try to shed light on the inner workings of the more black-box natural language processing model by performing an interpretability analysis, and find that attention weights reveal interesting patterns such as higher attribution to more important information content units in the picture description task, as well as pauses and filler words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This approach supports the value of well-performing machine learning and linguistically-focussed processing techniques to detect AD from speech and highlights the need to compare model performance on carefully balanced datasets, using consistent same training parameters and independent test datasets in order to determine the best performing predictive model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Cognitive and Motor Perseveration Are Associated in Older Adults</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.610359</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.610359</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aging causes perseveration (difficulty to switch between actions) in motor and cognitive tasks, suggesting that the same neural processes could govern these abilities in older adults. To test this, we evaluated the relation between independently measured motor and cognitive perseveration in young (21.4 ± 3.7 y/o) and older participants (76.5 ± 2.9 y/o). Motor perseveration was measured with a locomotor task in which participants had to transition between distinct walking patterns. Cognitive perseveration was measured with a card matching task in which participants had to switch between distinct matching rules. We found that perseveration in the cognitive and motor domains were positively related in older, but not younger individuals, such that participants exhibiting greater perseveration in the motor task also perseverated more in the cognitive task. Additionally, exposure reduces motor perseveration: older adults who had practiced the motor task could transition between walking patterns as proficiently as naïve, young individuals. Our results suggest an overlap in neural processes governing cognitive and motor perseveration with aging and that exposure can counteract the age-related motor perseveration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Foreign Language Learning as Cognitive Training to Prevent Old Age Disorders? Protocol of a Randomized Controlled Trial of Language Training vs. Musical Training and Social Interaction in Elderly With Subjective Cognitive Decline</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.550180</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: With aging comes a reduction of cognitive flexibility, which has been related to the development of late-life depression and progression of general cognitive decline. Several factors have been linked to attenuating such decline in cognitive flexibility, such as education, physical exercise and stimulating leisure activities. Speaking two or more languages has recently received abundant attention as another factor that may build up cognitive reserve, thereby limiting the functional implications of compromised cognition that accompany old age. With the number of older adults reaching record levels, it is important to attenuate the development of old-age disorders. Learning to speak a foreign language might offer a powerful tool in promoting healthy aging, but up to date effect studies are sparse. Here, the protocol that forms the foundation of the current study is presented. The present study aims to: (1) examine the effects of a foreign language training on cognitive flexibility and its neural underpinnings, and on mental health; and (2) assess the unique role of foreign language training vs. other cognitive or social programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: One-hundred and ninety-eight Dutch elderly participants reporting subjective cognitive decline are included and randomized to either a language intervention, a music intervention, or a social control intervention. During 3 to 6 months, the language group learns English, the music group learns to play the guitar and the social group participates in social meetings where art workshops are offered. At baseline, at a 3-month follow-up, and at 6 months after termination of the training program, clinical, cognitive and brain activity measurements (combined EEG and fNIRS methods) are taken to assess cognitive flexibility and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: This is the first trial addressing combined effects of language learning in elderly on cognition, language proficiency, socio-affective measures, and brain activity in the context of a randomized controlled trial. If successful, this study can provide insights into how foreign language training can contribute to more cognitively and mentally healthy years in older adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration: The trial is registered at the Netherlands Trial Register, July 2, 2018, trial number NL7137. https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/7137.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Mosquitoes are major infectious disease-carrying vectors. Assessment of current and future risks associated with the mosquito population requires knowledge of the full repertoire of pathogens they carry, including novel viruses, as well as their blood meal sources. Unbiased metatranscriptomic sequencing of individual mosquitoes offers a straightforward, rapid and quantitative means to acquire this information. Here, we profile 148 diverse wild-caught mosquitoes collected in California and detect sequences from eukaryotes, prokaryotes, 24 known and 46 novel viral species. Importantly, sequencing individuals greatly enhanced the value of the biological information obtained. It allowed us to a) speciate host mosquito, b) compute the prevalence of each microbe and recognize a high frequency of viral co-infections, c) associate animal pathogens with specific blood meal sources, and d) apply simple co-occurrence methods to recover previously undetected components of highly prevalent segmented viruses. In the context of emerging diseases, where knowledge about vectors, pathogens, and reservoirs is lacking, the approaches described here can provide actionable information for public health surveillance and intervention decisions.</description>

	<description>Gene activator proteins comprise distinct DNA-binding and transcriptional activation domains (ADs). Because few ADs have been described, we tested domains tiling all yeast transcription factors for activation &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and identified 150 ADs. By mRNA display, we showed that 73% of ADs bound the Med15 subunit of Mediator, and that binding strength was correlated with activation. AD-Mediator interaction &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; was unaffected by a large excess of free activator protein, pointing to a dynamic mechanism of interaction. Structural modeling showed that ADs interact with Med15 without shape complementarity ('fuzzy' binding). ADs shared no sequence motifs, but mutagenesis revealed biochemical and structural constraints. Finally, a neural network trained on AD sequences accurately predicted ADs in human proteins and in other yeast proteins, including chromosomal proteins and chromatin remodeling complexes. These findings solve the longstanding enigma of AD structure and function and provide a rationale for their role in biology.</description>

	<description>The molecular mechanisms underlying the diversity of cortical glutamatergic synapses is still incompletely understood. Here, we tested the hypothesis that presynaptic active zones (AZs) are constructed from molecularly uniform, independent release sites (RSs), the number of which scales linearly with the AZ size. Paired recordings between hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells and fast-spiking interneurons in acute slices from adult mice followed by quantal analysis demonstrate large variability in the number of RSs (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;) at these connections. High resolution molecular analysis of functionally characterized synapses reveals variability in the content of one of the key vesicle priming factors – Munc13-1 – in AZs that possess the same &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. Replica immunolabeling also shows a 3-fold variability in the total Munc13-1 content of AZs of identical size, and a 4-fold variability in the size and density of Munc13-1 clusters within the AZs. Our results provide evidence for quantitative molecular heterogeneity of RSs and support a model in which the AZ is built up from variable numbers of molecularly heterogeneous, but independent RSs.</description>

	<title>eLife: Protomer alignment modulates specificity of RNA substrate recognition by Ire1</title>

	<description>The unfolded protein response (UPR) maintains protein folding homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In metazoan cells, the Ire1 branch of the UPR initiates two functional outputs—non-conventional mRNA splicing and selective mRNA decay (RIDD). By contrast, Ire1 orthologs from &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&lt;/i&gt; are specialized for only splicing or RIDD, respectively. Previously, we showed that the functional specialization lies in Ire1's RNase activity, which is either stringently splice-site specific or promiscuous (W. Li et al., 2018). Here, we developed an assay that reports on Ire1's RNase promiscuity. We found that conversion of two amino acids within the RNase domain of &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae &lt;/i&gt;Ire1 to their &lt;i&gt;S. pombe&lt;/i&gt; counterparts rendered it promiscuous. Using biochemical assays and computational modeling, we show that the mutations rewired a pair of salt bridges at Ire1 RNase domain's dimer interface, changing its protomer alignment. Thus, Ire1 protomer alignment affects its substrates specificity.</description>

	<description>Premotor circuits in the brainstem project to pools of orofacial motoneurons to execute essential motor action such as licking, chewing, breathing, and in rodent, whisking. Previous transsynaptic tracing studies only mapped orofacial premotor circuits in neonatal mice, but the adult circuits remain unknown as a consequence of technical difficulties. Here we developed a three-step monosynaptic transsynaptic tracing strategy to identify premotor neurons controlling vibrissa, tongue protrusion, and jaw-closing muscles in the adult mouse. We registered these different groups of premotor neurons onto the Allen mouse brain common coordinate framework (CCF) and consequently generated a combined 3D orofacial premotor atlas, revealing unique spatial organizations of distinct premotor circuits. We further uncovered premotor neurons that simultaneously innervate multiple motor nuclei and, consequently, are likely to coordinate different muscles involved in the same orofacial motor actions. Our method for tracing adult premotor circuits and registering to Allen CCF is generally applicable and should facilitate the investigations of motor controls of diverse behaviors.</description>

	<title>eLife: Mechanistic theory predicts the effects of temperature and humidity on inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and other enveloped viruses</title>

	<description>Ambient temperature and humidity strongly affect inactivation rates of enveloped viruses, but a mechanistic, quantitative theory of these effects has been elusive. We measure the stability of SARS-CoV-2 on an inert surface at nine temperature and humidity conditions and develop a mechanistic model to explain and predict how temperature and humidity alter virus inactivation. We find SARS-CoV-2 survives longest at low temperatures and extreme relative humidities (RH); median estimated virus half-life is &amp;gt;24 hours at 10C and 40% RH, but ~1.5 hours at 27C and 65% RH. Our mechanistic model uses fundamental chemistry to explain why inactivation rate increases with increased temperature and shows a U-shaped dependence on RH. The model accurately predicts existing measurements of five different human coronaviruses, suggesting that shared mechanisms may affect stability for many viruses. The results indicate scenarios of high transmission risk, point to mitigation strategies, and advance the mechanistic study of virus transmission.</description>

	<description>Dendritic cells (DCs) regulate processes ranging from antitumor and antiviral immunity to host-microbe communication at mucosal surfaces. It remains difficult, however, to genetically manipulate human DCs, limiting our ability to probe how DCs elicit specific immune responses. Here, we develop a CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing method for human monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs) that mediates knockouts with a median efficiency of &amp;gt;94% across &amp;gt;300 genes. Using this method, we perform genetic screens in moDCs, identifying mechanisms by which DCs tune responses to lipopolysaccharides from the human microbiome. In addition, we reveal donor-specific responses to lipopolysaccharides, underscoring the importance of assessing immune phenotypes in donor-derived cells, and identify candidate genes that control this specificity, highlighting the potential of our method to pinpoint determinants of inter-individual variation in immunity. Our work sets the stage for a systematic dissection of the immune signaling at the host-microbiome interface and for targeted engineering of DCs for neoantigen vaccination.</description>

	<title>eLife: The mechanism underlying transient weakness in myotonia congenita</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65691</link>
	<description>In addition to the hallmark muscle stiffness, patients with recessive myotonia congenita (Becker disease) experience debilitating bouts of transient weakness that remain poorly understood despite years of study. We performed intracellular recordings from muscle of both genetic and pharmacologic mouse models of Becker disease to identify the mechanism underlying transient weakness. Our recordings reveal transient depolarizations (plateau potentials) of the membrane potential to −25 to −35 mV in the genetic and pharmacologic models of Becker disease. Both Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; currents contribute to plateau potentials. Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; persistent inward current (NaPIC) through Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.4 channels is the key trigger of plateau potentials and current through Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.1 Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels contributes to the duration of the plateau. Inhibiting NaPIC with ranolazine prevents the development of plateau potentials and eliminates transient weakness in vivo. These data suggest that targeting NaPIC may be an effective treatment to prevent transient weakness in myotonia congenita.</description>

	<description>Genes involved in disease resistance are some of the fastest evolving and most diverse components of genomes. Large numbers of nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat (NLR) genes are found in plant genomes and are required for disease resistance. However, NLRs can trigger autoimmunity, disrupt beneficial microbiota or reduce fitness. It is therefore crucial to understand how NLRs are controlled. Here we show that the RNA-binding protein FPA mediates widespread premature cleavage and polyadenylation of NLR transcripts, thereby controlling their functional expression and impacting immunity. Using long-read Nanopore direct RNA sequencing, we resolved the complexity of NLR transcript processing and gene annotation. Our results uncover a co-transcriptional layer of NLR control with implications for understanding the regulatory and evolutionary dynamics of NLRs in the immune responses of plants.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65108</link>
	<description>Adiponectin is essential for the regulation of tissue substrate utilization and systemic insulin sensitivity. Clinical studies have suggested a positive association of circulating adiponectin with healthspan and lifespan. However, the direct effects of adiponectin on promoting healthspan and lifespan remain unexplored. Here, we are using an adiponectin null mouse and a transgenic adiponectin overexpression model. We directly assessed the effects of circulating adiponectin on the aging process and found that adiponectin null mice display exacerbated age-related glucose and lipid metabolism disorders. Moreover, adiponectin null mice have a significantly shortened lifespan on both chow and high-fat diet (HFD). In contrast, a transgenic mouse model with elevated circulating adiponectin levels has a dramatically improved systemic insulin sensitivity, reduced age-related tissue inflammation and fibrosis, and a prolonged healthspan and median lifespan. These results support a role of adiponectin as an essential regulator for healthspan and lifespan.</description>

	<title>eLife: HIV-1 uncoating by release of viral cDNA from capsid-like structures in the nucleus of infected cells</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64776</link>
	<description>HIV-1 replication commences inside the cone-shaped viral capsid, but timing, localization and mechanism of uncoating are under debate. We adapted a strategy to visualize individual reverse-transcribed HIV-1 cDNA molecules and their association with viral and cellular proteins using fluorescence and correlative-light-and-electron-microscopy (CLEM). We specifically detected HIV-1 cDNA inside nuclei, but not in the cytoplasm. Nuclear cDNA initially co-localized with a fluorescent integrase fusion (IN-FP) and the viral CA (capsid) protein, but cDNA-punctae separated from IN-FP/CA over time. This phenotype was conserved in primary HIV-1 target cells, with nuclear HIV-1 complexes exhibiting strong CA-signals in all cell types. CLEM revealed cone-shaped HIV-1 capsid-like structures and apparently broken capsid-remnants at the position of IN-FP signals and elongated chromatin-like structures in the position of viral cDNA punctae lacking IN-FP. Our data argue for nuclear uncoating by physical disruption rather than cooperative disassembly of the CA-lattice, followed by physical separation from the pre-integration complex.</description>

	<description>Genetic tags allow rapid localization of tagged proteins in cells and tissues. APEX, an ascorbate peroxidase, has proven to be one of the most versatile and robust genetic tags for ultrastructural localization by electron microscopy. Here we describe a simple method, APEX-Gold, which converts the diffuse oxidized diaminobenzidine reaction product of APEX into a silver/gold particle akin to that used for immunogold labelling. The method increases the signal to noise ratio for EM detection, providing unambiguous detection of the tagged protein, and creates a readily quantifiable particulate signal. We demonstrate the wide applicability of this method for detection of membrane proteins, cytoplasmic proteins and cytoskeletal proteins. The method can be combined with different electron microscopic techniques including fast freezing and freeze substitution, focussed ion beam scanning electron microscopy, and electron tomography. Quantitation of expressed APEX-fusion proteins is achievable using membrane vesicles generated by a cell-free expression system. These membrane vesicles possess a defined quantum of signal, which can act as an internal standard for determination of the absolute density of expressed APEX-fusion proteins. Detection of fusion proteins expressed at low levels in cells from CRISPR-edited mice demonstrates the high sensitivity of the APEX-Gold method.</description>

	<title>eLife: Attenuated dopamine signaling after aversive learning is restored by ketamine to rescue escape actions</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64041</link>
	<description>Escaping aversive stimuli is essential for complex organisms, but prolonged exposure to stress leads to maladaptive learning. Stress alters neuronal activity and neuromodulatory signaling in distributed networks, modifying behavior. Here we describe changes in dopaminergic neuron activity and signaling following aversive learning in a learned helplessness paradigm in mice. A single dose of ketamine suffices to restore escape behavior after aversive learning. Dopaminergic neuron activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) systematically varies across learning, correlating with future sensitivity to ketamine treatment. Ketamine's effects are blocked by chemogenetic inhibition of dopamine signaling. Rather than directly altering the activity of dopaminergic neurons, ketamine appears to rescue dopamine dynamics through actions in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Chemogenetic activation of Drd1 receptor positive mPFC neurons mimics ketamine's effects on behavior. Together, our data link neuromodulatory dynamics in mPFC-VTA circuits, aversive learning, and the effects of ketamine.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63272</link>
	<description>Healthcare providers often underestimate patients' pain, sometimes even when aware of their reports. This could be the effect of experience reducing sensitivity to others pain, or distrust towards patients' self-evaluations. Across multiple experiments (375 participants), we tested whether senior medical students differed from younger colleagues and lay controls in the way they assess people's pain and take into consideration their feedback. We found that medical training affected the sensitivity to pain faces, an effect shown by the lower ratings and highlighted by a decrease in neural response of the insula and cingulate cortex. Instead, distrust towards the expressions' authenticity affected the processing of feedbacks, by decreasing activity in the ventral striatum whenever patients' self-reports matched participants' evaluations, and by promoting strong reliance on the opinion of other doctors. Overall, our study underscores the multiple processes which might influence the evaluation of others' pain at the early stages of medical career.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60994</link>
	<description>Output signals of neural circuits, including the retina, are shaped by a combination of excitatory and inhibitory signals. Inhibitory signals can act presynaptically on axon terminals to control neurotransmitter release and regulate circuit function. However, it has been difficult to study the role of presynaptic inhibition in most neural circuits due to lack of cell-type specific and receptor-type specific perturbations. In this study, we used a transgenic approach to selectively eliminate GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; inhibitory receptors from select types of second order neurons - bipolar cells - in mouse retina and examined how this affects the light response properties of the well-characterized ON alpha ganglion cell retinal circuit. Selective loss of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition causes an enhanced sensitivity and slower kinetics of light-evoked responses from ON alpha ganglion cells thus highlighting the role of presynaptic inhibition in gain control and temporal filtering of sensory signals in a key neural circuit in the mammalian retina.</description>

	<description>The specific circuit mechanisms through which anesthetics induce unconsciousness have not been completely characterized. We recorded neural activity from the frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices and thalamus while maintaining unconsciousness in non-human primates (NHPs) with the anesthetic propofol. Unconsciousness was marked by slow frequency (~1 Hz) oscillations in local field potentials, entrainment of local spiking to Up states alternating with Down states of little or no spiking activity, and decreased coherence in frequencies above 4 Hz. Thalamic stimulation ‘awakened’ anesthetized NHPs and reversed the electrophysiologic features of unconsciousness. Unconsciousness is linked to cortical and thalamic slow frequency synchrony coupled with decreased spiking, and loss of higher-frequency dynamics. This may disrupt cortical communication/integration.</description>

	<description>Some sea slugs sequester chloroplasts from algal food in their intestinal cells and photosynthesize for months. This phenomenon, kleptoplasty, poses a question of how the chloroplast retains its activity without the algal nucleus. There have been debates on the horizontal transfer of algal genes to the animal nucleus. To settle the arguments, this study reported the genome of a kleptoplastic sea slug, &lt;i&gt;Plakobranchus ocellatus&lt;/i&gt;, and found no evidence of photosynthetic genes encoded on the nucleus. Nevertheless, it was confirmed that light illumination prolongs the life of mollusk under starvation. These data presented a paradigm that a complex adaptive trait, as typified by photosynthesis, can be transferred between eukaryotic kingdoms by a unique organelle transmission without nuclear gene transfer. Our phylogenomic analysis showed that genes for proteolysis and immunity undergo gene expansion and are up-regulated in chloroplast-enriched tissue, suggesting that these molluskan genes are involved in the phenotype acquisition without horizontal gene transfer.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59809</link>
	<description>Oncogenes often promote cell death as well as proliferation. How oncogenes drive these diametrically opposed phenomena remains to be solved. A key question is whether cell death occurs as a response to aberrant proliferation signals or through a proliferation-independent mechanism. Here, we reveal that Src, the first identified oncogene, simultaneously drives cell proliferation and death in an obligatorily coupled manner through parallel MAPK pathways. The two MAPK pathways diverge from a lynchpin protein Slpr. A MAPK p38 drives proliferation whereas another MAPK JNK drives apoptosis independently of proliferation signals. Src-p38-induced proliferation is regulated by methionine-mediated Tor signaling. Reduction of dietary methionine uncouples the obligatory coupling of cell proliferation and death, suppressing tumorigenesis and tumor-induced lethality. Our findings provide an insight into how cells evolved to have a fail-safe mechanism that thwarts tumorigenesis by the oncogene Src. We also exemplify a diet-based approach to circumvent oncogenesis by exploiting the fail-safe mechanism.</description>

	<description>Many of the world's warm-blooded species are chronically infected with &lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/i&gt; tissue cysts, including an estimated one third of the global human population. The cellular processes that permit long-term persistence within the cyst are largely unknown for &lt;i&gt;T. gondii&lt;/i&gt; and related coccidian parasites that impact human and animal health. Herein we show that genetic ablation of &lt;i&gt;TgATG9&lt;/i&gt; substantially reduces canonical autophagy and compromises bradyzoite viability. Transmission electron microscopy revealed numerous structural abnormalities occurring in ∆&lt;i&gt;atg9 &lt;/i&gt;bradyzoites. Intriguingly, abnormal mitochondrial networks were observed in TgATG9-deficient bradyzoites, some of which contained numerous different cytoplasmic components and organelles. ∆&lt;i&gt;atg9 &lt;/i&gt;bradyzoite fitness was drastically compromised &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and in mice, with very few brain cysts identified in mice 5 weeks post-infection. Taken together, our data suggests that TgATG9, and by extension autophagy, is critical for cellular homeostasis in bradyzoites and is necessary for long-term persistence within the cyst of this coccidian parasite.</description>

	<description>Cortical interneurons establish inhibitory microcircuits throughout the neocortex and their dysfunction has been implicated in epilepsy and neuropsychiatric diseases. Developmentally, interneurons migrate from a distal progenitor domain in order to populate the neocortex - a process that occurs at a slower rate in humans than in mice. In this study, we sought to identify factors that regulate the rate of interneuron maturation across the two species. Using embryonic mouse development as a model system, we found that the process of initiating interneuron migration is regulated by blood vessels of the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), an interneuron progenitor domain. We identified two endothelial cell-derived paracrine factors, SPARC and SerpinE1, that enhance interneuron migration in mouse MGE explants and organotypic cultures. Moreover, pre-treatment of human stem cell-derived interneurons (hSC-interneurons) with SPARC and SerpinE1 prior to transplantation into neonatal mouse cortex enhanced their migration and morphological elaboration in the host cortex. Further, SPARC and SerpinE1-treated hSC-interneurons also exhibited more mature electrophysiological characteristics compared to controls. Overall, our studies suggest a critical role for CNS vasculature in regulating interneuron developmental maturation in both mice and humans.</description>

	<title>eLife: Quantitative analyses reveal extracellular dynamics of Wnt ligands in Xenopus embryos</title>

	<description>The mechanism of intercellular transport of Wnt ligands is still a matter of debate. To better understand this issue, we examined the distribution and dynamics of Wnt8 in &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; embryos. While Venus-tagged Wnt8 was found on the surfaces of cells close to Wnt-producing cells, we also detected its dispersal over distances of 15 cell diameters. A combination of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and quantitative imaging suggested that only a small proportion of Wnt8 ligands diffuses freely, whereas most Wnt8 molecules are bound to cell surfaces. Fluorescence decay after photoconversion showed that Wnt8 ligands bound on cell surfaces decrease exponentially, suggesting a dynamic exchange of bound forms of Wnt ligands. Mathematical modelling based on this exchange recapitulates a graded distribution of bound, but not free, Wnt ligands. Based on these results, we propose that Wnt distribution in tissues is controlled by a dynamic exchange of its abundant bound and rare free populations.</description>

Vaccine hesitancy is considered as one of the leading causes for the resurgence of vaccine preventable diseases. A non-negligible minority of parents does not fully adhere to the recommended vaccination schedule, leading their children to be partially immunized and at higher risk of contracting vaccine preventable diseases. Here, we leverage more than one million comments of 201,986 users posted from March 2008 to April 2019 on the public online forum BabyCenter US to learn more about such parents. For 32% with geographic location, we find the number of mapped users for each US state resembling the census population distribution with good agreement. We employ Natural Language Processing to identify 6884 and 10,131 users expressing their intention of following the recommended and alternative vaccination schedule, respectively RSUs and ASUs. From the analysis of their activity on the forum we find that ASUs have distinctly different interests and previous experiences with vaccination than RSUs. In particular, ASUs are more likely to follow groups focused on alternative medicine, are two times more likely to have experienced adverse events following immunization, and to mention more serious adverse reactions such as seizure or developmental regression. Content analysis of comments shows that the resources most frequently shared by both groups point to governmental domains (.gov). Finally, network analysis shows that RSUs and ASUs communicate between each other (indicating the absence of echo chambers), however with the latter group being more endogamic and favoring interactions with other ASUs. While our findings are limited to the specific platform analyzed, our approach may provide additional insights for the development of campaigns targeting parents on digital platforms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LUxN24a33jc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Efficient population coding depends on stimulus convergence and source of noise</title>

Sensory organs transmit information to downstream brain circuits using a neural code comprised of spikes from multiple neurons. According to the prominent efficient coding framework, the properties of sensory populations have evolved to encode maximum information about stimuli given biophysical constraints. How information coding depends on the way sensory signals from multiple channels converge downstream is still unknown, especially in the presence of noise which corrupts the signal at different points along the pathway. Here, we calculated the optimal information transfer of a population of nonlinear neurons under two scenarios. First, a lumped-coding channel where the information from different inputs converges to a single channel, thus reducing the number of neurons. Second, an independent-coding channel when different inputs contribute independent information without convergence. In each case, we investigated information loss when the sensory signal was corrupted by two sources of noise. We determined critical noise levels at which the optimal number of distinct thresholds of individual neurons in the population changes. Comparing our system to classical physical systems, these changes correspond to first- or second-order phase transitions for the lumped- or the independent-coding channel, respectively. We relate our theoretical predictions to coding in a population of auditory nerve fibers recorded experimentally, and find signatures of efficient coding. Our results yield important insights into the diverse coding strategies used by neural populations to optimally integrate sensory stimuli in the presence of distinct sources of noise.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uMJV6mqDdZg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The synchronized firings of active motor units (MUs) increase the oscillations of muscle force, observed as physiological tremors. This study aimed to investigate the effects of synchronizing the firings within three types of MUs (slow—S, fast resistant to fatigue–FR, and fast fatigable–FF) on the muscle force production using a mathematical model of the rat medial gastrocnemius muscle. The model was designed based on the actual proportion and physiological properties of MUs and motoneurons innervating the muscle. The isometric muscle and MU forces were simulated by a model predicting non-synchronized firing of a pool of 57 MUs (including 8 S, 23 FR, and 26 FF) to ascertain a maximum excitatory signal when all MUs were recruited into the contraction. The mean firing frequency of each MU depended upon the twitch contraction time, whereas the recruitment order was determined according to increasing forces (the size principle). The synchronization of firings of individual MUs was simulated using four different modes and inducing the synchronization of firings within three time windows (± 2, ± 4, and ± 6 ms) for four different combinations of MUs. The synchronization was estimated using two parameters, the correlation coefficient and the cross-interval synchronization index. The four scenarios of synchronization increased the values of the root-mean-square, range, and maximum force in correlation with the increase of the time window. Greater synchronization index values resulted in higher root-mean-square, range, and maximum of force outcomes for all MU types as well as for the whole muscle output; however, the mean spectral frequency of the forces decreased, whereas the mean force remained nearly unchanged. The range of variability and the root-mean-square of forces were higher for fast MUs than for slow MUs; meanwhile, the relative values of these parameters were highest for slow MUs, indicating their important contribution to muscle tremor, especially during weak contractions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MMvIEe796bA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The visual system is highly sensitive to spatial context for encoding luminance patterns. Context sensitivity inspired the proposal of many neural mechanisms for explaining the perception of luminance (brightness). Here we propose a novel computational model for estimating the brightness of many visual illusions. We hypothesize that many aspects of brightness can be explained by a dynamic filtering process that reduces the redundancy in edge representations on the one hand, while non-redundant activity is enhanced on the other. The dynamic filter is learned for each input image and implements context sensitivity. Dynamic filtering is applied to the responses of (model) complex cells in order to build a gain control map. The gain control map then acts on simple cell responses before they are used to create a brightness map via activity propagation. Our approach is successful in predicting many challenging visual illusions, including contrast effects, assimilation, and reverse contrast with the same set of model parameters.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VeY42W5-nio&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

What transpires soon after inhaling Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the respiratory virus causing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)? Where does infection begin? What are the features of subsequent virus spread? How might host responses quickly contain infection? Two recently published manuscripts have evaluated infection in primary cultures of well-differentiated cells to address these questions and bring more light on the proviral and antiviral components operating during the initial days after SARS-CoV-2 exposure.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/4eS0Sxaj6Ik&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Sacks, Randolph J. Noelle, Costantino Pitzalis, Robert I. Lechler, Giovanna Lombardi, Pablo D. Becker&lt;/p&gt;

Programmed death cell receptor 1 (PD-1) is expressed on T cells upon T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) is expressed in most tumor environments, and its binding to PD-1 on T cells drives them to apoptosis or into a regulatory phenotype. The fact that PD-L1 itself is also expressed on T cells upon activation has been largely neglected. Here, we demonstrate that PD-L1 ligation on human CD25-depleted CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, combined with CD3/TCR stimulation, induces their conversion into highly suppressive T cells. Furthermore, this effect was most prominent in memory (CD45RA&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;CD45RO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) T cells. PD-L1 engagement on T cells resulted in reduced ERK phosphorylation and decreased AKT/mTOR/S6 signaling. Importantly, T cells from rheumatoid arthritis patients exhibited high basal levels of phosphorylated ERK and following PD-L1 cross-linking both ERK signaling and the AKT/mTOR/S6 pathway failed to be down modulated, making them refractory to the acquisition of a regulatory phenotype. Altogether, our results suggest that PD-L1 signaling on memory T cells could play an important role in resolving inflammatory responses; maintaining a tolerogenic environment and its failure could contribute to ongoing autoimmunity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Z5vrkKoDlp4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Cell death is a vital event in life. Infections and injuries cause lytic cell death, which gives rise to danger signals that can further induce cell death, inflammation, and tissue damage. The mevalonate (MVA) pathway is an essential, highly conserved and dynamic metabolic pathway. Here, we discover that farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), a metabolic intermediate of the MVA pathway, functions as a newly identified danger signal to trigger acute cell death leading to neuron loss in stroke. Harboring both a hydrophobic 15-carbon isoprenyl chain and a heavily charged pyrophosphate head, FPP leads to acute cell death independent of its downstream metabolic pathways. Mechanistically, extracellular calcium influx and the cation channel transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) exhibit essential roles in FPP-induced cell death. FPP activates TRPM2 opening for ion influx. Furthermore, in terms of a mouse model constructing by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), FPP accumulates in the brain, which indicates the function of the FPP and TRPM2 danger signal axis in ischemic injury. Overall, our data have revealed a novel function of the MVA pathway intermediate metabolite FPP as a danger signal via transient receptor potential cation channels.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/22YzXyZQW3E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Viral diseases pose major threats to humans and other animals, including the billions of chickens that are an important food source as well as a public health concern due to zoonotic pathogens. Unlike humans and other typical mammals, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of chickens can confer decisive resistance or susceptibility to many viral diseases. An iconic example is Marek’s disease, caused by an oncogenic herpesvirus with over 100 genes. Classical MHC class I and class II molecules present antigenic peptides to T lymphocytes, and it has been hard to understand how such MHC molecules could be involved in susceptibility to Marek’s disease, given the potential number of peptides from over 100 genes. We used a new in vitro infection system and immunopeptidomics to determine peptide motifs for the 2 class II molecules expressed by the MHC haplotype B2, which is known to confer resistance to Marek’s disease. Surprisingly, we found that the vast majority of viral peptide epitopes presented by chicken class II molecules arise from only 4 viral genes, nearly all having the peptide motif for BL2*02, the dominantly expressed class II molecule in chickens. We expressed BL2*02 linked to several Marek’s disease virus (MDV) peptides and determined one X-ray crystal structure, showing how a single small amino acid in the binding site causes a crinkle in the peptide, leading to a core binding peptide of 10 amino acids, compared to the 9 amino acids in all other reported class II molecules. The limited number of potential T cell epitopes from such a complex virus can explain the differential MHC-determined resistance to MDV, but raises questions of mechanism and opportunities for vaccine targets in this important food species, as well as providing a basis for understanding class II molecules in other species including humans.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/qtXckE5WW1s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Memory retrieval dynamics and storage capacity of a modular network model of association cortex with featural decomposition. (arXiv:2104.11739v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11739</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The model network is composed of many modules. Each module represents an
assembly of recurrently connected neurons of a neocortical functional unit and
operates as a Hebbian autoassociator, storing a number of local configurations
of neuronal activity, or features, which it can recall upon cue. The global
memory patterns are made of specific combinations of features sparsely
distributed across the modules. Intermodular connections are modelled as a
finite-connectivity random graph. Any pair of features in any respective pair
of connected modules is allowed to be involved in several memory patterns; the
network dynamics is defined in such a way as to overcome the consequent
ambiguity of associations. The effects of a hypothetical mechanism of
long-range homeostatic synaptic scaling are also investigated.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dynamical process of cued retrieval almost saturates a natural upper
bound while producing negligible spurious activation. The extent of finite-size
effects on storage capacity is quantitatively evaluated. In the limit of
infinite size, the functional relationship between storage capacity and number
of features per module reduces to that which other authors found by methods
from equilibrium statistical mechanics, which suggests that the origin of the
functional form is fundamentally of combinatorial nature. In contrast with its
apparent inevitability at intramodular level, long-range synaptic scaling
results to be of minor relevance to both retrieval and storage capacity. A
conjecture is posited about how statistical fluctuation of coordination number
across the network may underpin spontaneous emergence of semantic hierarchies.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11700</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We present a novel weighted average model based on the mixture of experts
(MoE) concept to provide robustness in Federated learning (FL) against the
poisoned/corrupted/outdated local models. These threats along with the non-IID
nature of data sets can considerably diminish the accuracy of the FL model. Our
proposed MoE-FL setup relies on the trust between users and the server where
the users share a portion of their public data sets with the server. The server
applies a robust aggregation method by solving the optimization problem or the
Softmax method to highlight the outlier cases and to reduce their adverse
effect on the FL process. Our experiments illustrate that MoE-FL outperforms
the performance of the traditional aggregation approach for high rate of
poisoned data from attackers.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this review, we discuss critical dynamics of simple nonequilibrium models
on large connectomes, obtained by diffusion MRI, representing the white matter
of the human brain. In the first chapter, we overview graph theoretical and
topological analysis of these networks, pointing out that universality allows
selecting a representative network, the KKI-18, which has been used for
dynamical simulation. The critical and sub-critical behaviour of simple, two-
or three-state threshold models is discussed with special emphasis on
rare-region effects leading to robust Griffiths Phases (GP). Numerical results
of synchronization phenomena, studied by the Kuramoto model, are also shown,
leading to a continuous analog of the GP, termed frustrated synchronization in
Chimera states. The models presented here exhibit avalanche scaling behaviour
with exponents in agreement with brain experimental data if local homeostasis
is provided.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Plasticity circuits in the brain are known to be influenced by the
distribution of the synaptic weights through the mechanisms of synaptic
integration and local regulation of synaptic strength. However, the complex
interplay of stimulation-dependent plasticity with local learning signals is
disregarded by most of the artificial neural network training algorithms
devised so far. Here, we propose a novel biologically inspired optimizer for
artificial (ANNs) and spiking neural networks (SNNs) that incorporates key
principles of synaptic integration observed in dendrites of cortical neurons:
GRAPES (Group Responsibility for Adjusting the Propagation of Error Signals).
GRAPES implements a weight-distribution dependent modulation of the error
signal at each node of the neural network. We show that this biologically
inspired mechanism leads to a systematic improvement of the convergence rate of
the network, and substantially improves classification accuracy of ANNs and
SNNs with both feedforward and recurrent architectures. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that GRAPES supports performance scalability for models of
increasing complexity and mitigates catastrophic forgetting by enabling
networks to generalize to unseen tasks based on previously acquired knowledge.
The local characteristics of GRAPES minimize the required memory resources,
making it optimally suited for dedicated hardware implementations. Overall, our
work indicates that reconciling neurophysiology insights with machine
intelligence is key to boosting the performance of neural networks.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11410</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This study compares the modularity performance of two artificial neural
network architectures: a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent network, and
Morphognosis, a neural network based on a hierarchy of spatial and temporal
contexts. Mazes are used to measure performance, defined as the ability to
utilize independently learned mazes to solve mazes composed of them. A maze is
a sequence of rooms connected by doors. The modular task is implemented as
follows: at the beginning of the maze, an initial door choice forms a context
that must be retained until the end of an intervening maze, where the same door
must be chosen again to reach the goal. For testing, the door-association mazes
and separately trained intervening mazes are presented together for the first
time. While both neural networks perform well during training, the testing
performance of Morphognosis is significantly better than LSTM on this modular
task.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A substantial disadvantage of traditional learning is that all students
follow the same learning sequence, but not all of them have the same background
of knowledge, the same preferences, the same learning goals, and the same
needs. Traditional teaching resources, such as textbooks, in most cases pursue
students to follow fixed sequences during the learning process, thus impairing
their performance. Learning sequencing is an important research issue as part
of the learning process because no fixed learning paths will be appropriate for
all learners. For this reason, many research papers are focused on the
development of mechanisms to offer personalization on learning paths,
considering the learner needs, interests, behaviors, and abilities. In most
cases, these researchers are totally focused on the student's preferences,
ignoring the level of difficulty and the relation degree that exists between
various concepts in a course. This research paper presents the possibility of
constructing personalized learning paths using genetic algorithm-based model,
encountering the level of difficulty and relation degree of the constituent
concepts of a course. The experimental results shows that the genetic algorithm
is suitable to generate optimal learning paths based on learning object
difficulty level, duration, rating, and relation degree between each learning
object as elementary parts of the sequence of the learning path. From these
results compared to the quality of the traditional learning path, we observed
that even the quality of the weakest learning path generated by our GA approach
is in a favor compared to quality of the traditional learning path, with a
difference of 3.59\%, while the highest solution generated in the end resulted
8.34\% in favor of our proposal compared to the traditional learning paths.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Landmark-Aware and Part-based Ensemble Transfer Learning Network for Facial Expression Recognition from Static images. (arXiv:2104.11274v1 [cs.CV])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11274</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Facial Expression Recognition from static images is a challenging problem in
computer vision applications. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the
state-of-the-art method for various computer vision tasks, has had limited
success in predicting expressions from faces having extreme poses,
illumination, and occlusion conditions. To mitigate this issue, CNNs are often
accompanied by techniques like transfer, multi-task, or ensemble learning that
often provide high accuracy at the cost of high computational complexity. In
this work, we propose a Part-based Ensemble Transfer Learning network, which
models how humans recognize facial expressions by correlating the spatial
orientation pattern of the facial features with a specific expression. It
consists of 5 sub-networks, in which each sub-network performs transfer
learning from one of the five subsets of facial landmarks: eyebrows, eyes,
nose, mouth, or jaw to expression classification. We test the proposed network
on the CK+, JAFFE, and SFEW datasets, and it outperforms the benchmark for CK+
and JAFFE datasets by 0.51\% and 5.34\%, respectively. Additionally, it
consists of a total of 1.65M model parameters and requires only 3.28 $\times$
$10^{6}$ FLOPS, which ensures computational efficiency for real-time
deployment. Grad-CAM visualizations of our proposed ensemble highlight the
complementary nature of its sub-networks, a key design parameter of an
effective ensemble network. Lastly, cross-dataset evaluation results reveal
that our proposed ensemble has a high generalization capacity. Our model
trained on the SFEW Train dataset achieves an accuracy of 47.53\% on the CK+
dataset, which is higher than what it achieves on the SFEW Valid dataset.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a powerful approach for time series
prediction. However, their performance is strongly affected by their
architecture and hyperparameter settings. The architecture optimization of RNNs
is a time-consuming task, where the search space is typically a mixture of
real, integer and categorical values. To allow for shrinking and expanding the
size of the network, the representation of architectures often has a variable
length. In this paper, we propose to tackle the architecture optimization
problem with a variant of the Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm. To reduce
the evaluation time of candidate architectures the Mean Absolute Error Random
Sampling (MRS), a training-free method to estimate the network performance, is
adopted as the objective function for BO. Also, we propose three fixed-length
encoding schemes to cope with the variable-length architecture representation.
The result is a new perspective on accurate and efficient design of RNNs, that
we validate on three problems. Our findings show that 1) the BO algorithm can
explore different network architectures using the proposed encoding schemes and
successfully designs well-performing architectures, and 2) the optimization
time is significantly reduced by using MRS, without compromising the
performance as compared to the architectures obtained from the actual training
procedure.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Document information extraction tasks performed by humans create data
consisting of a PDF or document image input, and extracted string outputs. This
end-to-end data is naturally consumed and produced when performing the task
because it is valuable in and of itself. It is naturally available, at no
additional cost. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art word classification methods
for information extraction cannot use this data, instead requiring word-level
labels which are expensive to create and consequently not available for many
real life tasks. In this paper we propose the Attend, Copy, Parse architecture,
a deep neural network model that can be trained directly on end-to-end data,
bypassing the need for word-level labels. We evaluate the proposed architecture
on a large diverse set of invoices, and outperform a state-of-the-art
production system based on word classification. We believe our proposed
architecture can be used on many real life information extraction tasks where
word classification cannot be used due to a lack of the required word-level
labels.

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Gene4PD: A Comprehensive Genetic Database of Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.679568</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.679568</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with a strong genetic component. A growing number of variants and genes have been reported to be associated with PD; however, there is no database that integrate different type of genetic data, and support analyzing of PD-associated genes (PAGs). By systematic review and curation of multiple lines of public studies, we integrate multiple layers of genetic data (rare variants and copy-number variants identified from patients with PD, associated variants identified from genome-wide association studies, differentially expressed genes, and differential DNA methylation genes) and age at onset in PD. We integrated five layers of genetic data (8302 terms) with different levels of evidences from more than 3,000 studies and prioritized 124 PAGs with strong or suggestive evidences. These PAGs were identified to be significantly interacted with each other and formed an interconnected functional network enriched in several functional pathways involved in PD, suggesting these genes may contribute to the pathogenesis of PD. Furthermore, we identified 10 genes were associated with a juvenile-onset (age ≤ 30 years), 11 genes were associated with an early-onset (age of 30–50 years), whereas another 10 genes were associated with a late-onset (age &amp;gt; 50 years). Notably, the AAOs of patients with loss of function variants in five genes were significantly lower than that of patients with deleterious missense variants, while patients with VPS13C (P = 0.01) was opposite. Finally, we developed an online database named Gene4PD (http://genemed.tech/gene4pd) which integrated published genetic data in PD, the PAGs, and 63 popular genomic data sources, as well as an online pipeline for prioritize risk variants in PD. In conclusion, Gene4PD provides researchers and clinicians comprehensive genetic knowledge and analytic platform for PD, and would also improve the understanding of pathogenesis in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Velocity and Pulsatility Measures in the Perforating Arteries of the Basal Ganglia at 3T MRI in Reference to 7T MRI</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.665480</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.665480</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cerebral perforating artery flow velocity and pulsatility can be measured using 7 tesla (T) MRI. Enabling these flow metrics on more widely available 3T systems would make them more employable. It is currently unknown whether these measurements can be performed at 3T MRI due to the lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate if flow velocity and pulsatility in the perforating arteries of the basal ganglia (BG) can be measured at 3T MRI and assess the agreement with 7T MRI measurements as reference. Twenty-nine subjects were included, of which 14 patients with aortic coarctation [median age 29 years (21–72)] and 15 controls [median age 27 years (22–64)]. Using a cardiac-gated 2D phase-contrast MRI sequence BG perforating arteries were imaged at 3T and 7T MRI and perforating artery density (N&lt;sub&gt;density&lt;/sub&gt;, #/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), flow velocity (V&lt;sub&gt;mean&lt;/sub&gt;, cm/s) and pulsatility index (PI) were determined. Agreement between scanner modalities was assessed using correlation and difference plots with linear regression. A p-value ≤ 0.05 indicated statistical significance. It was shown that perforating artery flow velocity and pulsatility can be measured at 3T MRI (N&lt;sub&gt;density&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.21 ± 0.11; V&lt;sub&gt;mean&lt;/sub&gt; = 6.04 ± 1.27; PI = 0.49 ± 0.19), although values differed from 7T MRI measurements (N&lt;sub&gt;density&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.95 ± 0.21; V&lt;sub&gt;mean&lt;/sub&gt; = 3.89 ± 0.56; PI = 0.28 ± 0.08). The number of detected arteries was lower at 3T (5 ± 3) than 7T MRI (24 ± 6), indicating that 3T MRI is on average a factor 4.8 less sensitive to detect cerebral perforating arteries. Comparison with 7T MRI as reference showed some agreement in N&lt;sub&gt;density&lt;/sub&gt;, but little to no agreement for V&lt;sub&gt;mean&lt;/sub&gt; and PI. Equalizing the modalities’ sensitivity by comparing the detected arteries on 7T MRI with the highest velocity with all vessels detected on 3T MRI, showed some improvement in agreement for PI, but not for V&lt;sub&gt;mean&lt;/sub&gt;. This study shows that it is possible to measure cerebral perforating artery flow velocity and pulsatility at 3T MRI, although an approximately fivefold sample size is needed at 3T relative to 7T MRI for a given effect size, and the measurements should be performed with equal scanner field strength and protocol.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Neuroprotective Effects of Fingolimod Supplement on the Retina and Optic Nerve in the Mouse Model of Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.663541</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.663541</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Favorable effects exerted by long-term administration of fingolimod therapy in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients have been reported, but sporadic side effects, such as reversible macular edema, also have been recorded. The present study aimed to determine whether fingolimod therapy is beneficial to the visual system in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice. A decrease in demyelination and axon loss in the optic nerve as well as cellular infiltration, especially the recruited macrophages, was observed in EAE with fingolimod treatment. Fingolimod administration diminished hypergliosis of macroglia, including astrocytes and Müller cells in the retina and optic nerve in EAE. Microglia were hyperactivated in the retina and optic nerve in the EAE mice compared to controls, which could be alleviated by fingolimod treatment. Moreover, apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) and oligodendrocytes in the optic nerve was significantly reduced with fingolimod treatment compared to that in the untreated EAE mice. These results suggested that fingolimod exerts neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects on the retina and optic nerve in a mouse model of EAE. Considering the paradox of favorable and side effects of fingolimod on visual system, we speculate that side effects including macular oedema caused by fingolimod during MS treatment is tendency to be vasogenic rather than hypergliosis in optic nerve and retina which warrants further neuroophthalmological investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Synaptic Effect of Aδ-Fibers by Pulse-Train Electrical Stimulation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.643448</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Electrical stimulation of specific small fibers (Aδ- and C-fibers) is used in basic studies on nociception and neuropathic pain and to diagnose neuropathies. For selective stimulation of small fibers, the optimal stimulation waveform parameters are an important aspect together with the study of electrode design. However, determining an optimal stimulation condition is challenging, as it requires the characterization of the response of the small fibers to electrical stimulation. The perception thresholds are generally characterized using single-pulse stimulation based on the strength-duration curve. However, this does not account for the temporal effects of the different waveforms used in practical applications. In this study, we designed an experiment to characterize the effects of multiple pulse stimulation and proposed a computational model that considers electrostimulation of fibers and synaptic effects in a multiscale model. The measurements of perception thresholds showed that the pulse dependency of the threshold was an exponential decay with a maximum reduction of 55%. In addition, the frequency dependence of the threshold showed a U-shaped response with a reduction of 25% at 30 Hz. Moreover, the computational model explained the synaptic effects, which were also confirmed by evoked potential recordings. This study further characterized the activation of small fibers and clarified the synaptic effects, demonstrating the importance of waveform selection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Safety and Tolerability of Burst-Cycling Deep Brain Stimulation for Freezing of Gait in Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.651168</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.651168</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Freezing of gait (FOG) is a common symptom in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and can be difficult to treat with dopaminergic medications or with deep brain stimulation (DBS). Novel stimulation paradigms have been proposed to address suboptimal responses to conventional DBS programming methods. Burst-cycling deep brain stimulation (BCDBS) delivers current in various frequencies of bursts (e.g., 4, 10, or 15 Hz), while maintaining an intra-burst frequency identical to conventional DBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of BCDBS in PD patients with FOG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Ten PD subjects with STN or GPi DBS and complaints of FOG were recruited for this single center, single blinded within-subject crossover study. For each subject, we compared 4, 10, and 15 Hz BCDBS to conventional DBS during the PD medication-OFF state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: There were no serious adverse events with BCDBS. It was feasible and straightforward to program BCDBS in the clinic setting. The benefit was comparable to conventional DBS in measures of FOG, functional mobility and in PD motor symptoms. BCDBS had lower battery consumption when compared to conventional DBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: BCDBS was feasible, safe and well tolerated and it has potential to be a viable future DBS programming strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Short-Term Immobilization Promotes a Rapid Loss of Motor Evoked Potentials and Strength That Is Not Rescued by rTMS Treatment</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.640642</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Short-term limb immobilization results in skeletal muscle decline, but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. This study aimed to determine the neurophysiologic basis of immobilization-induced skeletal muscle decline, and whether repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) could prevent any decline. Twenty-four healthy young males (20 ± 0.5 years) underwent unilateral limb immobilization for 72 h. Subjects were randomized between daily rTMS (n = 12) using six 20 Hz pulse trains of 1.5 s duration with a 60 s inter-train-interval delivered at 90% resting Motor Threshold (rMT), or Sham rTMS (n = 12) throughout immobilization. Maximal grip strength, EMG activity, arm volume, and composition were determined at 0 and 72 h. Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs) were determined daily throughout immobilization to index motor excitability. Immobilization induced a significant reduction in motor excitability across time (−30% at 72 h; p &amp;lt; 0.05). The rTMS intervention increased motor excitability at 0 h (+13%, p &amp;lt; 0.05). Despite daily rTMS treatment, there was still a significant reduction in motor excitability (−33% at 72 h, p &amp;lt; 0.05), loss in EMG activity (−23.5% at 72 h; p &amp;lt; 0.05), and a loss of maximal grip strength (−22%, p &amp;lt; 0.001) after immobilization. Interestingly, the increase in biceps (Sham vs. rTMS) (+0.8 vs. +0.1 mm, p &amp;lt; 0.01) and posterior forearm (+0.3 vs. +0.0 mm, p &amp;lt; 0.05) skinfold thickness with immobilization in Sham treatment was not observed following rTMS treatment. Reduced MEPs drive the loss of strength with immobilization. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation cannot prevent this loss of strength but further investigation and optimization of neuroplasticity protocols may have therapeutic benefit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Altered Inhibitory Mechanisms in Parkinson’s Disease: Evidence From Lexical Decision and Simple Reaction Time Tasks</title>

	<description>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Although the motor signs of Parkinson’s disease (PD) are well defined, nonmotor symptoms, including higher-level language deficits, have also been shown to be frequent in patients with PD. In the present study, we used a lexical decision task (LDT) to find out whether access to the mental lexicon is impaired in patients with PD, and whether task performance is affected by bradykinesia.&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;Participants were 34 nondemented patients with PD, either without (off) medication (n = 16) or under optimum (on) medication (n = 18). A total of 19 age-matched control volunteers were also recruited. We recorded reaction times (RTs) to the LDT and a simple RT (control) task. In each task, stimuli were either visual or auditory. Statistical analyses consisted of repeated-measures analyses of variance and Tukey’s HSD post hoc tests.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;In the LDT, participants with PD both off and on medication exhibited intact access to the mental lexicon in both modalities. In the visual modality, patients off medication were just as fast as controls when identifying real words, but slower when identifying pseudowords. In the visual modality of the control task, RTs for pseudowords were significantly longer for PD patients off medication than for controls, revealing an unexpected but significant lexicality effect in patients that was not observed in the auditory modality. Performances of patients on medication did not differ from those of age-matched controls.&lt;/p&gt;Discussion&lt;p&gt;Motor execution was not slowed in patients with PD either off or on medication, in comparison with controls. Regarding lexical access, patients off medication seemed to (1) have difficulty inhibiting a cognitive-linguistic process (i.e., reading) when it was not required (simple reaction time task), and (2) exhibit a specific pseudoword processing deficit in the LDT, which may have been related to impaired lateral word inhibition within the mental lexicon. These deficits seemed to be compensated by medication.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Cholinergic and Noradrenergic Modulation of Corticothalamic Synaptic Input From Layer 6 to the Posteromedial Thalamic Nucleus in the Rat</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cholinergic and noradrenergic neuromodulation of the synaptic transmission from cortical layer 6 of the primary somatosensory cortex to neurons in the posteromedial thalamic nucleus (PoM) was studied using an in vitro slice preparation from young rats. Cholinergic agonist carbachol substantially decreased the amplitudes of consecutive excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) evoked by a 20 Hz five pulse train. The decreased amplitude effect was counteracted by a parallel increase of synaptic frequency-dependent facilitation. We found this modulation to be mediated by muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. In the presence of carbachol the amplitudes of the postsynaptic potentials showed a higher trial-to-trial coefficient of variation (CV), which suggested a presynaptic site of action for the modulation. To substantiate this finding, we measured the failure rate of the excitatory postsynaptic currents in PoM cells evoked by “pseudominimal” stimulation of corticothalamic input. A higher failure-rate in the presence of carbachol indicated decreased probability of transmitter release at the synapse. Activation of the noradrenergic modulatory system that was mimicked by application of norepinephrine did not affect the amplitude of the first EPSP evoked in the five-pulse train, but later EPSPs were diminished. This indicated a decrease of the synaptic frequency-dependent facilitation. Treatment with noradrenergic α-2 agonist clonidine, α-1 agonist phenylephrine, or β-receptor agonist isoproterenol showed that the modulation may partly rely on α-2 adrenergic receptors. CV analysis did not suggest a presynaptic action of norepinephrine. We conclude that cholinergic and noradrenergic modulation act as different variable dynamic controls for the corticothalamic mechanism of the frequency-dependent facilitation in PoM.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Specialized Pro-resolving Lipid Mediators and Glial Cells: Emerging Candidates for Brain Homeostasis and Repair</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes and oligodendrocytes are known to play critical roles in the central nervous system development, homeostasis and response to injury. In addition to their well-defined functions in synaptic signaling, blood-brain barrier control and myelination, it is now becoming clear that both glial cells also actively produce a wide range of immune-regulatory factors and engage in an intricate communication with neurons, microglia or with infiltrated immune cells, thus taking a center stage in both inflammation and resolution processes occurring within the brain. Resolution of inflammation is operated by the superfamily of specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs), that include lipoxins, resolvins, protectins and maresins, and that altogether activate a series of cellular and molecular events that lead to spontaneous regression of inflammatory processes and restoration of tissue homeostasis. Here, we review the manifold effects of SPMs on modulation of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, along with the mechanisms through which they either inhibit inflammatory pathways or induce the activation of protective ones. Furthermore, the possible role of SPMs in modulating the cross-talk between microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes is also summarized. This SPM-mediated mechanism uncovers novel pathways of immune regulation in the brain that could be further exploited to control neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to reliably repair spinal cord injuries (SCI) will be one of the greatest human achievements realized in regenerative medicine. Until recently, the cellular path to this goal has been challenging. However, as detailed developmental principles are revealed in mouse and human models, their application in the stem cell community brings trunk and spine embryology into efforts to advance human regenerative medicine. New models of posterior embryo development identify neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) as a major bifurcation point in generating the spinal cord and somites and is leading to production of cell types with the full range of axial identities critical for repair of trunk and spine disorders. This is coupled with organoid technologies including assembloids, circuitoids, and gastruloids. We describe a paradigm for applying developmental principles towards the goal of cell-based restorative therapies to enable reproducible and effective near-term clinical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Blood Oxygenation Level-Dependent Response to Multiple Grip Forces in Multiple Sclerosis: Going Beyond the Main Effect of Movement in Brodmann Area 4a and 4p</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.616028</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This study highlights the importance of looking beyond the main effect of movement to study alterations in functional response in the presence of central nervous system pathologies such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Data show that MS selectively affects regional BOLD (blood oxygenation level dependent) responses to variable grip forces (GF). It is known that the anterior and posterior BA 4 areas (BA 4a and BA 4p) are anatomically and functionally distinct. It has also been shown in healthy volunteers that there are linear (first order, typical of BA 4a) and nonlinear (second to fourth order, typical of BA 4p) BOLD responses to different levels of GF applied during a dynamic motor paradigm. After modeling the BOLD response with a polynomial expansion of the applied GFs, the particular case of BA 4a and BA 4p were investigated in healthy volunteers (HV) and MS subjects. The main effect of movement (zeroth order) analysis showed that the BOLD signal is greater in MS compared with healthy volunteers within both BA 4 subregions. At higher order, BOLD-GF responses were similar in BA 4a but showed a marked alteration in BA 4p of MS subjects, with those with greatest disability showing the greatest deviations from the healthy response profile. Therefore, the different behaviors in HV and MS could only be uncovered through a polynomial analysis looking beyond the main effect of movement into the two BA 4 subregions. Future studies will investigate the source of this pathophysiology, combining the present fMRI paradigm with blood perfusion and nonlinear neuronal response analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Association Between sTREM2, an Immune Biomarker of Microglial Activation, and Aging-Related Brain Volume Changes in Community-Dwelling Older Adults: A 7-Year Follow-Up Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.665612</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.665612</link>
	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to investigate the association between serum levels of soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2), a soluble form of an innate immune receptor expressed on the microglia, and brain volume in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The survey was conducted twice in Kurokawa-cho, Imari, Saga Prefecture, Japan, among people aged 65 years and older. We collected data from 596 residents. Serum sTREM2 level measurements, brain MRI, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and clinical dementia rating (CDR) were performed at Time 1 (2009–2011). Follow-up brain MRI, MMSE, and CDR were performed at Time 2 (2016–2017). The interval between Time 1 and Time 2 was approximately 7 years. Sixty-nine participants (16 men, mean age 72.69 ± 3.18 years; 53 women, mean age 72.68 ± 4.64 years) completed this study. We analyzed the correlation between serum sTREM2 levels (Time 1) and brain volume (Time 1, Time 2, and Time 1–Time 2 difference) using voxel-based morphometry implemented with Statistical Parametric Mapping.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Participants in this study had lower MMSE and higher CDR scores 7 years after the baseline evaluation. However, analyses at the cluster level by applying multiple comparison corrections (family wise error; P &amp;lt; 0.05) showed no correlation between serum sTREM2 levels and volume of different brain regions, either cross-sectional or longitudinal.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Serum sTREM2 level could not serve as an immune biomarker of aging-related volume changes in brain regions closely related to cognitive function in older adults aged 65 years and above.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Surgery Performed Under Propofol Anesthesia Induces Cognitive Impairment and Amyloid Pathology in ApoE4 Knock-In Mouse Model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.658860</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.658860</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) following anesthesia and surgery is a common and severe complication, especially in elderly patients. A pre-existing cognitive impairment may impart susceptibility to further cognitive dysfunction; the mechanism remains unclear. We hypothesized that the specific impacts of anesthesia and surgery on individuals with preclinical Alzheimer’s disease (AD) may render them more susceptible to an increase in the risk of cognitive impairment. The aim of this study was to compare the cognitive impairment between normal adult mice and those with preclinical AD after propofol anesthesia and surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We performed abdominal surgery in cognitively pre-symptomatic, 5-month-old male mice with sporadic AD (apolipoprotein E4 allele, ApoE4-KI) and age-matched (C57BL/6J) controls. Propofol anesthesia (170 mg/kg) was induced via retro-orbital injection over 2 h. Morris water maze (MWM) and Y-maze tests were conducted 2 days before and 2, 4, and 7 days after surgery. The mean escape latencies and spontaneous alternation percentages were the major outcomes. Neuronal apoptosis in hippocampal sections was evaluated using the terminal dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Hippocampal amyloid beta (Aβ) levels were assessed via quantitative immunohistochemistry (IHC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The control mice exhibited increased mean escape latencies of MWM at postoperative 2 and 4, but not at day 7; ApoE4-KI mice exhibited such increases at postoperative days 2, 4 and 7. Significant differences between ApoE4-KI and control mice in terms of the mean escape latencies were evident at days 2 and 7 (both P &amp;lt; 0.05). However, performance on a non-hippocampal memory tasks (Y-maze test) did not differ. More TUNEL-positive neurons were evident in the hippocampal CA3 region of ApoE4-KI mice at postoperative days 2 and 4, but not at day 7 compared to the control group (both P &amp;lt; 0.05). IHC revealed significantly elevated Aβ deposition in the hippocampal CA3 region of ApoE4-KI mice at postoperative days 4 and 7 compared to control mice (both P &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Propofol anesthesia followed by surgery induced persistent changes in cognition, and pathological hippocampal changes in pre-symptomatic, but vulnerable AD mice. It would be appropriate to explore whether preclinical AD patients are more vulnerable to POCD development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Bones in the vertebrate cranial base and limb skeleton grow by endochondral ossification, under the control of growth plates. Mechanisms of endochondral ossification are conserved across growth plates, which increases covariation in size and shape among bones, and in turn may lead to correlated changes in skeletal traits not under direct selection. We used micro-CT and geometric morphometrics to characterize shape changes in the cranium of the Longshanks mouse, which was selectively bred for longer tibiae. We show that Longshanks skulls became longer, flatter, and narrower in a stepwise process. Moreover, we show that these morphological changes likely resulted from developmental changes in the growth plates of the Longshanks cranial base, mirroring changes observed in its tibia. Thus, indirect and non-adaptive morphological changes can occur due to developmental overlap among distant skeletal elements, with important implications for interpreting the evolutionary history of vertebrate skeletal form.</description>

	<title>eLife: Defects in translation-dependent quality control pathways lead to convergent molecular and neurodevelopmental pathology</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66904</link>
	<description>Translation-dependent quality control pathways such as no-go decay (NGD), non-stop decay (NSD), and nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) govern protein synthesis and proteostasis by resolving non-translating ribosomes and preventing the production of potentially toxic peptides derived from faulty and aberrant mRNAs. However, how translation is altered and the in vivo defects that arise in the absence of these pathways are poorly understood. Here, we show that the NGD/NSD factors &lt;i&gt;Pelo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Hbs1l&lt;/i&gt; are critical in mice for cerebellar neurogenesis but expendable for survival of these neurons after development. Analysis of mutant mouse embryonic fibroblasts revealed translational pauses, alteration of signaling pathways, and translational reprogramming. Similar effects on signaling pathways, including mTOR activation, the translatome and mouse cerebellar development were observed upon deletion of the NMD factor &lt;i&gt;Upf2&lt;/i&gt;. Our data reveal that these quality control pathways that function to mitigate errors at distinct steps in translation can evoke similar cellular responses.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66706</link>
	<description>Detecting danger is key to the survival and success of all species. Animal nervous and immune systems cooperate to optimize danger detection. Preceding studies have highlighted the benefits of bringing neurons into the defense game, including regulation of immune responses, wound healing, pathogen control, and survival. Here, we summarize the body of knowledge in neuroimmune communication and assert that neuronal participation in the immune response is deeply beneficial in each step of combating infection, from inception to resolution. Despite the documented tight association between the immune and nervous systems in mammals or invertebrate model organisms, interdependence of these two systems is largely unexplored across metazoans. This review brings a phylogenetic perspective of the nervous and immune systems in the context of danger detection and advocates for the use of non-model organisms to diversify the field of neuroimmunology. We identify key taxa that are ripe for investigation due to the emergence of key evolutionary innovations in their immune and nervous systems. This novel perspective will help define the primordial principles that govern neuroimmune communication across taxa.</description>

	<title>eLife: Probing the decision-making mechanisms underlying choice between drug and nondrug rewards in rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.64993</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64993</link>
	<description>Delineating the decision-making mechanisms underlying choice between drug and nondrug rewards remains a challenge. This study adopts an original approach to probe these mechanisms by comparing response latencies during sampling versus choice trials. While lengthening of latencies during choice is predicted in a deliberative choice model (DCM), the race-like response competition mechanism postulated by the Sequential choice model (SCM) predicts a shortening of latencies during choice compared to sampling. Here, we tested these predictions by conducting a retrospective analysis of cocaine-versus-saccharin choice experiments conducted in our laboratory. We found that rats engage deliberative decision-making mechanisms after limited training, but adopt a SCM-like response selection mechanism after more extended training, while their behavior is presumably habitual. Thus, the DCM and SCM may not be general models of choice, as initially formulated, but could be dynamically engaged to control choice behavior across early and extended training.</description>

	<title>eLife: Trading mental effort for confidence in the metacognitive control of value-based decision-making</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63282</link>
	<description>Why do we sometimes opt for actions or items that we do not value the most? Under current neurocomputational theories, such preference reversals are typically interpreted in terms of errors that arise from the unreliable signaling of value to brain decision systems. But, an alternative explanation is that people may change their mind because they are reassessing the value of alternative options while pondering the decision. So, why do we carefully ponder some decisions, but not others? In this work, we derive a computational model of the metacognitive control of decisions or MCD. In brief, we assume that fast and automatic processes first provide initial (and largely uncertain) representations of options' values, yielding prior estimates of decision difficulty. These uncertain value representations are then refined by deploying cognitive (e.g., attentional, mnesic) resources, the allocation of which is controlled by an effort-confidence tradeoff. Importantly, the anticipated benefit of allocating resources varies in a decision-by-decision manner according to the prior estimate of decision difficulty. The ensuing MCD model predicts response time, subjective feeling of effort, choice confidence, changes of mind, and choice-induced preference change and certainty gain. We test these predictions in a systematic manner, using a dedicated behavioral paradigm. Our results provide a quantitative link between mental effort, choice confidence, and preference reversals, which could inform interpretations of related neuroimaging findings.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Neuronal Dystroglycan regulates postnatal development of CCK/cannabinoid receptor-1 interneurons</title>

	<description>The development of functional neural circuits requires the precise formation of synaptic connections between diverse neuronal populations. The molecular pathways that allow GABAergic interneuron subtypes in the mammalian brain to recognize their postsynaptic partners remain largely unknown. The transmembrane glycoprotein Dystroglycan is localized to inhibitory synapses in pyramidal neurons, where it is required for the proper function of CCK+ interneurons. We show that deletion of Dystroglycan from pyramidal neurons selectively impairs CCK+ interneuron development during the first postnatal week. In the absence of postsynaptic Dystroglycan, presynaptic CCK+ interneurons fail to elaborate their axons and largely disappear from the cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and olfactory bulb. Bax deletion did not rescue CCK+ interneurons, suggesting that they are not eliminated by canonical apoptosis in Dystroglycan mutants. Rather, we observed an increase in CCK+ interneuron innervation of the striatum, suggesting that the remaining CCK+ interneurons re-directed their axons to neighboring areas where Dystroglycan expression remained intact.

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Dysregulation of NRSF/REST via EHMT1 is association with psychiatric disorders</title>

	<description>Genetic evidence indicates disrupted epigenetic regulation as a major risk factor for psychiatric disorders, but the molecular mechanisms that drive this association are undetermined. EHMT1 is an epigenetic repressor that is causal for Kleefstra Syndrome (KS), a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) leading to ID, and is associated with schizophrenia. Here, we show that reduced EHMT1 activity decreases NRSF/REST protein leading to abnormal neuronal gene expression and progression of neurodevelopment in human iPSC. We further show that EHMT1 regulates NRSF/REST indirectly via repression of miRNA leading to aberrant neuronal gene regulation and neurodevelopment timing. Expression of a NRSF/REST mRNA that lacks the miRNA-binding sites restores neuronal gene regulation to EHMT1 deficient cells. Importantly, the EHMT1-regulated miRNA gene set with elevated expression is enriched for NRSF/REST regulators with an association for ID and schizophrenia. This reveals a molecular interaction between H3K9 dimethylation and NSRF/REST contributing to the aetiology of psychiatric disorders.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Dorsal striatum and the temporal expectancy of an aversive event in Pavlovian odor fear learning</title>

	<description>Interval timing, the ability to encode and retrieve the memory of intervals from seconds to minutes, guides fundamental animal behaviors across the phylogenetic tree. In Pavlovian fear conditioning, an initially neutral stimulus (conditioned stimulus, CS) predicts the arrival of an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US, generally a mild foot-shock) at a fixed time interval. Although some studies showed that temporal relations between CS and US events are learned from the outset of conditioning, the question of the memory of time and its underlying neural network in fear conditioning is still poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of the dorsal striatum in timing intervals in odor fear conditioning in male rats. To assess the animal's interval timing ability in this paradigm, we used the respiratory frequency. This enabled us to detect the emergence of temporal patterns related to the odor-shock time interval from the early stage of learning, confirming that rats are able to encode the odor-shock time interval after few training trials. We carried out reversible inactivation of the dorsal striatum before the acquisition session and before a shift in the learned time interval, and measured the effects of this treatment on the temporal pattern of the respiratory rate. In addition, using intracerebral microdialysis, we monitored extracellular dopamine level in the dorsal striatum throughout odor-shock conditioning and in response to a shift of the odor-shock time interval. Contrary to our initial predictions based on the existing literature on interval timing, we found evidence suggesting that transient inactivation of the dorsal striatum may favor a more precocious buildup of the respiratory frequency's temporal pattern during the odor-shock interval in a manner that reflected the duration of the interval. Our data further suggest that the conditioning and the learning of a novel time interval were associated with a decrease in dopamine level in the dorsal striatum, but not in the nucleus accumbens. These findings prompt a reassessment of the role of the striatum and striatal dopamine in interval timing, at least when considering Pavlovian aversive conditioning.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The role of frontal cortex in multisensory decisions</title>

	<description>To interpret the world and make accurate perceptual decisions, the brain must combine information across sensory modalities. For instance, it must combine vision and hearing to localize objects based on their image and sound. Probability theory suggests that evidence from multiple independent cues should be combined additively, but it is unclear whether mice and other mammals do this, and the cortical substrates of multisensory integration are uncertain. Here we show that to localize a stimulus, mice combine auditory and visual spatial cues additively, a computation supported by unisensory processing in auditory and visual cortex and additive multisensory integration in frontal cortex. We developed an audiovisual localization task where mice turn a wheel to indicate the joint position of an image and a sound. Scanning optogenetic inactivation of dorsal cortex showed that auditory and visual areas contribute unisensory information, whereas frontal cortex (secondary motor area, MOs) contributes multisensory information to the decision of the mouse. Neuropixels recordings of &amp;gt;10,000 neurons in frontal cortex indicated that neural activity in MOs reflects an additive combination of visual and auditory signals. An accumulator model applied to the sensory representations of MOs neurons reproduced behaviourally observed choices and reaction times. This suggests that MOs integrates information from multiple sensory cortices, providing a signal that is then transformed into a binary decision by a downstream accumulator.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Functional coupling between target selection and acquisition in the superior colliculus</title>

	<description>To survive in unpredictable environments, animals must continuously evaluate their surroundings for behavioral targets, such as food and shelter, and direct their movements to acquire those targets. Although the ability to accurately select and acquire spatial targets depends on a shared network of brain regions, how these processes are linked by neural circuits remains unknown. The superior colliculus (SC) mediates the selection of spatial targets and remains active during orienting movements to acquire targets, which suggests the underexamined possibility that common SC circuits underie both selection and acquisition processes. Here, we test the hypothesis that SC functional circuitry couples target selection and acquisition using a default motor plan generated by selection-related neuronal activity. Single-unit recordings from intermediate and deep layer SC neurons in male mice performing a spatial choice task demonstrated that choice-predictive neurons, including optogenetically identified GABAergic SC neurons whose activity was causally related to target selection, exhibit increased activity during movement to the target. By strategically recording from both rostral and caudal SC neurons, we also revealed an overall caudal-to-rostral shift in activity as targets were acquired. Finally, we used an attractor model to examine how target selection activity in the SC could generate a rostral shift in activity during target acquisition using only intrinsic SC circuitry. Overall, our results suggest a functional coupling between SC circuits that underlie target selection and acquisition, elucidating a key mechanism for goal-directed behavior.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: High-sensitivity detection of facial features on MRI brain scans with a convolutional network</title>

	<description>Platforms and institutions that support MRI data sharing need to ensure that identifiable facial features are not present in shared images. Currently, this assessment requires manual effect as no automated tools exist that can efficiently and accurately detect if an image has been defaced. The scarcity of publicly available data with preserved facial features, as well as the meager incentives to create such a cohort privately, have averted the development of face-detection models. Here, we introduce a framework to detect whether an input MRI brain scan has been defaced, with the ultimate goal of streamlining it within the submission protocols of MRI data archiving and sharing platforms. We present a binary (defaced/nondefaced) classifier based on a custom convolutional neural network architecture. We train the model on 980 defaced MRI scans from 36 different studies that are publicly available at OpenNeuro.org. To overcome the unavailability of nondefaced examples, we augment the dataset by inpainting synthetic faces into each training image. We show the adequacy of such a data augmentation in a cross-validation evaluation. We demonstrate the performance estimated with cross-validation matches that of an evaluation on a held-out dataset (N=581) preserving real faces, and obtain accuracy/sensitivity/specificity scores of 0.978/0.983/0.972, respectively. Data augmentations are key to boosting the performance of models bounded by limited sample sizes and insufficient diversity. Our model contributes towards developing classifiers with ~100% sensitivity detecting faces, which is crucial to ensure that no identifiable data are inadvertently made public.</description>

	<description>The brain performs various cognitive functions by learning the spatiotemporal salient features of the environment. This learning likely requires unsupervised segmentation of hierarchically organized spike sequences, but the underlying neural mechanism is only poorly understood. Here, we show that a recurrent gated network of neurons with dendrites can context-dependently solve difficult segmentation tasks. Dendrites in this model learn to predict somatic responses in a self-supervising manner while recurrent connections learn a context-dependent gating of dendro-somatic current flows to minimize a prediction error. These connections select particular information suitable for the given context from input features redundantly learned by the dendrites. The model selectively learned salient segments in complex synthetic sequences. Furthermore, the model was also effective for detecting multiple cell assemblies repeating in large-scale calcium imaging data of more than 6,500 cortical neurons. Our results suggest that recurrent gating and dendrites are crucial for cortical learning of context-dependent segmentation tasks.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The microRNA miR-18a links proliferation and inflammation during photoreceptor regeneration in the injured zebrafish retina</title>

	<description>In mammals, photoreceptor loss causes permanent blindness, but in zebrafish (Danio rerio), Muller glia function as intrinsic stem cells, producing progenitor cells that regenerate photoreceptors and restore vision. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) critically regulate neurogenesis in the brain and retina, but the roles of miRNAs in injury-induced neuronal regeneration are largely unknown. The miRNA miR-18a regulates photoreceptor differentiation in the embryonic retina. The purpose of the current study was to determine the function of miR-18a during injury-induced photoreceptor regeneration. RT-qPCR, in-situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed that miR-18a expression increases throughout the retina by 1-day post-injury (dpi) and continues to increase through 5 dpi. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling showed that at 7 and 10 dpi, when regenerated photoreceptors are normally differentiating, there are more proliferating Muller glia-derived progenitors in homozygous miR-18a mutant (miR-18ami5012) retinas compared with wild type (WT), indicating that miR-18a negatively regulates injury-induced proliferation. At 7 and 10 dpi, miR-18ami5012 retinas have fewer mature photoreceptors than WT, but there is no difference at 14 dpi, revealing that photoreceptor regeneration is delayed. BrdU labeling showed that the excess progenitors in miR-18ami5012 retinas migrate to other retinal layers besides the photoreceptor layer. Inflammation is critical for photoreceptor regeneration and RT-qPCR showed that, in the absence of miR-18a, inflammation is prolonged. Suppressing inflammation with dexamethasone rescues the miR-18ami5012 phenotype. Together, these data show that during injury-induced photoreceptor regeneration, miR-18a regulates proliferation and photoreceptor regeneration by regulating key aspects of the inflammatory response during photoreceptor regeneration in zebrafish.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The nematode worm C. elegans chooses between bacterial foods exactly as if maximizing economic utility</title>

	<description>In value-based decision making, options are selected according to subjective values assigned by the individual to available goods and actions. Despite the importance of this faculty of the mind, the neural mechanisms of value assignments, and how choices are directed by them, remain obscure. To investigate this problem, we used a classic measure of utility maximization, the Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preference, to quantify internal consistency of food preferences in Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode worm with a nervous system of only 302 neurons. Using a novel combination of microfluidics and electrophysiology, we found that C. elegans food choices fulfill the necessary and sufficient conditions for utility maximization, indicating that nematodes behave exactly as if they maintain, and attempt to maximize, an underlying representation of subjective value. Food choices are well-fit by a utility function widely used to model human consumers. Moreover, as in many other animals, subjective values in C. elegans are learned, a process we now find requires intact dopamine signaling. Differential responses of identified chemosensory neurons to foods with distinct growth potential are amplified by prior consumption of these foods, suggesting that these neurons may be part of a value-assignment system. The demonstration of utility maximization in an organism with a nervous system of only 302 neurons sets a new lower bound on the computational requirements for its execution, and offers the prospect of an essentially complete explanation of value-based decision making at single neuron resolution.</description>

	<description>Converging evidence indicates that response inhibition may arise from the interaction of effortful proactive and reflexive reactive mechanisms. However, the distinction between the neural basis sustaining proactive and reactive inhibitory processes is still unclear. To identify reliable neural markers of proactive inhibition, we examined the behavioral and electrophysiological correlates elicited by manipulating the degree of inhibitory control in a task that involved the detection and amendment of errors. Restraining or encouraging the correction of errors did not affect the time course of the behavioral and neural correlates associated to reactive inhibition. We rather found that a bilateral and sustained decrease of corticomotor excitability was required for an effective proactive inhibitory control, whereas selective strategies were associated with defective response suppression. Our results provide behavioral and electrophysiological conclusive evidence of a comprehensive proactive inhibitory mechanism, with a distinctive underlying neural basis, governing the commission and amendment of errors. Together, these findings hint at a decisive role for changes in corticomotor excitability in determining whether an action will be successfully suppressed.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Interneuronal dynamics facilitate the initiation of cortical spreading depression</title>

	<description>Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is thought to precede migraine attacks with aura and is characterized by a slowly traveling wave of inactivity through cortical pyramidal cells. During CSD, pyramidal cells experience hyperexcitation with rapidly increasing firing rates, major changes in electrochemistry, and ultimately spike block that propagates slowly across the cortex. While the identifying characteristic of CSD is the pyramidal cell hyperexcitation and subsequent spike block, it is currently unknown how the dynamics of the cortical microcircuits and inhibitory interneurons affect the initiation of CSD. We tested the contribution of cortical inhibitory interneurons to the initiation of spike block using a cortical microcircuit model that takes into account changes in ion concentrations that result from neuronal firing. Our results show that interneuronal inhibition provides a wider dynamic range to the circuit and generally improves stability against spike block. Despite these beneficial effects, strong interneuronal firing contributed to rapidly changing extracellular ion concentrations, which facilitated hyperexcitation and led to spike block first in the interneuron and then in the pyramidal cell. In all cases, a loss of interneuronal firing triggered pyramidal cell spike block. However, preventing interneuronal spike block was insufficient to rescue the pyramidal cell from spike block. Our data thus demonstrate that while the role of interneurons in cortical microcircuits is complex, they are critical to the initiation of pyramidal cell spike block and CSD. We discuss the implications that localized effects on cortical interneurons have beyond the isolated microcircuit.</description>

	<description>Aging is a process that adversely affects brain functions such as cognitive behaviors. Brain activity is a high-energy consumption process. Glucose serves as the main energy source under normal circumstances. Whether the dynamics of glucose metabolism during aging remains unchanged is not well understood. This study sought to investigate the activity-dependent changes in glucose metabolism of the mouse hippocampus during aging. In brief, after one hour of contextual exploration in an enriched environmental condition or one hour in a familiar home cage condition, metabolites were measured from the hippocampus of both adult and aged mice with metabolomic profiling. Compared to the home cage context, the enriched contextual exploration condition resulted in changes in the concentration of 11 glucose metabolism-related metabolites in the adult hippocampus. In contrast, glucose metabolism-related metabolite changes were more apparent in the aged group during contextual exploration when compared to those in the home cage condition. Importantly, in the aged groups, several key metabolites involved in glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and ketone body metabolism accumulated, suggesting the less efficient metabolization of glucose-based energy resources. Altogether, the analyses revealed that in the aged mice during enriched contextual exploration, the glucose resource seems to be unable to provide enough energy for hippocampal function.</description>

	<description>Background: Neuroplastic processes are influenced by selective serotonergic reuptake inhibitors, while learning in conjunction with the administration of serotonergic agents alters white matter microstructure in humans. The goal of this double-blind, placebo-controlled imaging study was to investigate the influence of escitalopram on white matter plasticity during (re)learning. Methods: Seventy-one healthy individuals (age = 25.6+/-5.0, 43 females) underwent 3 diffusion magnetic resonance imaging sessions: at baseline, after 3-weeks of associative learning (emotional/non-emotional content) and after relearning shuffled associations for an additional 3 weeks. During the relearning phase, subjects received daily escitalopram 10 mg or placebo orally. Data were analyzed using the FMRIB Software Library (FSL) and the implemented Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) approach. Results: The TBSS analysis revealed widespread decreases in fractional anisotropy metrics in subjects that received escitalopram. In addition, axial diffusivity decreases were mainly found in the corpus callosum and in areas within the internal capsule. In subjects receiving placebo, we did not find such effects, nor did our results show diffusivity changes related to learning or relearning. Conclusion: Diffusivity changes were found within several tracts in the escitalopram group, while we observed no changes in the placebo group. Although previous studies examining the effects of SSRIs on white matter tracts in humans are underrepresented, our results suggest a relationship between serotonergic agents and diffusivity parameters. The findings of this study implicate that escitalopram may directly or indirectly impact white matter microstructures in healthy subjects. Nevertheless, we did not find a relationship between serotonergic modulation, neuroplastic effects and relearning.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The neuroinflammatory interleukin-12 signaling pathway drives Alzheimer's disease-like pathology by perturbing oligodendrocyte survival and neuronal homeostasis</title>

	<description>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by deposition of pathological amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) and tau protein aggregates and involves chronic neuroinflammation, ultimately leading to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Central in AD-related neuroinflammation is the proinflammatory interleukin-12 (IL-12)/IL-23 signaling pathway whose inhibition has been shown to attenuate pathology and cognitive defects in AD-like mice. In order to explore which cell types are involved in this neuroinflammatory cascade, we used single-nuclei RNA sequencing in AD-like APPPS1 mice lacking or harboring IL-12/IL-23 signaling. We found Il12b transcripts encoding the common p40 subunit of IL-12/IL-23 signaling to be expressed preferentially, but not exclusively, in microglia in an AD-specific manner. In contrast, transcripts for the other subunits of the IL-12 signaling pathway were expressed constitutively in neurons and oligodendrocytes irrespective of AD pathology, while transcripts for IL-23 were almost undetectable. Notably, genetic ablation of IL-12/IL-23 signaling did not affect the inflammatory gene expression profile of the AD-specific disease associated microglia (DAM), but reversed the loss of mature myelin-producing oligodendrocytes and alterations in neuronal homeostasis in APPPS1 mice. Taken together, our results reveal that IL-12, but not IL-23 is the main driver of AD-specific IL-12/IL-23 neuroinflammation, which alters neuronal and oligodendrocyte functions. Given that drugs targeting IL-12 already exist, our data may foster first clinical trials in AD subjects using this novel neuroimmune target.</description>

	<description>Background and Objectives: The neural mechanism that enables the recovery of consciousness in patients with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) remains unclear. The aim of the current study is to characterize the cortical hub regions related to the recovery of consciousness in patients with UWS. Methods: Voxel-wise degree centrality analysis was adopted to identify the cortical hubs related to the recovery of consciousness, for which a total of 27 UWS patients were used, including 13 patients who emerged from UWS (UWS-E), and 14 patients who remained in UWS (UWS-R) at least three months after the experiment performance. Furthermore, other recoverable unconscious states including three independent deep sleep datasets (n = 12, 9, 9 respectively) and three independent anesthesia datasets (n = 27, 14, 6 respectively) were adopted as validation groups. Spatial similarity of the hub characteristic with the validation groups between the UWS-E and UWS-R was compared using the dice coefficient. Finally, with the cortical regions persistently shown as hubs across UWS-E and validation states, functional connectivity analysis was further performed to explore the connectivity patterns underlying the recovery of consciousness. Results: Four cortical hubs were identified with significantly higher degree centrality for UWS-E than UWS-R, including the anterior precuneus, left inferior parietal lobule, left inferior frontal gyrus, and left middle frontal gyrus, of which the degree centrality value also positively correlated with the patients' Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score. Furthermore, the anterior precuneus was found to show significantly higher similarity of hub characteristics as well as functional connectivity pattern between UWS-E and validation groups, compared with UWS-R. Discussion: The results suggest that the recovery of consciousness may be relevant to the integrity of cortical hubs, especially the anterior precuneus. The identified cortical hub regions could serve as potential targets for noninvasive stimulation aimed at promoting the patients' consciousness recovery.</description>

	<description>We propose a novel method to estimate the instantaneous oscillatory phase to implement a real-time system for closed-loop sensory stimulation in electroencephalography (EEG) experiments. The method uses Kalman filter-based prediction to estimate current and future EEG signals. We tested the performance of our method in a real-time situation. We demonstrate that the performance of our method shows higher accuracy in predicting the EEG phase than the conventional autoregressive model-based method. A Kalman filter allows us to easily estimate the instantaneous phase of EEG oscillations based on the automatically estimated autoregressive model implemented in a real-time signal processing machine. The proposed method has a potential for versatile applications targeting the modulation of EEG phase dynamics and the plasticity of brain networks in relation to perceptual or cognitive functions.</description>

	<description>Lewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy neurites are pathological hallmarks of Parkinsons disease and other progressive neurodegenerative disorders known as Lewy body diseases (LBD). These proteinaceous deposits are immunopositive for alpha-synuclein (aSyn) and several other proteins, as neurofilament components. The structural organization and composition of aSyn inclusions is still unclear and needs to be addressed in greater detail, as this may open novel avenues for our understanding of the disease-relevant pathological events. In this study, we investigated the molecular architecture of aSyn inclusions, both in cell models and in human brain tissue, using state-of-art super resolution X10 Expansion microscopy (ExM). This approach physically expands specimens embedded into a swellable gel, preserving their biological information. Then, the specimen can be analyzed using standard epifluorescence microscopes, thereby obtaining nanoscale information. The combination of different cell models, mouse and human brain tissue enabled us to distinguish different types aSyn assemblies (e.g. ring shape or tubular structures), and a conserved pattern of aSyn inclusions surrounded/encaged by intermediate filament proteins. Overall, X10 ExM enabled us to gain insight into the architecture and biology of aSyn inclusions and constitutes a powerful tool in the quest to understanding underlying disease mechanisms in synucleinopathies.</description>

	<description>Peripersonal space (PPS) is the region of space surrounding the body. It has a dedicated multisensory-motor representation, whose purpose is to predict and plan interactions with the environment, and which can vary depending on environmental circumstances. Here, we investigated the effect on the PPS representation of an experimentally induced stress response. We assessed PPS representation in healthy humans, before and after a stressful manipulation, by quantifying visuotactile interactions as a function of the distance from the body, while monitoring salivary cortisol concentration. Participants, who showed a cortisol stress response, presented enhanced visuotactile integration for stimuli close to the body and reduced for far stimuli. Conversely, individuals, with a less pronounced cortisol response, showed a reduced difference in visuotactile integration between the near and the far space. In our interpretation, physiological stress resulted in a freezing-like response, where multisensory-motor resources are allocated only to the area immediately surrounding the body.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: LAG3 is not expressed in human and murine neurons and does not modulate α-synucleinopathies</title>

	<description>While the initial pathology of Parkinson's disease and other -synucleinopathies is often confined to circumscribed brain regions, it can spread and progressively affect adjacent and distant brain locales. This process may be controlled by cellular receptors of -synuclein fibrils, one of which was proposed to be the LAG3 immune checkpoint molecule. Here, we analyzed the expression pattern of LAG3 in human and mouse brains. Using a variety of methods and model systems, we found no evidence for LAG3 expression by neurons. While we confirmed that LAG3 interacts with -synuclein fibrils, the specificity of this interaction appears limited. Moreover, overexpression of LAG3 in cultured human neural cells did not cause any worsening of -synuclein pathology ex vivo. The overall survival of A53T -synuclein transgenic mice was unaffected by LAG3 depletion and the seeded induction of -synuclein lesions in hippocampal slice cultures was unaffected by LAG3 knockout. These data suggest that the proposed role of LAG3 in the spreading of -synucleinopathies might not be universally valid.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Geraniol Enhances Inhibitory Inputs to Paraventricular Thalamic Nucleus and Induces Sedation in Mice</title>

	<description>Geraniol (GE), a plant-derived acyclic monoterpene, shows a wide variety of beneficial effects. Notably, recent studies have reported the potential sedative effects of GE in fish and rats. However, the mechanisms of GE in sedation remain elusive. Here, we found that GE reduced locomotion, relieved pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures, altered the electroencephalogram (EEG), and facilitated general anesthesia in mice. Meanwhile, GE decreased c-Fos expression and suppressed the calcium activity in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT). Microinjection of GE into the PVT reduced locomotion and facilitated propofol-induced anesthesia. Furthermore, the electrophysiology results showed that GE-induced dramatic membrane hyperpolarization and suppressed the neuronal activity of PVT neurons, mainly by prolonging spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents and inducing tonic inhibitory currents via GABAA receptors. Our study revealed that GE enhances inhibitory inputs to PVT neurons and induces sedation in mice. These findings provide a potential candidate for further development of sedatives and anesthetics.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Beyond linear dynamic functional connectivity: a vine copula change point model</title>

	<description>To estimate dynamic functional connectivity for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, two approaches have dominated: sliding window and change point methods. While computationally feasible, the sliding window approach has several limitations. In addition, the existing change point methods assume a Gaussian distribution for and linear dependencies between the fMRI time series. In this work, we introduce a new methodology called Vine Copula Change Point (VCCP) to estimate change points in the functional connectivity network structure between brain regions. It uses vine copulas, various state-of-the-art segmentation methods to identify multiple change points, and a likelihood ratio test or the stationary bootstrap for inference. The vine copulas allow for various forms of dependence between brain regions including tail, symmetric and asymmetric dependence, which has not been explored before in the analysis of neuroimaging data. We apply VCCP to various simulation data sets and to two fMRI data sets: a reading task and an anxiety inducing experiment. In particular, for the former data set, we illustrate the complexity of textual changes during the reading of Chapter 9 in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone and find that change points across subjects are related to changes in more than one type of textual attributes. Further, the graphs created by the vine copulas indicate the importance of working beyond Gaussianity and linear dependence. Finally, the R package vccp implementing the methodology from the paper is available from CRAN.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: How adaptation, training, and customization contribute to benefits from exoskeleton assistance</title>

	<description>Exoskeletons can enhance human mobility, but we still know little about why they are effective. For example, we do not know the relative importance of training, how much is required, or what type is most effective; how people adapt with the device; or the relative benefits of customizing assistance. We conducted experiments in which naive users learned to walk with ankle exoskeletons under one of three training regimens characterized by different levels of variation in device behavior. Assistance was also customized for one group. Following moderate-variation training, the benefits of customized assistance were large; metabolic rate was reduced by 39% compared to walking with the exoskeleton turned off. Training contributed about half of this benefit and customization about one quarter; a generic controller reduced energy cost by 10% before training and 31% afterwards. Training required much more exposure than typical of exoskeleton studies, about 109 minutes of assisted walking. Type of training also had a strong effect; the low-variation group required twice as long as the moderate-variation group to become expert, while the high-variation group never acquired this level of expertise. Curiously, all users adapted in a way that resulted in less mechanical power from the exoskeleton as they gained expertise. Customizing assistance required less time than training for all parameters except peak torque magnitude, which grew slowly over the study, suggesting a longer time-scale adaptation in the person. These results underscore the importance of training to the benefits of exoskeleton assistance and suggest the topic deserves more attention.</description>

	<description>Working memory (WM) extends the duration over which information is available for processing. Given its importance in supporting a wide-array of high level cognitive abilities, uncovering the neural mechanisms that underlie WM has been a primary goal of neuroscience research over the past century. Here, we critically review what we consider the two major arcs of inquiry, with a specific focus on findings that were theoretically transformative. For the first arc, we briefly review classic studies that led to the canonical WM theory that cast the prefrontal cortex (PFC) as a central player utilizing persistent activity of neurons as a mechanism for memory storage. We then consider recent challenges to the theory regarding the role of persistent neural activity. The second arc, which evolved over the last decade, stemmed from sophisticated computational neuroimaging approaches enabling researchers to decode the contents of WM from the patterns of neural activity in many parts of the brain including early visual cortex. We summarize key findings from these studies, their implications for WM theory, and finally the challenges these findings pose. A comprehensive theory of WM will require a unification of these two arcs of research.</description>

	<description>There are typical neurons in the intermediate and deep layers of the optic tectum of avian, which are sensitive to small continuous moving targets. Based on this sensitivity of these neurons to continuous moving targets, the hypothesis of directed energy accumulation in dendrite field of these neurons is proposed. Based on the phenomenon that single dendrite activation can induce somatic spikes in vitro, the hypothesis of sequential probability activation mechanism of soma is proposed. Combined with the above hypotheses, the information encoding model of these typical neurons is constructed. Moreover, electrophysiological experiments and model simulations are carried out to obtain the response of neurons to visual stimuli of sequential motion, random motion and random sequential motion. Results show that the encoding model fits the response properties of continuous motion-sensitive neurons well. This study is of great significance for understanding the neurophysiological process of small-target perception for avian tectofugal pathway and the construction of the brain-inspired small-target detection algorithm.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Hippocampal gamma-band oscillopathy in a mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome</title>

	<description>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability arising from the loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), a protein that plays a central role in neuronal function and plasticity. FXS patients show sensory hypersensitivity, hyperarousal and hippocampus-dependent learning deficits that can be recapitulated in the FMR1 KO mice. Enhanced metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) signaling and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) signaling in the FMR1 KO mouse are implicated as the primary causes of the disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, glutamatergic kainate receptor (KAR) function is reduced in the cortex of the FMR1 KO mice. Of note, activation of these signaling pathways leads to slow gamma-range oscillations in the hippocampus in vitro and abnormal gamma oscillations have been reported in FMR1 KO mice and patients with FXS. Thus, we hypothesized that aberrant activation of these receptors leads to the observed gamma oscillopathy. We recorded gamma oscillations induced by either cholinergic agonist carbachol (CCh), mGluR1/5 agonist Dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) or ionotropic glutamatergic agonist KA from the hippocampal CA3 in WT and FMR1 KO mice in vitro. We show a specific increase in the power of DHPG- and CCh-induced gamma oscillations and reduction in the synchronicity of gamma oscillations induced by KA. We further elucidate an aberrant spiking activity during CCh-induced and kainate-induced gamma oscillations which may underlie the altered gamma oscillation synchronization in the FMR1 KO mice. Last, we also noted a reduced incidence of spontaneously-occurring hippocampal sharp wave-ripple events. Our study provides further evidence for aberrant hippocampal rhythms in the FMR1 KO mice and identifies potential signaling pathways underlying gamma band oscillopathy in FXS.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Effects of non-invasive brain stimulation on visual perspective taking: A meta-analytic study</title>

	<description>Visual perspective taking (VPT) is a critical ability required by complex social interaction. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has been increasingly used to examine the causal relationship between brain activity and VPT, yet with heterogeneous results. In the current study, we conducted two meta-analyses to examine the effects of NIBS of the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) or dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) on VPT, respectively. We performed a comprehensive literature search to identify qualified studies, and computed the standardized effect size (ES) for each combination of VPT level (Level-1: visibility judgment; Level-2: mental rotation) and perspective (self and other). Twelve studies (rTPJ: 11 studies, 20 ESs; dmPFC: 4 studies, 18 ESs) were included in the meta-analyses. Random-effects models were used to generate the overall effects. Subgroup analyses for distinct VPT conditions were also performed. We found that stimulation of rTPJ significantly improved participants' visibility judgment from the allocentric perspective, whereas dmPFC stimulation mainly influenced Level-1 performance from the egocentric perspective. For both areas, the effects of stimulation on Level-2 performance are negligible. These findings suggest that the rTPJ and dmPFC are involved in basic allocentric and egocentric perspective-taking processes, respectively. Notably, contrary to some theoretical models, neither of them appears to be necessary for more complex VPT with a higher requirement of mental rotation. These findings may help clarify the causal roles of the rTPJ and dmPFC in VPT and emphasize the importance of specifying VPT conditions in experimental designs.</description>

	<description>Smart brain implants will revolutionize neurotechnology for improving the quality of life in patients with brain disorders. The treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) with neural implants for deep brain stimulation presents an avenue for developing machine-learning based individualized treatments to refine human motor control. We developed an optimized movement decoding approach to predict grip-force based on sensorimotor electrocorticography and subthalamic local field potentials in PD. We demonstrate that electrocorticography combined with Bayesian optimized extreme gradient boosted decision trees outperform other machine learning approaches. We elucidate a link between dopamine and movement coding capacity in PD, by showing negative correlations between decoding performance and motor symptom severity in the medication OFF state. Finally, we introduce an approach that leverages wholebrain connectomics to predict machine-learning based decoding performance in invasive neurophysiology. Our study provides a framework to aid development of intelligent adaptive deep brain stimulation.</description>

	<description>The antidepressant effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) is related to increased neuroplasticity during relearning. Stress-induced dendritic atrophy in key brain areas for learning and memory such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex is reversed by SSRI treatment. This finding is accompanied by behavioral stabilization. The aim of this study was to investigated serotonergic modulation effects on structural neuroplasticity (cortical thickness, subcortical volumes) during relearning in healthy subjects. Participants performed daily associative learning tasks over 3 weeks followed by a 3-week relearning phase combined with intake of the SSRI escitalopram or placebo. Evidence suggests that SSRIs promote the brains susceptibility to change on the basis of environment factors. We found no effect of SSRI on grey matter measures during relearning. Here, non-findings might be a consequence of the implemented intensity and duration of study interventions. With sparse literature on healthy participants in this field, future studies will have to further elucidate SSRIs properties on relearning and structural neuroplasticity.</description>

	<description>Sensory neurons not only encode stimuli that align with their receptive fields but are also modulated by context. For example, the responses of neurons in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) to gratings of their preferred orientation are modulated by the presence of superimposed orthogonal gratings (plaids). The effects of this modulation can be diverse: some neurons exhibit cross-orientation suppression while other neurons have larger responses to a plaid than its components. We investigated whether these diverse forms of masking could be explained by a unified circuit mechanism. We report that the suppression of cortical activity does not alter the effects of masking, ruling out cortical mechanisms. Instead, we demonstrate that the heterogeneity of plaid responses is explained by an interaction between stimulus geometry and orientation tuning. Highly selective neurons uniformly exhibit cross-orientation suppression, whereas in weakly-selective neurons masking depends on the spatial configuration of the stimulus, with effects transitioning systematically between suppression and facilitation. Thus, the diverse responses of mouse V1 neurons emerge as a consequence of the spatial structure of the afferent input to V1, with no need to invoke cortical interactions.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Orientation and color tuning of the human visual gamma rhythm</title>

	<description>Narrowband gamma oscillations (NBG: ~20-60Hz) in visual cortex reflect rhythmic fluctuations in population activity generated by underlying circuits tuned for stimulus location, orientation, and color. Consequently, the amplitude and frequency of induced NBG activity is highly sensitive to these stimulus features. For example, in the non-human primate, NBG displays biases in orientation and color tuning at the population level. Such biases may relate to recent reports describing the large-scale organization of single-cell orientation and color tuning in visual cortex, thus providing a potential bridge between measurements made at different scales. Similar biases in NBG population tuning have been predicted to exist in the human visual cortex, but this has yet to be fully examined. Using intracranial recordings from human visual cortex, we investigated the tuning of NBG to orientation and color, both independently and in conjunction. NBG was shown to display a cardinal orientation bias (horizontal) and also an end- and mid-spectral color bias (red/blue and green). When jointly probed, the cardinal bias for orientation was attenuated and an end-spectral preference for red and blue predominated. These data both elaborate on the close, yet complex, link between the population dynamics driving NBG oscillations and known feature selectivity biases in visual cortex, adding to a growing set of stimulus dependencies associated with the genesis of NBG. Together, these two factors may provide a fruitful testing ground for examining multi-scale models of brain activity, and impose new constraints on the functional significance of the visual gamma rhythm.</description>

Human gait analysis is often conducted in clinical and basic research, but many common approaches (e.g., three-dimensional motion capture, wearables) are expensive, immobile, data-limited, and require expertise. Recent advances in video-based pose estimation suggest potential for gait analysis using two-dimensional video collected from readily accessible devices (e.g., smartphones). To date, several studies have extracted features of human gait using markerless pose estimation. However, we currently lack evaluation of video-based approaches using a dataset of human gait for a wide range of gait parameters on a stride-by-stride basis and a workflow for performing gait analysis from video. Here, we compared spatiotemporal and sagittal kinematic gait parameters measured with OpenPose (open-source video-based human pose estimation) against simultaneously recorded three-dimensional motion capture from overground walking of healthy adults. When assessing all individual steps in the walking bouts, we observed mean absolute errors between motion capture and OpenPose of 0.02 s for temporal gait parameters (i.e., step time, stance time, swing time and double support time) and 0.049 m for step lengths. Accuracy improved when spatiotemporal gait parameters were calculated as individual participant mean values: mean absolute error was 0.01 s for temporal gait parameters and 0.018 m for step lengths. The greatest difference in gait speed between motion capture and OpenPose was less than 0.10 m s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Mean absolute error of sagittal plane hip, knee and ankle angles between motion capture and OpenPose were 4.0°, 5.6° and 7.4°. Our analysis workflow is freely available, involves minimal user input, and does not require prior gait analysis expertise. Finally, we offer suggestions and considerations for future applications of pose estimation for human gait analysis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/r-92OwQVJvo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Many cell types display the remarkable ability to alter their cellular phenotype in response to specific external or internal signals. Such phenotypic plasticity is apparent in the nematode &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; when adverse environmental conditions trigger entry into the dauer diapause stage. This entry is accompanied by structural, molecular, and functional remodeling of a number of distinct tissue types of the animal, including its nervous system. The transcription factor (TF) effectors of 3 different hormonal signaling systems, the insulin-responsive DAF-16/FoxO TF, the TGFβ-responsive DAF-3/SMAD TF, and the steroid nuclear hormone receptor, DAF-12/VDR, a homolog of the vitamin D receptor (VDR), were previously shown to be required for entering the dauer arrest stage, but their cellular and temporal focus of action for the underlying cellular remodeling processes remained incompletely understood. Through the generation of conditional alleles that allowed us to spatially and temporally control gene activity, we show here that all 3 TFs are not only required to initiate tissue remodeling upon entry into the dauer stage, as shown before, but are also continuously required to maintain the remodeled state. We show that DAF-3/SMAD is required in sensory neurons to promote and then maintain animal-wide tissue remodeling events. In contrast, DAF-16/FoxO or DAF-12/VDR act cell-autonomously to control anatomical, molecular, and behavioral remodeling events in specific cell types. Intriguingly, we also uncover non-cell autonomous function of DAF-16/FoxO and DAF-12/VDR in nervous system remodeling, indicating the presence of several insulin-dependent interorgan signaling axes. Our findings provide novel perspectives into how hormonal systems control tissue remodeling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/KCzeoM6J2mE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Receptor-mediated yolk uptake is required for &lt;i&gt;oskar&lt;/i&gt; mRNA localization and cortical anchorage of germ plasm components in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; oocyte</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Tsubasa Tanaka, Naoki Tani, Akira Nakamura&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; germ plasm is responsible for germ cell formation. Its assembly begins with localization of &lt;i&gt;oskar&lt;/i&gt; mRNA to the posterior pole of the oocyte. The &lt;i&gt;oskar&lt;/i&gt; translation produces 2 isoforms with distinct functions: short Oskar recruits germ plasm components, whereas long Oskar remodels actin to anchor the components to the cortex. The mechanism by which long Oskar anchors them remains elusive. Here, we report that Yolkless, which facilitates uptake of nutrient yolk proteins into the oocyte, is a key cofactor for long Oskar. Loss of Yolkless or depletion of yolk proteins disrupts the microtubule alignment and &lt;i&gt;oskar&lt;/i&gt; mRNA localization at the posterior pole of the oocyte, whereas microtubule-dependent localization of &lt;i&gt;bicoid&lt;/i&gt; mRNA to the anterior and &lt;i&gt;gurken&lt;/i&gt; mRNA to the anterior-dorsal corner remains intact. Furthermore, these mutant oocytes do not properly respond to long Oskar, causing defects in the actin remodeling and germ plasm anchoring. Thus, the yolk uptake is not merely the process for nutrient incorporation, but also crucial for &lt;i&gt;oskar&lt;/i&gt; mRNA localization and cortical anchorage of germ plasm components in the oocyte.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/4hWUnG5Fu1E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Avoiding organelle mutational meltdown across eukaryotes with or without a germline bottleneck</title>

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and plastid DNA (ptDNA) encode vital bioenergetic apparatus, and mutations in these organelle DNA (oDNA) molecules can be devastating. In the germline of several animals, a genetic “bottleneck” increases cell-to-cell variance in mtDNA heteroplasmy, allowing purifying selection to act to maintain low proportions of mutant mtDNA. However, most eukaryotes do not sequester a germline early in development, and even the animal bottleneck remains poorly understood. How then do eukaryotic organelles avoid Muller’s ratchet—the gradual buildup of deleterious oDNA mutations? Here, we construct a comprehensive and predictive genetic model, quantitatively describing how different mechanisms segregate and decrease oDNA damage across eukaryotes. We apply this comprehensive theory to characterise the animal bottleneck with recent single-cell observations in diverse mouse models. Further, we show that gene conversion is a particularly powerful mechanism to increase beneficial cell-to-cell variance without depleting oDNA copy number, explaining the benefit of observed oDNA recombination in diverse organisms which do not sequester animal-like germlines (for example, sponges, corals, fungi, and plants). Genomic, transcriptomic, and structural datasets across eukaryotes support this mechanism for generating beneficial variance without a germline bottleneck. This framework explains puzzling oDNA differences across taxa, suggesting how Muller’s ratchet is avoided in different eukaryotes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/mrvsEqfgoh4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The overarching trend in mitochondrial genome evolution is functional streamlining coupled with gene loss; therefore, gene acquisition by mitochondria is considered to be exceedingly rare. Selfish elements in the form of self-splicing introns occur in many organellar genomes, but the wider diversity of selfish elements, and how they persist in the DNA of organelles, has not been explored. In the mitochondrial genome of a marine heterotrophic katablepharid protist, we identify a functional type II restriction modification (RM) system originating from a horizontal gene transfer (HGT) event involving bacteria related to flavobacteria. This RM system consists of an HpaII-like endonuclease and a cognate cytosine methyltransferase (CM). We demonstrate that these proteins are functional by heterologous expression in both bacterial and eukaryotic cells. These results suggest that a mitochondrial-encoded RM system can function as a toxin–antitoxin selfish element and that such elements could be co-opted by eukaryotic genomes to drive biased organellar inheritance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/z_T8RqQw6hU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as energy-efficient neural
networks with temporal information. SNNs have shown a superior efficiency on
neuromorphic devices, but the devices are susceptible to noise, which hinders
them from being applied in real-world applications. Several studies have
increased noise robustness, but most of them considered neither deep SNNs nor
temporal information. In this paper, we investigate the effect of noise on deep
SNNs with various neural coding methods and present a noise-robust deep SNN
with temporal information. With the proposed methods, we have achieved a deep
SNN that is efficient and robust to spike deletion and jitter.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural cryptography is the application of artificial neural networks in the
subject of cryptography. The functionality of this solution is based on a tree
parity machine. It uses artificial neural networks to perform secure key
exchange between network entities. This article proposes improvements to the
synchronization of two tree parity machines. The improvement is based on
learning artificial neural network using input vectors which have a wider range
of values than binary ones. As a result, the duration of the synchronization
process is reduced. Therefore, tree parity machines achieve common weights in a
shorter time due to the reduction of necessary bit exchanges. This approach
improves the security of neural cryptography

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: cMLSGA: A Co-Evolutionary Multi-Level Selection Genetic Algorithm for Multi-Objective Optimization. (arXiv:2104.11072v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In practical optimisation the dominant characteristics of the problem are
often not known prior. Therefore, there is a need to develop general solvers as
it is not always possible to tailor a specialised approach to each application.
The hybrid form of Multi-Level Selection Genetic Algorithm (MLSGA) already
shows good performance on range of problems due to its diversity-first
approach, which is rare among Evolutionary Algorithms. To increase the
generality of its performance this paper proposes a distinct set of
co-evolutionary mechanisms, which defines co-evolution as competition between
collectives rather than individuals. This distinctive approach to
co-evolutionary provides less regular communication between sub-populations and
different fitness definitions between individuals and collectives. This
encourages the collectives to act more independently creating a unique
sub-regional search, leading to the development of co-evolutionary MLSGA
(cMLSGA). To test this methodology nine genetic algorithms are selected to
generate several variants of cMLSGA, which incorporates these approaches at the
individual level. The new mechanisms are tested on over 100 different functions
and benchmarked against the 9 state-of-the-art competitors in order to find the
best general solver. The results show that the diversity of co-evolutionary
approaches is more important than their individual performances. This allows
the selection of two competing algorithms that improve the generality of
cMLSGA, without large loss of performance on any specific problem type. When
compared to the state-of-the-art, the proposed methodology is the most
universal and robust, leading to an algorithm more likely to solve complex
problems with limited knowledge about the search space.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Accurately predicting the performance of different optimization algorithms
for previously unseen problem instances is crucial for high-performing
algorithm selection and configuration techniques. In the context of numerical
optimization, supervised regression approaches built on top of exploratory
landscape analysis are becoming very popular. From the point of view of Machine
Learning (ML), however, the approaches are often rather naive, using default
regression or classification techniques without proper investigation of the
suitability of the ML tools. With this work, we bring to the attention of our
community the possibility to personalize regression models to specific types of
optimization problems. Instead of aiming for a single model that works well
across a whole set of possibly diverse problems, our personalized regression
approach acknowledges that different models may suite different types of
problems. Going one step further, we also investigate the impact of selecting
not a single regression model per problem, but personalized ensembles. We test
our approach on predicting the performance of numerical optimization heuristics
on the BBOB benchmark collection.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Song appreciation involves a broad range of mental processes, and different
neural networks may be activated by different song types. The aim of the
present study was to show differential functional connectivity of the
prefrontal cortices while listening to breakup and rebellious songs. Breakup
songs describe romance and longing, whereas rebellious songs convey criticism
of conventional ideas or socio-cultural norms. We hypothesized that the medial
and lateral prefrontal cortices may interact with different brain regions in
response to these two song types. The functional magnetic resonance imaging
data of fifteen participants were collected while they were listening to two
complete breakup songs and two complete rebellious songs currently popular in
Taiwan. The results showed that listening to the breakup songs, compared to the
rebellious songs, enhanced the coupling between the medial prefrontal cortex
and several emotion-related regions, including the thalamus, caudate, amygdala,
hippocampus, and right inferior frontal gyrus. This coupling may reflect the
neural processes of pain empathy, reward processing, compassion, and
reappraisal in response to longing and sorrow expressed by the breakup songs.
Compared to the breakup songs, listening to the rebellious songs was associated
with enhanced coupling between subregions in the prefrontal and orbitofrontal
cortices. These areas might work in concert to support re-evaluation of
conventional ideas or socio-cultural norms as suggested by the rebellious
songs. This study advanced our understanding of the integration of brain
functions while processing complex information.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Most classical (non-spiking) neural network models disregard internal neuron
dynamics and treat neurons as simple input integrators. However, biological
neurons have an internal state governed by complex dynamics that plays a
crucial role in learning, adaptation and the overall network activity and
behaviour. This paper presents the Membrane Potential and Activation Threshold
Homeostasis (MPATH) neuron model, which combines several biologically inspired
mechanisms to efficiently simulate internal neuron dynamics with a single
parameter analogous to the membrane time constant in biological neurons. The
model allows neurons to maintain a form of dynamic equilibrium by automatically
regulating their activity when presented with fluctuating input. One
consequence of the MPATH model is that it imbues neurons with a sense of time
without recurrent connections, paving the way for modelling processes that
depend on temporal aspects of neuron activity. Experiments demonstrate the
model's ability to adapt to and continually learn from its input.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Transitions among metastable states underlie context-dependent working memories in a multiple timescale network. (arXiv:2104.10829v1 [physics.bio-ph])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10829</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10829</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transitions between metastable states are commonly observed in the neural
system and underlie various cognitive functions such as working memory. In a
previous study, we have developed a neural network model with the slow and fast
populations, wherein simple Hebb-type learning enables stable and complex
(e.g., non-Markov) transitions between neural states. This model is distinct
from a network with asymmetric Hebbian connectivity and a network trained with
supervised machine learning methods: the former generates simple Markov
sequences. The latter generates complex but vulnerable sequences against
perturbation and its learning methods are biologically implausible. By using
our model, we propose and demonstrate a novel mechanism underlying stable
working memories: sequentially stabilizing and destabilizing task-related
states in the fast neural dynamics. The slow dynamics maintain a history of the
applied inputs, e.g., context signals, and enable the task-related states to be
stabilized in a context-dependent manner. We found that only a single (or a
few) state(s) is stabilized in each epoch (i.e., a period in the presence of
the context signal and a delayed period) in a working memory task, resulting in
a robust performance against noise and change in a task protocol. These results
suggest a simple mechanism underlying complex and stable processing in neural
systems.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The globus pallidus (GPe), as part of the basal ganglia, was once described
as a black box. As its functions were unclear, the GPe has been
underappreciated for decades. The advent of molecular tools has sparked a
resurgence in interest in the GPe. A recent flurry of publications has unveiled
the molecular landscape, synaptic organization, and functions of the GPe. It is
now clear that the GPe plays multifaceted roles in both motor and non-motor
functions, and is critically implicated in several motor disorders.
Accordingly, the GPe should no longer be considered as a mere homogeneous relay
within the so-called &quot;indirect pathway&quot;. Here we summarize the key findings,
challenges, consensuses, and disputes from the past few years.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuromorphic computing and spiking neural networks (SNN) mimic the behavior
of biological systems and have drawn interest for their potential to perform
cognitive tasks with high energy efficiency. However, some factors such as
temporal dynamics and spike timings prove critical for information processing
but are often ignored by existing works, limiting the performance and
applications of neuromorphic computing. On one hand, due to the lack of
effective SNN training algorithms, it is difficult to utilize the temporal
neural dynamics. Many existing algorithms still treat neuron activation
statistically. On the other hand, utilizing temporal neural dynamics also poses
challenges to hardware design. Synapses exhibit temporal dynamics, serving as
memory units that hold historical information, but are often simplified as a
connection with weight. Most current models integrate synaptic activations in
some storage medium to represent membrane potential and institute a hard reset
of membrane potential after the neuron emits a spike. This is done for its
simplicity in hardware, requiring only a &quot;clear&quot; signal to wipe the storage
medium, but destroys temporal information stored in the neuron.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we derive an efficient training algorithm for Leaky Integrate
and Fire neurons, which is capable of training a SNN to learn complex spatial
temporal patterns. We achieved competitive accuracy on two complex datasets. We
also demonstrate the advantage of our model by a novel temporal pattern
association task. Codesigned with this algorithm, we have developed a CMOS
circuit implementation for a memristor-based network of neuron and synapses
which retains critical neural dynamics with reduced complexity. This circuit
implementation of the neuron model is simulated to demonstrate its ability to
react to temporal spiking patterns with an adaptive threshold.

Over-activation of RAAS in swine results in a disease state similar to that of COVID-19 in human patients, suggesting that COVID-19 pathophysiology may be driven, at least in part, by an imbalance of this hormonal system.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/MTJqvHA17jY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Here authors use reaction diffusion (RD) numerical simulations in 3D on realistic lizard skin geometries and demonstrate that skin thickness variation on its own is sufficient to cause scale-by-scale coloration and CA dynamics during RD patterning.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/NnvC3t7se8w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: A Canonical Laminar Neocortical Circuit Whose Bottom-Up, Horizontal, and Top-Down Pathways Control Attention, Learning, and Prediction</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;All perceptual and cognitive circuits in the human cerebral cortex are organized into layers. Specializations of a canonical laminar network of bottom-up, horizontal, and top-down pathways carry out multiple kinds of biological intelligence across different neocortical areas. This article describes what this canonical network is and notes that it can support processes as different as 3D vision and figure-ground perception; attentive category learning and decision-making; speech perception; and cognitive working memory (WM), planning, and prediction. These processes take place within and between multiple parallel cortical streams that obey computationally complementary laws. The interstream interactions that are needed to overcome these complementary deficiencies mix cell properties so thoroughly that some authors have noted the difficulty of determining what exactly constitutes a cortical stream and the differences between streams. The models summarized herein explain how these complementary properties arise, and how their interstream interactions overcome their computational deficiencies to support effective goal-oriented behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Spectrum Degradation of Hippocampal LFP During Euthanasia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.647011</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.647011</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The hippocampal local field potential (LFP) exhibits a strong correlation with behavior. During rest, the theta rhythm is not prominent, but during active behavior, there are strong rhythms in the theta, theta harmonics, and gamma ranges. With increasing running velocity, theta, theta harmonics and gamma increase in power and in cross-frequency coupling, suggesting that neural entrainment is a direct consequence of the total excitatory input. While it is common to study the parametric range between the LFP and its complementing power spectra between deep rest and epochs of high running velocity, it is also possible to explore how the spectra degrades as the energy is completely quenched from the system. Specifically, it is unknown whether the 1/f slope is preserved as synaptic activity becomes diminished, as low frequencies are generated by large pools of neurons while higher frequencies comprise the activity of more local neuronal populations. To test this hypothesis, we examined rat LFPs recorded from the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex during barbiturate overdose euthanasia. Within the hippocampus, the initial stage entailed a quasi-stationary LFP state with a power-law feature in the power spectral density. In the second stage, there was a successive erosion of power from high- to low-frequencies in the second stage that continued until the only dominant remaining power was &amp;lt;20 Hz. This stage was followed by a rapid collapse of power spectrum toward the absolute electrothermal noise background. As the collapse of activity occurred later in hippocampus compared with medial entorhinal cortex, it suggests that the ability of a neural network to maintain the 1/f slope with decreasing energy is a function of general connectivity. Broadly, these data support the energy cascade theory where there is a cascade of energy from large cortical populations into smaller loops, such as those that supports the higher frequency gamma rhythm. As energy is pulled from the system, neural entrainment at gamma frequency (and higher) decline first. The larger loops, comprising a larger population, are fault-tolerant to a point capable of maintaining their activity before a final collapse.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Influence of High Pass Filter Settings on Motor Evoked Potentials</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.665258</guid>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;Motor evoked potentials (MEP), obtained by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) are a common tool in clinical research and diagnostic. Nevertheless, reports regarding the influence of filter settings on MEP are sparse. Here, we compared MEP amplitudes and signal to noise ratio (SNR) using multiple high pass filter (HPF) and notch filter settings.&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;Twenty healthy subjects were enrolled in the study. Recruitment curves were obtained with HPF settings varied at 10, 20, 50, and 100 Hz. The four HPF settings were tested both with and without 50 Hz active notch filter. Low pass filter was kept constant at 5 kHz.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;MEP amplitudes with HPF at 10 and 20 Hz were significantly higher than at 100 Hz, regardless of the notch filter. However, SNR did not differ among HPF settings. An active notch filter significantly improved SNR.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The reduction in MEP amplitudes with HPF above 20 Hz may be due to noise reduction, since the different HPF conditions did not alter SNR. Thus, higher HPF above 50 Hz may be an option to reduce noise, the use of a notch filter may even improve SNR.&lt;/p&gt;Significance&lt;p&gt;Our findings are relevant for the selection of filter settings and might be of importance to any researcher who utilizes TMS-MEP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Modulation of Peak Alpha Frequency Oscillations During Working Memory Is Greater in Females Than Males</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.626406</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.626406</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Peak alpha frequency is known to vary not just between individuals, but also within an individual over time. While variance in this metric between individuals has been tied to working memory performance, less understood are how short timescale modulations of peak alpha frequency during task performance may facilitate behavior. This gap in understanding may be bridged by consideration of a key difference between individuals: sex. Inconsistent findings in the literature regarding the relationship between peak alpha frequency and cognitive performance, as well as known sex-related-differences in peak alpha frequency and its modulation motivated our hypothesis that cognitive and neural processes underlying working memory—modulation of peak alpha frequency in particular—may differ based upon sex. Targeting sex as a predictive factor, we analyzed the EEG data of participants recorded while they performed four versions of a visual spatial working memory task. A significant difference between groups was present: females modulated peak alpha frequency more than males. Task performance did not differ by sex, yet a relationship between accuracy and peak alpha frequency was present in males, but not in females. These findings highlight the importance of considering sex as a factor in the study of oscillatory activity, particularly to further understanding of the neural mechanisms that underlie working memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Short-Term High-Intensity Interval Exercise Promotes Motor Cortex Plasticity and Executive Function in Sedentary Females</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.620958</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.620958</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Previous research has demonstrated that regular exercise modulates motor cortical plasticity and cognitive function, but the influence of short-term high-intensity interval training (HIIT) remains unclear. In the present study, the effect of short-term HIIT on neuroplasticity and executive function was assessed in 32 sedentary females. Half of the participants undertook 2 weeks of HIIT. Paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (ppTMS) was used to measure motor cortical plasticity via short intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF). We further adapted the Stroop task using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to evaluate executive function in the participants. The results indicated that, compared with the control group, the HIIT group exhibited decreased ICF. In the Stroop task, the HIIT group displayed greater activation in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) even though no significant difference in task performance was observed. These findings indicate that short-term HIIT may modulate motor cortical plasticity and executive function at the neural level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Canavan Disease as a Model for Gene Therapy-Mediated Myelin Repair</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.661928</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.661928</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the scientific and therapeutic fields for rare, genetic central nervous system (CNS) diseases such as leukodystrophies, or white matter disorders, have expanded significantly in part due to technological advancements in cellular and clinical screenings as well as remedial therapies using novel techniques such as gene therapy. However, treatments aimed at normalizing the pathological changes associated with leukodystrophies have especially been complicated due to the innate and variable effects of glial abnormalities, which can cause large-scale functional deficits in developmental myelination and thus lead to downstream neuronal impairment. Emerging research in the past two decades have depicted glial cells, particularly oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, as key, regulatory modulators in constructing and maintaining myelin function and neuronal viability. Given the significance of myelin formation in the developing brain, myelin repair in a time-dependent fashion is critical in restoring homeostatic functionality to the CNS of patients diagnosed with white matter disorders. Using Canavan Disease (CD) as a leukodystrophy model, here we review the hypothetical roles of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), one of the brain's most abundant amino acid derivatives, in Canavan disease's CNS myelinating pathology, as well as discuss the possible functions astrocytes serve in both CD and other leukodystrophies' time-sensitive disease correction. Through this analysis, we also highlight the potential remyelinating benefits of gene therapy for other leukodystrophies in which alternative CNS cell targeting for white matter disorders may be an applicable path for reparative treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Contribution of Microglia to the Development and Maturation of the Visual System</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.659843</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), were once considered quiescent cells that sat in readiness for reacting to disease and injury. Over the last decade, however, it has become clear that microglia play essential roles in maintaining the normal nervous system. The retina is an easily accessible part of the central nervous system and therefore much has been learned about the function of microglia from studies in the retina and visual system. Anatomically, microglia have processes that contact all synapses within the retina, as well as blood vessels in the major vascular plexuses. Microglia contribute to development of the visual system by contributing to neurogenesis, maturation of cone photoreceptors, as well as refining synaptic contacts. They can respond to neural signals and in turn release a range of cytokines and neurotrophic factors that have downstream consequences on neural function. Moreover, in light of their extensive contact with blood vessels, they are also essential for regulation of vascular development and integrity. This review article summarizes what we have learned about the role of microglia in maintaining the normal visual system and how this has helped in understanding their role in the central nervous system more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: The Neurotransmitter Receptor Architecture of the Mouse Olfactory System</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The uptake, transmission and processing of sensory olfactory information is modulated by inhibitory and excitatory receptors in the olfactory system. Previous studies have focused on the function of individual receptors in distinct brain areas, but the receptor architecture of the whole system remains unclear. Here, we analyzed the receptor profiles of the whole olfactory system of adult male mice. We examined the distribution patterns of glutamatergic (AMPA, kainate, mGlu&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;, and NMDA), GABAergic (GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, GABA&lt;sub&gt;A(BZ)&lt;/sub&gt;, and GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;), dopaminergic (D&lt;sub&gt;1/5&lt;/sub&gt;) and noradrenergic (α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) neurotransmitter receptors by quantitative in vitro receptor autoradiography combined with an analysis of the cyto- and myelo-architecture. We observed that each subarea of the olfactory system is characterized by individual densities of distinct neurotransmitter receptor types, leading to a region- and layer-specific receptor profile. Thereby, the investigated receptors in the respective areas and strata showed a heterogeneous expression. Generally, we detected high densities of mGlu&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;Rs, GABA&lt;sub&gt;A(BZ)&lt;/sub&gt;Rs and GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs. Noradrenergic receptors revealed a highly heterogenic distribution, while the dopaminergic receptor D&lt;sub&gt;1/5&lt;/sub&gt; displayed low concentrations, except in the olfactory tubercle and the dorsal endopiriform nucleus. The similarities and dissimilarities of the area-specific multireceptor profiles were analyzed by a hierarchical cluster analysis. A three-cluster solution was found that divided the areas into the (1) olfactory relay stations (main and accessory olfactory bulb), (2) the olfactory cortex (anterior olfactory cortex, dorsal peduncular cortex, taenia tecta, piriform cortex, endopiriform nucleus, entorhinal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex) and the (3) olfactory tubercle, constituting its own cluster. The multimodal receptor-architectonic analysis of each component of the olfactory system provides new insights into its neurochemical organization and future possibilities for pharmaceutic targeting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: EEG-fMRI Signal Coupling Is Modulated in Subjects With Mild Cognitive Impairment and Amyloid Deposition</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.631172</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive impairment indicates disturbed brain physiology which can be due to various mechanisms including Alzheimer's pathology. Combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) recordings (EEG-fMRI) can assess the interplay between complementary measures of brain activity and EEG changes to be localized to specific brain regions. We used a two-step approach, where we first examined changes related to a syndrome of mild cognitive impairment irrespective of pathology and then studied the specific impact of amyloid pathology. After detailed clinical and neuropsychological characterization as well as a positron emission tomography (PET) scans with the tracer 11-[C]-Pittsburgh Compound B to estimate cerebral amyloid deposition, 14 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (mean age 75.6 SD: 8.9) according to standard criteria and 21 cognitively healthy controls (HCS) (mean age 71.8 SD: 4.2) were assessed with EEG-fMRI. Thalamo-cortical alpha-fMRI signal coupling was only observed in HCS. Additional EEG-fMRI signal coupling differences between HCS and MCI were observed in parts of the default mode network, salience network, fronto-parietal network, and thalamus. Individuals with significant cerebral amyloid deposition (amyloid-positive MCI and HCS combined compared to amyloid-negative HCS) displayed abnormal EEG-fMRI signal coupling in visual, fronto-parietal regions but also in the parahippocampus, brain stem, and cerebellum. This finding was paralleled by stronger absolute fMRI signal in the parahippocampus and weaker absolute fMRI signal in the inferior frontal gyrus in amyloid-positive subjects. We conclude that the thalamocortical coupling in the alpha band in HCS more closely reflects previous findings observed in younger adults, while in MCI there is a clearly aberrant coupling in several networks dominated by an anticorrelation in the posterior cingulate cortex. While these findings may broadly indicate physiological changes in MCI, amyloid pathology was specifically associated with abnormal fMRI signal responses and disrupted coupling between brain oscillations and fMRI signal responses, which especially involve core regions of memory: the hippocampus, para-hippocampus, and lateral prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Meningeal CGRP‐Prolactin Interaction Evokes Female‐Specific Migraine Behavior</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26070</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26070?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
Migraine is three times more common in women. CGRP plays a critical role in migraine pathology and causes female‐specific behavioral responses upon meningeal application. These effects are likely mediated through interactions of CGRP with signaling systems specific to females. Prolactin (PRL) levels have been correlated with migraine attacks. Here, we explore a potential interaction between CGRP and PRL in the meninges.


Methods
Prolactin, CGRP, and receptor antagonists CGRP8‐37 or Δ1‐9‐G129R‐hPRL were administered onto the dura of rodents followed by behavioral testing. Immunohistochemistry was used to examine PRL, CGRP and Prolactin receptor (Prlr) expression within the dura. Electrophysiology on cultured and back‐labeled trigeminal ganglia (TG) neurons was used to assess PRL‐induced excitability. Finally, the effects of PRL on evoked CGRP release from ex vivo dura were measured.


Results
We found that dural PRL produced sustained and long‐lasting migraine‐like behavior in cycling and ovariectomized female, but not male rodents. Prlr was expressed on dural afferent nerves in females with little‐to‐no presence in males. Consistent with this, PRL increased excitability only in female TG neurons innervating the dura and selectively sensitized CGRP release from female ex vivo dura. We demonstrate crosstalk between PRL and CGRP systems as CGRP8‐37 decreases migraine‐like responses to dural PRL. Reciprocally, Δ1‐9‐G129R‐hPRL attenuates dural CGRP‐induced migraine behaviors. Similarly, Prlr deletion from sensory neurons significantly reduced migraine‐like responses to dural CGRP.


Interpretation
This CGRP‐PRL interaction in the meninges is a mechanism by which these peptides could produce female‐selective responses and increase the prevalence of migraine in women. ANN NEUROL 2021</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Unraveling the mechanisms of surround suppression in early visual processing</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Yao Li, Lai-Sang Young&lt;/p&gt;

This paper uses mathematical modeling to study the mechanisms of surround suppression in the primate visual cortex. We present a large-scale neural circuit alistic modeling work are used. The remaining parameters are chosen to produce model outputs that emulate experimentally observed size-tuning curves. Our two main results are: (i) we discovered the character of the long-range connections in Layer 6 responsible for surround effects in the input layers; and (ii) we showed that a net-inhibitory feedback, i.e., feedback that excites I-cells more than E-cells, from Layer 6 to Layer 4 is conducive to producing surround properties consistent with experimental data. These results are obtained through parameter selection and model analysis. The effects of nonlinear recurrent excitation and inhibition are also discussed. A feature that distinguishes our model from previous modeling work on surround suppression is that we have tried to reproduce realistic lengthscales that are crucial for quantitative comparison with data. Due to its size and the large number of unknown parameters, the model is computationally challenging. We demonstrate a strategy that involves first locating baseline values for relevant parameters using a linear model, followed by the introduction of nonlinearities where needed. We find such a methodology effective, and propose it as a possibility in the modeling of complex biological systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bNCVOTWspsI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Nelson, Madison F. Walker, Kouki Kawakami, Asuka Inoue, Nevan J. Krogan, David J. Grunwald, Ruth Hüttenhain, Aashish Manglik, Benjamin R. Myers&lt;/p&gt;

The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is essential for organ development, homeostasis, and regeneration. Dysfunction of this cascade drives several cancers. To control expression of pathway target genes, the G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) Smoothened (SMO) activates glioma-associated (GLI) transcription factors via an unknown mechanism. Here, we show that, rather than conforming to traditional GPCR signaling paradigms, SMO activates GLI by binding and sequestering protein kinase A (PKA) catalytic subunits at the membrane. This sequestration, triggered by GPCR kinase (GRK)-mediated phosphorylation of SMO intracellular domains, prevents PKA from phosphorylating soluble substrates, releasing GLI from PKA-mediated inhibition. Our work provides a mechanism directly linking Hh signal transduction at the membrane to GLI transcription in the nucleus. This process is more fundamentally similar between species than prevailing hypotheses suggest. The mechanism described here may apply broadly to other GPCR- and PKA-containing cascades in diverse areas of biology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/kDoJwyIWoQQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper describes a mathematical formulation for measuring how one system
can estimate the consciousness of another. This consciousness estimate is
always relative to the observer. The paper shows how this formulation leads to
simple resolutions of some key problems of consciousness.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Towards Exploratory Landscape Analysis for Large-scale Optimization: A Dimensionality Reduction Framework. (arXiv:2104.10301v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10301</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although exploratory landscape analysis (ELA) has shown its effectiveness in
various applications, most previous studies focused only on low- and
moderate-dimensional problems. Thus, little is known about the scalability of
the ELA approach for large-scale optimization. In this context, first, this
paper analyzes the computational cost of features in the flacco package. Our
results reveal that two important feature classes (ela_level and ela_meta)
cannot be applied to large-scale optimization due to their high computational
cost. To improve the scalability of the ELA approach, this paper proposes a
dimensionality reduction framework that computes features in a reduced
lower-dimensional space than the original solution space. We demonstrate that
the proposed framework can drastically reduce the computation time of ela_level
and ela_meta for large dimensions. In addition, the proposed framework can make
the cell-mapping feature classes scalable for large-scale optimization. Our
results also show that features computed by the proposed framework are
beneficial for predicting the high-level properties of the 24 large-scale BBOB
functions.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Extraction of Hierarchical Functional Connectivity Components in human brain using Adversarial Learning. (arXiv:2104.10255v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10255</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10255</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The estimation of sparse hierarchical components reflecting patterns of the
brain's functional connectivity from rsfMRI data can contribute to our
understanding of the brain's functional organization, and can lead to
biomarkers of diseases. However, inter-scanner variations and other confounding
factors pose a challenge to the robust and reproducible estimation of
functionally-interpretable brain networks, and especially to reproducible
biomarkers. Moreover, the brain is believed to be organized hierarchically, and
hence single-scale decompositions miss this hierarchy. The paper aims to use
current advancements in adversarial learning to estimate interpretable
hierarchical patterns in the human brain using rsfMRI data, which are robust to
&quot;adversarial effects&quot; such as inter-scanner variations. We write the estimation
problem as a minimization problem and solve it using alternating updates.
Extensive experiments on simulation and a real-world dataset show high
reproducibility of the components compared to other well-known methods.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: State Transitions During Discrimination Learning in the Gerbil Auditory Cortex Analyzed by Network Causality Metrics</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.641684</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.641684</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This work studies the evolution of cortical networks during the transition from escape strategy to avoidance strategy in auditory discrimination learning in Mongolian gerbils trained by the well-established two-way active avoidance learning paradigm. The animals were implanted with electrode arrays centered on the surface of the primary auditory cortex and electrocorticogram (ECoG) recordings were made during performance of an auditory Go/NoGo discrimination task. Our experiments confirm previous results on a sudden behavioral change from the initial naïve state to an avoidance strategy as learning progresses. We employed two causality metrics using Granger Causality (GC) and New Causality (NC) to quantify changes in the causality flow between ECoG channels as the animals switched to avoidance strategy. We found that the number of channel pairs with inverse causal interaction significantly increased after the animal acquired successful discrimination, which indicates structural changes in the cortical networks as a result of learning. A suitable graph-theoretical model is developed to interpret the findings in terms of cortical networks evolving during cognitive state transitions. Structural changes lead to changes in the dynamics of neural populations, which are described as phase transitions in the network graph model with small-world connections. Overall, our findings underscore the importance of functional reorganization in sensory cortical areas as a possible neural contributor to behavioral changes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: The Renin–Angiotensin System Modulates Dopaminergic Neurotransmission: A New Player on the Scene</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is an extrapyramidal disorder characterized by neuronal degeneration in several regions of the peripheral and central nervous systems. It is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer’s. It has become a major health problem, affecting 1% of the world population over 60 years old and 3% of people beyond 80 years. The main histological findings are intracellular Lewy bodies composed of misfolded α-synuclein protein aggregates and loss of dopaminergic neurons in the central nervous system. Neuroinflammation, apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, altered calcium homeostasis, abnormal protein degradation, and synaptic pathobiology have been put forward as mechanisms leading to cell death, α-synuclein deposition, or both. A progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra late in the neurodegeneration leads to developing motor symptoms like bradykinesia, tremor, and rigidity. The renin–angiotensin system (RAS), which is involved in regulating blood pressure and body fluid balance, also plays other important functions in the brain. The RAS is involved in the autocrine and paracrine regulation of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic synapses. Dopamine depletion, as in PD, increases angiotensin II expression, which stimulates or inhibits dopamine synthesis and is released via AT1 or AT2 receptors. Furthermore, angiotensin II AT1 receptors inhibit D1 receptor activation allosterically. Therefore, the RAS may have an important modulating role in the flow of information from the brain cortex to the basal ganglia. High angiotensin II levels might even aggravate neurodegeneration, activating the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase complex, which leads to increased reactive oxygen species production.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Stress-Induced Enhanced Long-Term Potentiation and Reduced Threshold for N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor- and β-Adrenergic Receptor-Mediated Synaptic Plasticity in Rodent Ventral Subiculum</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.658465</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stress is a biologically relevant signal and can modulate hippocampal synaptic plasticity. The subiculum is the major output station of the hippocampus and serves as a critical hub in the stress response network. However, stress-associated synaptic plasticity in the ventral subiculum has not been adequately addressed. Therefore, we investigated the impact of a single exposure to an inherently stressful two-way active avoidance conditioning on the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) at CA1—subiculum synapses in ventral hippocampal slices from young adult rats 1 day after stressor exposure. We found that acute stress enhanced LTP and lowered the induction threshold for a late-onset LTP at excitatory CA1 to subicular burst-spiking neuron synapses. This late-onset LTP was dependent on the activation of β-adrenergic and glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and independent of D1/D5 dopamine receptor activation. Thereby, we present a cellular mechanism that might contribute to behavioral stress adaptation after acute stressor exposure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Protect Others to Protect Myself: A Weakness of Western Countries in the Face of Current and Future Pandemics? Psychological and Neuroscientific Perspectives</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2021.608151</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic has generated a large number of publications in the medical and biological fields concerning the virus and its treatments, as well as in psychology, social sciences, and data sciences with regard to the spread of the virus. Surprisingly, far fewer neuroscientific articles have been published in this field of research and one might well ask whether the cognitive neurosciences have anything to say at all about this vital topic. In this article, we highlight a research perspective relating to differences in the individual perception of the pandemic in Western compared to Eastern countries. Although this problem is complex, multifaceted and subsumes many other social variables, we suggest that the cognitive neurosciences do have important and fundamental insights to contribute concerning the collective response observed within these populations. More precisely, we propose the hypothesis that differences in the propensity to adopt a holistic perception of contamination processes at the group level, involving brain structures that are also associated with perspective-taking and empathy such as, in particular, the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), could help explain the differences in the perception of the pandemic observed between Western and Eastern countries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Peritumoral Brain Edema in Meningiomas May Be Related to Glymphatic Dysfunction</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.674898</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.674898</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The pathogenesis of peritumoral brain edema (PTBE) in meningiomas remains unclear. The glymphatic system is recently recognized as a pathway for waste clearance and maintaining fluid balance in the brain parenchymal interstitium. We aimed to investigate if the PTBE volume of meningiomas correlates with their glymphatic function. A total of 80 meningioma patients (mean age, 58.8 years; 37 men) and 44 normal subjects (mean age 53.3 years; 23 men) who had preoperative diffusion-tensor imaging for calculation of the analysis along the perivascular space (ALPS) index were retrospectively included. Information collected from each patient included sex, age, tumor grade, Ki-67 index, tumor location, tumor volume, PTBE volume and ALPS index. Comparisons of ALPS index among meningiomas without PTBE, meningiomas with PTBE, and normal subjects were performed using analysis of covariance with Bonferroni correction and adjustments for age and sex. Pearson correlation coefficient and multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with PTBE volume. Group comparisons revealed that the ALPS index was significantly higher (P &amp;lt; 0.05) in meningiomas without PTBE vs. meningiomas with PTBE and normal subjects. On the other hand, ALPS index was not different between meningiomas with PTBE and normal subjects. On Pearson correlation and multivariable linear regression analyses, the ALPS index was the only factor significantly (P &amp;lt; 0.05) associated with PTBE volume. In conclusion, PTBE volume inversely correlated with ALPS index in meningiomas. PTBE formation in meningiomas may be related to glymphatic dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Triadin Decrease Impairs the Expression of E-C Coupling Related Proteins in Muscles of MPTP-Induced Parkinson’s Disease Mice</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.649688</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD), caused by destruction of dopaminergic neurons in the brain, leads to motor symptoms like bradykinesia, tremor, and walking impairments. While most research effort focuses on changes in neuronal pathology we examined how muscle proteins were altered in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD. A Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release channel complex, consisting of ryanodine receptors (RYR), triadin (TRDN), and calsequestrin (CSQ1), is important for excitation-contraction coupling in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane in muscles. Thus, we investigated changes in the RYR Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release channel components in PD mice model. Based on a report that TRDN deletion impairs skeletal muscle function, we also investigated how the knock-down of TRDN affects other components of the RYR channel in the PD model. In this study, the expression levels of the components of RYR channels decreased in the quadriceps femoris muscle of MPTP-induced PD mice and in C2C12 cells treated with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium. We show that decreased TRDN levels decrease RYR and CSQ1 levels. These results suggest that the levels of proteins related to Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel function decreased in this model, which could impair muscle function. We conclude that muscle function alterations could add to the bradykinesia and tremor in this model of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Rapid cost drops and advancements in next-generation sequencing have made profiling of cells at individual level a conventional practice in scientific laboratories worldwide. Single-cell transcriptomics [single-cell RNA sequencing (SC-RNA-seq)] has an immense potential of uncovering the novel basis of human life. The well-known heterogeneity of cells at the individual level can be better studied by single-cell transcriptomics. Proper downstream analysis of this data will provide new insights into the scientific communities. However, due to low starting materials, the SC-RNA-seq data face various computational challenges: normalization, differential gene expression analysis, dimensionality reduction, etc. Additionally, new methods like 10× Chromium can profile millions of cells in parallel, which creates a considerable amount of data. Thus, single-cell data handling is another big challenge. This paper reviews the single-cell sequencing methods, library preparation, and data generation. We highlight some of the main computational challenges that require to be addressed by introducing new bioinformatics algorithms and tools for analysis. We also show single-cell transcriptomics data as a big data problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: PyGeNN: A Python Library for GPU-Enhanced Neural Networks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.659005</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;More than half of the Top 10 supercomputing sites worldwide use GPU accelerators and they are becoming ubiquitous in workstations and edge computing devices. GeNN is a C++ library for generating efficient spiking neural network simulation code for GPUs. However, until now, the full flexibility of GeNN could only be harnessed by writing model descriptions and simulation code in C++. Here we present PyGeNN, a Python package which exposes all of GeNN's functionality to Python with minimal overhead. This provides an alternative, arguably more user-friendly, way of using GeNN and allows modelers to use GeNN within the growing Python-based machine learning and computational neuroscience ecosystems. In addition, we demonstrate that, in both Python and C++ GeNN simulations, the overheads of recording spiking data can strongly affect runtimes and show how a new spike recording system can reduce these overheads by up to 10×. Using the new recording system, we demonstrate that by using PyGeNN on a modern GPU, we can simulate a full-scale model of a cortical column faster even than real-time neuromorphic systems. Finally, we show that long simulations of a smaller model with complex stimuli and a custom three-factor learning rule defined in PyGeNN can be simulated almost two orders of magnitude faster than real-time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: QDECR: A Flexible, Extensible Vertex-Wise Analysis Framework in R</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.561689</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The cerebral cortex is fundamental to the functioning of the mind and body. In vivo cortical morphology can be studied through magnetic resonance imaging in several ways, including reconstructing surface-based models of the cortex. However, existing software for surface-based statistical analyses cannot accommodate “big data” or commonly used statistical methods such as the imputation of missing data, extensive bias correction, and non-linear modeling. To address these shortcomings, we developed the QDECR package, a flexible and extensible R package for group-level statistical analysis of cortical morphology. QDECR was written with large population-based epidemiological studies in mind and was designed to fully utilize the extensive modeling options in R. QDECR currently supports vertex-wise linear regression. Design matrix generation can be done through simple, familiar R formula specification, and includes user-friendly extensions for R options such as polynomials, splines, interactions and other terms. QDECR can handle unimputed and imputed datasets with thousands of participants. QDECR has a modular design, and new statistical models can be implemented which utilize several aspects from other generic modules which comprise QDECR. In summary, QDECR provides a framework for vertex-wise surface-based analyses that enables flexible statistical modeling and features commonly used in population-based and clinical studies, which have until now been largely absent from neuroimaging research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Wrist Position Sense in Two Dimensions: Between-Hand Symmetry and Anisotropic Accuracy Across the Space</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A deep investigation of proprioceptive processes is necessary to understand the relationship between sensory afferent inputs and motor outcomes. In this work, we investigate whether and how perception of wrist position is influenced by the direction along which the movement occurs. Most previous studies have tested Joint Position Sense (JPS) through 1 degree of freedom (DoF) wrist movements, such as flexion/extension (FE) or radial/ulnar deviation (RUD). However, the wrist joint has 3-DoF and many activities of daily living produce combined movements, requiring at least 2-DoF wrist coordination. For this reason, in this study, target positions involved movement directions that combined wrist flexion or extension with radial or ulnar deviation. The chosen task was a robot-aided Joint Position Matching (JPM), in which blindfolded participants actively reproduced a previously passively assumed target joint configuration. The JPM performance of 20 healthy participants was quantified through measures of accuracy and precision, in terms of both perceived target direction and distance along each direction of movement. Twelve different directions of movement were selected and both hands tested. The left and right hand led to comparable results, both target extents and directions were differently perceived according to the target direction on the FE/RUD space. Moreover, during 2-DoF combined movements, subjects’ perception of directions was impaired when compared to 1-DoF target movements. In summary, our results showed that human perception of wrist position on the FE/RUD space is symmetric between hands but not isotropic among movement directions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Modulating Frontal Networks’ Timing-Dependent-Like Plasticity With Paired Associative Stimulation Protocols: Recent Advances and Future Perspectives</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Starting from the early 2000s, paired associative stimulation (PAS) protocols have been used in humans to study brain connectivity in motor and sensory networks by exploiting the intrinsic properties of timing-dependent cortical plasticity. In the last 10 years, PAS have also been developed to investigate the plastic properties of complex cerebral systems, such as the frontal ones, with promising results. In the present work, we review the most recent advances of this technique, focusing on protocols targeting frontal cortices to investigate connectivity and its plastic properties, subtending high-order cognitive functions like memory, decision-making, attentional, or emotional processing. Overall, current evidence reveals that PAS can be effectively used to assess, enhance or depress physiological connectivity within frontal networks in a timing-dependent way, in turn modulating cognitive processing in healthy and pathological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Brain Alteration of Seafarer Revealed by Activated Functional Connectivity Mode in fMRI Data Analysis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;As a special occupational group, the working and living environments faced by seafarers are greatly different from those of land. It is easy to affect the psychological and physiological activities of seafarers, which inevitably lead to changes in the brain functional activities of seafarers. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the neural activity rules of seafarers’ brain. In view of this, this paper studied the seafarers’ brain alteration at the activated voxel level based on functional magnetic resonance imaging technology by comparing the differences in functional connectivities (FCs) between seafarers and non-seafarers. Firstly, the activated voxels of each group were obtained by independence component analysis, and then the distribution of these voxels in the brain and the common activated voxels between the two groups were statistically analyzed. Next, the FCs between the common activated voxels of the two groups were calculated and obtained the FCs that had significant differences between them through two-sample T-test. Finally, all FCs and FCs with significant differences (DFCs) between the common activated voxels were used as the features for the support vector machine to classify seafarers and non-seafarers. The results showed that DFCs between the activated voxels had better recognition ability for seafarers, especially for Precuneus_L and Precuneus_R, which may play an important role in the classification prediction of seafarers and non-seafarers, so that provided a new perspective for studying the specificity of neurological activities of seafarers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: A Methodological Review of fNIRS in Driving Research: Relevance to the Future of Autonomous Vehicles</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;As automobile manufacturers have begun to design, engineer, and test autonomous driving systems of the future, brain imaging with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) can provide unique insights about cognitive processes associated with evolving levels of autonomy implemented in the automobile. Modern fNIRS devices provide a portable, relatively affordable, and robust form of functional neuroimaging that allows researchers to investigate brain function in real-world environments. The trend toward “naturalistic neuroscience” is evident in the growing number of studies that leverage the methodological flexibility of fNIRS, and in doing so, significantly expand the scope of cognitive function that is accessible to observation via functional brain imaging (i.e., from the simulator to on-road scenarios). While more than a decade’s worth of study in this field of fNIRS driving research has led to many interesting findings, the number of studies applying fNIRS during autonomous modes of operation is limited. To support future research that directly addresses this lack in autonomous driving research with fNIRS, we argue that a cogent distillation of the methods used to date will help facilitate and streamline this research of tomorrow. To that end, here we provide a methodological review of the existing fNIRS driving research, with the overarching goal of highlighting the current diversity in methodological approaches. We argue that standardization of these approaches will facilitate greater overlap of methods by researchers from all disciplines, which will, in-turn, allow for meta-analysis of future results. We conclude by providing recommendations for advancing the use of such fNIRS technology in furthering understanding the adoption of safe autonomous vehicle technology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Tapping Force Encodes Metrical Aspects of Rhythm</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.633956</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Humans possess the ability to extract highly organized perceptual structures from sequences of temporal stimuli. For instance, we can organize specific rhythmical patterns into hierarchical, or metrical, systems. Despite the evidence of a fundamental influence of the motor system in achieving this skill, few studies have attempted to investigate the organization of our motor representation of rhythm. To this aim, we studied—in musicians and non-musicians—the ability to perceive and reproduce different rhythms. In a first experiment participants performed a temporal order-judgment task, for rhythmical sequences presented via auditory or tactile modality. In a second experiment, they were asked to reproduce the same rhythmic sequences, while their tapping force and timing were recorded. We demonstrate that tapping force encodes the metrical aspect of the rhythm, and the strength of the coding correlates with the individual’s perceptual accuracy. We suggest that the similarity between perception and tapping-force organization indicates a common representation of rhythm, shared between the perceptual and motor systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Asymmetric Influence of Vocalic Context on Mandarin Sibilants: Evidence From ERP Studies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.617318</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.617318</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the present study, we examine the interactive effect of vowels on Mandarin fricative sibilants using a passive oddball paradigm to determine whether the HEIGHT features of vowels can spread on the surface and influence preceding consonants with unspecified features. The stimuli are two pairs of Mandarin words ([sa] ∼ [ʂa] and [su] ∼ [ʂu]) contrasting in vowel HEIGHT ([LOW] vs. [HIGH]). Each word in the same pair was presented both as standard and deviant, resulting in four conditions (/standard/&lt;sub&gt;[deviant]&lt;/sub&gt;: /sa/&lt;sub&gt;[ʂa]&lt;/sub&gt; ∼ /ʂa/&lt;sub&gt;[sa]&lt;/sub&gt; and /su/&lt;sub&gt;[ʂu]&lt;/sub&gt; ∼ /ʂu/&lt;sub&gt;[su]&lt;/sub&gt;). In line with the Featurally Underspecified Lexicon (FUL) model, asymmetric patterns of processing were found in the [su] ∼ [ʂu] word pair where both the MMN (mismatch negativity) and LDN (late discriminative negativity) components were more negative in /su/&lt;sub&gt;[ʂu]&lt;/sub&gt; (mismatch) than in /ʂu/&lt;sub&gt;[su]&lt;/sub&gt; (no mismatch), suggesting the spreading of the feature [HIGH] from the vowel [u] to [ʂ] on the surface. In the [sa] ∼ [ʂa] pair, however, symmetric negativities (for both MMN and LDN) were observed as there is no conflict between the surface feature [LOW] from [a] to [ʂ] and the underlying specified feature [LOW] of [s]. These results confirm that not all features are fully specified in the mental lexicon: features of vowels can spread on the surface and influence surrounding unspecified segments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neural Mechanisms of Observational Learning: A Neural Working Model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.609312</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Humans and some animal species are able to learn stimulus-response (S-R) associations by observing others' behavior. It saves energy and time and avoids the danger of trying the wrong actions. Observational learning (OL) depends on the capability of mapping the actions of others into our own behaviors, processing outcomes, and combining this knowledge to serve our goals. Observational learning plays a central role in the learning of social skills, cultural knowledge, and tool use. Thus, it is one of the fundamental processes in which infants learn about and from adults (Byrne and Russon, 1998). In this paper, we review current methodological approaches employed in observational learning research. We highlight the important role of the prefrontal cortex and cognitive flexibility to support this learning process, develop a new neural working model of observational learning, illustrate how imitation relates to observational learning, and provide directions for future research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Emergence of Neuronal Synchronisation in Coupled Areas</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.663408</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.663408</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most fundamental questions in the field of neuroscience is the emergence of synchronous behaviour in the brain, such as phase, anti-phase, and shift-phase synchronisation. In this work, we investigate how the connectivity between brain areas can influence the phase angle and the neuronal synchronisation. To do this, we consider brain areas connected by means of excitatory and inhibitory synapses, in which the neuron dynamics is given by the adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire model. Our simulations suggest that excitatory and inhibitory connections from one area to another play a crucial role in the emergence of these types of synchronisation. Thus, in the case of unidirectional interaction, we observe that the phase angles of the neurons in the receiver area depend on the excitatory and inhibitory synapses which arrive from the sender area. Moreover, when the neurons in the sender area are synchronised, the phase angle variability of the receiver area can be reduced for some conductance values between the areas. For bidirectional interactions, we find that phase and anti-phase synchronisation can emerge due to excitatory and inhibitory connections. We also verify, for a strong inhibitory-to-excitatory interaction, the existence of silent neuronal activities, namely a large number of excitatory neurons that remain in silence for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: CRBA: A Competitive Rate-Based Algorithm Based on Competitive Spiking Neural Networks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.627567</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.627567</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper we present a Competitive Rate-Based Algorithm (CRBA) that approximates operation of a Competitive Spiking Neural Network (CSNN). CRBA is based on modeling of the competition between neurons during a sample presentation, which can be reduced to ranking of the neurons based on a dot product operation and the use of a discrete Expectation Maximization algorithm; the latter is equivalent to the spike time-dependent plasticity rule. CRBA's performance is compared with that of CSNN on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. The results show that CRBA performs on par with CSNN, while using three orders of magnitude less computational time. Importantly, we show that the weights and firing thresholds learned by CRBA can be used to initialize CSNN's parameters that results in its much more efficient operation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Dopaminergic Neuromodulation of Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity in Mature Adult Rodent and Human Cortical Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.668980</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.668980</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Synapses in the cerebral cortex constantly change and this dynamic property regulated by the action of neuromodulators such as dopamine (DA), is essential for reward learning and memory. DA modulates spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), a cellular model of learning and memory, in juvenile rodent cortical neurons. However, it is unknown whether this neuromodulation also occurs at excitatory synapses of cortical neurons in mature adult mice or in humans. Cortical layer V pyramidal neurons were recorded with whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology and an extracellular stimulating electrode was used to induce STDP. DA was either bath-applied or optogenetically released in slices from mice. Classical STDP induction protocols triggered non-hebbian excitatory synaptic depression in the mouse or no plasticity at human cortical synapses. DA reverted long term synaptic depression to baseline in mouse via dopamine 2 type receptors or elicited long term synaptic potentiation in human cortical synapses. Furthermore, when DA was applied during an STDP protocol it depressed presynaptic inhibition in the mouse but not in the human cortex. Thus, DA modulates excitatory synaptic plasticity differently in human vs. mouse cortex. The data strengthens the importance of DA in gating cognition in humans, and may inform on therapeutic interventions to recover brain function from diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: For Better or for Worse: A Look Into Neutrophils in Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.648076</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.648076</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neutrophils are short-lived cells of the innate immune system and the first line of defense at the site of an infection and tissue injury. Pattern recognition receptors on neutrophils recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns or danger-associated molecular patterns, which recruit them to the destined site. Neutrophils are professional phagocytes with efficient granular constituents that aid in the neutralization of pathogens. In addition to phagocytosis and degranulation, neutrophils are proficient in creating neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) that immobilize pathogens to prevent their spread. Because of the cytotoxicity of the associated granular proteins within NETs, the microbes can be directly killed once immobilized by the NETs. The role of neutrophils in infection is well studied; however, there is less emphasis placed on the role of neutrophils in tissue injury, such as traumatic spinal cord injury. Upon the initial mechanical injury, the innate immune system is activated in response to the molecules produced by the resident cells of the injured spinal cord initiating the inflammatory cascade. This review provides an overview of the essential role of neutrophils and explores the contribution of neutrophils to the pathologic changes in the injured spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Mitochondrial CHCHD2: Disease-Associated Mutations, Physiological Functions, and Current Animal Models</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Rare mutations in the mitochondrial protein coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain containing 2 (CHCHD2) are associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and other Lewy body disorders. CHCHD2 is a bi-organellar mediator of oxidative phosphorylation, playing crucial roles in regulating electron flow in the mitochondrial electron transport chain and acting as a nuclear transcription factor for a cytochrome c oxidase subunit (COX4I2) and itself in response to hypoxic stress. CHCHD2 also regulates cell migration and differentiation, mitochondrial cristae structure, and apoptosis. In this review, we summarize the known disease-associated mutations of CHCHD2 in Asian and Caucasian populations, the physiological functions of CHCHD2, how CHCHD2 mutations contribute to α-synuclein pathology, and current animal models of CHCHD2. Further, we discuss the necessity of continued investigation into the divergent functions of CHCHD2 and CHCHD10 to determine how mutations in these similar mitochondrial proteins contribute to different neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Intranasal Delivery of Collagen-Loaded Neprilysin Clears Beta-Amyloid Plaques in a Transgenic Alzheimer Mouse Model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.649646</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.649646</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is pathologically characterized by extracellular beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and intraneuronal tau tangles in the brain. A therapeutic strategy aims to prevent or clear these Aβ plaques and the Aβ-degrading enzyme neprilysin is a potent drug to degrade plaques. The major challenge is to deliver bioactive neprilysin into the brain via the blood-brain barrier. The aim of the present study is to explore if intranasal delivery of neprilysin can eliminate plaques in a transgenic AD mouse model (APP_SweDI). We will test if collagen or platelets are useful vehicles to deliver neprilysin into the brain. Using organotypic brain slices from adult transgenic APP_SweDI mice, we show that neprilysin alone or loaded in collagen hydrogels or in platelets cleared cortical plaques. Intransasal delivery of neprilysin alone increased small Aβ depositions in the middle and caudal cortex in transgenic mice. Platelets loaded with neprilysin cleared plaques in the frontal cortex after intranasal application. Intranasal delivery of collagen-loaded neprilysin was very potent to clear plaques especially in the middle and caudal parts of the cortex. Our data support that the Aβ degrading enzyme neprilysin delivered to the mouse brain can clear Aβ plaques and intranasal delivery (especially with collagen as a vehicle) is a fast and easy application. However, it must be considered that intranasal neprilysin may also activate more plaque production in the transgenic mouse brain as a side effect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Alpha‐Synuclein Oligomers and Neurofilament Light Chain Predict Phenoconversion of Pure Autonomic Failure</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26089</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26089?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
To explore the role of alpha‐synuclein (αSyn) oligomers and neurofilament light chain (NfL) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with pure autonomic failure (PAF) as markers of future phenoconversion to multiple system atrophy (MSA).


Methods
Well‐characterized patients with PAF (n=32) were enrolled between June 2016 and February 2019 at Mayo Clinic Rochester and followed prospectively with annual visits to determine future phenoconversion to MSA, Parkinson's disease (PD), or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). ELISA was utilized to measure NfL and protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) to detect αSyn oligomers in CSF collected at baseline.


Results
Patients were followed for a median of 3.9 years. 5 patients converted to MSA, 2 to PD, and 2 to DLB. NfL at baseline was elevated only in patients who later developed MSA, perfectly separating those from future PD and DLB converters as well as non‐converters. ASyn‐PMCA was positive in all but 2 cases (94%). The PMCA reaction was markedly different in 5 samples with maximum fluorescence and reaction kinetics previously described in MSA patients; all of these patients later developed MSA.


Interpretation
αSyn‐PMCA is almost invariably positive in the CSF of patients with PAF establishing this condition as α‐synucleinopathy. Both NfL and the magnitude and reaction kinetics of αSyn PMCA faithfully predict which PAF patients will eventually phenoconvert to MSA. This finding has important implications not only for prognostication, but also for future trials of disease modifying therapies, allowing for differentiation of MSA from Lewy body synucleinopathies before motor symptoms develop.

Two of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines currently approved in the United States require 2 doses, administered 3 to 4 weeks apart. Constraints in vaccine supply and distribution capacity, together with a deadly wave of COVID-19 from November 2020 to January 2021 and the emergence of highly contagious Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants, sparked a policy debate on whether to vaccinate more individuals with the first dose of available vaccines and delay the second dose or to continue with the recommended 2-dose series as tested in clinical trials. We developed an agent-based model of COVID-19 transmission to compare the impact of these 2 vaccination strategies, while varying the temporal waning of vaccine efficacy following the first dose and the level of preexisting immunity in the population. Our results show that for Moderna vaccines, a delay of at least 9 weeks could maximize vaccination program effectiveness and avert at least an additional 17.3 (95% credible interval [CrI]: 7.8–29.7) infections, 0.69 (95% CrI: 0.52–0.97) hospitalizations, and 0.34 (95% CrI: 0.25–0.44) deaths per 10,000 population compared to the recommended 4-week interval between the 2 doses. Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines also averted an additional 0.60 (95% CrI: 0.37–0.89) hospitalizations and 0.32 (95% CrI: 0.23–0.45) deaths per 10,000 population in a 9-week delayed second dose (DSD) strategy compared to the 3-week recommended schedule between doses. However, there was no clear advantage of delaying the second dose with Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines in reducing infections, unless the efficacy of the first dose did not wane over time. Our findings underscore the importance of quantifying the characteristics and durability of vaccine-induced protection after the first dose in order to determine the optimal time interval between the 2 doses.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/d_fuvUtzhhI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
Neurodegenerative movement disorders, such as Huntington's disease (HD), share a progressive and relentless course with increasing motor disability, linked with neuropsychiatric impairment. These diseases exhibit diverse pathophysiological processes and are a topic of intense experimental and clinical research due to the lack of therapeutic options. Restorative therapies are promising approaches with the potential to restore brain circuits. However, there were less compelling results in the few clinical trials. In this review, we discuss cell replacement therapies applied to animal models and HD patients. We thoroughly describe the initial trials using fetal neural tissue transplantation and recent approaches based on alternative cell sources tested in several animal models. Stem cells were shown to generate the desired neuron phenotype and/or provide growth factors to the degenerating host cells. Besides, genetic approaches such as RNA interference and the CRISPR/Cas9 system have been studied in animal models and human‐derived cells. New genetic manipulations have revealed the capability to control or counteract the effect of human gene mutations as described by the use of antisense oligonucleotides in a clinical trial. In HD, innovative strategies are at forefront of human testing and thus other brain genetic diseases may follow similar therapeutic strategies.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Longitudinal Intravital Imaging Nerve Degeneration and Sprouting in the Toes of Spared Nerve Injured Mice</title>

	<description>We have developed a method for the longitudinal intravital observation of changes in peripheral nerve fibers. This method provides a high‐resolution approach for investigating epidermal and dermal nerve terminals as well as nerve plexuses and were extremely stable for at least 28 days. Using the SNI model, we found that the degeneration of the peripheral nerve terminals and plexuses over 2–3 days was aligned closely with the initiation of mechanical hypersensitivity. In addition, we obtained clear images of sprouting in the lateral part of the paw, which may be related to the maintenance of neuropathic pain symptoms.







Abstract
Neuropathic pain is pain caused by damage to the somatosensory nervous system. Both degenerating injured nerves and neighboring sprouting nerves can contribute to neuropathic pain. However, the mesoscale changes in cutaneous nerve fibers over time after the loss of the parent nerve has not been investigated in detail. In this study, we followed the changes in nerve fibers longitudinally in the toe tips of mice that had undergone spared nerve injury (SNI). Nav1.8‐tdTomato, Thy1‐GFP and MrgD‐GFP mice were used to observe the small and large cutaneous nerve fibers. We found that peripheral nerve plexuses degenerated within three days of nerve injury, and free nerve endings in the epidermis degenerated within two days. The timing of degeneration paralleled the initiation of mechanical hypersensitivity. We also found that some of the Nav1.8‐positive nerve plexuses and free nerve endings in the fifth toe survived, and sprouting occurred mostly from 7–28 days. The timing of the sprouting of nerve fibers in the fifth toe paralleled the maintenance phase of mechanical hypersensitivity. Our results support the hypotheses that both injured and intact nerve fibers participate in neuropathic pain, and that, specifically, nerve degeneration is related to the initiation of evoked pain and nerve sprouting is related to the maintenance of evoked pain.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: The Hidden Brain: Uncovering Previously Overlooked Brain Regions by Employing Novel Preclinical Unbiased Network Approaches</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A large focus of modern neuroscience has revolved around preselected brain regions of interest based on prior studies. While there are reasons to focus on brain regions implicated in prior work, the result has been a biased assessment of brain function. Thus, many brain regions that may prove crucial in a wide range of neurobiological problems, including neurodegenerative diseases and neuropsychiatric disorders, have been neglected. Advances in neuroimaging and computational neuroscience have made it possible to make unbiased assessments of whole-brain function and identify previously overlooked regions of the brain. This review will discuss the tools that have been developed to advance neuroscience and network-based computational approaches used to further analyze the interconnectivity of the brain. Furthermore, it will survey examples of neural network approaches that assess connectivity in clinical (i.e., human) and preclinical (i.e., animal model) studies and discuss how preclinical studies of neurodegenerative diseases and neuropsychiatric disorders can greatly benefit from the unbiased nature of whole-brain imaging and network neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Pathogenic Functions of Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Factor 6 Signaling Following Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.629910</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuroinflammation contributes to delayed (secondary) neurodegeneration following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) signaling may promote post-TBI neuroinflammation, thereby exacerbating secondary injury. This study investigated the pathogenic functions of TRAF6 signaling following TBI in vivo and in vitro. A rat TBI model was established by air pressure contusion while lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure was used to induce inflammatory-like responses in cultured astrocytes. Model rats were examined for cell-specific expression of TRAF6, NF-κB, phosphorylated (p)-NF-κB, MAPKs (ERK, JNK, and p38), p-MAPKs, chemokines (CCL2 and CXCL1), and chemokine receptors (CCR2 and CXCR2) by immunofluorescence, RT-qPCR, western blotting, and ELISA, for apoptosis by TUNEL staining, and spatial cognition by Morris water maze testing. These measurements were compared between TBI model rats receiving intracerebral injections of TRAF6-targeted RNAi vector (AAV9-TRAF6-RNAi), empty vector, MAPK/NF-κB inhibitors, or vehicle. Primary astrocytes were stimulated with LPS following TRAF6 siRNA or control transfection, and NF-κB, MAPKs, chemokine, and chemokine receptor expression levels evaluated by western blotting and ELISA. TRAF6 was expressed mainly in astrocytes and neurons of injured cortex, peaking 3 days post-TBI. Knockdown by AAV9-TRAF6-RNAi improved spatial learning and memory, decreased TUNEL-positive cell number in injured cortex, and downregulated expression levels of p-NF-κB, p-ERK, p-JNK, p-p38, CCL2, CCR2, CXCL1, and CXCR2 post-TBI. Inhibitors of NF-κB, ERK, JNK, and p38 significantly suppressed CCL2, CCR2, CXCL1, and CXCR2 expression following TBI. Furthermore, TRAF6-siRNA inhibited LPS-induced NF-κB, ERK, JNK, p38, CCL2, and CXCL1 upregulation in cultured astrocytes. Targeting TRAF6-MAPKs/NF-κB-chemokine signaling pathways may provide a novel therapeutic approach for reducing post-TBI neuroinflammation and concomitant secondary injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Occipital Horn Syndrome as a Result of Splice Site Mutations in ATP7A. No Activity of ATP7A Splice Variants Missing Exon 10 or Exon 15</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.532291</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Disease-causing variants in ATP7A lead to two different phenotypes associated with copper deficiency; a lethal form called Menkes disease (MD), leading to early death, and a much milder form called occipital horn syndrome (OHS). Some investigators have proposed that an ATP7A transcript missing exon 10 leads to a partly active protein product resulting in the OHS phenotype. Here, we describe an individual with OHS, a biology professor, who survived until age 62 despite a splice site mutation, leading to skipping of exon 15. ATP7A transcripts missing exon 10, or exon 15 preserve the reading frame, but it is unknown if either of these alternative transcripts encode functional protein variants. We have investigated the molecular consequence of splice site mutations leading to skipping of exon 10 or exon 15 which have been identified in individuals with OHS, or MD. By comparing ATP7A expression in fibroblasts from three individuals with OHS (OHS-fibroblasts) to ATP7A expression in fibroblasts from two individuals with MD (MD-fibroblasts), we demonstrate that transcripts missing either exon 10 or exon 15 were present in similar amounts in OHS-fibroblasts and MD-fibroblasts. No ATP7A protein encoded from these transcripts could be detected in the OHS and MD fibroblast. These results, combined with the observation that constructs encoding ATP7A cDNA sequences missing either exon 10, or exon 15 were unable to complement the high iron requirement of the ccc2Δ yeast strain, provide evidence that neither a transcript missing exon 10 nor a transcript missing exon 15 results in functional ATP7A protein. In contrast, higher amounts of wild-type ATP7A transcript were present in the OHS-fibroblasts compared with the MD-fibroblasts. We found that the MD-fibroblasts contained between 0 and 0.5% of wild-type ATP7A transcript, whereas the OHS-fibroblasts contained between 3 and 5% wild-type transcripts compared with the control fibroblasts. In summary these results indicate that protein variants encoded by ATP7A transcripts missing either exon 10 or exon 15 are not functional and not responsible for the OHS phenotype. In contrast, expression of only 3-5% of wild-type transcript compared with the controls permits the OHS phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Functional Connectivity of the Human Paraventricular Thalamic Nucleus: Insights From High Field Functional MRI</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2021.662293</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2021.662293</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) is a small but highly connected nucleus of the dorsal midline thalamus. The PVT has garnered recent attention as a context-sensitive node within the thalamocortical arousal system that modulates state-dependent motivated behaviors. Once considered related to generalized arousal responses with non-specific impacts on behavior, accumulating evidence bolsters the contemporary view that discrete midline thalamic subnuclei belong to specialized corticolimbic and corticostriatal circuits related to attention, emotions, and cognition. However, the functional connectivity patterns of the human PVT have yet to be mapped. Here, we combined high-quality, high-resolution 7T and 3T resting state MRI data from 121 young adult participants from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and thalamic subnuclei atlas masks to investigate resting state functional connectivity of the human PVT. The 7T results demonstrated extensive positive functional connectivity with the brainstem, midbrain, ventral and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), anterior and posterior cingulate, ventral striatum, hippocampus, and amygdala. These connections persist upon controlling for functional connectivity of the rest of the thalamus. Whole-brain contrasts provided further evidence that, compared to three nearby midline thalamic subnuclei, functional connectivity of the PVT is strong with the hippocampus, amygdala, ventral and dorsal mPFC, and middle temporal gyrus. These findings suggest that, even during rest, the human PVT is functionally coupled with many regions known to be structurally connected to rodent and non-human primate PVT. Further, cosine similarity analysis results suggested the PVT is integrated into the default mode network (DMN), an intrinsic connectivity network associated with episodic memory and self-referential thought. The current work provides a much-needed foundation for ongoing and future work examining the functional roles of the PVT in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We derive a theoretical construct that allows for the characterisation of both scalable and scale free systems within the dynamic causal modelling (DCM) framework. We define a dynamical system to be “scalable” if the same equation of motion continues to apply as the system changes in size. As an example of such a system, we simulate planetary orbits varying in size and show that our proposed methodology can be used to recover Kepler’s third law from the timeseries. In contrast, a “scale free” system is one in which there is no characteristic length scale, meaning that images of such a system are statistically unchanged at different levels of magnification. As an example of such a system, we use calcium imaging collected in murine cortex and show that the dynamical critical exponent, as defined in renormalization group theory, can be estimated in an empirical biological setting. We find that a task-relevant region of the cortex is associated with higher dynamical critical exponents in task vs. spontaneous states and vice versa for a task-irrelevant region.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: A Computational Model of Working Memory Based on Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Working memory is closely involved in various cognitive activities, but its neural mechanism is still under exploration. The mainstream view has long been that persistent activity is the neural basis of working memory, but recent experiments have observed that activity-silent memory can also be correctly recalled. The underlying mechanism of activity-silent memory is considered to be an alternative scheme that rejects the theory of persistent activity. We propose a working memory model based on spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). Different from models based on spike-rate coding, our model adopts temporal patterns of action potentials to represent information, so it can flexibly encode new memory representation. The model can work in both persistent and silent states, i.e., it is compatible with both of these seemingly conflicting neural mechanisms. We conducted a simulation experiment, and the results are similar to the real experimental results, which suggests that our model is plausible in biology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Activity Stabilization in a Population Model of Working Memory by Sinusoidal and Noisy Inputs</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.647944</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;According to mechanistic theories of working memory (WM), information is retained as stimulus-dependent persistent spiking activity of cortical neural networks. Yet, how this activity is related to changes in the oscillatory profile observed during WM tasks remains a largely open issue. We explore joint effects of input gamma-band oscillations and noise on the dynamics of several firing rate models of WM. The considered models have a metastable active regime, i.e., they demonstrate long-lasting transient post-stimulus firing rate elevation. We start from a single excitatory-inhibitory circuit and demonstrate that either gamma-band or noise input could stabilize the active regime, thus supporting WM retention. We then consider a system of two circuits with excitatory intercoupling. We find that fast coupling allows for better stabilization by common noise compared to independent noise and stronger amplification of this effect by in-phase gamma inputs compared to anti-phase inputs. Finally, we consider a multi-circuit system comprised of two clusters, each containing a group of circuits receiving a common noise input and a group of circuits receiving independent noise. Each cluster is associated with its own local gamma generator, so all its circuits receive gamma-band input in the same phase. We find that gamma-band input differentially stabilizes the activity of the “common-noise” groups compared to the “independent-noise” groups. If the inter-cluster connections are fast, this effect is more pronounced when the gamma-band input is delivered to the clusters in the same phase rather than in the anti-phase. Assuming that the common noise comes from a large-scale distributed WM representation, our results demonstrate that local gamma oscillations can stabilize the activity of the corresponding parts of this representation, with stronger effect for fast long-range connections and synchronized gamma oscillations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Computational models of neural circuits with varying levels of biophysical detail have been generated in pursuit of an underlying mechanism explaining the ubiquitous hippocampal theta rhythm. However, within the theta rhythm are at least two types with distinct frequencies associated with different behavioral states, an aspect that must be considered in pursuit of these mechanistic explanations. Here, using our previously developed excitatory-inhibitory network models that generate theta rhythms, we investigate the robustness of theta generation to intrinsic neuronal variability by building a database of heterogeneous excitatory cells and implementing them in our microcircuit model. We specifically investigate the impact of three key “building block” features of the excitatory cell model that underlie our model design: these cells' rheobase, their capacity for post-inhibitory rebound, and their spike-frequency adaptation. We show that theta rhythms at various frequencies can arise dependent upon the combination of these building block features, and we find that the speed of these oscillations are dependent upon the excitatory cells' response to inhibitory drive, as encapsulated by their phase response curves. Taken together, these findings support a hypothesis for theta frequency control that includes two aspects: (i) an internal mechanism that stems from the building block features of excitatory cell dynamics; (ii) an external mechanism that we describe as “inhibition-based tuning” of excitatory cell firing. We propose that these mechanisms control theta rhythm frequencies and underlie their robustness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Altered Phase Separation and Cellular Impact in C9orf72-Linked ALS/FTD</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.664151</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Since the discovery of the C9orf72 repeat expansion mutation as causative for chromosome 9-linked amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) in 2011, a multitude of cellular pathways have been implicated. However, evidence has also been accumulating for a key mechanism of cellular compartmentalization—phase separation. Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is fundamental for the formation of membraneless organelles including stress granules, the nucleolus, Cajal bodies, nuclear speckles and the central channel of the nuclear pore. Evidence has now accumulated showing that the formation and function of these membraneless organelles is impaired by both the toxic arginine rich dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs), translated from the C9orf72 repeat RNA transcript, and the repeat RNA itself. Both the arginine rich DPRs and repeat RNA themselves undergo phase separation and disrupt the physiological phase separation of proteins involved in the formation of these liquid-like organelles. Hence abnormal phase separation may explain a number of pathological cellular phenomena associated with C9orf72-ALS/FTD. In this review article, we will discuss the principles of phase separation, phase separation of the DPRs and repeat RNA themselves and how they perturb LLPS associated with membraneless organelles and the functional consequences of this. We will then discuss how phase separation may impact the major pathological feature of C9orf72-ALS/FTD, TDP-43 proteinopathy, and how LLPS may be targeted therapeutically in disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Inflammation-Mediated Angiogenesis in Ischemic Stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.652647</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stroke is the leading cause of disability and mortality in the world, but the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke (IS) is not completely clear and treatments are limited. Mounting evidence indicate that neovascularization is a critical defensive reaction to hypoxia that modulates the process of long-term neurologic recovery after IS. Angiogenesis is a complex process in which the original endothelial cells in blood vessels are differentiated, proliferated, migrated, and finally remolded into new blood vessels. Many immune cells and cytokines, as well as growth factors, are directly or indirectly involved in the regulation of angiogenesis. Inflammatory cells can affect endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and activation by secreting a variety of cytokines via various inflammation-relative signaling pathways and thus participate in the process of angiogenesis. However, the mechanism of inflammation-mediated angiogenesis has not been fully elucidated. Hence, this review aimed to discuss the mechanism of inflammation-mediated angiogenesis in IS and to provide new ideas for clinical treatment of IS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Hippocampal and Hippocampal-Subfield Volumes From Early-Onset Major Depression and Bipolar Disorder to Cognitive Decline</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: The hippocampus and its subfields (HippSub) are reported to be diminished in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD). We examined these groups vs healthy controls (HC) to reveal HippSub alterations between diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We segmented 3T-MRI T2-weighted hippocampal images of 67 HC, 58 BD, and MDD patients from the AFFDIS study and 137 patients from the DELCODE study assessing cognitive decline, including subjective cognitive decline (SCD), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and AD, via Free Surfer 6.0 to compare volumes across groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Groups differed significantly in several HippSub volumes, particularly between patients with AD and mood disorders. In comparison to HC, significant lower volumes appear in aMCI and AD groups in specific subfields. Smaller volumes in the left presubiculum are detected in aMCI and AD patients, differing from the BD group. A significant linear regression is seen between left hippocampus volume and duration since the first depressive episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: HippSub volume alterations were observed in AD, but not in early-onset MDD and BD, reinforcing the notion of different neural mechanisms in hippocampal degeneration. Moreover, duration since the first depressive episode was a relevant factor explaining the lower left hippocampal volumes present in groups.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: DHCR24 Knock-Down Induced Tau Hyperphosphorylation at Thr181, Ser199, Thr231, Ser262, Ser396 Epitopes and Inhibition of Autophagy by Overactivation of GSK3β/mTOR Signaling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.513605</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.513605</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Accumulating evidences supported that knock-down of DHCR24 is linked to the pathological risk factors of AD, suggesting a potential role of DHCR24 in AD pathogenesis. However, the molecular mechanism link between DHCR24 and tauopathy remains unknown. Here, in order to elucidate the relationship between DHCR24 and tauopathy, we will focus on the effect of DHCR24 on the tau hyperphosphorylation at some toxic sites. In present study, we found that DHCR24 knock-down significantly lead to the hyperphosphorylation of tau sites at Thr181, Ser199, Thr231, Ser262, Ser396. Moreover, DHCR24 knock-down also increase the accumulation of p62 protein, simultaneously decreased the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I and the number of autophagosome compared to the control groups, suggesting the inhibition of autophagy activity. In contrast, DHCR24 knock-in obviously abolished the effect of DHCR24 knock-down on tau hyperphosphrylation and autophagy. In addition, to elucidate the association between DHCR24 and tauopathy, we further showed that the level of plasma membrane cholesterol, lipid raft-anchored protein caveolin-1, and concomitantly total I class PI3-K (p110α), phospho-Akt (Thr308 and Ser473) were significantly decreased, resulting in the disruption of lipid raft/caveola and inhibition of PI3-K/Akt signaling in silencing DHCR24 SH-SY5Y cells compared to control groups. At the same time, DHCR24 knock-down simultaneously decreased the level of phosphorylated GSK3β at Ser9 (inactive form) and increased the level of phosphorylated mTOR at Ser2448 (active form), leading to overactivation of GSK3β and mTOR signaling. On the contrary, DHCR24 knock-in largely increased the level of membrane cholesterol and caveolin-1, suggesting the enhancement of lipid raft/caveola. And synchronously DHCR24 knock-in also abolished the effect of DHCR24 knock-down on the inhibition of PI3-K/Akt signaling as well as the overactivation of GSK3β and mTOR signaling. Collectively, our data strongly supported DHCR24 knock-down lead to tau hyperphosphorylation and the inhibition of autophagy by a lipid raft-dependent PI3-K/Akt-mediated GSK3β and mTOR signaling. Taking together, our results firstly demonstrated that the decrease of plasma membrane cholesterol mediated by DHCR24 deficiency might contribute to the tauopathy in AD and other tauopathies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Brain mosaic mutations are a major cause of refractory focal epilepsies with cortical malformations such as focal cortical dysplasia, hemimegalencephaly, malformation of cortical development with oligodendroglial hyperplasia in epilepsy, and ganglioglioma. Here, we collected cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during epilepsy surgery to search for somatic variants in cell‐free DNA (cfDNA) using targeted droplet digital polymerase chain reaction. In 3 of 12 epileptic patients with known somatic mutations previously identified in brain tissue, we here provide evidence that brain mosaicism can be detected in the CSF‐derived cfDNA. These findings suggest future opportunities for detecting the mutant allele driving epilepsy in CSF. ANN NEUROL 2021</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Vessel network extraction and analysis of mouse pulmonary vasculature via X-ray micro-computed tomographic imaging</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Eric A. Chadwick, Takaya Suzuki, Michael G. George, David A. Romero, Cristina Amon, Thomas K. Waddell, Golnaz Karoubi, Aimy Bazylak&lt;/p&gt;

In this work, non-invasive high-spatial resolution three-dimensional (3D) X-ray micro-computed tomography (μCT) of healthy mouse lung vasculature is performed. Methodologies are presented for filtering, segmenting, and skeletonizing the collected 3D images. Novel methods for the removal of spurious branch artefacts from the skeletonized 3D image are introduced, and these novel methods involve a combination of distance transform gradients, diameter-length ratios, and the fast marching method (FMM). These new techniques of spurious branch removal result in the consistent removal of spurious branches without compromising the connectivity of the pulmonary circuit. Analysis of the filtered, skeletonized, and segmented 3D images is performed using a newly developed Vessel Network Extraction algorithm to fully characterize the morphology of the mouse pulmonary circuit. The removal of spurious branches from the skeletonized image results in an accurate representation of the pulmonary circuit with significantly less variability in vessel diameter and vessel length in each generation. The branching morphology of a full pulmonary circuit is characterized by the mean diameter per generation and number of vessels per generation. The methods presented in this paper lead to a significant improvement in the characterization of 3D vasculature imaging, allow for automatic separation of arteries and veins, and for the characterization of generations containing capillaries and intrapulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses (IPAVA).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/h1OQ5sc_iwg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: How accurately can we assess zoonotic risk?</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Michelle Wille, Jemma L. Geoghegan, Edward C. Holmes&lt;/p&gt;

Identifying the animal reservoirs from which zoonotic viruses will likely emerge is central to understanding the determinants of disease emergence. Accordingly, there has been an increase in studies attempting zoonotic “risk assessment.” Herein, we demonstrate that the virological data on which these analyses are conducted are incomplete, biased, and rapidly changing with ongoing virus discovery. Together, these shortcomings suggest that attempts to assess zoonotic risk using available virological data are likely to be inaccurate and largely only identify those host taxa that have been studied most extensively. We suggest that virus surveillance at the human–animal interface may be more productive.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0mmobxPO1rg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: The Gut Microbiome in Progressive Multiple Sclerosis</title>

	<description>Objective
Investigate the gut microbiome in progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) and how it relates to clinical disease.


Methods
We sequenced the microbiota from healthy controls, relapsing remitting MS (RRMS), and progressive MS patients and correlated the levels of bacteria with clinical features of disease, including EDSS, quality of life, and brain MRI lesions/atrophy. We colonized mice with MS‐derived Akkermansia and induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.


Results
Microbiota β‐diversity differed between MS patients vs. controls but did not differ between RRMS vs. progressive MS or differ based on disease modifying therapies. Disease status had the greatest effect on the microbiome β‐diversity, followed by BMI, race, and sex. In both progressive and RRMS, we found increased Clostridium bolteae, Ruthenibacterium lactatiformans and Akkermansia and decreased Blautia wexlerae, Dorea formicigenerans, and Erysipelotrichaceae CCM. Unique to progressive MS, we found elevated Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridium g24 FCEY and decreased Blautia and Agathobaculum. Several Clostridium species were associated with higher EDSS and fatigue scores. Contrary to the view that elevated Akkermansia in MS has a detrimental role, we found that Akkermansia was linked to lower disability, suggesting a beneficial role. Consistent with this, we found that Akkermansia isolated from MS patients ameliorated EAE, which was linked to a reduction in RORγt+ and IL‐17 producing γδ T cells.


Interpretation
While some microbiota alterations are shared in relapsing and progressive MS, we identified unique bacteria associated with progressive MS and clinical measures of disease. Furthermore, elevated Akkermansia in MS may be a compensatory beneficial response in the MS microbiome.

	<description>Introduction&lt;p&gt;The present pilot study examined to what extent the COVID-19 lockdown affected the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in people with dementia and worsened their family caregivers’ distress. The associations between changes in the BPSD of relatives with dementia (RwD) and in their caregivers’ distress, and sense of social and emotional loneliness, and resilience were also investigated.&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;Thirty-five caregivers of RwD attending formal healthcare services before the COVID-19 lockdown volunteered for the study, and were interviewed by phone during the lockdown. Caregivers completed the NeuroPsychiatric Inventory (NPI) to assess their care recipients’ BPSD and their own distress, and two questionnaires assessing their social and emotional loneliness, and their resilience.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;No clear changes emerged in either the BPSD of the RwD or the caregivers’ distress during lockdown compared with before the pandemic. Caregivers reporting more frequent and severe BPSD in their RwD before the lockdown scored higher on emotional loneliness. Those reporting more frequent and severe BPSD under lockdown, especially men and those taking care of RwD with more advanced dementia, scored higher on both social and emotional loneliness. A significant negative correlation also emerged between caregivers’ resilience and changes in their level of distress due to the lockdown, with female caregivers reporting greater resilience.&lt;/p&gt;Discussion&lt;p&gt;Our findings offer preliminary insight on the effects of loneliness and resilience, and on the influence of individual characteristics on the experience and consequences of informal caregiving for RwD in times of restrictions imposed by a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Cnr2 Is Important for Ribbon Synapse Maturation and Function in Hair Cells and Photoreceptors</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The role of the cannabinoid receptor 2 (CNR2) is still poorly described in sensory epithelia. We found strong cnr2 expression in hair cells (HCs) of the inner ear and the lateral line (LL), a superficial sensory structure in fish. Next, we demonstrated that sensory synapses in HCs were severely perturbed in larvae lacking cnr2. Appearance and distribution of presynaptic ribbons and calcium channels (Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.3) were profoundly altered in mutant animals. Clustering of membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) in post-synaptic densities (PSDs) was also heavily affected, suggesting a role for cnr2 for maintaining the sensory synapse. Furthermore, vesicular trafficking in HCs was strongly perturbed suggesting a retrograde action of the endocannabinoid system (ECs) via cnr2 that was modulating HC mechanotransduction. We found similar perturbations in retinal ribbon synapses. Finally, we showed that larval swimming behaviors after sound and light stimulations were significantly different in mutant animals. Thus, we propose that cnr2 is critical for the processing of sensory information in the developing larva.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stem cell scientists have developed methods for the self-formation of artificial organs, often referred to as organoids. Organoids can be used as model systems for research in multiple biological disciplines. Yoshiki Sasai’s innovation for deriving mammalian retinal tissue from in vitro stem cells has had a large impact on the study of the biology of vision. New developments in retinal organoid technology provide avenues for in vitro models of human retinal diseases, studies of pathological mechanisms, and development of therapies for retinal degeneration, including electronic retinal implants and gene therapy. Moreover, these innovations have played key roles in establishing models for large-scale drug screening, studying the stages of retinal development, and providing a human model for personalized therapeutic approaches, like cell transplants to replace degenerated retinal cells. Here, we first discuss the importance of human retinal organoids to the biomedical sciences. Then, we review various functional features of retinal organoids that have been developed. Finally, we highlight the current limitations of retinal organoid technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Vascular Senescence: A Potential Bridge Between Physiological Aging and Neurogenic Decline</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The adult mammalian brain contains distinct neurogenic niches harboring populations of neural stem cells (NSCs) with the capacity to sustain the generation of specific subtypes of neurons during the lifetime. However, their ability to produce new progeny declines with age. The microenvironment of these specialized niches provides multiple cellular and molecular signals that condition NSC behavior and potential. Among the different niche components, vasculature has gained increasing interest over the years due to its undeniable role in NSC regulation and its therapeutic potential for neurogenesis enhancement. NSCs are uniquely positioned to receive both locally secreted factors and adhesion-mediated signals derived from vascular elements. Furthermore, studies of parabiosis indicate that NSCs are also exposed to blood-borne factors, sensing and responding to the systemic circulation. Both structural and functional alterations occur in vasculature with age at the cellular level that can affect the proper extrinsic regulation of NSCs. Additionally, blood exchange experiments in heterochronic parabionts have revealed that age-associated changes in blood composition also contribute to adult neurogenesis impairment in the elderly. Although the mechanisms of vascular- or blood-derived signaling in aging are still not fully understood, a general feature of organismal aging is the accumulation of senescent cells, which act as sources of inflammatory and other detrimental signals that can negatively impact on neighboring cells. This review focuses on the interactions between vascular senescence, circulating pro-senescence factors and the decrease in NSC potential during aging. Understanding the mechanisms of NSC dynamics in the aging brain could lead to new therapeutic approaches, potentially include senolysis, to target age-dependent brain decline.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Lipoprotein-Associated Phospholipase A2 Is a Risk Factor for Patients With Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.633022</guid>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;To explore the association between lipoprotein-related phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) and the risk of Parkinson’s disease (PD).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A case-control study involving 58 hospitalized PD patients and 60 healthy controls was carried out. Serum Lp-PLA2 level was detected. According to the disease course and severity, PD patients were subdivided to analyze the clinical value of Lp-PLA2. Relationship between Lp-PLA2 and PD risk was analyzed by logistic regression. Diagnostic value of Lp-PLA2 in PD patients was investigated using receiver’s operator characteristic curves.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Lp-PLA2 level was significantly higher in the PD patients compared with the controls, and was significantly and positively correlated with the Hoehn-Yahr (H&amp;amp;Y) stage. The serum Lp-PLA2 level and H&amp;amp;Y stage of PD patients with a longer disease course were significantly higher than those with a shorter disease course. PD patients with milder conditions had significantly lower serum Lp-PLA2 levels than patients with severe conditions. Multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated higher Lp-PLA2 level was an independent risk factor of PD patients. Moreover, the area under the curve for Lp-PLA2 was 0.703, which was between those of homocysteine and serum amylase A.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that increased level of Lp-PLA2 is associated with the risk of PD. Lp-PLA2 may be used for early detection of PD, and provides an effective intervention target for clinical treatment of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Voxel-Wise Feature Selection Method for CNN Binary Classification of Neuroimaging Data</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.630747</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.630747</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Voxel-wise group analysis is presented as a novel feature selection (FS) technique for a deep learning (DL) approach to brain imaging data classification. The method, based on a voxel-wise two-sample t-test and denoted as t-masking, is integrated into the learning procedure as a data-driven FS strategy. t-Masking has been introduced in a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the test bench of binary classification of very-mild Alzheimer’s disease vs. normal control, using a structural magnetic resonance imaging dataset of 180 subjects. To better characterize the t-masking impact on CNN classification performance, six different experimental configurations were designed. Moreover, the performances of the presented FS method were compared to those of similar machine learning (ML) models that relied on different FS approaches. Overall, our results show an enhancement of about 6% in performance when t-masking was applied. Moreover, the reported performance enhancement was higher with respect to similar FS-based ML models. In addition, evaluation of the impact of t-masking on various selection rates has been provided, serving as a useful characterization for future insights. The proposed approach is also highly generalizable to other DL architectures, neuroimaging modalities, and brain pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Ventral Striatal Activation During Reward Anticipation of Different Reward Probabilities in Adolescents and Adults</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.649724</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.649724</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Adolescence has been linked to an enhanced tolerance of uncertainty and risky behavior and is possibly connected to an increased response toward rewards. However, previous research has produced inconsistent findings. To investigate whether these findings are due to different reward probabilities used in the experimental design, we extended a monetary incentive delay (MID) task by including three different reward probabilities. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, 25 healthy adolescents and 22 adults were studied during anticipation of rewards in the VS. Differently colored cue stimuli indicated either a monetary or verbal trial and symbolized different reward probabilities, to which the participants were blinded. Results demonstrated faster reaction times for lower reward probabilities (33%) in both age groups. Adolescents were slower through all conditions and had less activation on a neural level. Imaging results showed a three-way interaction between age group x condition x reward probability with differences in percent signal change between adolescents and adults for the high reward probabilities (66%, 88%) while adolescents demonstrated differences for the lowest (33%). Therefore, previous inconsistent findings could be due to different reward probabilities, which makes examining these crucial for a better understanding of adolescent and adult behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Lost in Translation: Simple Steps in Experimental Design of Neurorehabilitation-Based Research Interventions to Promote Motor Recovery Post-Stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.644335</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.644335</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stroke continues to be a leading cause of disability. Basic neurorehabilitation research is necessary to inform the neuropathophysiology of impaired motor control, and to develop targeted interventions with potential to remediate disability post-stroke. Despite knowledge gained from basic research studies, the effectiveness of research-based interventions for reducing motor impairment has been no greater than standard of practice interventions. In this perspective, we offer suggestions for overcoming translational barriers integral to experimental design, to augment traditional protocols, and re-route the rehabilitation trajectory toward recovery and away from compensation. First, we suggest that researchers consider modifying task practice schedules to focus on key aspects of movement quality, while minimizing the appearance of compensatory behaviors. Second, we suggest that researchers supplement primary outcome measures with secondary measures that capture emerging maladaptive compensations at other segments or joints. Third, we offer suggestions about how to maximize participant engagement, self-direction, and motivation, by embedding the task into a meaningful context, a strategy more likely to enable goal-action coupling, associated with improved neuro-motor control and learning. Finally, we remind the reader that motor impairment post-stroke is a multidimensional problem that involves central and peripheral sensorimotor systems, likely influenced by chronicity of stroke. Thus, stroke chronicity should be given special consideration for both participant recruitment and subsequent data analyses. We hope that future research endeavors will consider these suggestions in the design of the next generation of intervention studies in neurorehabilitation, to improve translation of research advances to improved participation and quality of life for stroke survivors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain structural covariance network (SCN) can delineate the brain synchronized alterations in a long-range time period. It has been used in the research of cognition or neuropsychiatric disorders. Recently, causal analysis of structural covariance network (CaSCN), winner-take-all and cortex–subcortex covariance network (WTA-CSSCN), and modulation analysis of structural covariance network (MOD-SCN) have expended the technology breadth of SCN. However, the lack of user-friendly software limited the further application of SCN for the research. In this work, we developed the graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit of brain structural covariance connectivity based on MATLAB platform. The software contained the analysis of SCN, CaSCN, MOD-SCN, and WTA-CSSCN. Also, the group comparison and result-showing modules were included in the software. Furthermore, a simple showing of demo dataset was presented in the work. We hope that the toolkit could help the researchers, especially clinical researchers, to do the brain covariance connectivity analysis in further work more easily.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Pathophysiological Bases of Comorbidity in Migraine</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.640574</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.640574</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite that it is commonly accepted that migraine is a disorder of the nervous system with a prominent genetic basis, it is comorbid with a plethora of medical conditions. Several studies have found bidirectional comorbidity between migraine and different disorders including neurological, psychiatric, cardio- and cerebrovascular, gastrointestinal, metaboloendocrine, and immunological conditions. Each of these has its own genetic load and shares some common characteristics with migraine. The bidirectional mechanisms that are likely to underlie this extensive comorbidity between migraine and other diseases are manifold. Comorbid pathologies can induce and promote thalamocortical network dysexcitability, multi-organ transient or persistent pro-inflammatory state, and disproportionate energetic needs in a variable combination, which in turn may be causative mechanisms of the activation of an ample defensive system with includes the trigeminovascular system in conjunction with the neuroendocrine hypothalamic system. This strategy is designed to maintain brain homeostasis by regulating homeostatic needs, such as normal subcortico-cortical excitability, energy balance, osmoregulation, and emotional response. In this light, the treatment of migraine should always involves a multidisciplinary approach, aimed at identifying and, if necessary, eliminating possible risk and comorbidity factors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Application of the Mirror Technique for Three-Dimensional Electron Microscopy of Neurochemically Identified GABA-ergic Dendrites</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.652422</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the nervous system synaptic input arrives chiefly on dendrites and their type and distribution have been assumed pivotal in signal integration. We have developed an immunohistochemistry (IH)-correlated electron microscopy (EM) method – the “mirror” technique – by which synaptic input to entire dendrites of neurochemically identified interneurons (INs) can be mapped due preserving high-fidelity tissue ultrastructure. Hence, this approach allows quantitative assessment of morphometric parameters of synaptic inputs along the whole length of dendrites originating from the parent soma. The method exploits the fact that adjoining sections have truncated or cut cell bodies which appear on the common surfaces in a mirror fashion. In one of the sections the histochemical marker of the GABAergic subtype, calbindin was revealed in cell bodies whereas in the other section the remaining part of the very same cell bodies were subjected to serial section EM to trace and reconstruct the synaptology of entire dendrites. Here, we provide exemplary data on the synaptic coverage of two dendrites belonging to the same calbindin-D&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt; immunopositive IN and determine the spatial distribution of asymmetric and symmetric synapses, surface area and volume of the presynaptic boutons, morphometric parameters of synaptic vesicles, and area extent of the active zones.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Being the Family Caregiver of a Patient With Dementia During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Lockdown</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.653533</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.653533</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Family caregivers of patients with dementia are at high risk of stress and burden, and quarantine due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may have increased the risk of psychological disturbances in this population. The current study was carried out during the national lockdown declared in March 2020 by the Italian government as a containment measure of the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic and is the first nationwide survey on the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the mental health of dementia informal caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Eighty-seven dementia centers evenly distributed on the Italian territory enrolled 4,710 caregiver–patient pairs. Caregivers underwent a telephone interview assessing classical symptoms of caregiver stress and concern for the consequences of COVID-19 infection on patient’s health. We calculated prevalence of symptoms and regressed them on various potential stress risk factors: caregivers’ sociodemographic characteristics and lifestyle, patients’ clinical features, and lockdown-related elements, like discontinuity in medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Approximately 90% of caregivers reported at least one symptom of stress, and nearly 30% reported four or more symptoms. The most prevalent symptoms were concern for consequences of COVID-19 on patient’s health (75%) and anxiety (46%). The main risk factors for stress were identified as a conflicting relationship with the patient and discontinuity in assistance, but caregiver’s female sex, younger age, lower education, and cohabitation with the patient also had an impact. Availability of help from institutions or private individuals showed a protective effect against sense of abandonment but a detrimental effect on concern about the risk for the patient to contract COVID-19. The only protective factor was mild dementia severity, which was associated with a lower risk of feeling isolated and abandoned; type of dementia, on the other hand, did not affect stress risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the large prevalence of stress in family caregivers of patients with dementia during the COVID-19 pandemic and have identified both caregivers and situations at a higher risk of stress, which should be taken into account in the planning of interventions in support of quarantined families and patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Co-registration Analysis of Fluorodopa and Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography for Differentiating Multiple System Atrophy Parkinsonism Type From Parkinson's Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.648531</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.648531</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to differentiate between Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy parkinsonian subtype (MSA-P) because of the overlap of their signs and symptoms. Enormous efforts have been made to develop positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to differentiate these diseases. This study aimed to investigate the co-registration analysis of &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-fluorodopa and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flurodeoxyglucose PET images to visualize the difference between Parkinson's disease and MSA-P. We enrolled 29 Parkinson's disease patients, 28 MSA-P patients, and 10 healthy controls, who underwent both &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-fluorodopa and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flurodeoxyglucose PET scans. Patients with Parkinson's disease and MSA-P exhibited reduced bilateral striatal &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-fluorodopa uptake (p &amp;lt; 0.05, vs. healthy controls). Both regional specific uptake ratio analysis and statistical parametric mapping analysis of &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flurodeoxyglucose PET revealed hypometabolism in the bilateral putamen of MSA-P patients and hypermetabolism in the bilateral putamen of Parkinson's disease patients. There was a significant positive correlation between &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flurodeoxyglucose uptake and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-fluorodopa uptake in the contralateral posterior putamen of MSA-P patients (rs = 0.558, p = 0.002). Both &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flurodeoxyglucose and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-fluorodopa PET images showed that the striatum was rabbit-shaped in the healthy control group segmentation analysis. A defective rabbit-shaped striatum was observed in the &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-fluorodopa PET image of patients with Parkinson's disease and MSA-P. In the segmentation analysis of &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flurodeoxyglucose PET image, an intact rabbit-shaped striatum was observed in Parkinson's disease patients, whereas a defective rabbit-shaped striatum was observed in MSA-P patients. These findings suggest that there were significant differences in the co-registration analysis of &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flurodeoxyglucose and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-fluorodopa PET images, which could be used in the individual analysis to differentiate Parkinson's disease from MSA-P.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Elevated Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio Associated With Increased Risk of Recurrent Vascular Events in Older Minor Stroke or TIA Patients</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.646961</guid>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;The risk of recurrent stroke following a minor stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) is high, when inflammation might play an important role. We aimed to evaluate the value of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in predicting composite cardiovascular events in patients with minor stroke and TIA.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Consecutive patients with acute minor stroke or TIA admitted within 24 h of symptoms onset during a 5-year period in a prospective stroke registry were analyzed. We calculated the NLR dividing absolute neutrophil count by absolute lymphocyte count tested within 24 h of admission. NLR ≥4th quartile was defined as high NLR. A composite outcome was defined as stroke, acute coronary syndrome or vascular death within 1 year. We investigated associations between NLR and the composite outcome in univariate and multivariate analyses, among all patients and in those aged over 60 years (i.e., older patients).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Overall, 841 patients (median age 68 years; 60.4% males) were recruited. No significant independent association was found between NLR and the composite outcome in multivariate analysis in the overall cohort. Among the 612 older patients (median age 73 years; 59.2% males), the median NLR was 2.76 (interquartile range 1.96−4.00) and 148 (24.2%) patients had high NLR. The composite outcome occurred in 77 (12.6%) older patients, who were more likely to have a high NLR (39.0% versus 22.1%; p = 0.001) than those without a composite outcome. In multivariate logistic regression, high NLR (adjusted odds ratio 2.00; 95% confidence interval 1.07−3.75; p = 0.031) was independently associated with the composite outcome in older patients.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;In older (aged ≥60 years) patients with acute minor stroke or TIA, a higher NLR, a marker of systemic inflammation that can be easily obtained in routine blood tests, is an independent predictor of subsequent cardiovascular events.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;This study screened potential fluid biomarkers and developed a prediction model based on the easily obtained information at initial inspection to identify ataxia patients more likely to have multiple system atrophy-cerebellar type (MSA-C).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We established a retrospective cohort with 125 ataxia patients from southwest China between April 2018 and June 2020. Demographic and laboratory variables obtained at the time of hospital admission were screened using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression and logistic regression to construct a diagnosis score. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and decision curve analyses were performed to assess the accuracy and net benefit of the model. Also, independent validation using 25 additional ataxia patients was carried out to verify the model efficiency. Then the model was translated into a visual and operable web application using the R studio and Shiny package.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;From 47 indicators, five variables were selected and integrated into the prediction model, including the age of onset (AO), direct bilirubin (DBIL), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), eGFR, and synuclein-alpha. The prediction model exhibited an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.929 for the training cohort and an AUC of 0.917 for the testing cohort. The decision curve analysis (DCA) plot displayed a good net benefit for this model, and external validation confirmed its reliability. The model also was translated into a web application that is freely available to the public.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The prediction model that was developed based on laboratory and demographic variables obtained from ataxia patients at admission to the hospital might help improve the ability to differentiate MSA-C from spinocerebellar ataxia clinically.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The binding affinities of protein-nucleic acid interactions could be altered due to missense mutations occurring in DNA- or RNA-binding proteins, therefore resulting in various diseases. Unfortunately, a systematic comparison and prediction of the effects of mutations on protein-DNA and protein-RNA interactions (these two mutation classes are termed MPDs and MPRs, respectively) is still lacking. Here, we demonstrated that these two classes of mutations could generate similar or different tendencies for binding free energy changes in terms of the properties of mutated residues. We then developed regression algorithms separately for MPDs and MPRs by introducing novel geometric partition-based energy features and interface-based structural features. Through feature selection and ensemble learning, similar computational frameworks that integrated energy- and nonenergy-based models were established to estimate the binding affinity changes resulting from MPDs and MPRs, but the selected features for the final models were different and therefore reflected the specificity of these two mutation classes. Furthermore, the proposed methodology was extended to the identification of mutations that significantly decreased the binding affinities. Extensive validations indicated that our algorithm generally performed better than the state-of-the-art methods on both the regression and classification tasks.

The metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells creates metabolic vulnerabilities that can be therapeutically targeted. However, our understanding of metabolic dependencies and the pathway crosstalk that creates these vulnerabilities in cancer cells remains incomplete. Here, by integrating gene expression data with genetic loss-of-function and pharmacological screening data from hundreds of cancer cell lines, we identified metabolic vulnerabilities at the level of pathways rather than individual genes. This approach revealed that metabolic pathway dependencies are highly context-specific such that cancer cells are vulnerable to inhibition of one metabolic pathway only when activity of another metabolic pathway is altered. Notably, we also found that the no single metabolic pathway was universally essential, suggesting that cancer cells are not invariably dependent on any metabolic pathway. In addition, we confirmed that cell culture medium is a major confounding factor for the analysis of metabolic pathway vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, we found robust associations between metabolic pathway activity and sensitivity to clinically approved drugs that were independent of cell culture medium. Lastly, we used parallel integration of pharmacological and genetic dependency data to confidently identify metabolic pathway vulnerabilities. Taken together, this study serves as a comprehensive characterization of the landscape of metabolic pathway vulnerabilities in cancer cell lines.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QSI4-3h-Ths&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Sequence deeper without sequencing more: Bayesian resolution of ambiguously mapped reads</title>

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has transformed molecular biology and contributed to many seminal insights into genomic regulation and function. Apart from whole-genome sequencing, an NGS workflow involves alignment of the sequencing reads to the genome of study, after which the resulting alignments can be used for downstream analyses. However, alignment is complicated by the repetitive sequences; many reads align to more than one genomic locus, with 15–30% of the genome not being uniquely mappable by short-read NGS. This problem is typically addressed by discarding reads that do not uniquely map to the genome, but this practice can lead to systematic distortion of the data. Previous studies that developed methods for handling ambiguously mapped reads were often of limited applicability or were computationally intensive, hindering their broader usage. In this work, we present SmartMap: an algorithm that augments industry-standard aligners to enable usage of ambiguously mapped reads by assigning weights to each alignment with Bayesian analysis of the read distribution and alignment quality. SmartMap is computationally efficient, utilizing far fewer weighting iterations than previously thought necessary to process alignments and, as such, analyzing more than a billion alignments of NGS reads in approximately one hour on a desktop PC. By applying SmartMap to peak-type NGS data, including MNase-seq, ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq in three organisms, we can increase read depth by up to 53% and increase the mapped proportion of the genome by up to 18% compared to analyses utilizing only uniquely mapped reads. We further show that SmartMap enables the analysis of more than 140,000 repetitive elements that could not be analyzed by traditional ChIP-seq workflows, and we utilize this method to gain insight into the epigenetic regulation of different classes of repetitive elements. These data emphasize both the dangers of discarding ambiguously mapped reads and their power for driving biological discovery.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lxHOpbOVKoI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Mass Based Imaging (MBI) technologies such as Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging by time of flight (MIBI-TOF) and Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) allow for the simultaneous measurement of the expression levels of 40 or more proteins in biological tissue, providing insight into cellular phenotypes and organization &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt;. Imaging artifacts, resulting from the sample, assay or instrumentation complicate downstream analyses and require correction by domain experts. Here, we present MBI Analysis User Interface (MAUI), a series of graphical user interfaces that facilitate this data pre-processing, including the removal of channel crosstalk, noise and antibody aggregates. Our software streamlines these steps and accelerates processing by enabling real-time and interactive parameter tuning across multiple images.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OJnoGHD_DtQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Convolutional neural networks improve species distribution modelling by capturing the spatial structure of the environment</title>

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are statistical models suited for learning complex visual patterns. In the context of Species Distribution Models (SDM) and in line with predictions of landscape ecology and island biogeography, CNN could grasp how local landscape structure affects prediction of species occurrence in SDMs. The prediction can thus reflect the signatures of entangled ecological processes. Although previous machine-learning based SDMs can learn complex influences of environmental predictors, they cannot acknowledge the influence of environmental structure in local landscapes (hence denoted “punctual models”). In this study, we applied CNNs to a large dataset of plant occurrences in France (GBIF), on a large taxonomical scale, to predict ranked relative probability of species (by joint learning) to any geographical position. We examined the way local environmental landscapes improve prediction by performing alternative CNN models deprived of information on landscape heterogeneity and structure (“ablation experiments”). We found that the landscape structure around location crucially contributed to improve predictive performance of CNN-SDMs. CNN models can classify the predicted distributions of many species, as other joint modelling approaches, but they further prove efficient in identifying the influence of local environmental landscapes. CNN can then represent signatures of spatially structured environmental drivers. The prediction gain is noticeable for rare species, which open promising perspectives for biodiversity monitoring and conservation strategies. Therefore, the approach is of both theoretical and practical interest. We discuss the way to test hypotheses on the patterns learnt by CNN, which should be essential for further interpretation of the ecological processes at play.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/q7xKUcr8Ifw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Hierarchical motor adaptations negotiate failures during force field learning</title>

Humans have the amazing ability to learn the dynamics of the body and environment to develop motor skills. Traditional motor studies using arm reaching paradigms have viewed this ability as the process of ‘internal model adaptation’. However, the behaviors have not been fully explored in the case when reaches fail to attain the intended target. Here we examined human reaching under two force fields types; one that induces failures (i.e., target errors), and the other that does not. Our results show the presence of a distinct failure-driven adaptation process that enables quick task success after failures, and before completion of internal model adaptation, but that can result in persistent changes to the undisturbed trajectory. These behaviors can be explained by considering a hierarchical interaction between internal model adaptation and the failure-driven adaptation of reach direction. Our findings suggest that movement failure is negotiated using hierarchical motor adaptations by humans.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/y64_0QXQutQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Estimating Transfer Entropy in Continuous Time Between Neural Spike Trains or Other Event-Based Data</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by David P. Shorten, Richard E. Spinney, Joseph T. Lizier&lt;/p&gt;

Transfer entropy (TE) is a widely used measure of directed information flows in a number of domains including neuroscience. Many real-world time series for which we are interested in information flows come in the form of (near) instantaneous events occurring over time. Examples include the spiking of biological neurons, trades on stock markets and posts to social media, amongst myriad other systems involving events in continuous time throughout the natural and social sciences. However, there exist severe limitations to the current approach to TE estimation on such event-based data via discretising the time series into time bins: it is not consistent, has high bias, converges slowly and cannot simultaneously capture relationships that occur with very fine time precision as well as those that occur over long time intervals. Building on recent work which derived a theoretical framework for TE in continuous time, we present an estimation framework for TE on event-based data and develop a &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-nearest-neighbours estimator within this framework. This estimator is provably consistent, has favourable bias properties and converges orders of magnitude more quickly than the current state-of-the-art in discrete-time estimation on synthetic examples. We demonstrate failures of the traditionally-used source-time-shift method for null surrogate generation. In order to overcome these failures, we develop a local permutation scheme for generating surrogate time series conforming to the appropriate null hypothesis in order to test for the statistical significance of the TE and, as such, test for the conditional independence between the history of one point process and the updates of another. Our approach is shown to be capable of correctly rejecting or accepting the null hypothesis of conditional independence even in the presence of strong pairwise time-directed correlations. This capacity to accurately test for conditional independence is further demonstrated on models of a spiking neural circuit inspired by the pyloric circuit of the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion, succeeding where previous related estimators have failed.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/it9Dz-VffxU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: The dinucleotide composition of the Zika virus genome is shaped by conflicting evolutionary pressures in mammalian hosts and mosquito vectors</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jelke J. Fros, Imke Visser, Bing Tang, Kexin Yan, Eri Nakayama, Tessa M. Visser, Constantianus J. M. Koenraadt, Monique M. van Oers, Gorben P. Pijlman, Andreas Suhrbier, Peter Simmonds&lt;/p&gt;

Most vertebrate RNA viruses show pervasive suppression of CpG and UpA dinucleotides, closely resembling the dinucleotide composition of host cell transcriptomes. In contrast, CpG suppression is absent in both invertebrate mRNA and RNA viruses that exclusively infect arthropods. Arthropod-borne (arbo) viruses are transmitted between vertebrate hosts by invertebrate vectors and thus encounter potentially conflicting evolutionary pressures in the different cytoplasmic environments. Using a newly developed Zika virus (ZIKV) model, we have investigated how demands for CpG suppression in vertebrate cells can be reconciled with potentially quite different compositional requirements in invertebrates and how this affects ZIKV replication and transmission. Mutant viruses with synonymously elevated CpG or UpA dinucleotide frequencies showed attenuated replication in vertebrate cell lines, which was rescued by knockout of the zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP). Conversely, in mosquito cells, ZIKV mutants with elevated CpG dinucleotide frequencies showed substantially enhanced replication compared to wild type. Host-driven effects on virus replication attenuation and enhancement were even more apparent in mouse and mosquito models. Infections with CpG- or UpA-high ZIKV mutants in mice did not cause typical ZIKV-induced tissue damage and completely protected mice during subsequent challenge with wild-type virus, which demonstrates their potential as live-attenuated vaccines. In contrast, the CpG-high mutants displayed enhanced replication in &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes and a larger proportion of mosquitoes carried infectious virus in their saliva. These findings show that mosquito cells are also capable of discriminating RNA based on dinucleotide composition. However, the evolutionary pressure on the CpG dinucleotides of viral genomes in arthropod vectors directly opposes the pressure present in vertebrate host cells, which provides evidence that an adaptive compromise is required for arbovirus transmission. This suggests that the genome composition of arbo flaviviruses is crucial to maintain the balance between high-level replication in the vertebrate host and persistent replication in the mosquito vector.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/acvgEhXaVv8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Persisters represent a small subpopulation of non- or slow-growing bacterial cells that are tolerant to killing by antibiotics. Despite their prominent role in the recalcitrance of chronic infections to antibiotic therapy, the mechanism of their formation has remained elusive. We show that sorted cells of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; with low levels of energy-generating enzymes are better able to survive antibiotic killing. Using microfluidics time-lapse microscopy and a fluorescent reporter for in vivo ATP measurements, we find that a subpopulation of cells with a low level of ATP survives killing by ampicillin. We propose that these low ATP cells are formed stochastically as a result of fluctuations in the abundance of energy-generating components. These findings point to a general “low energy” mechanism of persister formation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/wLiBOMyGtAE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Reverse ecology is the inference of ecological information from patterns of genomic variation. One rich, heretofore underutilized, source of ecologically relevant genomic information is codon optimality or adaptation. Bias toward codons that match the tRNA pool is robustly associated with high gene expression in diverse organisms, suggesting that codon optimization could be used in a reverse ecology framework to identify highly expressed, ecologically relevant genes. To test this hypothesis, we examined the relationship between optimal codon usage in the classic galactose metabolism (&lt;i&gt;GAL&lt;/i&gt;) pathway and known ecological niches for 329 species of budding yeasts, a diverse subphylum of fungi. We find that optimal codon usage in the &lt;i&gt;GAL&lt;/i&gt; pathway is positively correlated with quantitative growth on galactose, suggesting that &lt;i&gt;GAL&lt;/i&gt; codon optimization reflects increased capacity to grow on galactose. Optimal codon usage in the &lt;i&gt;GAL&lt;/i&gt; pathway is also positively correlated with human-associated ecological niches in yeasts of the CUG-Ser1 clade and with dairy-associated ecological niches in the family Saccharomycetaceae. For example, optimal codon usage of &lt;i&gt;GAL&lt;/i&gt; genes is greater than 85% of all genes in the genome of the major human pathogen &lt;i&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt; (CUG-Ser1 clade) and greater than 75% of genes in the genome of the dairy yeast &lt;i&gt;Kluyveromyces lactis&lt;/i&gt; (family Saccharomycetaceae). We further find a correlation between optimization in the &lt;i&gt;GAL&lt;/i&gt;actose pathway genes and several genes associated with nutrient sensing and metabolism. This work suggests that codon optimization harbors information about the metabolic ecology of microbial eukaryotes. This information may be particularly useful for studying fungal dark matter—species that have yet to be cultured in the lab or have only been identified by genomic material.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/yGiZ_5eCky0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: The methodological quality of 176,620 randomized controlled trials published between 1966 and 2018 reveals a positive trend but also an urgent need for improvement</title>

Many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are biased and difficult to reproduce due to methodological flaws and poor reporting. There is increasing attention for responsible research practices and implementation of reporting guidelines, but whether these efforts have improved the methodological quality of RCTs (e.g., lower risk of bias) is unknown. We, therefore, mapped risk-of-bias trends over time in RCT publications in relation to journal and author characteristics. Meta-information of 176,620 RCTs published between 1966 and 2018 was extracted. The risk-of-bias probability (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of patients/personnel, and blinding of outcome assessment) was assessed using a risk-of-bias machine learning tool. This tool was simultaneously validated using 63,327 human risk-of-bias assessments obtained from 17,394 RCTs evaluated in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR). Moreover, RCT registration and CONSORT Statement reporting were assessed using automated searches. Publication characteristics included the number of authors, journal impact factor (JIF), and medical discipline. The annual number of published RCTs substantially increased over 4 decades, accompanied by increases in authors (5.2 to 7.8) and institutions (2.9 to 4.8). The risk of bias remained present in most RCTs but decreased over time for allocation concealment (63% to 51%), random sequence generation (57% to 36%), and blinding of outcome assessment (58% to 52%). Trial registration (37% to 47%) and the use of the CONSORT Statement (1% to 20%) also rapidly increased. In journals with a higher impact factor (&amp;gt;10), the risk of bias was consistently lower with higher levels of RCT registration and the use of the CONSORT Statement. Automated risk-of-bias predictions had accuracies above 70% for allocation concealment (70.7%), random sequence generation (72.1%), and blinding of patients/personnel (79.8%), but not for blinding of outcome assessment (62.7%). In conclusion, the likelihood of bias in RCTs has generally decreased over the last decades. This optimistic trend may be driven by increased knowledge augmented by mandatory trial registration and more stringent reporting guidelines and journal requirements. Nevertheless, relatively high probabilities of bias remain, particularly in journals with lower impact factors. This emphasizes that further improvement of RCT registration, conduct, and reporting is still urgently needed.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/KTBxyMjg_Vs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Yet translating findings from preclinical models to humans present a significant challenge, in part due to differences in cardiac protein expression between humans and model organisms. Proteins immediately determine cellular function, yet their large-scale investigation in hearts has lagged behind those of genes and transcripts. Here, we set out to bridge this knowledge gap: By analyzing protein profiles in humans and commonly used model organisms across cardiac chambers, we determine their commonalities and regional differences. We analyzed cardiac tissue from each chamber of human, pig, horse, rat, mouse, and zebrafish in biological replicates. Using mass spectrometry–based proteomics workflows, we measured and evaluated the abundance of approximately 7,000 proteins in each species. The resulting knowledgebase of cardiac protein signatures is accessible through an online database: atlas.cardiacproteomics.com. Our combined analysis allows for quantitative evaluation of protein abundances across cardiac chambers, as well as comparisons of cardiac protein profiles across model organisms. Up to a quarter of proteins with differential abundances between atria and ventricles showed opposite chamber-specific enrichment between species; these included numerous proteins implicated in cardiac disease. The generated proteomics resource facilitates translational prospects of cardiac studies from model organisms to humans by comparisons of disease-linked protein networks across species.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/4yRRIsy7RPQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: As above, so below: Whole transcriptome profiling demonstrates strong molecular similarities between avian dorsal and ventral pallial subdivisions</title>

	<description>Jarvis et al. and Chen et al. (2013) used the expression profiles of 50 genes to develop the continuum hypothesis of avian brain organization. It states that the subdivisions of the dorsal pallium develop continuously with those of the ventral pallium, resulting in a “partial mirror image” organization around the vestigial ventricle divide. However, these claims were challenged due to the small number of genes profiled. The present study uses RNA sequencing to profile the whole transcriptome (~20,000 genes) of the principal subdivisions of the avian telencephalon and confirms the remarkable molecularly similarities between the dorsal and ventral pallium. We recommend adopting a hierarchal nomenclature to reflect these robust molecular similarities.






Abstract
Over the last two decades, beginning with the Avian Brain Nomenclature Forum in 2000, major revisions have been made to our understanding of the organization and nomenclature of the avian brain. However, there are still unresolved questions on avian pallial organization, particularly whether the cells above the vestigial ventricle represent distinct populations to those below it or similar populations. To test these two hypotheses, we profiled the transcriptomes of the major avian pallial subdivisions dorsal and ventral to the vestigial ventricle boundary using RNA sequencing and a new zebra finch genome assembly containing about 22,000 annotated, complete genes. We found that the transcriptomes of neural populations above and below the ventricle were remarkably similar. Each subdivision in dorsal pallium (Wulst) had a corresponding molecular counterpart in the ventral pallium (DVR). In turn, each corresponding subdivision exhibited shared gene co‐expression modules that contained gene sets enriched in functional specializations, such as anatomical structure development, synaptic transmission, signaling, and neurogenesis. These findings are more in line with the continuum hypothesis of avian brain subdivision organization above and below the vestigial ventricle space, with the pallium as a whole consisting of four major cell populations (intercalated pallium, mesopallium, hyper‐nidopallium, and arcopallium) instead of seven (hyperpallium apicale, interstitial hyperpallium apicale, intercalated hyperpallium, hyperpallium densocellare, mesopallium, nidopallium, and arcopallium). We suggest adopting a more streamlined hierarchical naming system that reflects the robust similarities in gene expression, neural connectivity motifs, and function. These findings have important implications for our understanding of overall vertebrate brain evolution.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We estimate that 208,000 deep brain stimulation (DBS) devices have been implanted to address neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders worldwide. DBS Think Tank presenters pooled data and determined that DBS expanded in its scope and has been applied to multiple brain disorders in an effort to modulate neural circuitry. The DBS Think Tank was founded in 2012 providing a space where clinicians, engineers, researchers from industry and academia discuss current and emerging DBS technologies and logistical and ethical issues facing the field. The emphasis is on cutting edge research and collaboration aimed to advance the DBS field. The Eighth Annual DBS Think Tank was held virtually on September 1 and 2, 2020 (Zoom Video Communications) due to restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The meeting focused on advances in: (1) optogenetics as a tool for comprehending neurobiology of diseases and on optogenetically-inspired DBS, (2) cutting edge of emerging DBS technologies, (3) ethical issues affecting DBS research and access to care, (4) neuromodulatory approaches for depression, (5) advancing novel hardware, software and imaging methodologies, (6) use of neurophysiological signals in adaptive neurostimulation, and (7) use of more advanced technologies to improve DBS clinical outcomes. There were 178 attendees who participated in a DBS Think Tank survey, which revealed the expansion of DBS into several indications such as obesity, post-traumatic stress disorder, addiction and Alzheimer’s disease. This proceedings summarizes the advances discussed at the Eighth Annual DBS Think Tank.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
The cetacean visual system is a product of selection pressures favoring underwater vision, yet relatively little is known about it across taxa. Previous studies report several mutations in the opsin genetic sequence in cetaceans, suggesting the evolutionary complete or partial loss of retinal cone photoreceptor function in mysticete and odontocete lineages, respectively. Despite this, limited anatomical evidence suggests cone structures are partially maintained but with absent outer and inner segments in the bowhead retina. The functional consequence and anatomical distributions associated with these unique cone morphologies remain unclear. The current study further investigates the morphology and distribution of cone photoreceptors in the bowhead whale and beluga retina and evaluates the potential functional capacity of these cells' alternative to photoreception. Refined histological and advanced microscopic techniques revealed two additional cone morphologies in the bowhead and beluga retina that have not been previously described. Two proteins involved in magnetosensation were present in these cone structures suggesting the possibility for an alternative functional role in responding to changes in geomagnetic fields. These findings highlight a revised understanding of the unique evolution of cone and gross retinal anatomy in cetaceans, and provide prefatory evidence of potential functional reassignment of these cells.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Defining vitamin D receptor expression in the brain using a novel VDRCre mouse</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/10.1002/cne.25100</guid>

	<description>We generated a novel vitamin D receptor (VDR) VDRCre knockin mouse for the interrogation of VDR anatomy in the brain. In this article, we demonstrate through immunohistochemistry that VDRCre‐driven reporter expression colocalizes with VDR mRNA throughout the brain. Additionally, we demonstrate that tdTomato (+) neurons respond rapidly to vitamin D, which does not occur in tdTomato (−) neurons.







Abstract
Vitamin D action has been linked to several diseases regulated by the brain including obesity, diabetes, autism, and Parkinson's. However, the location of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in the brain is not clear due to conflicting reports. We found that two antibodies previously published as specific in peripheral tissues are not specific in the brain. We thus created a new knockin mouse with cre recombinase expression under the control of the endogenous VDR promoter (VDRCre). We demonstrated that the cre activity in the VDRCre mouse brain (as reported by a cre‐dependent tdTomato expression) is highly overlapping with endogenous VDR mRNAs. These VDR‐expressing cells were enriched in multiple brain regions including the cortex, amygdala, caudate putamen, and hypothalamus among others. In the hypothalamus, VDR partially colocalized with vasopressin, oxytocin, estrogen receptor‐α, and β‐endorphin to various degrees. We further functionally validated our model by demonstrating that the endogenous VDR agonist 1,25‐dihydroxyvitamin D activated all tested tdTomato+ neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamus but had no effect on neurons without tdTomato fluorescence. Thus, we have generated a new mouse tool that allows us to visualize VDR‐expressing cells and to characterize their functions.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Identification and localization of a gonadotropin‐releasing hormone‐related neuropeptide in Biomphalaria, an intermediate host for schistosomiasis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/10.1002/cne.25099</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25099?af=R</link>
	<description>Histological methods were used to localize a neuropeptide related to gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone in the central nervous system and periphery of Biomphalaria glabrata, an intermediate host for intestinal schistosomiasis.







Abstract
Freshwater snails of the genus Biomphalaria serve as obligatory hosts for the digenetic trematode Schistosoma mansoni, the causative agent for the most widespread form of intestinal schistosomiasis. Within Biomphalaria, S. mansoni larvae multiply and transform into the cercariae form that can infect humans. Trematode development and proliferation is thought to be facilitated by modifications of host behavior and physiological processes, including a reduction of reproduction known as “parasitic castration.” As neuropeptides participate in the control of reproduction across phylogeny, a neural transcriptomics approach was undertaken to identify peptides that could regulate Biomphalaria reproductive physiology. The present study identified a transcript in Biomphalaria alexandrina that encodes a peptide belonging to the gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) superfamily. The precursor and the predicted mature peptide, pQIHFTPDWGNN‐NH2 (designated Biom‐GnRH), share features with peptides identified in other molluscan species, including panpulmonates, opisthobranchs, and cephalopods. An antibody generated against Biom‐GnRH labeled neurons in the cerebral, pedal, and visceral ganglia of Biomphalaria glabrata. GnRH‐like immunoreactive fiber systems projected to all central ganglia. In the periphery, immunoreactive material was detected in the ovotestis, oviduct, albumen gland, and nidamental gland. As these structures serve crucial roles in the production, transport, nourishment, and encapsulation of eggs, disruption of the GnRH system of Biomphalaria could contribute to reduced reproductive activity in infected snails.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Acute Δ9‐tetrahydrocannabinol prompts rapid changes in cannabinoid CB1 receptor immunolabeling and subcellular structure in CA1 hippocampus of young adult male mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/10.1002/cne.25098</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25098?af=R</link>
	<description>Acute exposure to Δ‐9‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) significantly decreases cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor density at inhibitory terminals and mitochondria. Besides, dendrites are significantly larger, have more spines and contain more mitochondria. CB1 receptors (arrows), inhibitory terminals (ter, red shading), mitochondria (m, purple shading), dendrites (blue shading), dendritic spines (sp, blue shading). Scale bars = 500 nm.







Abstract
The use and abuse of cannabis can be associated with significant pathophysiology, however, it remains unclear whether (1) acute administration of Δ‐9‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) during early adulthood alters the cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor localization and expression in cells of the brain, and (2) THC produces structural brain changes. Here we use electron microscopy and a highly sensitive pre‐embedding immunogold method to examine CB1 receptors in the hippocampus cornu ammonis subfield 1 (CA1) 30 min after male mice were exposed to a single THC injection (5 mg/kg). The findings show that acute exposure to THC can significantly decrease the percentage of CB1 receptor immunopositive terminals making symmetric synapses, mitochondria, and astrocytes. The percentage of CB1 receptor‐labeled terminals forming asymmetric synapses was unaffected. Lastly, CB1 receptor expression was significantly lower at terminals of symmetric and asymmetric synapses as well as in mitochondria. Structurally, CA1 dendrites were significantly larger, and contained more spines and mitochondria following acute THC administration. The area of the dendritic spines, synaptic terminals, mitochondria, and astrocytes decreased significantly following acute THC exposure. Altogether, these results indicate that even a single THC exposure can have a significant impact on CB1 receptor expression, and can alter CA1 ultrastructure, within 30 min of drug exposure. These changes may contribute to the behavioral alterations experienced by young individuals shortly after cannabis intoxication.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Neuroplasticity in N‐methyl‐d‐aspartic acid receptor signaling in subregions of the rat rostral ventrolateral medulla following sedentary versus physically active conditions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/10.1002/cne.25094</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25094?af=R</link>
	<description>The mechanisms by which the brain undergoes neuroplasticity during sedentary versus active conditions are important in understanding how a sedentary lifestyle has become the leading cause of death due to modifiable risk factors. Neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) regulate ongoing sympathetic vasoconstriction and cardiac function under normal conditions, and their activity appears heightened in models of cardiovascular disease associated with sympathetic overactivity. The current study provides evidence of activity‐related neuroplasticity in the RVLM via increased glutamate levels and increased expression of N‐methyl‐d‐aspartic acid receptors in the RVLM of sedentary compared to active rats. These mechanisms produce a complex framework by which RVLM neurons increase their influence on sympathoexcitation in sedentary compared to physically active conditions.







Abstract
The rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) is a brain region involved in normal regulation of the cardiovascular system and heightened sympathoexcitatory states of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Among major risk factors for CVD, sedentary lifestyles contribute to higher mortality than other modifiable risk factors. Previous studies suggest excessive glutamatergic excitation of presympathetic neurons in the RVLM occurs in sedentary animals. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine neuroplasticity in the glutamatergic system in the RVLM of sedentary and physically active rats. We hypothesized that relative to active rats, sedentary rats would exhibit higher expression of glutamate N‐methyl‐d‐aspartic acid receptor subunits (GluN), phosphoGluN1, and the excitatory scaffold protein postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95), while achieving higher glutamate levels. Male Sprague–Dawley rats (4 weeks old) were divided into sedentary and active (running wheel) conditions for 10–12 weeks. We used retrograde tracing/triple‐labeling techniques, western blotting, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We report in sedentary versus physically active rats: 1) fewer bulbospinal non‐C1 neurons positive for GluN1, 2) significantly higher expression of GluN1 and GluN2B but lower levels of phosphoGluN1 (pSer896) and PSD95, and 3) higher levels of glutamate in the RVLM. Higher GluN expression is consistent with enhanced sympathoexcitation in sedentary animals; however, a more complex neuroplasticity occurs within subregions of the ventrolateral medulla. Our results in rodents may also indicate that alterations in glutamatergic excitation of the RVLM contribute to the increased incidence of CVD in humans who lead sedentary lifestyles. Thus, there is a strong need to further pursue mechanisms of inactivity‐related neuroplasticity in the RVLM.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Sex and age influence gonadal steroid hormone receptor distributions relative to estrogen receptor β‐containing neurons in the mouse hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus</title>

	<description>Light and electron microscopic studies reveal that gonadal steroids may directly and indirectly influence PVN neurons via nuclear (a) and extranuclear (b) gonadal hormone receptors in a sex‐specific manner. AR, androgen receptor; ER, estrogen receptor; GPER, G‐protein–coupled estrogen receptor.







Abstract
Within the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), estrogen receptor (ER) β and other gonadal hormone receptors play a role in central cardiovascular processes. However, the influence of sex and age on the cellular and subcellular relationships of ERβ with ERα, G‐protein ER (GPER1), as well as progestin and androgen receptors (PR and AR) in the PVN is uncertain. In young (2‐ to 3‐month‐old) females and males, ERβ‐enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) containing neurons were approximately four times greater than ERα‐labeled and PR‐labeled nuclei in the PVN. In subdivisions of the PVN, young females, compared to males, had: (1) more ERβ‐EGFP neurons in neuroendocrine rostral regions; (2) fewer ERα‐labeled nuclei in neuroendocrine and autonomic projecting medial subregions; and (3) more ERα‐labeled nuclei in an autonomic projecting caudal region. In contrast, young males, compared to females, had approximately 20 times more AR‐labeled nuclei, which often colocalized with ERβ‐EGFP in neuroendocrine (approximately 70%) and autonomic (approximately 50%) projecting subregions. Ultrastructurally, in soma and dendrites, PVN ERβ‐EGFP colocalized primarily with extranuclear AR (approximately 85% soma) and GPER1 (approximately 70% soma). Aged (12‐ to 24‐month‐old) males had more ERβ‐EGFP neurons in a rostral neuroendocrine subregion compared to aged females and females with accelerated ovarian failure (AOF) and in a caudal autonomic subregion compared to post‐AOF females. Late‐aged (18‐ to 24‐month‐old) females compared to early‐aged (12‐ to 14‐month‐old) females and AOF females had fewer AR‐labeled nuclei in neuroendrocrine and autonomic projecting subregions. These findings indicate that gonadal steroids may directly and indirectly influence PVN neurons via nuclear and extranuclear gonadal hormone receptors in a sex‐specific manner.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Visual opsin expression and morphological characterization of retinal photoreceptors in the pouched lamprey (Geotria australis, Gray)</title>

	<description>A multidisciplinary approach was applied to assign the expression of different visual opsin classes to specific photoreceptor subtypes in Geotria australis. Five discrete photoreceptor subtypes were identified in the retina, each containing one of five classes of visual opsin. This suggests that G. australis has the potential for complex color vision.







Abstract
Lampreys are extant members of the agnathan (jawless) vertebrates that diverged ~500 million years ago, during a critical stage of vertebrate evolution when image‐forming eyes first emerged. Among lamprey species assessed thus far, the retina of the southern hemisphere pouched lamprey, Geotria australis, is unique, in that it possesses morphologically distinct photoreceptors and expresses five visual photopigments. This study focused on determining the number of different photoreceptors present in the retina of G. australis and whether each cell type expresses a single opsin class. Five photoreceptor subtypes were identified based on ultrastructure and differential expression of one of each of the five different visual opsin classes (lws, sws1, sws2, rh1, and rh2) known to be expressed in the retina. This suggests, therefore, that the retina of G. australis possesses five spectrally and morphologically distinct photoreceptors, with the potential for complex color vision. Each photoreceptor subtype was shown to have a specific spatial distribution in the retina, which is potentially associated with changes in spectral radiance across different lines of sight. These results suggest that there have been strong selection pressures for G. australis to maintain broad spectral sensitivity for the brightly lit surface waters that this species inhabits during its marine phase. These findings provide important insights into the functional anatomy of the early vertebrate retina and the selection pressures that may have led to the evolution of complex color vision.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Forebrain projection neurons target functionally diverse respiratory control areas in the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata</title>

	<description>Respiratory motor activity can be modulated by higher brain inputs. We hypothesized that forebrain regions send descending inputs to the respiratory control areas in the midbrain, pons, and medulla. Our data imply that (a) volitional motor commands for vocalization are specifically relayed via the midbrain periaqueductal gray; (b) commands to coordinate breathing with other orofacial behaviors (e.g., sniffing, whisking, swallowing) target the pontine Kölliker‐Fuse nucleus, predominantly; and (c) limbic or autonomic (interoceptive) systems are connected to broadly distributed downstream brainstem respiratory networks, including the medullary Bötzinger complex (BötC), pre‐BötC, and caudal raphé nuclei. We provide a neural substrate to explain how volitional, state‐dependent, and emotional modulation of breathing is regulated by the forebrain.







Abstract
Eupnea is generated by neural circuits located in the ponto‐medullary brainstem, but can be modulated by higher brain inputs which contribute to volitional control of breathing and the expression of orofacial behaviors, such as vocalization, sniffing, coughing, and swallowing. Surprisingly, the anatomical organization of descending inputs that connect the forebrain with the brainstem respiratory network remains poorly defined. We hypothesized that descending forebrain projections target multiple distributed respiratory control nuclei across the neuroaxis. To test our hypothesis, we made discrete unilateral microinjections of the retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B in the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG), the pontine Kölliker‐Fuse nucleus (KFn), the medullary Bötzinger complex (BötC), pre‐BötC, or caudal midline raphé nuclei. We quantified the regional distribution of retrogradely labeled neurons in the forebrain 12–14 days postinjection. Overall, our data reveal that descending inputs from cortical areas predominantly target the PAG and KFn. Differential forebrain regions innervating the PAG (prefrontal, cingulate cortices, and lateral septum) and KFn (rhinal, piriform, and somatosensory cortices) imply that volitional motor commands for vocalization are specifically relayed via the PAG, while the KFn may receive commands to coordinate breathing with other orofacial behaviors (e.g., sniffing, swallowing). Additionally, we observed that the limbic or autonomic (interoceptive) systems are connected to broadly distributed downstream bulbar respiratory networks. Collectively, these data provide a neural substrate to explain how volitional, state‐dependent, and emotional modulation of breathing is regulated by the forebrain.</description>

	<description>N‐cadherin is involved in the formation and maintenance of synapses. It was mainly detected in type II cells and nerve fibers in taste buds. Immunoelectron microscopy detected N‐cadherin symmetrically in the membranes of contact sites between afferent fibers (N) and type II cells (II), including synapses. Arrowheads: atypical mitochondria.







Abstract
Taste buds, the receptor organs for taste, contain 50–100 taste bud cells. Although these cells undergo continuous turnover, the structural and functional integrity of taste buds is maintained. The molecular mechanisms by which synaptic connectivity between taste buds and afferent fibers is formed and maintained remain ambiguous. In the present study, we examined the localization of N‐cadherin in the taste buds of the mouse circumvallate papillae because N‐cadherin, one of the classical cadherins, is important for the formation and maintenance of synapses. At the light microscopic level, N‐cadherin was predominantly detected in type II cells and nerve fibers in the connective tissues in and around the vallate papillae. At the ultrastructural level, N‐cadherin immunoreactivity appears along the cell membrane and in the intracellular vesicles of type II cells. N‐cadherin immunoreactivity also is evident in the membranes of afferent terminals at the contact sites to N‐cadherin‐positive type II cells. At channel type synapses between type II cells and nerve fibers, N‐cadherin is present surrounding, but not within, the presumed neurotransmitter release zone, identified by large mitochondria apposed to the taste cells. The present results suggest that N‐cadherin is important for the formation or maintenance of type II cell afferent synapses in taste buds.</description>

	<description>Scavenger receptor CD36 contributes significantly to lipid homeostasis, inflammation, and amyloid deposition in the brain. Here, we characterized CD36 gene and protein expression in the brains of young and aged male and female C57BL/6J mice. We found age‐related increases in CD36 mRNA, and CD36 protein differed by region, age, and sex and was primarily expressed intravascularly. These variations may contribute to Aβ deposition and neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease.







Abstract
Scavenger receptor CD36 contributes significantly to lipid homeostasis, inflammation, and amyloid deposition, while CD36 deficiency is associated with restored cerebrovascular function in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model. Yet the distribution of CD36 has not been examined in the brain. Here, we characterized CD36 gene and protein expression in the brains of young, middle aged, aged, and elderly male and female C57BL/6J mice. Age‐related increases in CD36 mRNA expression were observed in the male hippocampus and female midbrain. Additionally, male mice had greater CD36 mRNA expression than females in the striatum, hippocampus, and midbrain. CD36 protein was primarily expressed intravascularly, and this expression differed by region, age, and sex in the mouse brain. Although male mice brains demonstrated an increase in CD36 protein with age in several cortices, basal ganglia, hippocampus, and midbrain, a decrease with age was observed in female mice in the same regions. These data suggest that distinctive age, region, and sex expression of CD36 in the brain may contribute to Aβ deposition and neuroinflammation in AD.</description>

	<description>Abstract
The chemical synapse is the principal form of contact between neurons of the central nervous system. These synapses are typically configured as presynaptic axon terminations onto postsynaptic dendrites or somata, giving rise to axo‐dendritic and axo‐somatic synapses, respectively. Beyond these common synapse configurations are less‐studied, non‐canonical synapse types that are prevalent throughout the brain and significantly contribute to neural circuit function. Among these are the axo‐axonic synapses, which consist of an axon terminating on another axon or axon terminal. Here, we review evidence for axo‐axonic synapse contributions to neural signaling in the mammalian nervous system and survey functional neural circuit motifs enabled by these synapses. We also detail how recent advances in microscopy, transgenics, and biological sensors may be used to identify and functionally assay axo‐axonic synapses.</description>

	<description>We accomplished visualization and reconstruction of noradrenergic neurons projecting to the olfactory bulb (OB) by infection of adeno‐associated viruses into the locus coeruleus of dopamine beta hydroxylase‐Cre mice. An individual noradrenergic axon traveled while forming several branches and was distributed in multiple glomeruli that were located in different areas of the glomerular layer in the OB.







Abstract
Olfactory input is processed in the glomerulus of the main olfactory bulb (OB) and relayed to higher centers in the brain by projection neurons. Conversely, centrifugal inputs from other brain regions project to the OB. We have previously analyzed centrifugal inputs into the OB from several brain regions using single‐neuron labeling. In this study, we analyzed the centrifugal noradrenergic (NA) fibers derived from the locus coeruleus (LC), because their projection pathways and synaptic connections in the OB have not been clarified in detail. We analyzed the NA centrifugal projections by single‐neuron labeling and immunoelectron microscopy. Individual NA neurons labeled by viral infection were three‐dimensionally traced using Neurolucida software to visualize the projection pathway from the LC to the OB. Also, centrifugal NA fibers were visualized using an antibody for noradrenaline transporter (NET). NET immunoreactive (‐ir) fibers contained many varicosities and synaptic vesicles. Furthermore, electron tomography demonstrated that NET‐ir fibers formed asymmetrical synapses of varied morphology. Although these synapses were present at varicosities, the density of synapses was relatively low throughout the OB. The maximal density of synapses was found in the external plexiform layer; about 17% of all observed varicosities contained synapses. These results strongly suggest that NA‐containing fibers in the OB release NA from both varicosities and synapses to influence the activities of OB neurons. The present study provides a morphological basis for olfactory modulation by centrifugal NA fibers derived from the LC.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Late onset of Synaptotagmin 2a expression at synapses relevant to social behavior</title>

	<description>During brain development, synapses form and are refined through the accumulation of different proteins. Here we examined the dynamic distribution of Synaptotagmin 2a (Syt2a) in the developing forebrain of zebrafish larvae with a focus on regions associated with social behavior. We show that Syt2a colocalized with tyrosine hydroxylase, a protein important for behavior. Further, we found that Syt2a localizes to synapses onto neurons implicated in social behavior, with an increase of Syt2a expression coinciding with the emergence of social behavior.







Abstract
As they form, synapses go through various stages of maturation and refinement. These steps are linked to significant changes in synaptic function, potentially resulting in emergence and maturation of behavioral outputs. Synaptotagmins are calcium‐sensing proteins of the synaptic vesicle exocytosis machinery, and changes in Synaptotagmin proteins at synapses have significant effects on vesicle release and synaptic function. Here, we examined the distribution of the synaptic vesicle protein Synaptotagmin 2a (Syt2a) during development of the zebrafish nervous system. Syt2a is widely distributed throughout the midbrain and hindbrain early during larval development but very weakly expressed in the forebrain. Later in development, Syt2a expression levels in the forebrain increase, particularly in regions associated with social behavior, and most intriguingly, around the time social behavior becomes apparent. We provide evidence that Syt2a localizes to synapses onto neurons implicated in social behavior in the ventral forebrain and show that Syt2a is colocalized with tyrosine hydroxylase, a biosynthetic enzyme in the dopamine pathway. Our results suggest a developmentally important role for Syt2a in maturing synapses in the forebrain, coinciding with the emergence of social behavior.</description>

	<description>The Superficial Interneurons (SINs) of the zebrafish tectum comprise a diverse population. Here we demonstrate that despite their wide range of reported tuning properties and morphology, most SINs respond to light offset and possess large receptive fields. SINs were previously thought to be solely inhibitory, yet we report that a subset express glutamatergic markers. Finally, these cells are unlikely to be intrinsically photosensitive as removal of retinal input, eliminated nearly all light on and off responses in SINs.  (Image: Eva Laurell)







Abstract
The superficial interneurons, SINs, of the zebrafish tectum, have been implicated in a range of visual functions, including size discrimination, directional selectivity, and looming‐evoked escape. This raises the question if SIN subpopulations, despite their morphological similarities and shared anatomical position in the retinotectal processing stream, carry out diverse, task‐specific functions in visual processing, or if they have simple tuning properties in common. Here we have further characterized the SINs through functional imaging, electrophysiological recordings, and neurotransmitter typing in two transgenic lines, the widely used Gal4s1156t and the recently reported LCRRH2‐RH2‐2:GFP. We found that about a third of the SINs strongly responded to changes in whole‐field light levels, with a strong preference for OFF over ON stimuli. Interestingly, individual SINs were selectively tuned to a diverse range of narrow luminance decrements. Overall responses to whole‐field luminance steps did not vary with the position of the SIN cell body along the depth of the tectal neuropil or with the orientation of its neurites. We ruled out the possibility that intrinsic photosensitivity of Gal4s1156t+ SINs contribute to the measured visual responses. We found that, while most SINs express GABAergic markers, a substantial minority express an excitatory neuronal marker, the vesicular glutamate transporter, expanding the possible roles of SIN function in the tectal circuitry. In conclusion, SINs represent a molecularly, morphologically, and functionally heterogeneous class of interneurons, with subpopulations that detect a range of specific visual features, to which we have now added narrow luminance decrements.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Upregulation of eIF4E, but not other translation initiation factors, in dendritic spines during memory formation</title>

	<description>Memory formation requires initiation of new protein synthesis as well as protein synthesis in dendrites, but it is unknown whether initiation can happen within dendritic spines. We combined immunolabeling with serial section 3D electron microscopy to examine the distribution of three initiation factors, eIF4E, eIF4G1, and eIF2α in dendritic spines of the lateral amygdala during formation of a Pavlovian conditioning memory. Top row: Electron micrographs showing labeled spines (arrows) with synapses (arrowheads). Bottom left: Segment of dendrite reconstructed from serial sections with synapses shown in red. Bottom right: The percentage of spines containing labeling for eIF4E was higher after training, but there were no differences for eIF4G1 or eIF2α labeling.







Abstract
Local translation can provide a rapid, spatially targeted supply of new proteins in distal dendrites to support synaptic changes that underlie learning. Learning and memory are especially sensitive to manipulations of translational control mechanisms, particularly those that target the initiation step, and translation initiation at synapses could be a means of maintaining synapse specificity during plasticity. Initiation predominantly occurs via recruitment of ribosomes to the 5’ mRNA cap by complexes of eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs), and the interaction between eIF4E and eIF4G1 is a particularly important target of translational control pathways. Pharmacological inhibition of eIF4E‐eIF4G1 binding impairs formation of memory for aversive Pavlovian conditioning as well as the accompanying increase in polyribosomes in the heads of dendritic spines in the lateral amygdala (LA). This is consistent with a role for initiation at synapses in memory formation, but whether eIFs are even present near synapses is unknown. To determine whether dendritic spines contain eIFs and whether eIF distribution is affected by learning, we combined immunolabeling with serial section transmission electron microscopy (ssTEM) volume reconstructions of LA dendrites after Pavlovian conditioning. Labeling for eIF4E, eIF4G1, and eIF2α – another key target of regulation – occurred in roughly half of dendritic spines, but learning effects were only found for eIF4E, which was upregulated in the heads of dendritic spines. Our results support the possibility of regulated translation initiation as a means of synapse‐specific protein targeting during learning and are consistent with the model of eIF4E availability as a central point of control.

Metastability in the brain is thought to be a mechanism involved in dynamic organization of cognitive and behavioral functions across multiple spatiotemporal scales. However, it is not clear how such organization is realized in underlying neural oscillations in a high-dimensional state space. It was shown that macroscopic oscillations often form phase-phase coupling (PPC) and phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) which result in synchronization and amplitude modulation, respectively, even without external stimuli. These oscillations can also make spontaneous transitions across synchronous states at rest. Using resting-state electroencephalographic signals and the autism-spectrum quotient scores acquired from healthy humans, we show experimental evidence that the PAC combined with PPC allows amplitude modulation to be transient, and that the metastable dynamics with this transient modulation is associated with autistic-like traits. In individuals with a longer attention span, such dynamics tended to show fewer transitions between states by forming delta-alpha PAC. We identified these states as two-dimensional metastable states that could share consistent patterns across individuals. Our findings suggest that the human brain dynamically organizes inter-individual differences in a hierarchy of macroscopic oscillations with multiple timescales by utilizing metastability.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/d44_o2307G4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Transcript stability is associated with many biological processes, and the factors affecting mRNA stability have been extensively studied. However, little is known about the features related to human long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) stability. By inhibiting transcription and collecting samples in 10 time points, genome-wide RNA-seq studies was performed in human lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549) and RNA half-life datasets were constructed. The following observations were obtained. First, the half-life distributions of both lncRNAs and messanger RNAs (mRNAs) with one exon (lnc-human1 and m-human1) were significantly different from those of both lncRNAs and mRNAs with more than one exon (lnc-human2 and m-human2). Furthermore, some factors such as full-length transcript secondary structures played a contrary role in lnc-human1 and m-human2. Second, through the half-life comparisons of nucleus- and cytoplasm-specific and common lncRNAs and mRNAs, lncRNAs (mRNAs) in the nucleus were found to be less stable than those in the cytoplasm, which was derived from transcripts themselves rather than cellular location. Third, kmers-based protein−RNA or RNA−RNA interactions promoted lncRNA stability from lnc-human1 and decreased mRNA stability from m-human2 with high probability. Finally, through applying deep learning−based regression, a non-linear relationship was found to exist between the half-lives of lncRNAs (mRNAs) and related factors. The present study established lncRNA and mRNA half-life regulation networks in the A549 cell line and shed new light on the degradation behaviors of both lncRNAs and mRNAs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_x3OBdaRtTI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Long regulatory elements (LREs), such as CpG islands, polydA:dT tracts or AU-rich elements, are thought to play key roles in gene regulation but, as opposed to conventional binding sites of transcription factors, few methods have been proposed to formally and automatically characterize them. We present here a computational approach named DExTER (Domain Exploration To Explain gene Regulation) dedicated to the identification of candidate LREs (cLREs) and apply it to the analysis of the genomes of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;falciparum&lt;/i&gt; and other eukaryotes. Our analyses show that all tested genomes contain several cLREs that are somewhat conserved along evolution, and that gene expression can be predicted with surprising accuracy on the basis of these long regions only. Regulation by cLREs exhibits very different behaviours depending on species and conditions. In &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;falciparum&lt;/i&gt; and other Apicomplexan organisms as well as in &lt;i&gt;Dictyostelium discoideum&lt;/i&gt;, the process appears highly dynamic, with different cLREs involved at different phases of the life cycle. For multicellular organisms, the same cLREs are involved in all tissues, but a dynamic behavior is observed along embryonic development stages. In &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;falciparum&lt;/i&gt;, whose genome is known to be strongly depleted of transcription factors, cLREs are predictive of expression with an accuracy above 70%, and our analyses show that they are associated with both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation signals. Moreover, we assessed the biological relevance of one LRE discovered by DExTER in &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;falciparum&lt;/i&gt; using an &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; reporter assay.
The source code (python) of DExTER is available at https://gite.lirmm.fr/menichelli/DExTER.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kDCxCPtiTXg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Accurate cancer phenotype prediction with AKLIMATE, a stacked kernel learner integrating multimodal genomic data and pathway knowledge</title>

Advancements in sequencing have led to the proliferation of multi-omic profiles of human cells under different conditions and perturbations. In addition, many databases have amassed information about pathways and gene “signatures”—patterns of gene expression associated with specific cellular and phenotypic contexts. An important current challenge in systems biology is to leverage such knowledge about gene coordination to maximize the predictive power and generalization of models applied to high-throughput datasets. However, few such integrative approaches exist that also provide interpretable results quantifying the importance of individual genes and pathways to model accuracy. We introduce AKLIMATE, a first kernel-based stacked learner that seamlessly incorporates multi-omics feature data with prior information in the form of pathways for either regression or classification tasks. AKLIMATE uses a novel multiple-kernel learning framework where individual kernels capture the prediction propensities recorded in random forests, each built from a specific pathway gene set that integrates all omics data for its member genes. AKLIMATE has comparable or improved performance relative to state-of-the-art methods on diverse phenotype learning tasks, including predicting microsatellite instability in endometrial and colorectal cancer, survival in breast cancer, and cell line response to gene knockdowns. We show how AKLIMATE is able to connect feature data across data platforms through their common pathways to identify examples of several known and novel contributors of cancer and synthetic lethality.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vLL7me8Kt6o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

ParAB&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;, the most widespread bacterial DNA segregation system, is composed of a centromeric sequence, &lt;i&gt;parS&lt;/i&gt;, and two proteins, the ParA ATPase and the ParB DNA binding proteins. Hundreds of ParB proteins assemble dynamically to form nucleoprotein &lt;i&gt;parS&lt;/i&gt;-anchored complexes that serve as substrates for ParA molecules to catalyze positioning and segregation events. The exact nature of this ParB&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; complex has remained elusive, what we address here by revisiting the Stochastic Binding model (SBM) introduced to explain the non-specific binding profile of ParB in the vicinity of &lt;i&gt;parS&lt;/i&gt;. In the SBM, DNA loops stochastically bring loci inside a sharp cluster of ParB. However, previous SBM versions did not include the negative supercoiling of bacterial DNA, leading to use unphysically small DNA persistences to explain the ParB binding profiles. In addition, recent super-resolution microscopy experiments have revealed a ParB cluster that is significantly smaller than previous estimations and suggest that it results from a liquid-liquid like phase separation. Here, by simulating the folding of long (≥ 30 kb) supercoiled DNA molecules calibrated with realistic DNA parameters and by considering different possibilities for the physics of the ParB cluster assembly, we show that the SBM can quantitatively explain the ChIP-seq ParB binding profiles without any fitting parameter, aside from the supercoiling density of DNA, which, remarkably, is in accord with independent measurements. We also predict that ParB assembly results from a non-equilibrium, stationary balance between an influx of produced proteins and an outflux of excess proteins, i.e., ParB clusters behave like liquid-like protein condensates with unconventional “leaky” boundaries.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O6fP88-FrSc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Diego Vidaurre&lt;/p&gt;

An important question in neuroscience is whether or not we can interpret spontaneous variations in the pattern of correlation between brain areas, which we refer to as functional connectivity or FC, as an index of dynamic neuronal communication in fMRI. That is, can we measure time-varying FC reliably? And, if so, can FC reflect information transfer between brain regions at relatively fast-time scales? Answering these questions in practice requires dealing with the statistical challenge of having high-dimensional data and a comparatively lower number of time points or volumes. A common strategy is to use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data, and then apply some model, such as the hidden Markov model (HMM) or a mixture model of Gaussian distributions, to find a set of distinct FC patterns or states. The distinct spatial properties of these FC states together with the time-resolved switching between them offer a flexible description of time-varying FC. In this work, I show that in this context PCA can suffer from systematic biases and loss of sensitivity for the purposes of finding time-varying FC. To get around these issues, I propose a novel variety of the HMM, named HMM-PCA, where the states are themselves PCA decompositions. Since PCA is based on the data covariance, the state-specific PCA decompositions reflect distinct patterns of FC. I show, theoretically and empirically, that fusing dimensionality reduction and time-varying FC estimation in one single step can avoid these problems and outperform alternative approaches, facilitating the quantification of transient communication in the brain.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zRfYbVrBeMo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Objective
Blood tests to monitor disease activity, attack severity, or treatment impact in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) have not been developed. This study investigated the relationship between serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP) concentration and NMOSD activity and assessed the impact of inebilizumab treatment.


Methods
N‐MOmentum was a prospective, multicenter, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, randomized clinical trial in adults with NMOSD. sGFAP levels were measured by single‐molecule arrays (SIMOA) in 1,260 serial and attack‐related samples from 215 N‐MOmentum participants (92% aquaporin 4‐immunoglobulin G‐seropositive) and in control samples (from healthy donors and patients with relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis).


Results
At baseline, 62 participants (29%) exhibited high sGFAP concentrations (≥170 pg/ml; ≥2 standard deviations above healthy donor mean concentration) and were more likely to experience an adjudicated attack than participants with lower baseline concentrations (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval], 3.09 [1.6–6.1], p = 0.001). Median (interquartile range [IQR]) concentrations increased within 1 week of an attack (baseline: 168.4, IQR = 128.9–449.7 pg/ml; attack: 2,160.1, IQR = 302.7–9,455.0 pg/ml, p = 0.0015) and correlated with attack severity (median fold change from baseline [FC], minor attacks: 1.06, IQR = 0.9–7.4; major attacks: 34.32, IQR = 8.7–107.5, p = 0.023). This attack‐related increase in sGFAP occurred primarily in placebo‐treated participants (FC: 20.2, IQR = 4.4–98.3, p = 0.001) and was not observed in inebilizumab‐treated participants (FC: 1.1, IQR = 0.8–24.6, p &amp;gt; 0.05). Five participants (28%) with elevated baseline sGFAP reported neurological symptoms leading to nonadjudicated attack assessments.


Interpretation
Serum GFAP may serve as a biomarker of NMOSD activity, attack risk, and treatment effects. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:895–910</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Noninvasive Mapping of Ripple Onset Predicts Outcome in Epilepsy Surgery</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26066</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26066?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
Intracranial electroencephalographic (icEEG) studies show that interictal ripples propagate across the brain of children with medically refractory epilepsy (MRE), and the onset of this propagation (ripple onset zone [ROZ]) estimates the epileptogenic zone. It is still unknown whether we can map this propagation noninvasively. The goal of this study is to map ripples (ripple zone [RZ]) and their propagation onset (ROZ) using high‐density EEG (HD‐EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), and to estimate their prognostic value in pediatric epilepsy surgery.


Methods
We retrospectively analyzed simultaneous HD‐EEG and MEG data from 28 children with MRE who underwent icEEG and epilepsy surgery. Using electric and magnetic source imaging, we estimated virtual sensors (VSs) at brain locations that matched the icEEG implantation. We detected ripples on VSs, defined the virtual RZ and virtual ROZ, and estimated their distance from icEEG. We assessed the predictive value of resecting virtual RZ and virtual ROZ for postsurgical outcome. Interictal spike localization on HD‐EEG and MEG was also performed and compared with ripples.


Results
We mapped ripple propagation in all patients with HD‐EEG and in 27 (96%) patients with MEG. The distance from icEEG did not differ between HD‐EEG and MEG when mapping the RZ (26–27mm, p = 0.6) or ROZ (22–24mm, p = 0.4). Resecting the virtual ROZ, but not virtual RZ or the sources of spikes, was associated with good outcome for HD‐EEG (p = 0.016) and MEG (p = 0.047).


Interpretation
HD‐EEG and MEG can map interictal ripples and their propagation onset (virtual ROZ). Noninvasively mapping the ripple onset may augment epilepsy surgery planning and improve surgical outcome of children with MRE. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:911–925</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Genetic Variation in WNT9B Increases Relapse Hazard in Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26061</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26061?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
Many multiple sclerosis (MS) genetic susceptibility variants have been identified, but understanding disease heterogeneity remains a key challenge. Relapses are a core feature of MS and a common primary outcome of clinical trials, with prevention of relapses benefiting patients immediately and potentially limiting long‐term disability accrual. We aim to identify genetic variation associated with relapse hazard in MS by analyzing the largest study population to date.


Methods
We performed a genomewide association study (GWAS) in a discovery cohort and investigated the genomewide significant variants in a replication cohort. Combining both cohorts, we captured a total of 2,231 relapses occurring before the start of any immunomodulatory treatment in 991 patients. For assessing time to relapse, we applied a survival analysis utilizing Cox proportional hazards models. We also investigated the association between MS genetic risk scores and relapse hazard and performed a gene ontology pathway analysis.


Results
The low‐frequency genetic variant rs11871306 within WNT9B reached genomewide significance in predicting relapse hazard and replicated (meta‐analysis hazard ratio (HR) = 2.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.70–2.78, p = 2.07 × 10−10). A pathway analysis identified an association of the pathway “response to vitamin D” with relapse hazard (p = 4.33 × 10−6). The MS genetic risk scores, however, were not associated with relapse hazard.


Interpretation
Genetic factors underlying disease heterogeneity differ from variants associated with MS susceptibility. Our findings imply that genetic variation within the Wnt signaling and vitamin D pathways contributes to differences in relapse occurrence. The present study highlights these cross‐talking pathways as potential modulators of MS disease activity. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:884–894</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Electroencephalographic Abnormalities are Common in COVID‐19 and are Associated with Outcomes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26060</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26060?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
The aim was to determine the prevalence and risk factors for electrographic seizures and other electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) undergoing clinically indicated continuous electroencephalogram (cEEG) monitoring and to assess whether EEG findings are associated with outcomes.


Methods
We identified 197 patients with COVID‐19 referred for cEEG at 9 participating centers. Medical records and EEG reports were reviewed retrospectively to determine the incidence of and clinical risk factors for seizures and other epileptiform patterns. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis assessed the relationship between EEG patterns and clinical outcomes.


Results
Electrographic seizures were detected in 19 (9.6%) patients, including nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) in 11 (5.6%). Epileptiform abnormalities (either ictal or interictal) were present in 96 (48.7%). Preceding clinical seizures during hospitalization were associated with both electrographic seizures (36.4% in those with vs 8.1% in those without prior clinical seizures, odds ratio [OR] 6.51, p = 0.01) and NCSE (27.3% vs 4.3%, OR 8.34, p = 0.01). A pre‐existing intracranial lesion on neuroimaging was associated with NCSE (14.3% vs 3.7%; OR 4.33, p = 0.02). In multivariate analysis of outcomes, electrographic seizures were an independent predictor of in‐hospital mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 4.07 [1.44–11.51], p &amp;lt; 0.01). In competing risks analysis, hospital length of stay increased in the presence of NCSE (30 day proportion discharged with vs without NCSE: HR 0.21 [0.03–0.33] vs 0.43 [0.36–0.49]).


Interpretation
This multicenter retrospective cohort study demonstrates that seizures and other epileptiform abnormalities are common in patients with COVID‐19 undergoing clinically indicated cEEG and are associated with adverse clinical outcomes. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:872–883</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Selective Endothelial Hyperactivation of Oncogenic KRAS Induces Brain Arteriovenous Malformations in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26059</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26059?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
Brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) are a leading cause of hemorrhagic stroke and neurological deficits in children and young adults, however, no pharmacological intervention is available to treat these patients. Although more than 95% of bAVMs are sporadic without family history, the pathogenesis of sporadic bAVMs is largely unknown, which may account for the lack of therapeutic options. KRAS mutations are frequently observed in cancer, and a recent unprecedented finding of these mutations in human sporadic bAVMs offers a new direction in the bAVM research. Using a novel adeno‐associated virus targeting brain endothelium (AAV‐BR1), the current study tested if endothelial KRASG12V mutation induces sporadic bAVMs in mice.


Methods
Five‐week‐old mice were systemically injected with either AAV‐BR1‐GFP or ‐KRASG12V. At 8 weeks after the AAV injection, bAVM formation and characteristics were addressed by histological and molecular analyses. The effect of MEK/ERK inhibition on KRASG12V‐induced bAVMs was determined by treatment of trametinib, a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)‐approved MEK/ERK inhibitor.


Results
The viral‐mediated KRASG12V overexpression induced bAVMs, which were composed of a tangled nidus mirroring the distinctive morphology of human bAVMs. The bAVMs were accompanied by focal angiogenesis, intracerebral hemorrhages, altered vascular constituents, neuroinflammation, and impaired sensory/cognitive/motor functions. Finally, we confirmed that bAVM growth was inhibited by trametinib treatment.


Interpretation
Our innovative approach using AAV‐BR1 confirms that KRAS mutations promote bAVM development via the MEK/ERK pathway, and provides a novel preclinical mouse model of bAVMs which will be useful to develop a therapeutic strategy for patients with bAVM. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:926–941</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Postictal Death Is Associated with Tonic Phase Apnea in a Mouse Model of Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26053</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26053?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is an unpredictable and devastating comorbidity of epilepsy that is believed to be due to cardiorespiratory failure immediately after generalized convulsive seizures.


Methods
We performed cardiorespiratory monitoring of seizure‐induced death in mice carrying either a p.Arg1872Trp or p.Asn1768Asp mutation in a single Scn8a allele—mutations identified from patients who died from SUDEP—and of seizure‐induced death in pentylenetetrazole‐treated wild‐type mice.


Results
The primary cause of seizure‐induced death for all mice was apnea, as (1) apnea began during a seizure and continued for tens of minutes until terminal asystole, and (2) death was prevented by mechanical ventilation. Fatal seizures always included a tonic phase that was coincident with apnea. This tonic phase apnea was not sufficient to produce death, as it also occurred during many nonfatal seizures; however, all seizures that were fatal had tonic phase apnea. We also made the novel observation that continuous tonic diaphragm contraction occurred during tonic phase apnea, which likely contributes to apnea by preventing exhalation, and this was only fatal when breathing did not resume after the tonic phase ended. Finally, recorded seizures from a patient with developmental epileptic encephalopathy with a previously undocumented SCN8A likely pathogenic variant (p.Leu257Val) revealed similarities to those of the mice, namely, an extended tonic phase that was accompanied by apnea.


Interpretation
We conclude that apnea coincident with the tonic phase of a seizure, and subsequent failure to resume breathing, are the determining events that cause seizure‐induced death in Scn8a mutant mice. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:1023–1035</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Early Predictors of 9‐Year Disability in Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26052</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26052?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
The purpose of this study was to assess early predictors of 9‐year disability in pediatric patients with multiple sclerosis.


Methods
Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessments of 123 pediatric patients with multiple sclerosis were obtained at disease onset and after 1 and 2 years. A 9‐year clinical follow‐up was also performed. Cox proportional hazard and multivariable regression models were used to assess independent predictors of time to first relapse and 9‐year outcomes.


Results
Time to first relapse was predicted by optic nerve lesions (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.10, p = 0.02) and high‐efficacy treatment exposure (HR = 0.31, p = 0.005). Predictors of annualized relapse rate were: at baseline, presence of cerebellar (β = −0.15, p &amp;lt; 0.001), cervical cord lesions (β = 0.16, p = 0.003), and high‐efficacy treatment exposure (β = −0.14, p = 0.01); considering also 1‐year variables, number of relapses (β = 0.14, p = 0.002), and the previous baseline predictors; considering 2‐year variables, time to first relapse (2‐year: β = −0.12, p = 0.01) entered, whereas high‐efficacy treatment exposure exited the model. Predictors of 9‐year disability worsening were: at baseline, presence of optic nerve lesions (odds ratio [OR] = 6.45, p = 0.01); considering 1‐year and 2‐year variables, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) changes (1‐year: OR = 26.05, p &amp;lt; 0.001; 2‐year: OR = 16.38, p = 0.02), and ≥ 2 new T2‐lesions in 2 years (2‐year: OR = 4.91, p = 0.02). Predictors of higher 9‐year EDSS score were: at baseline, EDSS score (β = 0.58, p &amp;lt; 0.001), presence of brainstem lesions (β = 0.31, p = 0.04), and number of cervical cord lesions (β = 0.22, p = 0.05); considering 1‐year and 2‐year variables, EDSS changes (1‐year: β = 0.79, p &amp;lt; 0.001; 2‐year: β = 0.55, p &amp;lt; 0.001), and ≥ 2 new T2‐lesions (1‐year: β = 0.28, p = 0.03; 2‐year: β = 0.35, p = 0.01).


Interpretation
A complete baseline MRI assessment and an accurate clinical and MRI monitoring during the first 2 years of disease contribute to predict 9‐year prognosis in pediatric patients with multiple sclerosis. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:1011–1022</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Leucine Zipper 4 Autoantibody: A Novel Germ Cell Tumor and Paraneoplastic Biomarker</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26050</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26050?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
This study was undertaken to describe a novel biomarker of germ cell tumor and associated paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS).


Methods
Archival sera from patients with germ cell tumor–associated PNS were evaluated. We identified a common autoantigen in a human testicular cancer cell line (TCam‐2) by Western blot and mass spectrometry. Its identity was confirmed by recombinant‐protein Western blot, enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and cell‐based assay. Autoantibody specificity was confirmed by analyzing assorted control sera/cerebrospinal fluid.


Results
Leucine zipper 4 (LUZP4)–immunoglobulin G (IgG) was detected in 28 patients' sera, 26 of whom (93%) were men. The median age at neurological symptom onset was 45 years (range = 28–84). Median titer (ELISA) was 1:300 (1:50 to &amp;gt;1:6,400, normal value &amp;lt; 1:50). Coexistent kelchlike protein 11–IgG was identified in 18 cases (64%). The most common presenting phenotype was rhombencephalitis (17/28, 61%). Other presentations included limbic encephalitis (n = 5, 18%), seizures and/or encephalitis (n = 2, 7%), and motor neuronopathy/polyradiculopathy (n = 4, 14%). The most common malignancy among cancer‐evaluated PNS patients was seminoma (21/27, 78%). Nine of the 21 seminomas detected by whole‐body fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan (43%) were extratesticular. Both female patients had ovarian teratoma. Regressed testicular germ cell tumors were found in 4 patients. Exposure of T‐cell–dendritic‐cell cocultures from chronic immunosuppression‐naïve LUZP4‐IgG–seropositive patients to recombinant LUZP4 protein evoked a marked increase in CD69 expression on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells when compared to vehicle‐exposed and healthy control cultures.


Interpretation
LUZP4‐IgG represents a novel serological biomarker of PNS and has high predictive value for germ cell tumors. The demonstrated antigen‐specific T‐cell responses support a CD8+ T‐cell–mediated cytotoxic paraneoplastic and antitumor potential. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:1001–1010</description>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26048?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
The present work was undertaken to study the genetic contribution to the start of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with amyloid and tau biomarkers in cognitively intact older identical twins.


Methods
We studied in 96 monozygotic twin‐pairs relationships between amyloid‐beta (Aβ) aggregation as measured by the Aβ1–42/1–40 ratio in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; n = 126) and positron emission tomography (PET, n = 194), and CSF markers for Aβ production (beta‐secretase 1, Aβ1–40, and Aβ1–38) and CSF tau. Associations among markers were tested with generalized estimating equations including a random effect for twin status, adjusted for age, gender, and apolipoprotein E ε4 genotype. We used twin analyses to determine relative contributions of genetic and/or environmental factors to AD pathophysiological processes.


Results
Twenty‐seven individuals (14%) had an abnormal amyloid PET, and 14 twin‐pairs (15%) showed discordant amyloid PET scans. Within twin‐pairs, Aβ production markers and total‐tau (t‐tau) levels strongly correlated (r range = 0.73–0.86, all p &amp;lt; 0.0001), and Aβ aggregation markers and 181‐phosphorylated‐tau (p‐tau) levels correlated moderately strongly (r range = 0.50–0.64, all p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Cross‐twin cross‐trait analysis showed that Aβ1–38 in one twin correlated with Aβ1–42/1–40 ratios, and t‐tau and p‐tau levels in their cotwins (r range = −0.28 to 0.58, all p &amp;lt; .007). Within‐pair differences in Aβ production markers related to differences in tau levels (r range = 0.49–0.61, all p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Twin discordance analyses suggest that Aβ production and tau levels show coordinated increases in very early AD.


Interpretation
Our results suggest a substantial genetic/shared environmental background contributes to both Aβ and tau increases, suggesting that modulation of environmental risk factors may aid in delaying the onset of AD pathophysiological processes. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:987–1000</description>

In the present clinicopathological study with 73 patients with LBD, we observed that the substantia nigra pars compacta dopamine neuron density was markedly lower in patients who had comorbid depression antemortem than in nondepressed patients (1.52 vs 2.32 n/mm2, p = 0.004). There were no differences in cognition, motor disease severity, antiparkinsonian medications, or disease duration between groups. The results implicate the substantia nigra as an important psychomotor modulatory area of mood in patients with Lewy body disorders. ANN NEUROL 2021;;89:1046–1050</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Diagnostic Utility of Gold Coast Criteria in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26045</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26045?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
The diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains problematic, with current diagnostic criteria (revised El Escorial [rEEC] and Awaji) being complex and prone to error. Consequently, the diagnostic utility of the recently proposed Gold Coast criteria was determined in ALS.


Methods
We retrospectively reviewed 506 patients (302 males, 204 females) to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the Gold Coast criteria to that of the Awaji and rEEC criteria (defined by the proportion of patients categorized as definite, probable, or possible ALS) in accordance with standards of reporting of diagnostic accuracy criteria.


Results
The sensitivity of Gold Coast criteria (92%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 88.7–94.6%) was comparable to that of Awaji (90.3%, 95% CI = 86.69–93.2%) and rEEC (88.6, 95% CI = 84.8–91.7%) criteria. Additionally, the Gold Coast criteria sensitivity was maintained across different subgroups, defined by site of onset, disease duration, and functional disability. In atypical ALS phenotypes, the Gold Coast criteria exhibited greater sensitivity and specificity.


Interpretation
The present study established the diagnostic utility of the Gold Coast criteria in ALS, with benefits evident in bulbar and limb onset disease patients, as well as atypical phenotypes. The Gold Coast criteria should be considered in clinical practice and therapeutic trials. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:979–986</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Assessing Dysferlinopathy Patients Over Three Years With a New Motor Scale</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26044</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26044?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
Dysferlinopathy is a muscular dystrophy with a highly variable clinical presentation and currently unpredictable progression. This variability and unpredictability presents difficulties for prognostication and clinical trial design. The Jain Clinical Outcomes Study of Dysferlinopathy aims to establish the validity of the North Star Assessment for Limb Girdle Type Muscular Dystrophies (NSAD) scale and identify factors that influence the rate of disease progression using NSAD.


Methods
We collected a longitudinal series of functional assessments from 187 patients with dysferlinopathy over 3 years. Rasch analysis was used to develop the NSAD, a motor performance scale suitable for ambulant and nonambulant patients. Generalized estimating equations were used to evaluate the impact of patient factors on outcome trajectories.


Results
The NSAD detected significant change in clinical progression over 1 year. The steepest functional decline occurred during the first 10 years after symptom onset, with more rapid decline noted in patients who developed symptoms at a younger age (p = 0.04). The most rapidly deteriorating group over the study was patients 3 to 8 years post symptom onset at baseline.


Interpretation
The NSAD is the first validated limb girdle specific scale of motor performance, suitable for use in clinical practice and clinical trials. Longitudinal analysis showed it may be possible to identify patient factors associated with greater functional decline both across the disease course and in the short‐term for clinical trial preparation. Through further work and validation in this cohort, we anticipate that a disease model incorporating functional performance will allow for more accurate prognosis for patients with dysferlinopathy.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Apolipoprotein E4 Reduction with Antisense Oligonucleotides Decreases Neurodegeneration in a Tauopathy Model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26043</guid>

	<description>Objective
Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype is the strongest genetic risk factor for late‐onset Alzheimer's disease, with the ε4 allele increasing risk in a dose‐dependent fashion. In addition to ApoE4 playing a crucial role in amyloid‐β deposition, recent evidence suggests that it also plays an important role in tau pathology and tau‐mediated neurodegeneration. It is not known, however, whether therapeutic reduction of ApoE4 would exert protective effects on tau‐mediated neurodegeneration.


Methods
Herein, we used antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) against human APOE to reduce ApoE4 levels in the P301S/ApoE4 mouse model of tauopathy. We treated P301S/ApoE4 mice with ApoE or control ASOs via intracerebroventricular injection at 6 and 7.5 months of age and performed brain pathological assessments at 9 months of age.


Results
Our results indicate that treatment with ApoE ASOs reduced ApoE4 protein levels by ~50%, significantly protected against tau pathology and associated neurodegeneration, decreased neuroinflammation, and preserved synaptic density. These data were also corroborated by a significant reduction in levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL) protein in plasma of ASO‐treated mice.


Interpretation
We conclude that reducing ApoE4 levels should be explored further as a therapeutic approach for APOE4 carriers with tauopathy including Alzheimer's disease. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:952–966</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Inflammatory Cytokine Patterns Associated with Neurological Diseases in Coronavirus Disease 2019</title>

	<description>Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) can present with distinct neurological manifestations. This study shows that inflammatory neurological diseases were associated with increased levels of interleukin (IL)‐2, IL‐4, IL‐6, IL‐10, IL‐12, chemokine (C‐X‐C motif) ligand 8 (CXCL8), and CXCL10 in the cerebrospinal fluid. Conversely, encephalopathy was associated with high serum levels of IL‐6, CXCL8, and active tumor growth factor β1. Inflammatory syndromes of the central nervous system in COVID‐19 can appear early, as a parainfectious process without significant systemic involvement, or without direct evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 neuroinvasion. At the same time, encephalopathy is mainly influenced by peripheral events, including inflammatory cytokines. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:1041–1045</description>

	<description>Cerebral palsy (CP) neurologic care and research efforts typically focus on children. However, most people with CP are adults. Adults with CP are at increased risk of new neurologic conditions, such as stroke and myelopathy, that require ongoing neurologic surveillance to distinguish them from baseline motor impairments. Neurologic factors could also contribute to the motor function decline, chronic pain, and chronic fatigue that are commonly experienced by adults with CP. Based on a systematic literature review, we suggest (1) guidelines for neurologic surveillance and neurologist referral and (2) clinical research questions regarding the evolving neurologic risks for adults with CP.

	<description>Limited data exists regarding the disease course of Huntington's Disease (HD) in children and young adults. Here, we evaluate the trajectory of various cognitive skill development as a function of cytosine‐adenine‐guanine (CAG) repeat length in children and adolescents that carry the mutation that causes HD. We discovered that the development of verbal skills seems to plateau earlier as CAG repeat length increases. These findings increase our understanding of the relationship between neurodegeneration and neurodevelopment and may have far‐reaching implications for future gene‐therapy treatment strategies.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Heritability Enrichment Implicates Microglia in Parkinson's Disease Pathogenesis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26032</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26032?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
Understanding how different parts of the immune system contribute to pathogenesis in Parkinson's disease is a burning challenge with important therapeutic implications. We studied enrichment of common variant heritability for Parkinson's disease stratified by immune and brain cell types.


Methods
We used summary statistics from the most recent meta‐analysis of genomewide association studies in Parkinson's disease and partitioned heritability using linkage disequilibrium score regression, stratified for specific cell types, as defined by open chromatin regions. We also validated enrichment results using a polygenic risk score approach and intersected disease‐associated variants with epigenetic data and expression quantitative loci to nominate and explore a putative microglial locus.


Results
We found significant enrichment of Parkinson's disease risk heritability in open chromatin regions of microglia and monocytes. Genomic annotations overlapped substantially between these 2 cell types, and only the enrichment signal for microglia remained significant in a joint model. We present evidence suggesting P2RY12, a key microglial gene and target for the antithrombotic agent clopidogrel, as the likely driver of a significant Parkinson's disease association signal on chromosome 3.


Interpretation
Our results provide further support for the importance of immune mechanisms in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis, highlight microglial dysregulation as a contributing etiological factor, and nominate a targetable microglial gene candidate as a pathogenic player. Immune processes can be modulated by therapy, with potentially important clinical implications for future treatment in Parkinson's disease. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:942–951</description>

A total of 100% (n = 72) would recommend the experience to others. Most reported improved clinical (86%) and examination (82%) skills. All gained an understanding of different health care systems, and 83% reported deeper commitment to underserved populations. A total of 41 participants (57%) reported more judicious use of resources upon return to the United States. Global health electives had a positive impact on neurology trainees.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Superficial Siderosis: A Clinical Review</title>

	<description>Superficial siderosis of the central nervous system results from subpial hemosiderin deposition due to chronic low‐grade bleeding into the subarachnoid space. The confluent and marginal subpial hemosiderin is best appreciated on iron‐sensitive magnetic resonance imaging sequences. With widespread use of magnetic resonance imaging, the disorder is increasingly being recognized, including in asymptomatic individuals. Gait ataxia, often with hearing impairment is a common clinical presentation. A clinical history of subarachnoid hemorrhage is generally not present. A macrovascular pathology is generally not causative. The most common etiology is dural disease, often dural tears. Prior or less commonly ongoing symptoms of craniospinal hypovolemia may be present. Common etiologies for dural tears include disc disease and trauma, including surgical trauma. Patients with dural tears due to herniated and calcified discs often have a ventral intraspinal fluid collection due to cerebrospinal fluid leak. A precise identification of the dural tear relies on multi‐modality imaging. It has been speculated that chronic bleeding from fragile blood vessels around the dural tear may be the likely underlying mechanism. Surgical correction of the bleeding source is a logical therapeutic strategy. Clinical outcomes are variable though neuroimaging evidence of successful dural tear repair is noted. The currently available data regarding use of deferiprone in patients with superficial siderosis is insufficient to recommend its routine use in patients.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Comparison of Scalp ERP to Faces in Macaques and Humans</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Face recognition is an essential activity of social living, common to many primate species. Underlying processes in the brain have been investigated using various techniques and compared between species. Functional imaging studies have shown face-selective cortical regions and their degree of correspondence across species. However, the temporal dynamics of face processing, particularly processing speed, are likely different between them. Across sensory modalities activation of primary sensory cortices in macaque monkeys occurs at about 3/5 the latency of corresponding activation in humans, though this human simian difference may diminish or disappear in higher cortical regions. We recorded scalp event-related potentials (ERPs) to presentation of faces in macaques and estimated the peak latency of ERP components. Comparisons of latencies between macaques (112 ms) and humans (192 ms) suggested that the 3:5 ratio could be preserved in higher cognitive regions of face processing between those species.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Restoration of Two-Photon Ca2+ Imaging Data Through Model Blind Spatiotemporal Filtering</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Two-photon Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging is a leading technique for recording neuronal activities in vivo with cellular or subcellular resolution. However, during experiments, the images often suffer from corruption due to complex noises. Therefore, the analysis of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging data requires preprocessing steps, such as denoising, to extract biologically relevant information. We present an approach that facilitates imaging data restoration through image denoising performed by a neural network combining spatiotemporal filtering and model blind learning. Tests with synthetic and real two-photon Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach enables efficient restoration of imaging data. In addition, we demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods by evaluating the qualities of the denoising performance of the models quantitatively. Therefore, our method provides an invaluable tool for denoising two-photon Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging data by model blind spatiotemporal processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Automated Quantitative Analysis of ex vivo Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability Using Intellesis Machine-Learning</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;An increase in blood brain barrier permeability commonly precedes neuro-inflammation and cognitive impairment in models of dementia. Common methods to estimate capillary permeability have potential confounders, or require laborious and subjective semi-manual analysis.&lt;/p&gt;New method&lt;p&gt;Here we used snap frozen mouse and rat brain sections that were double-immunofluorescent labeled for immunoglobulin G (IgG; plasma protein) and laminin-α4 (capillary basement membrane). A Machine Learning Image Analysis program (Zeiss ZEN Intellisis) was trained to recognize and segment laminin-α4 to equivocally identify blood vessels in large sets of images. An IgG subclass based on a threshold intensity was segmented and quantitated only in extravascular regions. The residual parenchymal IgG fluorescence is indicative of blood-to-brain extravasation of IgG and was accurately quantitated.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Automated machine-learning and threshold based segmentation of only parenchymal IgG extravasation accentuates otherwise indistinct capillary permeability, particularly frequent in minor BBB leakage. Comparison with Existing Methods: Large datasets can be processed and analyzed quickly and robustly to provide an overview of vascular permeability throughout the brain. All human bias or ambiguity involved in classifying and measuring leakage is removed.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Here we describe a fast and precise method of visualizing and quantitating BBB permeability in mouse and rat brain tissue, while avoiding the confounding influence of unphysiological conditions such as perfusion and eliminating any human related bias from analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Effects of Perturbation Velocity, Direction, Background Muscle Activation, and Task Instruction on Long-Latency Responses Measured From Forearm Muscles</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.639773</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.639773</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The central nervous system uses feedback processes that occur at multiple time scales to control interactions with the environment. The long-latency response (LLR) is the fastest process that directly involves cortical areas, with a motoneuron response measurable 50 ms following an imposed limb displacement. Several behavioral factors concerning perturbation mechanics and the active role of muscles prior or during the perturbation can modulate the long-latency response amplitude (LLRa) in the upper limbs, but the interactions among many of these factors had not been systematically studied before. We conducted a behavioral study on thirteen healthy individuals to determine the effect and interaction of four behavioral factors – background muscle torque, perturbation direction, perturbation velocity, and task instruction – on the LLRa evoked from the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) muscles after velocity-controlled wrist displacements. The effects of the four factors were quantified using both a 0D statistical analysis on the average perturbation-evoked EMG signal in the period corresponding to an LLR, and using a timeseries analysis of EMG signals. All factors significantly modulated LLRa, and their combination nonlinearly contributed to modulating the LLRa. Specifically, all the three-way interaction terms that could be computed without including the interaction between instruction and velocity significantly modulated the LLR. Analysis of the three-way interaction terms of the 0D model indicated that for the ECU muscle, the LLRa evoked when subjects are asked to maintain their muscle activation in response to the perturbations was greater than the one observed when subjects yielded to the perturbations (p &amp;lt; 0.001), but this effect was not measured for muscles undergoing shortening or in absence of background muscle activation. Moreover, higher perturbation velocity increased the LLRa evoked from the stretched muscle in presence of a background torque (p &amp;lt; 0.001), but no effects of velocity were measured in absence of background torque. Also, our analysis identified significant modulations of LLRa in muscles shortened by the perturbation, including an interaction between torque and velocity, and an effect of both torque and velocity. The time-series analysis indicated the significance of additional transient effects in the LLR region for muscles undergoing shortening.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Generalizing Longitudinal Age Effects on Brain Structure – A Two-Study Comparison Approach</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.635687</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.635687</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cross-sectional studies indicate that normal aging is accompanied by decreases in brain structure. Longitudinal studies, however, are relatively rare and inconsistent regarding their outcomes. Particularly the heterogeneity of methods, sample characteristics and the high inter-individual variability in older adults prevent the deduction of general trends. Therefore, the current study aimed to compare longitudinal age-related changes in brain structure (measured through cortical thickness) in two large independent samples of healthy older adults (n = 161 each); the Longitudinal Healthy Aging Brain (LHAB) database project at the University of Zurich, Switzerland, and 1000BRAINS at the Research Center Juelich, Germany. Annual percentage changes in the two samples revealed stable to slight decreases in cortical thickness over time. After correction for major covariates, i.e., baseline age, sex, education, and image quality, sample differences were only marginally present. Results suggest that general trends across time might be generalizable over independent samples, assuming the same methodology is used, and similar sample characteristics are present.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Purpose: We aimed to find out the distributed functional connectome of white matter in patients with functional dyspepsia (FD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: 20 patients with FD and 24 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were included into the study. The functional connectome of white matter and graph theory were used to these participants. Two-sample t-test was used for the detection the abnormal graph properties in FD. Pearson correlation was used for the relationship between properties and the clinical and neuropshychological information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Patients with FD and healthy controls showed small-world properties in functional connectome of white matter. Compared with healthy controls, the FD group showed decreased global properties (Cp, S, Eglobal, and Elocal). Four pairs of fiber bundles that are connected to the frontal lobe, insula, and thalamus were affected in the FD group. Duration and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index positively correlated with the betweenness centrality of white matter regions of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: FD patients turned to a non-optimized functional organization of WM brain network. Frontal lobe, insula, and thalamus were key regions in brain information exchange of FD. It provided some novel imaging evidences for the mechanism of FD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Dark Rearing Promotes the Recovery of Visual Cortical Responses but Not the Morphology of Geniculocortical Axons in Amblyopic Cat</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.637638</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Monocular deprivation (MD) of vision during early postnatal life induces amblyopia, and most neurons in the primary visual cortex lose their responses to the closed eye. Anatomically, the somata of neurons in the closed-eye recipient layer of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) shrink and their axons projecting to the visual cortex retract. Although it has been difficult to restore visual acuity after maturation, recent studies in rodents and cats showed that a period of exposure to complete darkness could promote recovery from amblyopia induced by prior MD. However, in cats, which have an organization of central visual pathways similar to humans, the effect of dark rearing only improves monocular vision and does not restore binocular depth perception. To determine whether dark rearing can completely restore the visual pathway, we examined its effect on the three major concomitants of MD in individual visual neurons, eye preference of visual cortical neurons and soma size and axon morphology of LGN neurons. Dark rearing improved the recovery of visual cortical responses to the closed eye compared with the recovery under binocular conditions. However, geniculocortical axons serving the closed eye remained retracted after dark rearing, whereas reopening the closed eye restored the soma size of LGN neurons. These results indicate that dark rearing incompletely restores the visual pathway, and thus exerts a limited restorative effect on visual function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Non-Cell-Autonomous Regulation of Optic Nerve Regeneration by Amacrine Cells</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Visual information is conveyed from the eye to the brain through the axons of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that course through the optic nerve and synapse onto neurons in multiple subcortical visual relay areas. RGCs cannot regenerate their axons once they are damaged, similar to most mature neurons in the central nervous system (CNS), and soon undergo cell death. These phenomena of neurodegeneration and regenerative failure are widely viewed as being determined by cell-intrinsic mechanisms within RGCs or to be influenced by the extracellular environment, including glial or inflammatory cells. However, a new concept is emerging that the death or survival of RGCs and their ability to regenerate axons are also influenced by the complex circuitry of the retina and that the activation of a multicellular signaling cascade involving changes in inhibitory interneurons – the amacrine cells (AC) – contributes to the fate of RGCs. Here, we review our current understanding of the role that interneurons play in cell survival and axon regeneration after optic nerve injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: NF-κB-Induced Upregulation of miR-146a-5p Promoted Hippocampal Neuronal Oxidative Stress and Pyroptosis via TIGAR in a Model of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that places a heavy burden on patients and society. Hippocampal neuronal loss is a hallmark of AD progression. Therefore, understanding the mechanism underlying hippocampal neuronal death would be of great importance for the diagnosis and treatment of AD. This study aimed to explore the molecular mechanism via which nuclear factor kappa β (NF-κB) promotes hippocampal neuronal oxidative stress and pyroptosis in AD. We collected serum samples from 101 healthy elderly people and 112 patients with AD at the Affiliated Hospital of Kunming University of Science and Technology between January 2017 and January 2020. Commercially available human hippocampal neurons (HHNs) were used to establish an AD model (AD-HHN) following Aβ25–35 treatment. The mRNA expression levels of NF-κB and pyroptosis markers [NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3, caspase-1, interleukin (IL)-1β, and interleukin-18] mRNA and the expression level of miR-146a-5p in the serum samples of patients with AD and AD-HHNs were determined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Oxidative stress indices (reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and catalase) were measured by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The expression of proteins [NF-κB, TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR), and pyroptosis markers] was tested by western blotting. The relationship between miR-146a-5p and TIGAR was investigated using a dual luciferase reporter gene assay. We found that NF-κB and miR-146a-5p were highly expressed, while TIGAR was low expressed in patients with AD and AD-HHNs. In addition, there was a significant positive correlation between the expression levels of NF-κB and miR-146a-5p, but a negative correlation between NF-κB mRNA and TIGAR mRNA in patients with AD, as well as miR-146a-5p and TIGAR mRNA in patients with AD. In AD-HNNs, miR-146a-5p targeted and downregulated the expression of TIGAR. Knockdown of NF-κB or overexpression of TIGAR markedly attenuated oxidative stress and pyroptosis in AD-HHNs, while concurrent overexpression of miR-146a-5p inhibited these effects. In conclusion, NF-κB-induced upregulation of miR-146a-5p promoted oxidative stress and pyroptosis in AD-HNNs by targeting TIGAR.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: 3D Reconstruction of the Morpho-Functional Topography of the Human Vagal Trigone</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Vagal Trigone, often referred to as Ala Cinerea, is a triangular-shaped area of the floor of the fourth ventricle that is strictly involved in the network of chardiochronotropic, baroceptive, respiratory, and gastrointestinal control systems of the medulla oblongata. While it is frequently identified as the superficial landmark for the underlying Dorsal Motor Nucleus of the Vagus, this correspondence is not univocal in anatomical literature and is often oversimplified in neuroanatomy textbooks and neurosurgical atlases. As the structure represents an important landmark for neurosurgical procedures involving the floor of the fourth ventricle, accurate morphological characterization is required to avoid unwanted side effects (e.g., bradychardia, hypertension) during neuorphysiological monitoring and cranial nerve nuclei stimulation in intraoperative settings. The aim of this study was to address the anatomo-topographical relationships of the Vagal Trigone with the underlying nuclei. For this purpose, we have conducted an anatomo-microscopical examination of serial sections deriving from 54 Human Brainstems followed by 3D reconstruction and rendering of the specimens. Our findings indicate that the Vagal Trigone corresponds only partially with the Dorsal Motor Nucleus of the Vagus, while most of its axial profile is occupied by the dorsal regions of the Solitary Tract Nucleus. Furthermore, basing on literature and our findings we speculate that the neuroblasts of the Dorsal Motor Nucleus of the Vagus undergo neurobiotaxic migration induced by the neuroblasts of the dorsolaterally located solitary tract nucleus, giving rise to the Ala Cinerea, a topographically defined area for parasympathetic visceral control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Multiple Roles in Neuroprotection for the Exercise Derived Myokine Irisin</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Exercise has multiple beneficial effects on health including decreasing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. Such effects are thought to be mediated (at least in part) by myokines, a collection of cytokines and other small proteins released from skeletal muscles. As an endocrine organ, skeletal muscle synthesizes and secretes a wide range of myokines which contribute to different functions in different organs, including the brain. One such myokine is the recently discovered protein Irisin, which is secreted into circulation from skeletal muscle during exercise from its membrane bound precursor Fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5). Irisin contributes to metabolic processes such as glucose homeostasis and browning of white adipose tissue. Irisin also crosses the blood brain barrier and initiates a neuroprotective genetic program in the hippocampus that culminates with increased expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Furthermore, exercise and FNDC5/Irisin have been shown to have several neuroprotective effects against injuries in ischemia and neurodegenerative disease models, including Alzheimer’s disease. In addition, Irisin has anxiolytic and antidepressant effects. In this review we present and summarize recent findings on the multiple effects of Irisin on neural function, including signaling pathways and mechanisms involved. We also discuss how exercise can positively influence brain function and mental health via the “skeletal muscle-brain axis.” While there are still many unanswered questions, we put forward the idea that Irisin is a potentially essential mediator of the skeletal muscle-brain crosstalk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Role of mTOR-Regulated Autophagy in Synaptic Plasticity Related Proteins Downregulation and the Reference Memory Deficits Induced by Anesthesia/Surgery in Aged Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.628541</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Postoperative cognitive dysfunction increases mortality and morbidity in perioperative patients and has become a major concern for patients and caregivers. Previous studies demonstrated that synaptic plasticity is closely related to cognitive function, anesthesia and surgery inhibit synaptic function. In central nervous system, autophagy is vital to synaptic plasticity, homeostasis of synapticproteins, synapse elimination, spine pruning, proper axon guidance, and when dysregulated, is associated with behavioral and memory functions disorders. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) negatively regulates the process of autophagy. This study aimed to explore whether rapamycin can ameliorate anesthesia/surgery-induced cognitive deficits by inhibiting mTOR, activating autophagy and rising synaptic plasticity-related proteins in the hippocampus. Aged C57BL/6J mice were used to establish POCD models with exploratory laparotomy under isoflurane anesthesia. The Morris Water Maze (MWM) was used to measure reference memory after anesthesia and surgery. The levels of mTOR phosphorylation (p-mTOR), Beclin-1 and LC3-II were examined on postoperative days 1, 3 and 7 by western blotting. The levels of synaptophysin (SYN) and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) in the hippocampus were also examined by western blotting. Here we showed that anesthesia/surgery impaired reference memory and induced the activation of mTOR, decreased the expression of autophagy-related proteins such as Beclin-1 and LC3-II. A corresponding decline in the expression of neuronal/synaptic, plasticity-related proteins such as SYN and PSD-95 was also observed. Pretreating mice with rapamycin inhibited the activation of mTOR and restored autophagy function, also increased the expression of SYN and PSD-95. Furthermore, anesthesia/surgery-induced learning and memory deficits were also reversed by rapamycin pretreatment. In conclusion, anesthesia/surgery induced mTOR hyperactivation and autophagy impairments, and then reduced the levels of SYN and PSD-95 in the hippocampus. An mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, ameliorated anesthesia/surgery-related cognitive impairments by inhibiting the mTOR activity, inducing activation of autophagy, enhancing SYN and PSD-95 expression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;To develop and validate a prediction nomogram based on motoric cognitive risk syndrome for cognitive impairment in healthy older adults.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Using two longitudinal cohorts of participants (aged ≥ 60 years) with 4-year follow-up, we developed (n = 1,177) and validated (n = 2,076) a prediction nomogram. LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression model and multivariable Cox regression analysis were used for variable selection and for developing the prediction model, respectively. The performance of the nomogram was assessed with respect to its calibration, discrimination, and clinical usefulness.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The individualized prediction nomogram was assessed based on the following: motoric cognitive risk syndrome, education, gender, baseline cognition, and age. The model showed good discrimination [Harrell’s concordance index (C-index) of 0.814; 95% confidence interval, 0.782–0.835] and good calibration. Comparable results were also seen in the validation cohort, which includes good discrimination (C-index, 0.772; 95% confidence interval, 0.776–0.818) and good calibration. Decision curve analysis demonstrated that the prediction nomogram was clinically useful.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This prediction nomogram provides a practical tool with all necessary predictors, which are accessible to practitioners. It can be used to estimate the risk of cognitive impairment in healthy older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Probabilistic value learning in medial temporal lobe amnesia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/10.1002/hipo.23317</guid>

	<description>Abstract
A prevailing view in cognitive neuroscience suggests that different forms of learning are mediated by dissociable memory systems, with a mesolimbic (i.e., midbrain and basal ganglia) system supporting incremental trial‐and‐error reinforcement learning and a hippocampal‐based system supporting episodic memory. Yet, growing evidence suggests that the hippocampus may also be important for trial‐and‐error learning, particularly value or reward‐based learning. In the present report, we use a lesion‐based neuropsychological approach to clarify hippocampal contributions to such learning. Six amnesic patients with medial temporal lobe damage and a group of healthy controls were administered a simple value‐based learning task involving probabilistic trial‐and‐error acquisition of stimulus–response‐outcome (reward or none) contingencies modeled after Li et al. (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
, 2011, 108
(1), 55–60). As predicted, patients were significantly impaired on the task, demonstrating reduced learning of the contingencies. Our results provide further supportive evidence that the hippocampus' role in cognition extends beyond episodic memory tasks and call for further refinement of theoretical models of hippocampal functioning.</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Dorsal and ventral mossy cells differ in their axonal projections throughout the dentate gyrus of the mouse hippocampus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/10.1002/hipo.23314</guid>

	<description>Abstract
Glutamatergic hilar mossy cells (MCs) have axons that terminate both near and far from their cell body but stay within the DG, making synapses primarily in the molecular layer. The long‐range axons are considered the primary projection, and extend throughout the DG ipsilateral to the soma, and project to the contralateral DG. The specificity of MC axons for the inner molecular layer (IML) has been considered to be a key characteristic of the DG. In the present study, we made the surprising finding that dorsal MC axons are an exception to this rule. We used two mouse lines that allow for Cre‐dependent viral labeling of MCs and their axons: dopamine receptor D2 (Drd2‐Cre) and calcitonin receptor‐like receptor (Crlr‐Cre). A single viral injection into the dorsal DG to label dorsal MCs resulted in labeling of MC axons in both the IML and middle molecular layer (MML). Interestingly, this broad termination of dorsal MC axons occurred throughout the septotemporal DG. In contrast, long‐range axons of ventral MCs terminated in the IML, consistent with the literature. Taken together, these results suggest that dorsal and ventral MCs differ significantly in their axonal projections. Since MC projections in the ML are thought to terminate primarily on GCs, the results suggest a dorsal–ventral difference in MC activation of GCs. The surprising difference in dorsal and ventral MC projections should therefore be considered when evaluating dorsal–ventral differences in DG function.</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Sodium salicylate enhances neural excitation via reducing GABAergic transmission in the dentate gyrus area of rat hippocampus in vivo</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/10.1002/hipo.23312</guid>

	<description>Abstract
Sodium salicylate, one of the non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, is widely prescribed in the clinic, but a high dose of usage can cause hyperactivity in the central nervous system, including the hippocampus. At present, the neural mechanism underlying the induced hyperactivity is not fully understood, in particular, in the hippocampus under an in vivo condition. In this study, we found that systemic administration of sodium salicylate increased the field excitatory postsynaptic potential slope and the population spike amplitude in a dose‐dependent manner in the hippocampal dentate gyrus area of rats with in vivo field potential extracellular recordings, which indicates that sodium salicylate enhances basal synaptic transmission and neural excitation. In the presence of picrotoxin, a GABA‐A receptor antagonist, sodium salicylate failed to increase the initial slope of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential and the amplitude of the population spike in vivo. To further explore how sodium salicylate enhances the neural excitation, we made whole‐cell patch‐clamp recordings from hippocampal slices. We found that perfusion of the slice with sodium salicylate decreased electrically evoked GABA receptor‐mediated currents, increased paired‐pulse ratio, and lowered frequency and amplitude of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents. Together, these results demonstrate that sodium salicylate enhances the neural excitation through suppressing GABAergic synaptic transmission in presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms in the hippocampal dentate gyrus area. Our findings may help understand the side effects caused by sodium salicylate in the central nervous system.</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Hippocampal beta oscillations predict mouse object‐location associative memory performance</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/10.1002/hipo.23311</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23311?af=R</link>
	<description>Abstract
Memorizing the locations of environmental cues is crucial for survival and depends on the hippocampus. We recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from the hippocampus of freely moving mice during an object location task. The power of beta‐band (23–30 Hz) oscillations increased immediately before approaching objects in a memory‐encoding phase. The exploration‐induced beta oscillations gradually decreased during the memory‐encoding session. Mice that exhibited stronger beta oscillation power exhibited better performance in the subsequent memory‐retrieval test. These results suggest that beta oscillations in the hippocampal CA1 region are involved in the memory encoding of object‐location associations.</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Expression of reelin with age in the human hippocampal formation</title>

	<description>Abstract
Reelin plays a key role in neuronal migration and lamination in the cortex and hippocampus. Animal studies have shown that reelin expression decreases with age. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of reelin in all layers of the human hippocampal formation across three age groups. We used immunohistochemistry in formalin fixed and paraffin embedded hippocampal tissue from infants (1–10 months; n = 9), children (4–10 years; n = 4), and adults (45–60 years; n = 6) to stain for reelin. Expression was quantified (measured as the number of positive reelin cells/mm2) in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus (DG), the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (ML), the hippocampal fissure (HF), stratum lacunosum moleculare (SLM), CA4/Hilus and the stratum pyramidale layer of CA3, CA2, and CA1. Expression of reelin was highest in the HF irrespective of age, followed by the SLM and ML. Minimal to no expression was seen in the stratum pyramidale layer of CA1‐3. With age, reelin expression decreased and was statistically significant from infancy to childhood in the HF (p = .02). This study confirms that reelin expression decreases with age in the human hippocampus, and shows for the first time that the major decrease occurs between infancy and early childhood.</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Cross‐regional phase amplitude coupling supports the encoding of episodic memories</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/10.1002/hipo.23309</guid>

	<description>Abstract
Phase amplitude coupling (PAC) between theta and gamma oscillations represents a key neurophysiological mechanism that promotes the temporal organization of oscillatory activity. For this reason, PAC has been implicated in item/context integration for episodic processes, including coordinating activity across multiple cortical regions. While data in humans has focused principally on PAC within a single brain region, data in rodents has revealed evidence that the phase of the hippocampal theta oscillation modulates gamma oscillations in the cortex (and vice versa). This pattern, termed cross‐regional PAC (xPAC), has not previously been observed in human subjects engaged in mnemonic processing. We use a unique dataset with intracranial electrodes inserted simultaneously into the hippocampus and seven cortical regions across 40 human subjects to (1) test for the presence of significant cross‐regional PAC (xPAC), (2) to establish that the magnitude of xPAC predicts memory encoding success, (3) to describe specific frequencies within the broad 2–9 Hz theta range that govern hippocampal‐cortical interactions in xPAC, and (4) compare anterior versus posterior hippocampal xPAC patterns. We find that strong functional xPAC occurs principally between the hippocampus and other mesial temporal structures, namely entorhinal and parahippocampal cortices, and that xPAC is overall stronger for posterior hippocampal connections. We also show that our results are not confounded by alternative factors such as inter‐regional phase synchrony, local PAC occurring within cortical regions, or artifactual theta oscillatory waveforms.</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Influence of regional white matter hyperintensity volume and apolipoprotein E ε4 status on hippocampal volume in healthy older adults</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/10.1002/hipo.23308</guid>

	<description>Abstract
While total white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been associated with hippocampal atrophy, less is known about how the regional distribution of WMH volume may differentially affect the hippocampus in healthy aging. Additionally, apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carriers may be at an increased risk for greater WMH volumes and hippocampal atrophy in aging. The present study sought to investigate whether regional WMH volume mediates the relationship between age and hippocampal volume and if this association is moderated by APOE ε4 status in a group of 190 cognitively healthy adults (APOE ε4 status [carrier/non‐carrier] = 59/131), ages 50–89. Analyses revealed that temporal lobe WMH volume significantly mediated the relationship between age and average bilateral hippocampal volume, and this effect was moderated by APOE ε4 status (−0.020 (SE = 0.009), 95% CI, [−0.039, −0.003]). APOE ε4 carriers, but not non‐carriers, showed negative indirect effects of age on hippocampal volume through temporal lobe WMH volume (APOE ε4 carriers: −0.016 (SE = 0.007), 95% CI, [−0.030, −0.003]; APOE ε4 non‐carriers: .005 (SE = 0.006), 95% CI, [−0.006, 0.017]). These findings remained significant after additionally adjusting for sex, years of education, hypertension status and duration, cholesterol status, diabetes status, Body Mass Index, history of smoking, and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale‐IV Full Scale IQ. There were no significant moderated mediation effects for frontal, parietal, and occipital lobe WMH volumes, with or without covariates. Our findings indicate that in cognitively healthy older adults, elevated WMH volume regionally localized to the temporal lobes in APOE ε4 carriers is associated with reduced hippocampal volume, suggesting greater vulnerability to brain aging and the risk for Alzheimer's disease.</description>

Cardiac anatomy plays a crucial role in determining cardiac function. However, there is a poor understanding of how specific and localised anatomical changes affect different cardiac functional outputs. In this work, we test the hypothesis that in a statistical shape model (SSM), the modes that are most relevant for describing anatomy are also most important for determining the output of cardiac electromechanics simulations. We made patient-specific four-chamber heart meshes (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 20) from cardiac CT images in asymptomatic subjects and created a SSM from 19 cases. Nine modes captured 90% of the anatomical variation in the SSM. Functional simulation outputs correlated best with modes 2, 3 and 9 on average (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; = 0.49 ± 0.17, 0.37 ± 0.23 and 0.34 ± 0.17 respectively). We performed a global sensitivity analysis to identify the different modes responsible for different simulated electrical and mechanical measures of cardiac function. Modes 2 and 9 were the most important for determining simulated left ventricular mechanics and pressure-derived phenotypes. Mode 2 explained 28.56 ± 16.48% and 25.5 ± 20.85, and mode 9 explained 12.1 ± 8.74% and 13.54 ± 16.91% of the variances of mechanics and pressure-derived phenotypes, respectively. Electrophysiological biomarkers were explained by the interaction of 3 ± 1 modes. In the healthy adult human heart, shape modes that explain large portions of anatomical variance do not explain equivalent levels of electromechanical functional variation. As a result, in cardiac models, representing patient anatomy using a limited number of modes of anatomical variation can cause a loss in accuracy of simulated electromechanical function.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eTlBJyE2pCY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Repeat proteins are abundant in eukaryotic proteomes. They are involved in many eukaryotic specific functions, including signalling. For many of these proteins, the structure is not known, as they are difficult to crystallise. Today, using direct coupling analysis and deep learning it is often possible to predict a protein’s structure. However, the unique sequence features present in repeat proteins have been a challenge to use direct coupling analysis for predicting contacts. Here, we show that deep learning-based methods (trRosetta, DeepMetaPsicov (DMP) and PconsC4) overcomes this problem and can predict intra- and inter-unit contacts in repeat proteins. In a benchmark dataset of 815 repeat proteins, about 90% can be correctly modelled. Further, among 48 PFAM families lacking a protein structure, we produce models of forty-one families with estimated high accuracy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NC-_vO_A2A8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Brain networks exhibit very variable and dynamical functional connectivity and flexible configurations of information exchange despite their overall fixed structure. Brain oscillations are hypothesized to underlie time-dependent functional connectivity by periodically changing the excitability of neural populations. In this paper, we investigate the role of the connection delay and the detuning between the natural frequencies of neural populations in the transmission of signals. Based on numerical simulations and analytical arguments, we show that the amount of information transfer between two oscillating neural populations could be determined by their connection delay and the mismatch in their oscillation frequencies. Our results highlight the role of the collective phase response curve of the oscillating neural populations for the efficacy of signal transmission and the quality of the information transfer in brain networks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rB0tSDpOfkI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Speech biomarkers in rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and Parkinson's disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26085</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26085?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
This multi‐language study employed simple speech recording and high‐end pattern analysis to provide sensitive and reliable non‐invasive biomarkers of prodromal vs. manifest alpha‐synucleinopathy in patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (iRBD) and early‐stage Parkinson's disease (PD).


Methods
We performed a multicentre study across the Czech, English, German, French and Italian languages at seven centres in Europe and North America. A total of 448 participants (337 males) including 150 with iRBD (mean duration of iRBD across language groups 0.5–3.4 years), 149 with PD (mean duration of disease across language groups 1.7–2.5 years), and 149 healthy controls were recorded; 350 of the participants completed the 12‐month follow‐up. We developed a fully‐automated acoustic quantitative assessment approach for the seven distinctive patterns of hypokinetic dysarthria.


Results
No language differences that impacted clinical parkinsonian phenotypes were found. Compared to the controls, we found significant abnormalities of an overall acoustic speech severity measure via composite dysarthria index for both iRBD (p = 0.002) and PD (p &amp;lt; 0.001). By contrast, only PD (p &amp;lt; 0.001) was perceptually distinct in a blinded subjective analysis. We found significant group differences between PD and controls for monopitch (p &amp;lt; 0.001), prolonged pauses (p &amp;lt; 0.001) and imprecise consonants (p = 0.03); only monopitch was able to differentiate iRBD patients from controls (p = 0.004). At the 12‐month follow‐up, a slight progression of overall acoustic speech impairment was noted for the iRBD (p = 0.04) and PD (p = 0.03) groups.


Interpretation
Automated speech analysis may provide a useful additional biomarker of parkinsonism for the assessment of disease progression and therapeutic interventions.

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Controlling for activity‐dependent genes and behavioral states is critical for determining brain relationships within and across species</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/10.1002/cne.25157</guid>

	<description>In 2016, Puelles et al. sought to determine the relationship of avian and mammalian pallial regions using the expression profile of the NR4A2 nuclear orphan receptor, concluding that the lateral avian mesopallium was most like the mammalian claustrum, not layer 2 of the cortex as found by Suzuki and Hirata (2014). However, we found that the NR4A2 expression patterns were characteristic of an activity‐dependent gene. Looking at different behavioral contexts in the zebra finch, we found induced expression of NR4A2 in regions across the pallium associated with visual, somatosensory, and motor activity, confounding and contradicting previous findings. Accordingly, we do not believe NR4A2 is a suitable gene for assessing homologous brain anatomy without understanding the animal's behavioral state.







Abstract
The genetic profile of vertebrate pallia has long driven debate on homology across distantly related clades. Based on an expression profile of the orphan nuclear receptor NR4A2 in mouse and chicken brains, Puelles et al. (2016) concluded that the avian lateral mesopallium is homologous to the mammalian claustrum, and the medial mesopallium homologous to the insula cortex. They argued that their findings contradict conclusions by Jarvis et al. (2013) and Chen et al. (2013) that the hyperpallium densocellare is instead a mesopallium cell population, and by Suzuki and Hirata (2013) that the avian mesopallium is homologous to mammalian cortical layers 2/3. Here, we find that NR4A2 is an activity‐dependent gene and cannot be used to determine brain organization or species relationships without considering behavioral state. Activity‐dependent NR4A2 expression has been previously demonstrated in the rodent brain, with the highest induction occurring within the claustrum, amygdala, deep and superficial cortical layers, and hippocampus. In the zebra finch, we find that NR4A2 is constitutively expressed in the arcopallium, but induced in parts of the mesopallium, and in sparse cells within the hyperpallium, depending on animal stimulus or behavioral state. Basal and induced NR4A2 expression patterns do not discount the previously named avian hyperpallium densocellare as dorsal mesopallium and conflict with proposed homology between the avian mesopallium and mammalian claustrum/insula at the exclusion of other brain regions. Broadly, these findings highlight the importance of controlling for behavioral state and neural activity to genetically define brain cell population relationships within and across species.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Cerebrovascular Neuroprotection after Acute Concussion in Adolescents</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26082</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26082?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
To assess acute cerebrovascular function in concussed adolescents (14‐21 years of age), whether it related to resting cerebral hemodynamics, and whether it recovered chronically.


Methods
Cerebral vasoreactivity and autoregulation, based on middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity, were assessed in 28 concussed participants (≤14 days of injury) and 29 matched controls. The participants in the concussion group returned for an 8‐week follow‐up assessment. Over the course of those 8‐weeks, participants recorded aerobic exercise frequency and duration.


Results
Between group demographic, clinical, and hemodynamic variables were not significantly different. Vasoreactivity was significantly higher in the concussed group (p=0.02). Within the concussed group, 60% of the variability in resting cerebral blood flow velocity was explained by vasoreactivity and two components of autoregulation – falling slope and effectiveness of autoregulation (adjusted R2=0.60, p&amp;lt;0.001). Moreover, lower mean arterial pressure, lower responses to increases in arterial pressure, and lower vasoreactivity were significantly associated with larger symptom burden (adjusted R2=0.72, p&amp;lt;0.01). By the 8‐week timepoint, symptom burden, but not vasoreactivity, improved in all but four concussed participants (p&amp;lt;0.01). 8‐week change in vasoreactivity was positively associated with aerobic exercise volume (adjusted R2=0.19, p=0.02).


Interpretation
Concussion resulted in changes in cerebrovascular regulatory mechanisms, which in turn explained the variability in resting cerebral blood flow velocity and acute symptom burden. Furthermore, these alterations persisted chronically despite symptom resolution, but was positively modified by aerobic exercise volume. These findings provide a mechanistic framework for further investigation into underlying cerebrovascular related symptomatology.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Motility Profile of Captive-Bred Marmosets Revealed by a Long-Term In-Cage Monitoring System</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A quantitative evaluation of motility is crucial for studies employing experimental animals. Here, we describe the development of an in-cage motility monitoring method for new world monkeys using off-the-shelf components, and demonstrate its capability for long-term operation (e.g., a year). Based on this novel system, we characterized the motility of the common marmoset over different time scales (seconds, hours, days, and weeks). Monitoring of seven young animals belonging to two different age groups (sub-adult and young-adult) over a 231-day period revealed: (1) strictly diurnal activity (97.3% of movement during daytime), (2) short-cycle (∼20 s) transition in activity, and (3) bimodal diurnal activity including a “siesta” break. Additionally, while the mean duration of short-cycle activity, net daily activity, and diurnal activity changed over the course of development, 24-h periodicity remained constant. Finally, the method allowed for detection of progressive motility deterioration in a transgenic marmoset. Motility measurement offers a convenient way to characterize developmental and pathological changes in animals, as well as an economical and labor-free means for long-term evaluation in a wide range of basic and translational studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;For more than two decades, there has been converging evidence for an essential role of the cerebellum in non-motor functions. The cerebellum is not only important in learning and sensorimotor processes, some growing evidences show its implication in conditional learning and reward, which allows building our expectations about behavioral outcomes. More recent work has demonstrated that the cerebellum is also required for the sense of agency, a cognitive process that allows recognizing an action as our own, suggesting that the cerebellum might serve as an interface between sensorimotor function and cognition. A unifying model that would explain the role of the cerebellum across these processes has not been fully established. Nonetheless, an important heritage was given by the field of motor control: the forward model theory. This theory stipulates that movements are controlled based on the constant interactions between our organism and its environment through feedforward and feedback loops. Feedforward loops predict what is going to happen, while feedback loops confront the prediction with what happened so that we can react accordingly. From an anatomical point of view, the cerebellum is at an ideal location at the interface between the motor and sensory systems, as it is connected to cerebral, striatal, and spinal entities via parallel loops, so that it can link sensory and motor systems with cognitive processes. Recent findings showing that the cerebellum participates in building the sense of agency as a predictive and comparator system will be reviewed together with past work on motor control within the context of the forward model theory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The history of neural activity determines the synaptic plasticity mechanisms employed in the brain. Previous studies report a rapid reduction in the strength of excitatory synapses onto layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons of the primary visual cortex (V1) following two days of dark exposure and subsequent re-exposure to light. The abrupt increase in visually driven activity is predicted to drive homeostatic plasticity, however, the parameters of neural activity that trigger these changes are unknown. To determine this, we first recorded spike trains in vivo from V1 layer 4 (L4) of dark exposed (DE) mice of both sexes that were re-exposed to light through homogeneous or patterned visual stimulation. We found that delivering the spike patterns recorded in vivo to L4 of V1 slices was sufficient to reduce the amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) of V1 L2/3 neurons in DE mice, but not in slices obtained from normal reared (NR) controls. Unexpectedly, the same stimulation pattern produced an up-regulation of mEPSC amplitudes in V1 L2/3 neurons from mice that received 2 h of light re-exposure (LE). A Poisson spike train exhibiting the same average frequency as the patterns recorded in vivo was equally effective at depressing mEPSC amplitudes in L2/3 neurons in V1 slices prepared from DE mice. Collectively, our results suggest that the history of visual experience modifies the responses of V1 neurons to stimulation and that rapid homeostatic depression of excitatory synapses can be driven by non-patterned input activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Myosin V Regulates Spatial Localization of Different Forms of Neurotransmitter Release in Central Synapses</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Synaptic active zone (AZ) contains multiple specialized release sites for vesicle fusion. The utilization of release sites is regulated to determine spatiotemporal organization of the two main forms of synchronous release, uni-vesicular (UVR) and multi-vesicular (MVR). We previously found that the vesicle-associated molecular motor myosin V regulates temporal utilization of release sites by controlling vesicle anchoring at release sites in an activity-dependent manner. Here we show that acute inhibition of myosin V shifts preferential location of vesicle docking away from AZ center toward periphery, and results in a corresponding spatial shift in utilization of release sites during UVR. Similarly, inhibition of myosin V also reduces preferential utilization of central release sites during MVR, leading to more spatially distributed and temporally uniform MVR that occurs farther away from the AZ center. Using a modeling approach, we provide a conceptual framework that unites spatial and temporal functions of myosin V in vesicle release by controlling the gradient of release site release probability across the AZ, which in turn determines the spatiotemporal organization of both UVR and MVR. Thus myosin V regulates both temporal and spatial utilization of release sites during two main forms of synchronous release.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Visual Outcomes in Experimental Rodent Models of Blast-Mediated Traumatic Brain Injury</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Blast-mediated traumatic brain injuries (bTBI) cause long-lasting physical, cognitive, and psychological disorders, including persistent visual impairment. No known therapies are currently utilized in humans to lessen the lingering and often serious symptoms. With TBI mortality decreasing due to advancements in medical and protective technologies, there is growing interest in understanding the pathology of visual dysfunction after bTBI. However, this is complicated by numerous variables, e.g., injury location, severity, and head and body shielding. This review summarizes the visual outcomes observed by various, current experimental rodent models of bTBI, and identifies data showing that bTBI activates inflammatory and apoptotic signaling leading to visual dysfunction. Pharmacologic treatments blocking inflammation and cell death pathways reported to alleviate visual deficits in post-bTBI animal models are discussed. Notably, techniques for assessing bTBI outcomes across exposure paradigms differed widely, so we urge future studies to compare multiple models of blast injury, to allow data to be directly compared.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
