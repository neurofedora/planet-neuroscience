	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Millisecond Spike Timing Codes for Motor Control</title>

	<description>Millisecond variations in spiking patterns can radically alter motor behavior, suggesting that traditional rate-based theories of motor control require revision. The importance of spike timing in sensorimotor control arises from dynamic interactions between the nervous system, muscles, and the body. New mechanisms, model systems, and theories are revealing how these interactions shape behavior.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: When Sound Stops: Offset Responses in the Auditory System</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30227-3?rss=yes</guid>

	<description>The auditory modality is fundamentally a temporal sense that requires analysis of changes in sound signals on timescales ranging from microseconds to minutes. To generate a faithful representation of changes in sound intensity and frequency over time, sound offsets (disappearances) as well as sound onsets (appearances) must be encoded by the auditory system. We review here the computational significance, perceptual roles, anatomical locations, and cellular and network origins of sound-offset responses in the mammalian auditory brain.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Roles of Brain Criticality and Multiscale Oscillations in Temporal Predictions for Sensorimotor Processing</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30220-0?rss=yes</guid>
	<link>https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30220-0?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Sensorimotor predictions are essential for adaptive behavior. In natural environments, events that demand sensorimotor predictions unfold across many timescales, and corresponding temporal predictions (either explicit or implicit) should therefore emerge in brain dynamics. Neuronal oscillations are scale-specific processes found in several frequency bands. They underlie periodicity in sensorimotor processing and can represent temporal predictions via their phase dynamics. These processes build upon endogenous neural rhythmicity and adapt in response to exogenous timing demands.</description>

	<description>The rate of affective disorder is substantially higher in women than in men, and considerable evidence points to the actions of ovarian hormones in mediating this disparity. In this Opinion, we discuss the hypothesis that cyclic changes in ovarian hormone levels produce cyclic alterations in connectivity between the intrinsic networks of the brain. These alterations produce specific temporal windows within the menstrual cycle when internetwork connectivity is increased, associated with increased stress reactivity and better memory for unpleasant, arousing events, leading to increased negative mood and susceptibility to affective disorder.</description>

	<description>Over the 40 years that TINS has been in existence, there has been substantial progress in understanding the types, organisation, and neural mechanisms of memory. The selectivity of memory maintenance and retention remains a puzzle, and we here summarise two contributions of our own research to this enigma: the striking impact of the novelty and surprise often of other events happening around the time that a new memory is encoded and how activated prior knowledge guides the updating process that characterises aspects of memory consolidation.</description>

	<description>Speakers of different languages think about time differently in accordance with the spatial metaphors common in their languages. Furthermore, learning new spatial metaphors in language instills new non-linguistic representations of time, suggesting that language can play a causal role in constructing mental timelines.</description>

	<description>The neocortex is one of the most distinctive structures of the mammalian brain, yet also one of the most varied in terms of both size and organization. Multiple processes have contributed to this variability, including evolutionary mechanisms (i.e., alterations in gene sequence) that alter the size, organization, and connections of neocortex, and activity dependent mechanisms that can also modify these same features. Thus, changes to the neocortex can occur over different time-scales, including within a single generation.</description>

	<description>The ability to detect time intervals and temporal patterns is critical to some of the most fundamental computations the brain performs, including the ability to communicate and appraise a dynamically changing environment. Many of these computations take place on the scale of tens to hundreds of milliseconds. Electrophysiological evidence shows that some neurons respond selectively to duration, interval, rate, or order. Because the time constants of many time-varying neural and synaptic properties, including short-term synaptic plasticity (STP), are also in the range of tens to hundreds of milliseconds, they are strong candidates to underlie the formation of temporally selective neurons.</description>

	<description>GABAergic interneurons, which are highly diverse, have long been thought to contribute to the timing of neural activity as well as to the generation and shaping of brain rhythms. GABAergic activity is crucial not only for entrainment of oscillatory activity across a neural population, but also for precise regulation of the timing of action potentials and the suppression of slow-timescale correlations. The diversity of inhibition provides the potential for flexible regulation of patterned activity, but also poses a challenge to identifying the elements of excitatory–inhibitory interactions underlying network engagement.</description>

	<description>Nervous systems control locomotion using rhythmically active networks that orchestrate motor neuron firing patterns. Whether animals use common or distinct genetic programs to encode motor rhythmicity remains unclear. Cross-species comparisons have revealed remarkably conserved neural patterning systems but have also unveiled divergent circuit architectures that can generate similar locomotor behaviors.</description>

	<description>The rotation of the Earth around its axis causes periodic exposure of half of its surface to sunlight. This daily recurring event has been internalized in most organisms in the form of cellular circadian clock mechanisms. These cellular clocks are synchronized with each other in various ways to establish circadian networks that build the circadian program in tissues and organs, coordinating physiology and behavior in the entire organism. In the mammalian brain, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) receives light information via the retina and synchronizes its own neuronal clocks to the light signal.</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A rotation-equivariant convolutional neural network model of primary visual cortex. (arXiv:1809.10504v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10504</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10504</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Classical models describe primary visual cortex (V1) as a filter bank of
orientation-selective linear-nonlinear (LN) or energy models, but these models
fail to predict neural responses to natural stimuli accurately. Recent work
shows that models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) lead to much
more accurate predictions, but it remains unclear which features are extracted
by V1 neurons beyond orientation selectivity and phase invariance. Here we work
towards systematically studying V1 computations by categorizing neurons into
groups that perform similar computations. We present a framework to identify
common features independent of individual neurons' orientation selectivity by
using a rotation-equivariant convolutional neural network, which automatically
extracts every feature at multiple different orientations. We fit this model to
responses of a population of 6000 neurons to natural images recorded in mouse
primary visual cortex using two-photon imaging. We show that our
rotation-equivariant network not only outperforms a regular CNN with the same
number of feature maps, but also reveals a number of common features shared by
many V1 neurons, which deviate from the typical textbook idea of V1 as a bank
of Gabor filters. Our findings are a first step towards a powerful new tool to
study the nonlinear computations in V1.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Characterizing complex networks using Entropy-degree diagrams: unveiling changes in functional brain connectivity induced by Ayahuasca. (arXiv:1809.10301v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10301</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10301</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Open problems abound in the theory of complex networks, which has found
successful application to diverse fields of science. With the aim of further
advancing the understanding of the brain's functional connectivity, we propose
to evaluate a network metric which we term the geodesic entropy. This entropy,
in a way that can be made precise, quantifies the Shannon entropy of the
distance distribution to a specific node from all other nodes. Measurements of
geodesic entropy allow for the characterization of the structural information
of a network that takes into account the distinct role of each node into the
network topology. The measurement and characterization of this structural
information has the potential to greatly improve our understanding of sustained
activity and other emergent behaviors in networks, such as self-organized
criticality sometimes seen in such contexts. We apply these concepts and
methods to study the effects of how the psychedelic Ayahuasca affects the
functional connectivity of the human brain. We show that the geodesic entropy
is able to differentiate the functional networks of the human brain in two
different states of consciousness in the resting state: (i) the ordinary waking
state and (ii) a state altered by ingestion of the Ayahuasca. The entropy of
the nodes of brain networks from subjects under the influence of Ayahuasca
diverge significantly from those of the ordinary waking state. The functional
brain networks from subjects in the altered state have, on average, a larger
geodesic entropy compared to the ordinary state. We conclude that geodesic
entropy is a useful tool for analyzing complex networks and discuss how and why
it may bring even further valuable insights into the study of the human brain
and other empirical networks.

Biological data sets are typically characterized by high dimensionality and low effect sizes. A powerful method for detecting systematic differences between experimental conditions in such multivariate data sets is multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), particularly pattern classification. However, in virtually all applications, data from the classes that correspond to the conditions of interest are not homogeneous but contain subclasses. Such subclasses can for example arise from individual subjects that contribute multiple data points, or from correlations of items within classes. We show here that in multivariate data that have subclasses nested within its class structure, these subclasses introduce systematic information that improves classifiability beyond what is expected by the size of the class difference. We analytically prove that this subclass bias systematically inflates correct classification rates (CCRs) of linear classifiers depending on the number of subclasses as well as on the portion of variance induced by the subclasses. In simulations, we demonstrate that subclass bias is highest when between-class effect size is low and subclass variance high. This bias can be reduced by increasing the total number of subclasses. However, we can account for the subclass bias by using permutation tests that explicitly consider the subclass structure of the data. We illustrate our result in several experiments that recorded human EEG activity, demonstrating that parametric statistical tests as well as typical trial-wise permutation fail to determine significance of classification outcomes correctly.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tMGb6u-BxMQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Interactions among microbial community members can lead to emergent properties, such as enhanced productivity, stability, and robustness. Iron-oxide mats in acidic (pH 2–4), high-temperature (&amp;gt; 65 °C) springs of Yellowstone National Park contain relatively simple microbial communities and are well-characterized geochemically. Consequently, these communities are excellent model systems for studying the metabolic activity of individual populations and key microbial interactions. The primary goals of the current study were to integrate data collected &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; with &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; calculations across process-scales encompassing enzymatic activity, cellular metabolism, community interactions, and ecosystem biogeochemistry, as well as to predict and quantify the functional limits of autotroph-heterotroph interactions. Metagenomic and transcriptomic data were used to reconstruct carbon and energy metabolisms of an important autotroph (&lt;i&gt;Metallosphaera yellowstonensis&lt;/i&gt;) and heterotroph (&lt;i&gt;Geoarchaeum&lt;/i&gt; sp. OSPB) from the studied Fe(III)-oxide mat communities. Standard and hybrid elementary flux mode and flux balance analyses of metabolic models predicted cellular- and community-level metabolic acclimations to simulated environmental stresses, respectively. &lt;i&gt;In situ&lt;/i&gt; geochemical analyses, including oxygen depth-profiles, Fe(III)-oxide deposition rates, stable carbon isotopes and mat biomass concentrations, were combined with cellular models to explore autotroph-heterotroph interactions important to community structure-function. Integration of metabolic modeling with &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; measurements, including the relative population abundance of autotrophs to heterotrophs, demonstrated that Fe(III)-oxide mat communities operate at their maximum total community growth rate (i.e. sum of autotroph and heterotroph growth rates), as opposed to net community growth rate (i.e. total community growth rate subtracting autotroph consumed by heterotroph), as predicted from the maximum power principle. Integration of multiscale data with ecological theory provides a basis for predicting autotroph-heterotroph interactions and community-level cellular organization.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9cziYmlDKfI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Distal dendritic enrichment of HCN1 channels in hippocampal CA1 is promoted by estrogen, but does not require Reelin</title>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;HCN1 compartmentalization in CA1 pyramidal cells, essential for hippocampal information processing, is believed to be controlled by the extracellular matrix protein Reelin (Kupferman et al., 2014). Expression of Reelin, in turn, is stimulated by 17β-estradiol (E2). In this study, we therefore tested whether E2 regulates the compartmentalization of HCN1 in CA1 via Reelin. In organotypic entorhino-hippocampal cultures, we found that E2 promotes the HCN1 distal dendritic enrichment via the G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor GPER1, but apparently independent of Reelin, because GST-RAP, known to reduce reelin signaling, did not prevent E2-induced HCN1 enrichment in distal CA1. We therefore re-examined the role of Reelin for the regulation of HCN1 compartmentalization and could not detect effects of reduced Reelin signaling on HCN1 distribution in CA1, neither in the (developmental) slice culture model, nor in tamoxifen-inducible conditional &lt;i&gt;reelin&lt;/i&gt; knockout mice during adulthood. We conclude that for HCN1 channel compartmentalization in CA1 pyramidal cells, Reelin is not as essential as previously proposed and E2-effects on HCN1 distribution in CA1 are mediated by mechanisms that do not involve Reelin. Because HCN1 localization was not altered at different phases of the estrous cycle, gonadally-derived estradiol is unlikely to regulate HCN1 channel compartmentalization, while the pattern of immunoreactivity of aromatase, the final enzyme of estradiol synthesis, argues for a role of local hippocampal E2 synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Mechanisms of learning and memory require a fine-tuned interplay between ion channels on hippocampal neurons. Among these, CA1 pyramidal cells have a crucial position, as they integrate information from various hippocampal and extra-hippocampal sources. Identifying factors that influence the function of ion channels, such as the HCN1 channels, which filter entorhinal synaptic input, may therefore help to better understand processes that underlie learning and memory. Here we show that the dendritic localization of HCN1 channels, a critical determinant of their function, is influenced by estrogen (E2), thus bringing attention to the modulatory roles of sex hormones on hippocampal information processing, which are yet poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: The role of interleukin-10 in mediating the effect of immune challenge on mouse gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons in vivo</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Immune challenge alters neural functioning via cytokine production. Inflammation has profound impact on the central regulation of fertility, but the mechanisms involved are not clearly defined. The anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 is responsible for balancing the immune response in the brain. To examine whether IL-10 has an effect on the function of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, we first examined the effect of immune responses with distinct cytokine profiles, such as the T-cell-dependent (TD) and T-cell-independent (TI) B-cell response. We investigated the effect of the TD and TI immune responses on ERK1/2 phosphorylation in GnRH neurons by administering fluorescein-isothiocyanate/keyhole-limpet-hemocyanin (KLH-FITC) or dextran-FITC to female mice. Although dextran-FITC had no effect, KLH-FITC induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in GnRH neurons after 6 days. KLH-FITC treatment increased the levels of IL-10 in the hypothalamus, but this treatment did not cause lymphocyte infiltration or an increase in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In IL-10 KO mice, KLH-FITC-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the GnRH neurons was absent. We also showed that in IL-10 KO mice, the estrous cycle was disrupted. Perforated patch-clamp recordings from GnRH-GFP neurons, IL-10 immunohistochemistry and in vitro experiments on acute brain slices revealed that IL-10 can directly alter GnRH neuron firing and induce ERK1/2 phosphorylation. These observations demonstrate that IL-10 plays a role in influencing signaling of GnRH neurons in the TD immune response. These results also provide the first evidence that IL-10 can directly alter the function of GnRH neurons and may help the maintenance of the integrity of the estrous cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; The anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 plays a role in maintaining a balanced immune response in the brain. Although clinical studies have demonstrated that IL-10 influences fertility, the impact of IL-10 on gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons is unknown. Our results demonstrate that T cell-dependent (TD) immune challenge induces ERK1/2 phosphorylation in GnRH neurons via IL-10. We provide the first evidence that IL-10 directly regulates the firing and signaling of GnRH neurons. Our results indicate that IL-10-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in GnRH neurons might be associated with the maintenance of the estrous cycle in bacterial/viral infection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The reproducibility of scientific research has become a point of critical
concern. We argue that openness and transparency are critical for
reproducibility, and we outline an ecosystem for open and transparent science
that has emerged within the human neuroimaging community. We discuss the range
of open data sharing resources that have been developed for neuroimaging data,
and the role of data standards (particularly the Brain Imaging Data Structure)
in enabling the automated sharing, processing, and reuse of large neuroimaging
datasets. We outline how the open-source Python language has provided the basis
for a data science platform that enables reproducible data analysis and
visualization. We also discuss how new advances in software engineering, such
as containerization, provide the basis for greater reproducibility in data
analysis. The emergence of this new ecosystem provides an example for many
areas of science that are currently struggling with reproducibility.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding neuronal communication is fundamental in neuroscience but there
are few methodologies offering detailed analysis for well-controlled
conditions. By interfacing microElectrode arrays with microFluidics ({\mu}EF
devices), it is possible to compartmentalize neuronal cultures with a specified
alignment of axons and microelectrodes. This setup allows extracellular
recordings of spike propagation with high signal-to-noise ratio over the course
of several weeks. Addressing these {\mu}EF systems we developed an advanced,
yet easy-to-use, open-source computational tool, {\mu}SpikeHunter, which
provides detailed quantification of several communication-related properties
such as propagation velocity, conduction failure, spike timings, and coding
mechanisms. The combination of {\mu}EF devices and {\mu}SpikeHunter can be used
in the context of standard neuronal cultures or with co-culture configurations
where, for example, communication between sensory neurons and other cell types
is monitored and assessed. The ability to analyze axonal signals (in a
user-friendly, time-efficient, high-throughput manner) opens doors to new
approaches to studies of peripheral innervation, neural coding, and
neuroregeneration approaches, among many others. We demonstrate the use of
{\mu}SpikeHunter in dorsal root ganglion neurons where we analyze the presence
of anterograde signals in {\mu}EF devices.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the only major cause of mortality in the world
without an effective disease modifying treatment. Evidence supporting the so
called disconnection hypothesis suggests that functional connectivity
biomarkers may have clinical potential for early detection of AD. However,
known issues with low test-retest reliability and signal to noise in functional
connectivity may prevent accuracy and subsequent predictive capacity. We
validate the utility of a novel principal component based diagnostic
identifiability framework to increase separation in functional connectivity
across the Alzheimer's spectrum by identifying and reconstructing FC using only
AD sensitive components or connectivity modes. We show that this framework (1)
increases test-retest correspondence and (2) allows for better separation, in
functional connectivity, of diagnostic groups both at the whole brain and
individual resting state network level. Finally, we evaluate a posteriori the
association between connectivity mode weights with longitudinal neurocognitive
outcomes.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spiking neural networks (SNN) as time-dependent hypotheses consisting of
spiking nodes (neurons) and directed edges (synapses) are believed to offer
unique solutions to reward prediction tasks and the related feedback that are
classified as reinforcement learning. Generally, temporal difference (TD)
learning renders it possible to optimize a model network to predict the delayed
reward in an ad hoc manner. Neuromorphic SNNs--networks built using dedicated
hardware--particularly leverage such TD learning for not only reward prediction
but also temporal sequence prediction in a physical time domain. In this
tutorial, such learning in a physical time domain is referred to as temporal
learning to distinguish it from conventional TD learning-based methods that
generally involve algorithmic (rather than physical) time. This tutorial
addresses neuromorphic SNNs for temporal learning from the scratch. It first
concerns general characteristics of SNNs including spiking neurons and
information coding schemes and then moves on to temporal learning including its
general concept, feasible algorithms, and their association with
neurophysiological learning rules that have intensively been enriched for the
last few decades.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Development of spatial suppression surrounding the focus of visual attention. (arXiv:1809.09700v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09700</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The capacity to filter out irrelevant information from our environment is
critical to efficient processing. Yet, during development, when building a
knowledge base of the world is occurring, the ability to selectively allocate
attentional resources is limited (e.g., Amso &amp;amp; Scerif, 2015). In adulthood,
research has demonstrated that surrounding the spatial location of attentional
focus is a suppressive field, resulting from top-down attention promoting the
processing of relevant stimuli and inhibiting surrounding distractors (e.g.,
Hopf et al., 2006). It is not fully known, however, whether this phenomenon
manifests in development. In the current study, we examined whether spatial
suppression surrounding the focus of visual attention is exhibited in
developmental age groups. Participants between 12 and 27 years of age exhibited
spatial suppression surrounding their focus of visual attention. Their accuracy
increased as a function of the separation distance between a spatially cued
(and attended) target and a second target, suggesting that a ring of
suppression surrounded the attended target. When a central cue was instead
presented and therefore attention was no longer spatially cued, surround
suppression was not observed, indicating that our initial findings of
suppression were indeed related to the focus of attention. Attentional surround
suppression was not observed in 8- to 11-years-olds, even with a longer spatial
cue presentation time, demonstrating that the lack of the effect at these ages
is not due to slowed attentional feedback processes. Our findings demonstrate
that top-down attentional processes are still immature until approximately 12
years of age, and that they continue to be refined throughout adolescence,

	<description>Propagation of non-linear waves is key to the functioning of diverse biological systems. Such waves can organize into spirals, rotating around a core, whose properties determine the overall wave dynamics. Theoretically, manipulation of a spiral wave core should lead to full spatiotemporal control over its dynamics. However, this theory lacks supportive evidence (even at a conceptual level), making it thus a long-standing hypothesis. Here, we propose a new phenomenological concept that involves artificially dragging spiral waves by their cores, to prove the afore-mentioned hypothesis &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt;, with subsequent &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; validation in optogenetically-modified monolayers of rat atrial cardiomyocytes. We thereby connect previously established, but unrelated concepts of spiral wave attraction, anchoring and unpinning to demonstrate that core manipulation, through controlled displacement of heterogeneities in excitable media, allows forced movement of spiral waves along pre-defined trajectories. Consequently, we impose real-time spatiotemporal control over spiral wave dynamics in a biological system.</description>

	<description>Fast synaptic inhibition in the nervous system depends on the transmembrane flux of Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ions based on the neuronal Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; driving force. Established theories regarding the determinants of Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; driving force have recently been questioned. Here we present biophysical models of Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis using the pump-leak model. Using numerical and novel analytic solutions, we demonstrate that the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase, ion conductances, impermeant anions, electrodiffusion, water fluxes and cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs) play roles in setting the Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; driving force. Our models, together with experimental validation, show that while impermeant anions can contribute to setting [Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; in neurons, they have a negligible effect on the driving force for Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; locally and cell-wide. In contrast, we demonstrate that CCCs are well-suited for modulating Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; driving force and hence inhibitory signalling in neurons. Our findings reconcile recent experimental findings and provide a framework for understanding the interplay of different chloride regulatory processes in neurons.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: α-actinin accounts for the bioactivity of actin preparations in inducing STAT target genes in Drosophila melanogaster</title>

	<description>Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are molecules exposed or released by dead cells that trigger or modulate immunity and tissue repair. In vertebrates, the cytoskeletal component F-actin is a DAMP specifically recognised by DNGR-1, an innate immune receptor. Previously we suggested that actin is also a DAMP in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; by inducing STAT-dependent (Srinivasan et al., 2016). Here, we revise that conclusion and report that α-actinin is far more potent than actin at inducing the same STAT response and can be found in trace amounts in actin preparations. Recombinant expression of actin or α-actinin in bacteria demonstrated that only α-actinin could drive the expression of STAT target genes in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. The response to injected α-actinin required the same signalling cascade that we had identified in our previous work using actin preparations. Taken together, these data indicate that α-actinin rather than actin drives STAT activation when injected into &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

	<description>Germ granules are non-membranous ribonucleoprotein granules deemed the hubs for post-transcriptional gene regulation and functionally linked to germ cell fate across species. Little is known about the physical properties of germ granules and how these relate to germ cell function. Here we study two types of germ granules in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; embryo: cytoplasmic germ granules that instruct primordial germ cells (PGCs) formation and nuclear germ granules within early PGCs with unknown function. We show that cytoplasmic and nuclear germ granules are phase transitioned condensates nucleated by Oskar protein that display liquid as well as hydrogel-like properties. Focusing on nuclear granules, we find that Oskar drives their formation in heterologous cell systems. Multiple, independent Oskar protein domains synergize to promote granule phase separation. Deletion of Oskar's nuclear localization sequence specifically ablates nuclear granules in cell systems. In the embryo, nuclear germ granules promote germ cell divisions thereby increasing PGC number for the next generation.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Resting-state gamma-band power alterations in schizophrenia reveal E/I-balance abnormalities across illness-stages</title>

	<description>We examined alterations in E/I-balance in schizophrenia (ScZ) through measurements of resting-state gamma-band activity in participants meeting clinical high-risk (CHR) criteria (n = 88), 21 first episode (FEP) patients and 34 chronic ScZ-patients. Furthermore, MRS-data were obtained in CHR-participants and matched controls. Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) resting-state activity was examined at source level and MEG-data were correlated with neuropsychological scores and clinical symptoms. CHR-participants were characterized by increased 64–90 Hz power. In contrast, FEP- and ScZ-patients showed aberrant spectral power at both low- and high gamma-band frequencies. MRS-data showed a shift in E/I-balance toward increased excitation in CHR-participants, which correlated with increased occipital gamma-band power. Finally, neuropsychological deficits and clinical symptoms in FEP and ScZ-patients were correlated with reduced gamma band-activity, while elevated psychotic symptoms in the CHR group showed the opposite relationship. The current study suggests that resting-state gamma-band power and altered Glx/GABA ratio indicate changes in E/I-balance parameters across illness stages in ScZ.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Heterogeneity of Astrocytic and Neuronal GLT-1 at Cortical Excitatory Synapses, as Revealed by its Colocalization With Na+/K+-ATPase α Isoforms</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy203</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;GLT-1, the major glutamate transporter, is expressed at perisynaptic astrocytic processes (PAP) and axon terminals (AxT). GLT-1 is coupled to Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase (NKA) α1–3 isoforms, whose subcellular distribution and spatial organization in relationship to GLT-1 are largely unknown. Using several microscopy techniques, we showed that at excitatory synapses α1 and α3 are exclusively neuronal (mainly in dendrites and in some AxT), while α2 is predominantly astrocytic. GLT-1 displayed a differential colocalization with α1–3. GLT-1/α2 and GLT-1/α3 colocalization was higher in GLT-1 positive puncta partially (for GLT-1/α2) or almost totally (for GLT-1/α3) overlapping with VGLUT1 positive terminals than in nonoverlapping ones. GLT-1 colocalized with α2 at PAP, and with α1 and α3 at AxT. GLT-1 and α2 gold particles were ∼1.5–2 times closer than GLT-1/α1 and GLT-1/α3 particles. GLT-1/α2 complexes (edge to edge interdistance of gold particles ≤50 nm) concentrated at the perisynaptic region of PAP membranes, whereas neuronal GLT-1/α1 and GLT-1/α3 complexes were fewer and more uniformly distributed in AxT. These data unveil different composition of GLT-1 and α subunits complexes in the glial and neuronal domains of excitatory synapses. The spatial organization of GLT-1/α1–3 complexes suggests that GLT-1/NKA interaction is more efficient in astrocytes than in neurons, further supporting the dominant role of astrocytic GLT-1 in glutamate homeostasis.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>The subventricular zone (SVZ) is one of the primary sources for rodent neural progenitor cells (NPC), however, aging greatly impacts the substructure of the region and rate of new cell birth. To determine if age impacts the rate of in vivo migration within animals, we examined the rostral migratory stream (RMS) of animals across 12 days using an established MRI technique. To visualize NPCs, we injected micron sized particles of iron oxide (MPIO) into the lateral ventricle to endogenously label cells within the SVZ, which then appeared as hypo-intensive spots within MR images. Our in vivo MRI data showed that the rate of migration was significantly different between all ages examined, with decreases in the distance traveled as age progressed. The total number of iron oxide labeled cells within the olfactory bulb on day 12, decrease significantly when compared across ages in ex vivo high-resolution scans. We also, for the first time, demonstrated the endogenous labeling of cells within the dentate gyrus (DG) of hippocampus. Here too, there was a significant decrease in the number of labeled cells within the structure across age. Histology of the NPCs verified the decrease in labeling of cells with doublecortin (DCX) as age progressed for both regions. The dramatic reduction of labeling within the SVZ and DG observed with MRI, demonstrates the importance of understanding the impact of age on the relationship of NPC and disease.</description>

	<description>Memory retrieval is characterised by synchronised neural activity between hippocampus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), with additional evidence that vmPFC activity leads that of the hippocampus. It has been proposed that the mental generation of scene imagery is a crucial component of memory processing. If this is the case, then a comparable interaction between the two brain regions should exist during the construction of novel scene imagery. To address this question, we leveraged the high temporal resolution of magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate the construction of novel mental imagery. We tasked male and female humans with imagining scenes and single isolated objects in response to one-word cues. We performed source level power, coherence and causality analyses to characterise the underlying inter-regional interactions. Both scene and object imagination resulted in similar theta power changes in the anterior hippocampus. However, higher theta coherence was observed between the hippocampus and vmPFC in the scene compared to the object condition. Dynamic causal modelling of this interaction revealed that vmPFC drove activity in hippocampus during novel scene construction. These results constitute the first evidence in humans that memory retrieval and scene imagination rely on similar vmPFC-hippocampus neural dynamics. Furthermore, they provide support for theories emphasising similarities between both cognitive processes, and perspectives that propose that the vmPFC guides the construction of context-relevant representations in the hippocampus.</description>

	<description>Age-related alterations in serotonin (5-HT) function have been hypothesized to underlie a range of physiological, emotional, and cognitive changes in older age. Here, we conducted a quantitative synthesis and comparison of the effects of age on 5-HT receptors and transporters from cross-sectional PET and SPECT imaging studies. Random-effects meta- analyses of 31 studies including 1087 healthy adults yielded large negative age effects in 5- HT-2A receptors, moderate negative age effects in 5-HT transporters, and small negative age effects in 5-HT-1A receptors. Age differences were significantly larger in 5-HT-2A receptors compared to 5-HT-1A receptors. A meta-regression showed that 5-HT target, brain region, tracer kinetic measure, radionuclide, and publication year significantly moderated the age effect. The findings overall identify reduced serotonergic signal transmission in age. The evidence for a relative preservation of 5-HT-1A compared to 5-HT-2A receptors may partially explain differential psychological changes with age, such as why older people use more emotion-focused rather than problem-focused coping strategies.</description>

	<description>Spatio-temporal sequences of neuronal activity are observed in many brain regions in a variety of tasks and are thought to form the basis of any meaningful behavior. Mechanisms by which a neuronal network can generate spatio-temporal activity sequences have remained obscure. Existing models are biologically untenable because they require manual embedding of a feedforward network within a random network or supervised learning to train the connectivity of a network to generate sequences. Here, we propose a biologically plausible, generative rule to create spatio-temporal activity sequences in a network model of spiking neurons with distance dependent connectivity. We show that the emergence of spatio-temporal activity sequences requires: (1) individual neurons preferentially project a small fraction of their axons in a specific direction, and (2) the preferential projection direction of neighboring neurons is similar. Thus, an anisotropic but correlated connectivity of neuron groups suffices to generate spatio-temporal activity sequences in an otherwise random neuronal network model.</description>

	<description>Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) form the connection between the eye and the brain, with this connectivity disrupted in numerous blinding disorders. Previous studies have demonstrated the ability to derive RGCs from hPSCs; however these cells exhibited some characteristics that indicated a limited state of maturation. Among the many factors known to influence RGC development in the retina, astrocytes are known to play a significant role in their functional maturation. Thus, efforts of the current study examined the functional maturation of hPSC-derived RGCs, including the ability of astrocytes to modulate this developmental timeline. Morphological and functional properties of RGCs were found to increase over time, with astrocytes significantly accelerating the functional maturation of hPSC-derived RGCs. The results of this study are the first of its kind to extensively study the functional and morphological maturation of RGCs in vitro, including the effects of astrocytes upon the maturation of hPSC-derived RGCs.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Lack of correlation between number of neurons and behavioral performance in Swiss mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/428607v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Neuronal number varies by several orders of magnitude across species, and has been proposed to predict cognitive capability across species. Remarkably, numbers of neurons vary across individual mice by a factor of 2 or more. We directly addressed the question of whether there is a relationship between performance in behavioral tests and the number of neurons in functionally relevant structures in the mouse brain. Naive Swiss mice went through a battery of behavioral tasks designed to measure cognitive, motor and olfactory skills. We estimated the number of neurons in different brain regions (cerebral cortex, hippocampus, olfactory bulb, cerebellum and remaining areas) and crossed the two datasets to test the a priori hypothesis of correlation between cognitive abilities and numbers of neurons. As previous evidence indicates that environmental enrichment may increase neurogenesis and improve neuronal survival, we added a control group that did not undergo cognitive testing to rule out the possibility that our test battery could alter the neuronal number. We found that behavioral testing did not change numbers of neurons in the cerebral cortex and in the hippocampus. Surprisingly, performance in the behavioral tasks did not correlate strongly with number of neurons in any of the brain regions studied. Our results show that whereas neuronal number is a good predictor of cognitive skills across species, it is not a predictor of cognitive, sensory or motor ability across individuals within a species, which suggests that other factors are more relevant for explaining cognitive differences between individuals of the same species.</description>

	<description>Men and women may use alcohol to regulate their emotions differently, with corresponding differences in neural responses. We examined how photographs of emotional stimuli impacted brain activity obtained through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) from 42 alcoholic (25 women) and 46 nonalcoholic (24 women) participants. Brain responsivity was blunted in alcoholic compared to nonalcoholic groups. Further analyses indicated significant gender differences in the impact of alcoholism. Brain activation of the alcoholic men (ALCM) was significantly lower than that of the alcoholic women (ALCW) and nonalcoholic men (NCM) in regions including the inferior parietal gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, and postcentral gyrus, whereas activation was higher in the ALCW than in the nonalcoholic women (NCW) in superior frontal and supramarginal cortical regions. The reduced brain reactivity of ALCM and increases for ALCW highlighted divergent brain regions and gender effects, suggesting possible differences in the underlying basis for development of alcohol use disorders.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Elimination of peripheral auditory pathway activation does not affect motor responses from ultrasound neuromodulation</title>

	<description>Recent studies in a variety of animal models including rodents, monkeys, and humans suggest that transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) has considerable promise for non-invasively modulating neural activity with the ability to target deep brain structures. However, concerns have been raised that motor responses evoked by tFUS may be due to indirect activation of the auditory pathway rather than direct activation of motor circuits. In this study, tFUS-induced electromyography (EMG) signals were recorded and analyzed in wild-type (WT) normal hearing mice and two strains of genetically deaf mice to examine the involvement of the peripheral auditory system in tFUS-stimulated motor responses. In addition, auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were measured to elucidate the effect of the tFUS stimulus envelope on auditory and motor responses. We also varied the tFUS stimulation duration to measure its effect on motor response duration. We show, first, that the sharp edges in a tFUS rectangular envelope stimulus activate the peripheral afferent auditory pathway and, second, that smoothing these edges eliminates the auditory responses without affecting the motor responses in normal hearing WT mice. We further show that by eliminating peripheral auditory activity using two different strains of deaf knockout mice, motor responses are the same as in normal hearing WT mice. Finally, we demonstrate a high correlation between tFUS pulse duration and EMG response duration. These results support the concept that tFUS-evoked motor responses are not a result of stimulation of the peripheral auditory system.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The functional organisation of the hippocampus along its long axis is gradual and predicts recollection</title>

	<description>Understanding the functional organisation of the hippocampus is crucial for understanding its role in cognition and disorders in which it is implicated. Different views have been proposed of how function is distributed along its long axis: one view suggests segregation, whereas the alternative view postulates a more gradual organisation. Here, we applied a novel connectopic mapping data-analysis approach to the resting-state fMRI data of participants of the Human Connectome Project, and demonstrate that the functional organisation of the hippocampal longitudinal axis is gradual rather than segregated into parcels. In addition, we show that inter-individual variations in this gradual organisation predicts variations in recollection memory better than a characterisation based on parcellation. These results present an important step forward in understanding the functional organisation of the human hippocampus and have important implications for translating between rodent and human research.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Comparative efficacy and acceptability of non-surgical brain stimulation for the acute treatment of adult major depressive episodes: A systematic review and network meta-analysis of 113 randomised clinical trials</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/426866v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Background: Non-surgical brain stimulation techniques have been applied as tertiary treatments in major depression. However, the relative efficacy and acceptability of individual protocols is uncertain. Our aim was to estimate the comparative clinical efficacy and acceptability of non-surgical brain stimulation for the acute treatment of major depressive episodes in adults. Methods: Embase, PubMed/MEDLINE and PsycINFO were searched up until May 8, 2018, supplemented by manual searches of bibliographies of recent reviews and included trials. We included clinical trials with random allocation to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), accelerated TMS (aTMS), priming TMS (pTMS), deep TMS (dTMS), theta burst stimulation (TBS), synchronised TMS (sTMS), magnetic seizure therapy (MST) or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) protocols or sham. Data were extracted from published reports and outcomes were synthesised using pairwise and network random-effects meta-analysis. Primary outcomes were response (efficacy) and all-cause discontinuation (acceptability). We computed odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Remission and continuous post-treatment depression severity scores were also examined. Results: 113 trials (262 treatment arms) randomising 6,750 patients (mean age = 47.9 years; 59% female) with major depressive disorder or bipolar depression met our inclusion criteria. In terms of efficacy, 10 out of 18 treatment protocols were associated with higher response relative to sham in network meta-analysis: bitemporal ECT (OR=8.91, 95%CI 2.57-30.91), high-dose right-unilateral ECT (OR=7.27, 1.90-27.78), pTMS (OR=6.02, 2.21-16.38), MST (OR=5.55, 1.06-28.99), bilateral rTMS (OR=4.92, 2.93-8.25), bilateral TBS (OR=4.44, 1.47-13.41), low-frequency right rTMS (OR=3.65, 2.13-6.24), intermittent TBS (OR=3.20, 1.45-7.08), high-frequency left rTMS (OR=3.17, 2.29-4.37) and tDCS (OR=2.65, 1.55-4.55). Comparing active treatments, bitemporal ECT and high-dose right-unilateral ECT were associated with increased response. All treatment protocols were at least as acceptable as sham treatment. Conclusion: We found that non-surgical brain stimulation techniques constitute viable alternative or add-on treatments for adult patients with major depressive episodes. Our findings also highlight the need to consider other patient and treatment-related factors in addition to antidepressant efficacy and acceptability when making clinical decisions; and emphasize important research priorities in the field of brain stimulation.</description>

	<description>Closed-loop technologies provide novel ways of online observation, control and bidirectional interaction with the nervous system, which help to study complex non-linear and partially observable neural dynamics. These protocols are often difficult to implement due to the temporal precision required when interacting with biological components, which in many cases can only be achieved using real-time technology. In this paper we introduce RTHybrid (www.github.com/GNB-UAM/RTHybrid), a free and open-source software that includes a neuron and synapse model library to build hybrid circuits with living neurons in a wide variety of experimental contexts. In an effort to encourage the standardization of real-time software technology in neuroscience research, we compared different open-source real-time operating system patches, RTAI, Xenomai 3 and Preempt-RT, according to their performance and usability. RTHybrid has been developed to run over Linux operating systems supporting both Xenomai 3 and Preempt-RT real-time patches, and thus allowing an easy implementation in any laboratory. We report a set of validation tests and latency benchmarks for the construction of hybrid circuits using this library. With this work we want to promote the dissemination of standardized, user-friendly and open-source software tools developed for open- and closed-loop experimental neuroscience.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Multiple statistical signatures of human confidence</title>

	<description>The so called standard model of confidence predicts a specific statistical signature of confidence that has been widely used to objectively identify neural, behavioural, and physiological correlates of confidence. That signature states that confidence is medium when the stimulation is absent, increases with stimulus strength in correct trials, and decreases with stimulus strength in incorrect trials. Here, we show that the standard model is a special case in which evidence about stimulus strength is omitted in the objective calculation of confidence. In the general case, objective confidence follows a different statistical signature: for both correct and incorrect choices, confidence increases with stimulus strength. Recent experiments provided evidence for both types of patterns, implying that both the special and the general case occur in experiments. Thus, relying exclusively on one type of signature of confidence is problematic.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Farzaneh Khajouei, Saurabh Sinha&lt;/p&gt;

Studying a gene’s regulatory mechanisms is a tedious process that involves identification of candidate regulators by transcription factor (TF) knockout or over-expression experiments, delineation of enhancers by reporter assays, and demonstration of direct TF influence by site mutagenesis, among other approaches. Such experiments are often chosen based on the biologist’s intuition, from several testable hypotheses. We pursue the goal of making this process systematic by using ideas from information theory to reason about experiments in gene regulation, in the hope of ultimately enabling rigorous experiment design strategies. For this, we make use of a state-of-the-art mathematical model of gene expression, which provides a way to formalize our current knowledge of cis- as well as trans- regulatory mechanisms of a gene. Ambiguities in such knowledge can be expressed as uncertainties in the model, which we capture formally by building an ensemble of plausible models that fit the existing data and defining a probability distribution over the ensemble. We then characterize the impact of a new experiment on our understanding of the gene’s regulation based on how the ensemble of plausible models and its probability distribution changes when challenged with results from that experiment. This allows us to assess the ‘value’ of the experiment retroactively as the reduction in entropy of the distribution (information gain) resulting from the experiment’s results. We fully formalize this novel approach to reasoning about gene regulation experiments and use it to evaluate a variety of perturbation experiments on two developmental genes of &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;. We also provide objective and ‘biologist-friendly’ descriptions of the information gained from each such experiment. The rigorously defined information theoretic approaches presented here can be used in the future to formulate systematic strategies for experiment design pertaining to studies of gene regulatory mechanisms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/z4Q0168x58A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Quantitative single cell analysis uncovers the life/death decision in CD95 network</title>

CD95/Fas/APO-1 is a member of the death receptor family that triggers apoptotic and anti-apoptotic responses in particular, NF-κB. These responses are characterized by a strong heterogeneity within a population of cells. To determine how the cell decides between life and death we developed a computational model supported by imaging flow cytometry analysis of CD95 signaling. Here we show that CD95 stimulation leads to the induction of caspase and NF-kB pathways simultaneously in one cell. The related life/death decision strictly depends on cell-to-cell variability in the formation of the death-inducing complex (DISC) on one side (extrinsic noise) &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. stochastic gene expression of the NF-kB pathway on the other side (intrinsic noise). Moreover, our analysis has uncovered that the stochasticity in apoptosis and NF-kB pathways leads not only to survival or death of a cell, but also causes a third type of response to CD95 stimulation that we termed ambivalent response. Cells in the ambivalent state can undergo cell death or survive which was subsequently validated by experiments. Taken together, we have uncovered how these two competing pathways control the fate of a cell, which in turn plays an important role for development of anti-cancer therapies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fCqyOiqzsjo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Maternal Immune Activation Alters Adult Behavior, Gut Microbiome and Juvenile Brain Oscillations in Ferrets</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Maternal immune activation (MIA) has been identified as a causal factor in psychiatric disorders by epidemiological studies in humans and mechanistic studies in rodent models. Addressing this gap in species between mice and human will accelerate the understanding of the role of MIA in the etiology of psychiatric disorders. Here we provide the first study of MIA in the ferret (&lt;i&gt;Mustela putorius furo&lt;/i&gt;), an animal model with a rich history of developmental investigations due to the similarities in developmental programs and cortical organization with primates. We found that after MIA by injection of PolyIC in the pregnant mother animal, the adult offspring exhibited reduced social behavior, less eye-contact with humans, decreased recognition memory, a sex-specific increase in amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion, and altered gut microbiome. We also studied the neurophysiological properties of the MIA ferrets in development by &lt;i&gt;in-vivo&lt;/i&gt; recordings of the local field potential (LFP) from visual cortex in 5-6 weeks old animals, and found that the spontaneous and sensory-evoked LFP had decreased power, especially in the gamma frequency band. Overall, our results provide the first evidence for the detrimental effect of MIA in ferrets support the use of the ferret as an intermediate model species for the study of disorders with neurodevelopmental origin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Maternal immune activation (MIA) has been adopted in the rodent model to study neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia. Yet, neurodevelopmental programs differ quite substantially between mice and humans. The ferret has a rich history for the study of neurodevelopment due to its unique advantages that combine short gestation time with the emergence of sophisticated cortical organization during development. The present study found that MIA leads to a range of behavioral abnormalities as well as altered gut microbiome in adult ferrets. Notably, we observed impaired brain oscillations in these animals in early development. Our results lay the foundation for the translational study of neurodevelopmental disorders in ferrets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Increased Synthesis of Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycan Promotes Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis in Response to Enriched Environment</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) is a candidate regulator of embryonic neurogenesis. The aim of this study was to specify the functional significance of CSPG in adult hippocampal neurogenesis using male mice. Here, we showed that neural stem cells and neuronal progenitors in the dentate gyrus were covered in part by CSPG. Pharmacological depletion of CSPG in the dentate gyrus reduced the densities of neuronal progenitors and newborn granule cells. 3D reconstruction of newborn granule cells showed that their maturation was inhibited by CSPG digestion. The novel object recognition test revealed that CSPG digestion caused cognitive memory impairment. Western blot analysis showed that expression of β-catenin in the dentate gyrus was decreased by CSPG digestion. The amount of CSPG in the dentate gyrus was increased by enriched environment (EE) and was decreased by forced swim stress. In addition, EE accelerated the recovery of CSPG expression in the dentate gyrus from the pharmacological depletion and promoted the restoration of granule cell production. Conversely, the densities of newborn granule cells were also decreased in mice that lacked chondroitin sulfate &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1 (CSGalNAcT1), a key enzyme for CSPG synthesis (T1KO mice). The capacity of EE to promote granule cell production and improve cognitive memory was impaired in T1KO mice. These findings indicate that CSPG is involved in the regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis and suggest that increased synthesis of CSPG by CSGalNacT1 may mediate promotion of granule cell production and improvement of cognitive memory in response to EE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) is a candidate regulator of embryonic neurogenesis. Here, we specified the role of CSPG in adult neurogenesis in the mouse hippocampus. Digestion of CSPG in the dentate gyrus impaired granule cell production and cognitive memory. Enriched environment (EE) promoted the recovery of CSPG expression and granule cell production from the CSPG digestion. Additionally, adult neurogenesis was impaired in mice that lacked a key enzyme for CSPG synthesis (T1KO mice). The capacity of EE to promote granule cell production and cognitive memory was impaired in T1KO mice. Altogether, these findings indicate that CSPG underlies adult hippocampal neurogenesis and suggest that increased synthesis of CSPG may mediate promotion of granule cell production in response to EE.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: TRPM2 Exacerbates Central Nervous System Inflammation in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis by Increasing Production of CXCL2 Chemokines</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the CNS characterized by demyelination and axonal injury. Current therapies that mainly target lymphocytes do not fully meet clinical need due to the risk of severe side effects and lack of efficacy against progressive MS. Evidence suggests that MS is associated with CNS inflammation, although the underlying molecular mechanism is poorly understood. Transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2), a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-permeable nonselective cation channel, is expressed at high levels in the brain and by immune cells, including monocyte lineage cells. Here, we show that TRPM2 plays a pathological role in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. Knockout (KO) or pharmacological inhibition of TRPM2 inhibited progression of EAE and TRPM2-KO mice showed lower activation of Iba1-immunopositive monocyte lineage cells and neutrophil infiltration of the CNS than WT mice. Moreover, CXCL2 production in TRPM2-KO mice was significantly reduced at day 14, although the severity of EAE was the same as that in WT mice at that time point. In addition, we used BM chimeric mice to show that TRPM2 expressed by CNS-infiltrating macrophages contributes to progression of EAE. Because CXCL2 induces migration of neutrophils, these results indicate that reduced expression of CXCL2 in the CNS suppresses neutrophil infiltration and slows progression of EAE in TRPM2-KO mice. Together, the results suggest that TRPM2 plays an important role in progression of EAE pathology and shed light on its putative role as a therapeutic target for MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Current therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS), which mainly target lymphocytes, carry the risk of severe side effects and lack efficacy against the progressive form of the disease. Here, we found that the transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) channel, which is abundantly expressed in CNS-infiltrating macrophages, plays a crucial role in development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. EAE progression was suppressed by Knockout (KO) or pharmacological inhibition of TRPM2; this was attributed to a reduction in CXCL2 chemokine production by CNS-infiltrating macrophages in TRPM2-KO mice, resulting in suppression of neutrophil infiltration into the CNS. These results reveal an important role of TRPM2 in the pathogenesis of EAE and shed light on its potential as a therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Brain-Heart Biomarker for Epileptogenesis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/39/8473?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Postinjury epilepsy is an potentially preventable sequela in as many as 20% of patients with brain insults. For these cases biomarkers of epileptogenesis are critical to facilitate identification of patients at high-risk of developing epilepsy and to introduce effective anti-epileptogenic interventions. Here, we demonstrate that delayed brain–heart coincidences serve as a reliable biomarker. In a murine model of post-infection acquired epilepsy, we used long-term simultaneous measurements of the brain activity via electroencephalography and autonomic cardiac activity via electrocardiography, in male mice, to quantitatively track brain–heart interactions during epileptogenesis. We find that abnormal cortical discharges precede abnormal fluctuations in the cardiac rhythm at the resolution of single beat-to-beat intervals. The delayed brain–heart coincidence is detectable as early as the onset of chronic measurements, 2–14 weeks before the first seizure, only in animals that become epileptic, and increases during epileptogenesis. Therefore, delayed brain–heart coincidence serves as a biomarker of epileptogenesis and could be used for phenotyping, diagnostic, and therapeutic purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; No biomarker that readily predicts and tracks epileptogenesis currently exists for the wide range of human acquired epilepsies. Here, we used long-term measurements of brain and heart activity in a mouse model of post-infection acquired epilepsy to investigate the potential of brain–heart interaction as a biomarker of epileptogenesis. We found that delayed coincidences from brain to heart can clearly separate the mice that became epileptic from those that did not weeks before development of epilepsy. Our findings allow for phenotyping and tracking of epileptogenesis in this and likely other models of acquired epilepsy. Such capability is critical for efficient adjunctive treatment development and for tracking the efficacy of such treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In substance use disorders, negative affect associated with drug withdrawal can elicit strong drug craving and promote relapse. One brain region implicated in those processes is the rostral agranular insular cortex (RAIC), although precisely how this region encodes negative affect associated with drug seeking is unknown. Here, a preclinical model was used where RAIC activity was examined in male Sprague Dawley rats during intraoral infusions of a sweet (saccharin) paired with impending but delayed access to cocaine self-administration, and for comparative purposes, during the sweet predicting saline self-administration or injection of lithium chloride (LiCl), or during intraoral infusions of a bitter taste (quinine). Consistent with previous work, cocaine-paired saccharin, LiCl-paired saccharin, and quinine all elicited aversive taste reactivity. However, the aversive taste reactivity elicited by the cocaine-paired tastant was qualitatively different from that evoked by the other two agents. Furthermore, differences in taste reactivity were reflected in RAIC cell firing, where distinct shifts in neural signaling were observed specifically after cocaine but not LiCl conditioning. Notably, low motivation for cocaine (indicated by low loading and slower latencies to lever press) was correlated with this shift in RAIC signaling, but aversive (gaping) responses were not. Collectively, these findings indicate that cocaine-paired tastants elicit unique aspects of aversive behaviors that differ from traditional conditioned taste aversion (LiCl) or quinine and that the RAIC plays a role in modulating drug-seeking behaviors driven by drug-induced dysphoria (craving), but not negative affect per se.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In substance use disorders, negative affect associated with drug cues can elicit craving and promote relapse; however, the underlying neurocircuitry of this phenomenon is unknown. Here, we investigated the role of the rostral agranular insula cortex (RAIC) in these processes using a preclinical model wherein intraoral delivery of a sweet is paired with delayed access to cocaine self-administration. The taste comes to elicit negative affect that predicts heightened drug seeking. Here, we found that a population of RAIC neurons became inhibited during presentation of the cocaine-paired tastant (when negative affect is high) and that this inhibitory neural profile predicted lower drug seeking. These findings suggest that the RAIC may function to oppose cue-induced cocaine craving and help reduce motivation for the drug.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Feedback-Based Learning in Aging: Contributions and Trajectories of Change in Striatal and Hippocampal Systems</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/39/8453?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The striatum supports learning from immediate feedback by coding prediction errors (PEs), whereas the hippocampus (HC) plays a parallel role in learning from delayed feedback. Both regions show evidence of decline in human aging, but behavioral research suggests greater decline in HC versus striatal functions. The present study included male and female humans and used fMRI to examine younger and older adults' brain activation patterns during a learning task with choice feedback presented immediately or after a brief delay. Participants then completed a surprise memory task that tested their recognition of trial-unique feedback stimuli, followed by assessments of postlearning cue preference, outcome probability awareness, and willingness to pay. The study yielded three main findings. First, behavioral measures indicated similar rates of learning in younger and older adults across conditions, but postlearning measures indicated impairment in older adults' ability to subsequently apply learning to discriminate between cues. Second, PE signals in the striatum were greater for immediate versus delayed feedback in both age groups, but PE signals in the HC were greater for delayed versus immediate feedback only in younger adults. Third, unlike younger adults, older adults failed to exhibit enhanced episodic memory for outcome stimuli in the delayed-feedback condition. Together, these findings indicate that HC circuits supporting learning and memory decline more than striatal circuits in healthy aging, which suggests that declines in HC learning signals may be an important predictor of deficits in learning-dependent economic decisions among older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The hippocampus (HC) and striatum play distinct and critical roles in learning. Substantial research suggests that age-related decline in learning supported by the HC outpaces decline in learning supported by the striatum; however, such inferences have been drawn by comparing performance in tasks with fundamentally different structures. The present study overcomes this obstacle by implementing a single fMRI-learning paradigm with a subtle variation in feedback timing to examine differential age effects on memory supported by the HC and striatum. Our results provide converging behavioral and brain-imaging evidence showing that HC circuits supporting learning and memory decline more than striatal circuits in healthy aging and that declines in HC learning signals may predict early deficits in learning-dependent decisions among older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Auditory Predictive Coding across Awareness States under Anesthesia: An Intracranial Electrophysiology Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/39/8441?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The systems-level mechanisms underlying loss of consciousness (LOC) under anesthesia remain unclear. General anesthetics suppress sensory responses within higher-order cortex and feedback connections, both critical elements of predictive coding hypotheses of conscious perception. Responses to auditory novelty may offer promise as biomarkers for consciousness. This study examined anesthesia-induced changes in auditory novelty responses over short (local deviant [LD]) and long (global deviant [GD]) time scales, envisioned to engage preattentive and conscious levels of processing, respectively. Electrocorticographic recordings were obtained in human neurosurgical patients (3 male, 3 female) from four hierarchical processing levels: core auditory cortex, non-core auditory cortex, auditory-related, and PFC. Stimuli were vowel patterns incorporating deviants within and across stimuli (LD and GD). Subjects were presented with stimuli while awake, and during sedation (responsive) and following LOC (unresponsive) under propofol anesthesia. LD and GD effects were assayed as the averaged evoked potential and high gamma (70–150 Hz) activity. In the awake state, LD and GD effects were present in all recorded regions, with averaged evoked potential effects more broadly distributed than high gamma activity. Under sedation, LD effects were preserved in all regions, except PFC. LOC was accompanied by loss of LD effects outside of auditory cortex. By contrast, GD effects were markedly suppressed under sedation in all regions and were absent following LOC. Thus, although the presence of GD effects is indicative of being awake, its absence is not indicative of LOC. Loss of LD effects in higher-order cortical areas may constitute an alternative biomarker of LOC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Development of a biomarker that indexes changes in the brain upon loss of consciousness (LOC) under general anesthesia has broad implications for elucidating the neural basis of awareness and clinical relevance to mechanisms of sleep, coma, and disorders of consciousness. Using intracranial recordings from neurosurgery patients, we investigated changes in the activation of cortical networks involved in auditory novelty detection over short (local deviance) and long (global deviance) time scales associated with sedation and LOC under propofol anesthesia. Our results indicate that, whereas the presence of global deviance effects can index awareness, their loss cannot serve as a biomarker for LOC. The dramatic reduction of local deviance effects in areas beyond auditory cortex may constitute an alternative biomarker of LOC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Contextual-Dependent Attention Effect on Crowded Orientation Signals in Human Visual Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/39/8433?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A target becomes hard to identify with nearby visual stimuli. This phenomenon, known as crowding, places a fundamental limit on conscious perception and object recognition. To understand the neural representation of crowded stimuli, we used fMRI and a forward encoding model to reconstruct the target-specific feature from multivoxel activation patterns evoked by orientation patches. Orientation-selective response profiles were constructed in V1–V4 for a target embedded in different contexts. Subjects of both sexes either directed their attention over all the orientation patches or selectively to the target. In the context with a weak crowding effect, attending to the target enhanced the orientation selectivity of the response profile; such effect increased along the visual pathway. In the context with a strong crowding effect, attending to the target enhanced the orientation selectivity of the response profile in the earlier visual area, but not in V4. The increase and decrease of orientation selectivity along the visual hierarchy demonstrate a contextual-dependent attention effect on crowded orientation signals: in the context with a weak crowding effect, selective attention gradually resolves the target from nearby distractors along the hierarchy; in the context with a strong crowding effect, while selective attention maintains the target feature in the earlier visual area, its effect decreases in the downstream area. Our findings reveal how the human visual system represents the target-specific feature at multiple stages under the limit of attention selection in a cluttered scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Using fMRI and a forward encoding model, we reconstructed orientation-selective response profiles for a target embedded in crowded contexts. In the context with a weak crowding effect, attention gradually resolves the target from nearby distractors along the visual hierarchy. In the context with a strong crowding effect, while the feature of the target is preserved in the early visual cortex, it degrades in the later visual processing stage. The increase and decrease of orientation selectivity along the visual hierarchy reveal how the human visual system strikes to present the target-specific feature under the limit of attention selection in a cluttered scene.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Interneuron Simplification and Loss of Structural Plasticity As Markers of Aging-Related Functional Decline</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Changes in excitatory neuron and synapse structure have been recognized as a potential physical source of age-related cognitive decline. Despite the importance of inhibition to brain plasticity, little is known regarding aging-associated changes to inhibitory neurons. Here we test for age-related cellular and circuit changes to inhibitory neurons of mouse visual cortex. We find no substantial difference in inhibitory neuron number, inhibitory neuronal subtypes, or synapse numbers within the cerebral cortex of aged mice compared with younger adults. However, when comparing cortical interneuron morphological parameters, we find differences in complexity, suggesting that arbors are simplified in aged mice. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; two-photon microscopy has previously shown that in contrast to pyramidal neurons, inhibitory interneurons retain a capacity for dendritic remodeling in the adult. We find that this capacity diminishes with age and is accompanied by a shift in dynamics from balanced branch additions and retractions to progressive prevalence of retractions, culminating in a dendritic arbor that is both simpler and more stable. Recording of visually evoked potentials shows that aging-related interneuron dendritic arbor simplification and reduced dynamics go hand in hand with loss of induced stimulus-selective response potentiation (SRP), a paradigm for adult visual cortical plasticity. Chronic treatment with the antidepressant fluoxetine reversed deficits in interneuron structural dynamics and restored SRP in aged animals. Our results support a structural basis for age-related impairments in sensory perception, and suggest that declines in inhibitory neuron structural plasticity during aging contribute to reduced functional plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Structural alterations in neuronal morphology and synaptic connections have been proposed as a potential physical basis for age–related decline in cognitive function. Little is known regarding aging-associated changes to inhibitory neurons, despite the importance of inhibitory circuitry to adult cortical plasticity and the reorganization of cortical maps. Here we show that brain aging goes hand in hand with progressive structural simplification and reduced plasticity of inhibitory neurons, and a parallel decline in sensory map plasticity. Fluoxetine treatment can attenuate the concurrent age–related declines in interneuron structural and functional plasticity, suggesting it could provide an important therapeutic approach for mitigating sensory and cognitive deficits associated with aging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Functional riboSNitch in the 3' Untranslated Region of FKBP5 Alters MicroRNA-320a Binding Efficiency and Mediates Vulnerability to Chronic Post-Traumatic Pain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/39/8407?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/39/8407?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown that common variants of the gene coding for FK506-binding protein 51 (&lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt;), a critical regulator of glucocorticoid sensitivity, affect vulnerability to stress-related disorders. In a previous report, &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt; rs1360780 was identified as a functional variant because of its effect on gene methylation. Here we report evidence for a novel functional &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt; allele, rs3800373. This study assessed the association between rs3800373 and post-traumatic chronic pain in 1607 women and men from two ethnically diverse human cohorts. The molecular mechanism through which rs3800373 affects adverse outcomes was established via &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; analyses. The rs3800373 minor allele predicted worse adverse outcomes after trauma exposure, such that individuals with the minor (risk) allele developed more severe post-traumatic chronic musculoskeletal pain. Among these individuals, peritraumatic circulating &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt; expression levels increased as cortisol and glucocorticoid receptor (&lt;i&gt;NR3C1&lt;/i&gt;) mRNA levels increased, consistent with increased glucocorticoid resistance. Bioinformatic, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, and mutational analyses indicate that the rs3800373 minor allele reduces the binding of a stress- and pain-associated microRNA, miR-320a, to &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt; via altering the &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt; mRNA 3'UTR secondary structure (i.e., is a riboSNitch). This results in relatively greater &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt; translation, unchecked by miR-320a. Overall, these results identify an important gene–miRNA interaction influencing chronic pain risk in vulnerable individuals and suggest that exogenous methods to achieve targeted reduction in poststress &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression may constitute useful therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt; is a critical regulator of the stress response. Previous studies have shown that dysregulation of the expression of this gene plays a role in the pathogenesis of chronic pain development as well as a number of comorbid neuropsychiatric disorders. In the current study, we identified a functional allele (rs3800373) in the 3'UTR of &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt; that influences vulnerability to chronic post-traumatic pain in two ethnic cohorts. Using multiple complementary experimental approaches, we show that the &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt; rs3800373 minor allele alters the secondary structure of &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt; mRNA, decreasing the binding of a stress- and pain-associated microRNA, miR-320a. This results in relatively greater &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt; translation, unchecked by miR-320a, increasing glucocorticoid resistance and increasing vulnerability to post-traumatic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Adhesion-GPCR BAI1 Promotes Excitatory Synaptogenesis by Coordinating Bidirectional Trans-synaptic Signaling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/39/8388?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Excitatory synapses are specialized cell–cell contacts located on actin-rich dendritic spines that mediate information flow and storage in the brain. The postsynaptic adhesion-G protein-coupled receptor (A-GPCR) BAI1 is a critical regulator of excitatory synaptogenesis, which functions in part by recruiting the Par3-Tiam1 polarity complex to spines, inducing local Rac1 GTPase activation and actin cytoskeletal remodeling. However, a detailed mechanistic understanding of how BAI1 controls synapse and spine development remains elusive. Here, we confirm that BAI1 is required &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; for hippocampal spine development, and we identify three distinct signaling mechanisms mediating BAI1's prosynaptogenic functions. Using &lt;i&gt;in utero&lt;/i&gt; electroporation to sparsely knock down BAI1 expression in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, we show that BAI1 cell-autonomously promotes spinogenesis in the developing mouse brain. BAI1 appears to function as a receptor at synapses, as its extracellular N-terminal segment is required for both its prospinogenic and prosynaptogenic functions. Moreover, BAI1 activation with a &lt;i&gt;Stachel&lt;/i&gt;-derived peptide, which mimics a tethered agonist motif found in A-GPCRs, drives synaptic Rac1 activation and subsequent spine and synapse development. We also reveal, for the first time, a trans-synaptic function for BAI1, demonstrating in a mixed-culture assay that BAI1 induces the clustering of presynaptic vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGluT1) in contacting axons, indicative of presynaptic differentiation. Finally, we show that BAI1 forms a receptor complex with the synaptogenic cell-adhesion molecule Neuroligin-1 (NRLN1) and mediates NRLN1-dependent spine growth and synapse development. Together, these findings establish BAI1 as an essential postsynaptic A-GPCR that regulates excitatory synaptogenesis by coordinating bidirectional trans-synaptic signaling in cooperation with NRLN1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Adhesion-G protein-coupled receptors are cell-adhesion receptors with important roles in nervous system development, function, and neuropsychiatric disorders. The postsynaptic adhesion-G protein-coupled receptor BAI1 is a critical regulator of dendritic spine and excitatory synapse development. However, the mechanism by which BAI1 controls these functions remains unclear. Our study identifies three distinct signaling paradigms for BAI1, demonstrating that it mediates forward, reverse, and lateral signaling in spines. Activation of BAI1 by a &lt;i&gt;Stachel&lt;/i&gt;-dependent mechanism induces local Rac1 activation and subsequent spinogenesis/synaptogenesis. BAI1 also signals trans-synaptically to promote presynaptic differentiation. Furthermore, BAI1 interacts with the postsynaptic cell-adhesion molecule Neuroligin-1 (NRLN1) and facilitates NRLN1-dependent spine growth and excitatory synaptogenesis. Thus, our findings establish BAI1 as a functional synaptogenic receptor that promotes presynaptic and postsynaptic development in cooperation with synaptic organizer NRLN1.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Posterior Parietal Cortex Dysfunction Is Central to Working Memory Storage and Broad Cognitive Deficits in Schizophrenia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/39/8378?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/39/8378?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;PFC dysfunction is widely believed to underlie working memory (WM) deficits in people with schizophrenia (PSZ), but few studies have focused on measures of WM storage devoid of manipulation. Research in neurotypical individuals has shown that storage capacity is more closely related to posterior parietal cortex (PPC) than PFC, suggesting that reductions in WM storage capacity in schizophrenia that are associated with broad cognitive deficits may be related to neural activity in PPC. In the present human neuroimaging study, 37 PSZ and 37 matched healthy control subjects of either sex completed a change detection task with varying set sizes while undergoing fMRI. The task was designed to emphasize WM storage with minimal top-down control demands. Whole-brain analysis identified areas in which BOLD activity covaried with the number of items maintained in WM (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;), as derived from task performance at a given set size. Across groups, &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt; values independent of set size predicted BOLD activity in PPC, including superior and inferior parietal lobules and intraparietal sulcus, and middle occipital gyrus. Whole-brain interaction analysis found significantly less &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;-dependent signal modulation in PSZ than healthy control subjects in left PPC, a phenomenon that could not be explained by a narrower &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt; value range. The slope between &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt; and PPC activation statistically accounted for 43.4% of the between-group differences in broad cognitive function. These results indicate that PPC dysfunction is central to WM storage deficits in PSZ and may play a key role in the broad cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; People with schizophrenia exhibit cognitive deficits across a wide range of tasks. Explaining these impairments in terms of a small number of core deficits with clearly defined neural correlates would advance the understanding of the disorder and promote treatment development. We show that a substantial portion of broad cognitive deficits in schizophrenia can be explained by a failure to flexibly modulate posterior parietal cortex activity as a function of the amount of information currently stored in working memory. Working memory deficits have long been considered central to schizophrenia-related cognitive deficits, but the focus has been on paradigms involving some form of top-down control rather than pure storage of information, which may have unduly narrowed the focus on prefrontal dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: S-Nitrosylation of Divalent Metal Transporter 1 Enhances Iron Uptake to Mediate Loss of Dopaminergic Neurons and Motoric Deficit</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/39/8364?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Elevated iron deposition has been reported in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the route of iron uptake leading to high deposition in the substantia nigra is unresolved. Here, we show a mechanism in enhanced Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake via S-nitrosylation of divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1). While DMT1 could be S-nitrosylated by exogenous nitric oxide donors, in human PD brains, endogenously S-nitrosylated DMT1 was detected in postmortem substantia nigra. Patch-clamp electrophysiological recordings and iron uptake assays confirmed increased Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake through S-nitrosylated DMT1. We identified two major S-nitrosylation sites, C23 and C540, by mass spectrometry, and DMT1 C23A or C540A substitutions abolished nitric oxide (NO)-mediated DMT1 current increase. To evaluate &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; significance, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was stereotaxically injected into the substantia nigra of female and male mice to induce inflammation and production of NO. The intranigral LPS injection resulted in corresponding increase in Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; deposition, JNK activation, dopaminergic neuronal loss and deficit in motoric activity, and these were rescued by the NO synthase inhibitor l-NAME or by the DMT1-selective blocker ebselen. Lentiviral knockdown of DMT1 abolished LPS-induced dopaminergic neuron loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neuroinflammation and high cytoplasmic Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels have been implicated in the initiation and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we report the unexpected enhancement of the functional activity of transmembrane divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) by S-nitrosylation. We demonstrated that S-nitrosylation increased DMT1-mediated Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake, and two cysteines were identified by mass spectrometry to be the sites for S-nitrosylation and for enhanced iron uptake. One conceptual advance is that while DMT1 activity could be increased by external acidification because the gating of the DMT1 transporter is proton motive, we discovered that DMT1 activity could also be enhanced by S-nitrosylation. Significantly, lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide (NO)-mediated neuronal death in the substantia nigra could be ameliorated by using l-NAME, a NO synthase inhibitor, or by ebselen, a DMT1-selective blocker.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor Type J (PTPRJ) Regulates Retinal Axonal Projections by Inhibiting Eph and Abl Kinases in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/39/8345?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Eph receptors play pivotal roles in the axon guidance of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) at the optic chiasm and the establishment of the topographic retinocollicular map. We previously demonstrated that protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type O (PTPRO) is specifically involved in the control of retinotectal projections in chicks through the dephosphorylation of EphA and EphB receptors. We subsequently revealed that all the mouse R3 subfamily members (PTPRB, PTPRH, PTPRJ, and PTPRO) of the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) family inhibited Eph receptors as their substrates in cultured mammalian cells. We herein investigated the functional roles of R3 RPTPs in the projection of mouse retinal axon of both sexes. &lt;i&gt;Ptpro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ptprj&lt;/i&gt; were expressed in mouse RGCs; however, &lt;i&gt;Ptprj&lt;/i&gt; expression levels were markedly higher than those of &lt;i&gt;Ptpro&lt;/i&gt;. Consistent with their expression levels, Eph receptor activity was significantly enhanced in &lt;i&gt;Ptprj&lt;/i&gt;-knock-out (&lt;i&gt;Ptprj&lt;/i&gt;-KO) retinas. In &lt;i&gt;Ptprj&lt;/i&gt;-KO and &lt;i&gt;Ptprj&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Ptpro&lt;/i&gt;-double-KO (DKO) mice, the number of retinal axons that projected ipsilaterally or to the contralateral eye was significantly increased. Furthermore, retinal axons in &lt;i&gt;Ptprj&lt;/i&gt;-KO and DKO mice formed anteriorly shifted ectopic terminal zones in the superior colliculus (SC). We found that c-Abl (Abelson tyrosine kinase) was downstream of ephrin–Eph signaling for the repulsion of retinal axons at the optic chiasm and in the SC. c-Abl was identified as a novel substrate for PTPRJ and PTPRO, and the phosphorylation of c-Abl was upregulated in &lt;i&gt;Ptprj&lt;/i&gt;-KO and DKO retinas. Thus, PTPRJ regulates retinocollicular projections in mice by controlling the activity of Eph and c-Abl kinases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Correct retinocollicular projection is a prerequisite for proper vision. Eph receptors have been implicated in retinal axon guidance at the optic chiasm and the establishment of the topographic retinocollicular map. We herein demonstrated that protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type J (PTPRJ) regulated retinal axonal projections by controlling Eph activities. The retinas of &lt;i&gt;Ptprj&lt;/i&gt;-knock-out (KO) and &lt;i&gt;Ptpro&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Ptprj&lt;/i&gt; double-KO mice exhibited significantly enhanced Eph activities over those in wild-type mice, and their axons showed defects in pathfinding at the chiasm and retinocollicular topographic map formation. We also revealed that c-Abl (Abelson tyrosine kinase) downstream of Eph receptors was regulated by PTPRJ. These results indicate that the regulation of the ephrin–Eph–c-Abl axis by PTPRJ plays pivotal roles in the proper central projection of retinal axons during development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Injury to the supraspinal motor systems, especially the corticospinal tract, leads to movement impairments. In addition to direct disruption of descending motor pathways, spinal motor circuits that are distant to and not directly damaged by the lesion undergo remodeling that contributes significantly to the impairments. Knowing which spinal circuits are remodeled and the underlying mechanisms are critical for understanding the functional changes in the motor pathway and for developing repair strategies. Here, we target spinal premotor cholinergic interneurons (IN) that directly modulate motoneuron excitability via their cholinergic C-bouton terminals. Using a model of unilateral medullary corticospinal tract lesion in male rats, we found transneuronal downregulation of the premotor cholinergic pathway. Phagocytic microglial cells were upregulated in parallel with cholinergic pathway downregulation and both were blocked by minocycline, a microglia activation inhibitor. Additionally, we found a transient increase in interneuronal complement protein C1q expression that preceded cell loss. 3D reconstructions showed ongoing phagocytosis of C1q-expressing cholinergic INs by microglia 3 d after injury, which was complete by 10 d after injury. Unilateral motor cortex inactivation using the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor agonist muscimol replicated the changes detected at 3 d after lesion, indicating activity dependence. The neuronal loss after the lesion was rescued by increasing spinal activity using cathodal &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-spinal direct current stimulation. Our finding of activity-dependent modulation of cholinergic premotor INs after CST injury provides the mechanistic insight that maintaining activity, possibly during a critical period, helps to protect distant motor circuits from further damage and, as a result, may improve motor functional recovery and rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Supraspinal injury to the motor system disrupts descending motor pathways, leading to movement impairments. Whether and how intrinsic spinal circuits are remodeled after a brain injury is unclear. Using a rat model of unilateral corticospinal tract lesion in the medulla, we show activity-dependent, transneuronal downregulation of the spinal premotor cholinergic system, which is mediated by microglial phagocytosis, possibly involving a rapid and transient increase in neuronal C1q before neuronal loss. Spinal cord neuromodulation after injury to augment spinal activity rescued the premotor cholinergic system. Our findings provide the mechanistic insight that maintaining activity, possibly during an early critical period, could protect distant motor circuits from further damage mediated by microglia and interneuronal complement protein and improve motor functional outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Coherent Activity between the Prelimbic and Auditory Cortex in the Slow-Gamma Band Underlies Fear Discrimination</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The medial prefrontal cortex and the basolateral amygdala (BLA) are essential for discriminating between harmful and safe stimuli. The primary auditory cortex (Te1) sends projections to both sites, but whether and how it interacts with these areas during fear discrimination are poorly understood. Here we show that in male rats that can differentiate between a new tone and a threatening one, the selective optogenetic inhibition of Te1 axon terminals into the prelimbic (PL) cortex shifted discrimination to fear generalization. Meanwhile, no effects were detected when Te1 terminals were inhibited in the BLA. Using a combination of local field potential and multiunit recordings, we show that in animals that discriminate successfully between a new tone and a harmful one, the activity of the Te1 and the PL cortex becomes immediately and tightly synchronized in the slow-gamma range (40–70 Hz) at the onset of the new tone. This enhanced synchronization was not present in other frequency ranges, such as the theta range. Critically, the level of gamma synchrony predicted the behavioral choice (i.e., no freezing or freezing) of the animals. Moreover, in the same rats, gamma synchrony was absent before the fear-learning trial and when animals should discriminate between an olfactory stimulus and the auditory harmful one. Thus, our findings reveal that the Te1 and the PL cortex dynamically establish a functional connection during auditory fear-discrimination processes, and that this corticocortical oscillatory mechanism drives the behavioral choice of the animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Identifying neural networks that infer safety versus danger is of great interest in the scientific field. Fear generalization reduces the chances of an animal's survival and leads to psychiatric diseases, such as post-traumatic stress disorders and phobias in humans. Here we demonstrate that animals able to differentiate a new tone from a previous threating tone showed synchronization between the prefrontal and primary auditory cortices. Critically, this connectivity precedes and predicts the behavioral outcome of the animal. Optogenetic inhibition of this functional connectivity leads to fear generalization. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that a corticocortical dialogue occurring between sensory and prefrontal areas is a key node for fear-discrimination processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Automated, predictive, and interpretable inference of C. elegans escape dynamics. (arXiv:1809.09321v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The roundworm C. elegans exhibits robust escape behavior in response to
rapidly rising temperature. The behavior lasts for a few seconds, shows history
dependence, involves both sensory and motor systems, and is too complicated to
model mechanistically using currently available knowledge. Instead we model the
process phenomenologically, and we use the Sir Isaac dynamical inference
platform to infer the model in a fully automated fashion directly from
experimental data. The inferred model requires incorporation of an unobserved
dynamical variable, and is biologically interpretable. The model makes accurate
predictions about the dynamics of the worm behavior, and it can be used to
characterize the functional logic of the dynamical system underlying the escape
response. This work illustrates the power of modern artificial intelligence to
aid in discovery of accurate and interpretable models of complex natural
systems.

From this study emerges a model whereby distinct dopaminergic projections to striatum influence behavior along at least two axes, one representing value and one representing threat.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/WwEvQ6H8e-Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Vertebrate neural tube formation depends on the coordinated orientation of cells in the tissue known as planar cell polarity (PCP). In the &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; neural plate, PCP is marked by the enrichment of the conserved proteins Prickle3 and Vangl2 at anterior cell boundaries. Here we show that the apical determinant Par3 is also planar polarized in the neuroepithelium, suggesting a role for Par3 in PCP. Consistent with this hypothesis, interference with Par3 activity inhibited asymmetric distribution of PCP junctional complexes and caused neural tube defects. Importantly, Par3 physically associated with Prickle3 and promoted its apical localization, whereas overexpression of a Prickle3-binding Par3 fragment disrupted PCP in the neural plate. We also adapted proximity biotinylation assay for use in &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; embryos and show that Par3 functions by enhancing the formation of the anterior apical PCP complex. These findings describe a mechanistic link between the apical localization of PCP components and morphogenetic movements underlying neurulation.</description>

	<description>Generating a comprehensive description of cortical networks requires a large-scale, systematic approach. To that end, we have begun a pipeline project using multipatch electrophysiology, supplemented with two-photon optogenetics, to characterize connectivity and synaptic signaling between classes of neurons in adult mouse primary visual cortex (V1) and human cortex. We focus on producing results detailed enough for the generation of computational models and enabling comparison with future studies. Here, we report our examination of intralaminar connectivity within each of several classes of excitatory neurons. We find that connections are sparse but present among all excitatory cell classes and layers we sampled, and that most mouse synapses exhibited short-term depression with similar dynamics. Synaptic signaling between a subset of layer 2/3 neurons, however, exhibited facilitation. These results contribute to a body of evidence describing recurrent excitatory connectivity as a conserved feature of cortical microcircuits.</description>

	<description>Many secondary active membrane transporters pump substrates against concentration gradients by coupling their uptake to symport of sodium ions. Symport requires the substrate and ions to be always transported together. Cooperative binding of the solutes is a key mechanism contributing to coupled transport in the sodium and aspartate symporter from &lt;i&gt;Pyrococcus horikoshii&lt;/i&gt; Glt&lt;sub&gt;Ph&lt;/sub&gt;. Here, we describe the kinetic mechanism of coupled binding for Glt&lt;sub&gt;Ph&lt;/sub&gt; in the inward facing state. The first of the three coupled sodium ions, binds weakly and slowly, enabling the protein to accept the rest of the ions and the substrate. The last ion binds tightly, but is in rapid equilibrium with solution. Its release is required for the complex disassembly. Thus, the first ion serves to 'open the door' for the substrate, the last ion 'locks the door' once the substrate is in, and one ion contributes to both events.</description>

	<description>How trafficking pathways and organelle abundance adapt in response to metabolic and physiological changes is still mysterious, although a few transcriptional regulators of organellar biogenesis have been identified in recent years. We previously found that the Wnt signaling directly controls lipid droplet formation, linking the cell storage capacity to the established functions of Wnt in development and differentiation. In the present paper, we report that Wnt-induced lipid droplet biogenesis does not depend on the canonical TCF/LEF transcription factors. Instead, we find that TFAP2 family members mediate the pro-lipid droplet signal induced by Wnt3a, leading to the notion that the TFAP2 transcription factor may function as a 'master' regulator of lipid droplet biogenesis.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Retinal direction selectivity in the absence of asymmetric starburst amacrine cell responses</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/428532v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>In the mammalian retina, asymmetric inhibitory signals arising from the direction-selective dendrites of GABAergic/cholinergic starburst amacrine cells are thought to be crucial for originating direction selectivity. Contrary to this notion, however, we found that direction selectivity in downstream ganglion cells remains remarkably unaffected when starburst output is rendered non-directional (using a novel strategy combining a conditional GABA receptor knockout mouse with optogenetics). We show that temporal asymmetries between excitation/inhibition, arising from the differential connectivity patterns of starburst cholinergic and GABAergic synapses to ganglion cells, form the basis for a parallel mechanism generating direction selectivity. We further demonstrate that these distinct mechanisms work in a coordinated way to refine direction selectivity as the stimulus crosses the ganglion cells receptive field. Thus, precise spatiotemporal patterns of inhibition and excitation that shape directional responses in ganglion cells are shaped by two core mechanisms, both arising from distinct specializations of the starburst network.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: LINEAR ANALYSIS OF HIPPOCAMPAL LFP: SLOW GAMMA VS HIGH THETA</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/428490v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/428490v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>We apply common linear analysis techniques (Fourier and wavelet transforms) to time-series of hippocampal local field potential (LFP) collected from a small population of rats (5 individuals) during awake-behavior in a maze-exploring task, and rest (non-REM sleep). Important characteristics of hippocampal activity, such as the power of the theta rhythm and its harmonics, as well as that of the gamma rhythm, are strongly dependent on the intensity of behavioral activity, as measured by rat speed. A comparison of Fourier and wavelet representation of stationary LFP epochs show that the wavelet representation fails to resolve high-order theta harmonics (24, 32, 40 Hz) that appear well defined in the Fourier analysis and occupy the frequency band of 20-50 Hz, also attributed to the slow gamma rhythm. It seems possible that a misinterpretation of wavelet analysis might be the origin of the identification of the slow gamma rhythm. Such a misidentification would also naturally lead to spurious coupling results between the low gamma and theta oscillations. Theoretically, both transforms can handle arbitrary time-series; however, the Fourier transform is best interpreted for weakly phase-coupled, nearly-Gaussian stochastic processes, while the wavelet transform is most useful when applied to non-stationary, transient processes. Outside their optimal applicability range, both transforms may produce ambiguous, even misleading results. Rather than refuting the existence of slow gamma, our results emphasize the importance of selecting the adequate spectral analysis method for the stochastic process analyzed. To help with the selection, we propose a simple stationarity test based on the integral value of the bicoherence. Further research is needed to separate high order theta harmonics from slow gamma.</description>

	<description>We try to deploy the retinal fovea to optimally scrutinize an object of interest by directing our eyes to it. Horizontal and vertical components of these fixation eye movements are determined by the objects location. However, fixation eye movements also involve a torsional component, which according to Listings law is fully determined by the 2D eye position acquired. According to Von Helmholtz knowledge of the torsion provided by this law alleviates the perceptual interpretation of the image tilt that changes with fixation, a view supported by psychophysical experiments he pioneered. We address the question where and how Listings law is implemented in the visual system and we show that neurons in monkey area V1 use knowledge of torsion to compensate the image tilt associated with specific eye positions as set by Listings law.</description>

	<description>The context in which reward-paired cues are encountered sets the occasion for appropriate reward-seeking but may also spur inappropriate behaviors such as the renewal of drug-seeking. The psychological processes underlying occasion setting remain unclear as contexts are diffuse and difficult to isolate from other stimuli. To overcome this, we modeled a context as a phasic and discrete event - an occasion setter - which allowed for control over its presentation and influence on cue-driven reward-seeking. This allowed us to directly assess how occasion setters, like contexts, regulate the predictive and motivational significance of Pavlovian cues. Male rats (n=50) were trained in a Pavlovian paradigm where the presentation of an ambiguous conditioned stimulus was reinforced only if preceded by an occasion setting cue. We assessed the motivational value of the occasion setter and conditioned stimulus alone or in combination using conditioned reinforcement. Rats showed enhanced conditioned approach to the reward port during the reward-adjacent conditioned stimulus when it was preceded by the occasion setter. When allowed the opportunity, rats responded more to obtain presentations of the conditioned stimulus in combination with the occasion setter than the conditioned stimulus alone. Critically, rats also worked to obtain presentations of the occasion setter alone more than the conditioned stimulus, and this was resistant to manipulations of the value of the occasion setter. We conclude that occasion setting can act via incentive motivational mechanisms and that, apart from resolving predictive information about ambiguous reward-paired cues, occasion setters themselves generate states of appetitive motivation that can facilitate reward-seeking.</description>

	<description>High acuity vision in primates, including humans, is mediated by a small central retinal region called the fovea. As more accessible model organisms lack a fovea, its specialized function and dysfunction in ocular diseases remain poorly understood. We used 165,000 single-cell RNA-seq profiles to generate and validate comprehensive cellular taxonomies of macaque fovea and peripheral retina. More than 80% of &amp;gt;65 cell types match between the two regions, but exhibit substantial differences in proportions and gene expression, some of which we relate to functional differences. Comparison of macaque retinal types with those of mice reveals that interneuron types are tightly conserved, but that projection neuron types and programs diverge, despite conserved transcription factor codes. Key macaque types are conserved in humans, allowing mapping of cell-type and region-specific expression of &amp;gt;190 genes associated with 6 human retinal diseases. Our work provides a framework for comparative single-cell analysis across tissue regions and species.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Discrimination of the hierarchical structure of cortical layers in 2-photon microscopy data by combined unsupervised and supervised machine learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/427955v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>The laminar organization of the cerebral cortex is a fundamental characteristic of the brain, with essential implications for cortical function. Due to the rapidly growing amount of high-resolution brain imaging data, a great demand arises for automated and flexible methods for discriminating the laminar texture of the cortex. Here, we propose a combined approach of unsupervised and supervised machine learning to discriminate the hierarchical cortical laminar organization in high-resolution 2-photon microscopic neural image data without observer bias, that is, without the prerequisite of manually labeled training data. For local cortical foci, we modify an unsupervised clustering approach to identify and represent the laminar cortical structure. Subsequently, supervised machine learning is applied to transfer the resulting layer labels across different locations and image data, to ensure the existence of a consistent layer label system. By using neurobiologically meaningful features, the discrimination results are shown to be consistent with the layer classification of the classical Brodmann scheme, and provide additional insight into the structure of the cerebral cortex and its hierarchical organization. Thus, our work paves a new way for studying the anatomical organization of the cerebral cortex, and potentially its functional organization.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Subcutaneous neurotrophin-3 infusion induces corticospinal neuroplasticity and improvements in dexterity and walking in elderly rats after large cortical stroke</title>

	<description>There is an urgent need for a therapy which reverses disability after stroke when initiated in a time frame suitable for the majority of new victims. Neurotrophin-3 (NT3) is a growth factor made by muscle spindles and skin which is required for the survival, development and function of locomotor circuits involving afferents from muscle and skin that mediate proprioception and tactile sensation. We set out to determine whether subcutaneous supplementation of NT3 improves sensorimotor recovery after stroke in elderly rats. We show that one-month-long subcutaneous infusion of NT3 protein induces sensorimotor recovery after cortical stroke in elderly rats. Specifically, in a randomised, blinded pre-clinical trial, we show improved dexterity, walking and sensory function in rats following cortical ischemic stroke when treatment with NT3 is initiated 24 hours after stroke. Importantly, NT-3 was given in a clinically-feasible timeframe via this straightforward route. MRI and histology showed that recovery was not due to neuroprotection, as expected given the delayed treatment. Rather, anterograde tracing showed that corticospinal axons from the less-affected hemisphere sprouted in the spinal cord from cervical levels 2 to 8. Importantly, Phase I and II clinical trials by others show that repeated, subcutaneously administered high doses of recombinant NT-3 are safe and well tolerated in humans with other conditions. This paves the way for NT-3 as a therapy for stroke.</description>

	<description>The sensation of touch in the glabrous skin of the human hand is conveyed by thousands of fast conducting mechanoreceptive afferents, which can be categorised into four distinct types. The spiking properties of these afferents in the periphery in response to varied tactile stimuli are well-characterised, but relatively little is known about the spatiotemporal properties of the neural representations of these different receptor types in the human cortex. Here, we use the novel methodological combination of single unit intraneural microstimulation (INMS) with magnetoencephalography (MEG) to localise cortical representations of individual touch afferents in humans, by measuring the extracranial magnetic fields from neural currents. We find that by assessing modulations of the beta (13-30 Hz) rhythm during single unit INMS, significant changes in oscillatory amplitude occur in the contralateral primary somatosensory cortex within and across a group of fast adapting type I mechanoreceptive afferents, which corresponded well to the induced response from matched vibrotactile stimulation. Combining the spatiotemporal specificity of MEG with the selective single unit stimulation of INMS enables the interrogation of the central representations of different aspects of tactile afferent signalling within the human cortices. The fundamental finding that single unit INMS ERD responses are robust and consistent with natural somatosensory stimuli will permit us to more dynamically probe the central nervous system responses in humans, to address questions about the processing of touch from the different classes of mechanoreceptive afferents and the effects of stimulus frequency and waveform.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Comparison of fluctuations in global network topology of modeled and empirical brain functional connectivity</title>

Dynamic models of large-scale brain activity have been used for reproducing many empirical findings on human brain functional connectivity. Features that have been shown to be reproducible by comparing modeled to empirical data include functional connectivity measured over several minutes of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, as well as its time-resolved fluctuations on a time scale of tens of seconds. However, comparison of modeled and empirical data has not been conducted yet for fluctuations in global network topology of functional connectivity, such as fluctuations between segregated and integrated topology or between high and low modularity topology. Since these global network-level fluctuations have been shown to be related to human cognition and behavior, there is an emerging need for clarifying their reproducibility with computational models. To address this problem, we directly compared fluctuations in global network topology of functional connectivity between modeled and empirical data, and clarified the degree to which a stationary model of spontaneous brain dynamics can reproduce the empirically observed fluctuations. Modeled fluctuations were simulated using a system of coupled phase oscillators wired according to brain structural connectivity. By performing model parameter search, we found that modeled fluctuations in global metrics quantifying network integration and modularity had more than 80% of magnitudes of those observed in the empirical data. Temporal properties of network states determined based on fluctuations in these metrics were also found to be reproducible, although their spatial patterns in functional connectivity did not perfectly marched. These results suggest that stationary models simulating resting-state activity can reproduce the magnitude of empirical fluctuations in segregation and integration, whereas additional factors, such as active mechanisms controlling non-stationary dynamics and/or greater accuracy of mapping brain structural connectivity, would be necessary for fully reproducing the spatial patterning associated with these fluctuations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sr-8OBw5Vvo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Cooperation is key for the evolution of biological systems ranging from bacteria communities to human societies. Evolutionary processes can dramatically alter the cooperation level. Evolutionary processes are typically of two classes: comparison based and self-evaluation based. The fate of cooperation is extremely sensitive to the details of comparison based processes. For self-evaluation processes, however, it is still unclear whether the sensitivity remains. We concentrate on a class of self-evaluation processes based on aspiration, where all the individuals adjust behaviors based on their own aspirations. We prove that the evolutionary outcome with heterogeneous aspirations is the same as that of the homogeneous one for regular networks under weak selection limit. Simulation results further suggest that it is also valid for general networks across various distributions of personalised aspirations. Our result clearly indicates that self-evaluation processes are robust in contrast with comparison based rules. In addition, our result greatly simplifies the calculation of the aspiration dynamics, which is computationally expensive.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AtRjHXVAAl8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Electrophysiological Signature Reveals Laminar Structure of the Porcine Hippocampus</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus is integral to working and episodic memory and is a central region of interest in diseases affecting these processes. Pig models are widely used in translational research and may provide an excellent bridge between rodents and nonhuman primates for CNS disease models because of their gyrencephalic neuroanatomy and significant white matter composition. However, the laminar structure of the pig hippocampus has not been well characterized. Therefore, we histologically characterized the dorsal hippocampus of Yucatan miniature pigs and quantified the cytoarchitecture of the hippocampal layers. We then utilized stereotaxis combined with single-unit electrophysiological mapping to precisely place multichannel laminar silicon probes into the dorsal hippocampus without the need for image guidance. We used &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiological recordings of simultaneous laminar field potentials and single-unit activity in multiple layers of the dorsal hippocampus to physiologically identify and quantify these layers under anesthesia. Consistent with previous reports, we found the porcine hippocampus to have the expected archicortical laminar structure, with some anatomical and histological features comparable to the rodent and others to the primate hippocampus. Importantly, we found these distinct features to be reflected in the laminar electrophysiology. This characterization, as well as our electrophysiology-based methodology targeting the porcine hippocampal lamina combined with high-channel-count silicon probes, will allow for analysis of spike-field interactions during normal and disease states in both anesthetized and future awake behaving neurophysiology in this large animal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

To overcome these obstacles and identify key mechanisms by which Zika virus (ZIKV) manipulates host responses, we developed a system that enables simultaneous characterization of genome-wide transcriptional...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/m00t20hX01U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Epigenetic memory for signal-dependent transcription has remained elusive. So far, the concept of epigenetic memory has been largely limited to cell-autonomous, preprogrammed processes such as development and metabolism. Here we show that IFNβ stimulation creates transcriptional memory in fibroblasts, conferring faster and greater transcription upon restimulation. The memory was inherited...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/iU7mKEIbmPs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Uncovering Multi-Site Identifiability Based on Resting-State Functional Connectomes. (arXiv:1809.08959v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08959</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08959</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multi-site studies are becoming important to increase statistical power,
enhance generalizability, and to improve the likelihood of pooling relevant
subgroups together activities which are otherwise limited by the availability
of patients or funds at a single site. Even with harmonized imaging sequences,
site-dependent variability can mask the advantages of these multi-site studies.
The aim of this study was to assess multi-site reproducibility in resting-state
functional connectivity fingerprints, and to improve identifiability of
obtained functional connectomes. The individual fingerprinting of functional
connectivity profiles is promising due to its potential as a robust
neuroimaging biomarker with which to draw single-subject inferences. We
evaluated individual fingerprints in test-retest visit pairs within and across
two sites and present a generalized framework based on principal component
analysis to improve identifiability. Those principal components that maximized
differential identifiability of a training dataset were used as an orthogonal
connectivity basis to reconstruct the individual functional connectomes of
training and validation sets. The optimally reconstructed functional
connectomes showed a substantial improvement in individual fingerprinting of
the subjects within and across the two sites and test-retest visit pairs
relative to the original data. A notable increase in ICC values for functional
edges and resting-state networks were also observed for reconstructed
functional connectomes. Improvements in identifiability were not found to be
affected by the presence or absence of global signal regression. Result
demonstrate that the data-driven method presented in this study can improve
identifiability in resting-state functional connectomes in multi-site studies.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Contribution of social network analysis and collective phenomena to understanding social complexity and cognition. (arXiv:1809.08704v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08704</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The social brain hypothesis postulates the increasing complexity of social
interactions as a driving force for the evolution of cognitive abilities.
Whereas dyadic and triadic relations play a basic role in defining social
behaviours and pose many challenges for the social brain, individuals in animal
societies typically belong to relatively large networks. How the structure and
dynamics of these networks also contribute to the evolution of cognition, and
vice versa, is less understood. Here we review how collective phenomena can
occur in systems where social agents do not require sophisticated cognitive
skills, and how complex networks can grow from simple probabilistic rules, or
even emerge from the interaction between agents and their environment, without
explicit social factors. We further show that the analysis of social networks
can be used to develop good indicators of social complexity beyond the
individual or dyadic level. We also discuss the types of challenges that the
social brain must cope with in structured groups, such as higher information
fluxes, originating from individuals playing different roles in the network, or
dyadic contacts of widely varying durations and frequencies. We discuss the
relevance of these ideas for primates and other animals societies.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We present BrainNet which, to our knowledge, is the first multi-person
non-invasive direct brain-to-brain interface for collaborative problem solving.
The interface combines electroencephalography (EEG) to record brain signals and
transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to deliver information noninvasively to
the brain. The interface allows three human subjects to collaborate and solve a
task using direct brain-to-brain communication. Two of the three subjects are
&quot;Senders&quot; whose brain signals are decoded using real-time EEG data analysis to
extract decisions about whether to rotate a block in a Tetris-like game before
it is dropped to fill a line. The Senders' decisions are transmitted via the
Internet to the brain of a third subject, the &quot;Receiver,&quot; who cannot see the
game screen. The decisions are delivered to the Receiver's brain via magnetic
stimulation of the occipital cortex. The Receiver integrates the information
received and makes a decision using an EEG interface about either turning the
block or keeping it in the same position. A second round of the game gives the
Senders one more chance to validate and provide feedback to the Receiver's
action. We evaluated the performance of BrainNet in terms of (1) Group-level
performance during the game; (2) True/False positive rates of subjects'
decisions; (3) Mutual information between subjects. Five groups of three
subjects successfully used BrainNet to perform the Tetris task, with an average
accuracy of 0.813. Furthermore, by varying the information reliability of the
Senders by artificially injecting noise into one Sender's signal, we found that
Receivers are able to learn which Sender is more reliable based solely on the
information transmitted to their brains. Our results raise the possibility of
future brain-to-brain interfaces that enable cooperative problem solving by
humans using a &quot;social network&quot; of connected brains.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Topological Data Analysis of Task-Based fMRI Data from Experiments on Schizophrenia. (arXiv:1809.08504v1 [q-bio.QM])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We use methods from computational algebraic topology to study functional
brain networks, in which nodes represent brain regions and weighted edges
represent similarity of fMRI time series from each region. With these tools,
which allow one to characterize topological invariants such as loops in
high-dimensional data, we are able to gain understanding into low-dimensional
structures in networks in a way that complements traditional approaches based
on pairwise interactions. In the present paper, we analyze networks constructed
from task-based fMRI data from schizophrenia patients, healthy controls, and
healthy siblings of schizophrenia patients using persistent homology, which
allows us to explore the persistence of topological structures such as loops at
different scales in the networks. We use persistence landscapes, persistence
images, and Betti curves to create output summaries from our
persistent-homology calculations, and we study the persistence landscapes and
images using $k$-means clustering and community detection. Based on our
analysis of persistence landscapes, we find that the members of the sibling
cohort have topological features (specifically, their 1-dimensional loops) that
are distinct from the other two cohorts. From the persistence images, we are
able to distinguish all three subject groups and to determine the brain regions
in the loops (with four or more edges) that allow us to make these
distinctions.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We develop a phenomenological coarse--graining procedure for activity in a
large network of neurons, and apply this to recordings from a population of
1000+ cells in the hippocampus. Distributions of coarse--grained variables seem
to approach a fixed non--Gaussian form, and we see evidence of scaling in both
static and dynamic quantities. These results suggest that the collective
behavior of the network is described by a non--trivial fixed point.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Asking questions is a pervasive human activity, but little is understood
about what makes them difficult to answer. An analysis of a pair of large
databases, of New York Times crosswords and questions from the quiz-show
Jeopardy, establishes two orthogonal dimensions of question difficulty:
obscurity (the rarity of the answer) and opacity (the indirectness of question
cues, operationalized with word2vec). The importance of opacity, and the role
of synergistic information in resolving it, suggests that accounts of
difficulty in terms of prior expectations captures only a part of the
question-asking process. A further regression analysis shows the presence of
additional dimensions to question-asking: question complexity, the answer's
local network density, cue intersection, and the presence of signal words. Our
work shows how question-askers can help their interlocutors by using contextual
cues, or, conversely, how a particular kind of unfamiliarity with the domain in
question can make it harder for individuals to learn from others. Taken
together, these results suggest how Bayesian models of question difficulty can
be supplemented by process models and accounts of the heuristics individuals
use to navigate conceptual spaces.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Affective computing is confronted to high inter-subject variability, in both
emotional and physiological responses to a given stimulus. In a stimuli-shared
framework, that is to say for different subjects who watch the same stimuli,
Inter-Subject Correlation (ISC) measured from Electroencephalographic (EEG)
recordings characterize the correlations between the respective signals at the
different EEG channels. In order to investigate the interplay between ISC and
emotion, we propose to study the effect of valence and arousal on the ISC
score. To this end, we exploited various computational schemes corresponding to
different subsets of the dataset: all the data, stimulus-wise, subject
pairwise, and both stimulus-wise and subject pairwise. We thus applied these
schemes to the HCI MAHNOB and DEAP databases. Our results suggest that the ISC
score decreases with valence and increases with arousal, as already shown by
previous results on functional MRI.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/39518</link>
	<description>T-box riboswitches are &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-regulatory RNA elements that regulate the expression of proteins involved in amino acid biosynthesis and transport by binding to specific tRNAs and sensing their aminoacylation state. While the T-box modular structural elements that recognize different parts of a tRNA have been identified, the kinetic trajectory describing how these interactions are established temporally remains unclear. Using smFRET, we demonstrate that tRNA binds to the riboswitch in two steps, first anticodon recognition followed by the sensing of the 3' NCCA end, with the second step accompanied by a T-box riboswitch conformational change. Studies on site-specific mutants highlight that specific T-box structural elements drive the two-step binding process in a modular fashion. Our results set up a kinetic framework describing tRNA binding by T-box riboswitches, and propose such binding mechanism is kinetically beneficial for efficient, co-transcriptional recognition of the cognate tRNA ligand.</description>

	<description>The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), a member of the ENaC/DEG superfamily, regulates Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and water homeostasis. ENaCs assemble as heterotrimeric channels that harbor protease-sensitive domains critical for gating the channel. Here we present the structure of human ENaC in the uncleaved state determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. The ion channel is composed of a large extracellular domain and a narrow transmembrane domain. The structure reveals that ENaC assembles with a 1:1:1 stoichiometry of α:β:γ subunits arranged in a counter-clockwise manner. The shape of each subunit is reminiscent of a hand with key gating domains of a 'finger' and a 'thumb'. Wedged between these domains is the elusive protease-sensitive inhibitory domain poised to regulate conformational changes of the 'finger' and 'thumb'; thus, the structure provides the first view of the architecture of inhibition of ENaC.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38839</link>
	<description>PCSK9 is a secreted protein that regulates plasma cholesterol levels and cardiovascular disease risk. Prior studies suggested the presence of an ER cargo receptor that recruits PCSK9 into the secretory pathway, but its identity has remained elusive. Here, we apply a novel approach that combines proximity-dependent biotinylation and proteomics together with genome-scale CRISPR screening to identify SURF4, a homologue of the yeast cargo receptor Erv29p, as a primary mediator of PCSK9 secretion in HEK293T cells. The functional contribution of SURF4 to PCSK9 secretion was confirmed with multiple independent &lt;i&gt;SURF4&lt;/i&gt;-targeting sgRNAs, clonal SURF4-deficient cell lines, and functional rescue with &lt;i&gt;SURF4&lt;/i&gt; cDNA. SURF4 was found to localize to the early secretory pathway where it physically interacts with PCSK9. Deletion of &lt;i&gt;SURF4&lt;/i&gt; resulted in ER accumulation and decreased extracellular secretion of PCSK9. These findings support a model in which SURF4 functions as an ER cargo receptor mediating the efficient cellular secretion of PCSK9.</description>

	<description>Human GABAergic interneurons (GIN) are implicated in normal brain function as well as numerous mental disorders. However, generation of functional human GIN subtypes from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) has not been established. By expressing &lt;i&gt;LHX6&lt;/i&gt;, a transcriptional factor critical for GIN development, we have induced hPSCs to GINs, including somatostatin (SST, 29%) and parvalbumin (PV, 21%) neurons. Our RNAseq results also confirmed alteration of GINs identity with the overexpression of &lt;i&gt;LHX6&lt;/i&gt;. Five months after transplantation into the mouse brain, the human GABA precursors generated increased population of SST and PV neurons by overexpressing &lt;i&gt;LHX6&lt;/i&gt;. Importantly, the grafted human GINs exhibited functional electrophysiological properties and even fast-spiking like action potentials. Thus, expression of the single transcription factor LHX6 under our GIN differentiation condition is sufficient to robustly induce human PV and SST subtypes.</description>

	<description>Conductances of ion channels and transporters controlling cardiac excitation may vary in a population of subjects with different cardiac gene expression patterns. However, the amount of variability and its origin are not quantitatively known. We propose a new conceptual approach to predict this variability that consists of finding combinations of conductances generating a normal intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transient without any constraint on the action potential. Furthermore, we validate experimentally its predictions using the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel, a model system of genetically diverse mouse strains that allows us to quantify inter-subject versus intra-subject variability. The method predicts that conductances of inward Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and outward K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; currents compensate each other to generate a normal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transient in good quantitative agreement with current measurements in ventricular myocytes from hearts of different isogenic strains. Our results suggest that a feedback mechanism sensing the aggregate Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transient of the heart suffices to regulate ionic conductances.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: OptMDFpathway: Identification of metabolic pathways with maximal thermodynamic driving force and its application for analyzing the endogenous CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation potential of Escherichia coli</title>

Constraint-based modeling techniques have become a standard tool for the &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; analysis of metabolic networks. To further improve their accuracy, recent methodological developments focused on integration of thermodynamic information in metabolic models to assess the feasibility of flux distributions by thermodynamic driving forces. Here we present &lt;i&gt;OptMDFpathway&lt;/i&gt;, a method that extends the recently proposed framework of Max-min Driving Force (MDF) for thermodynamic pathway analysis. Given a metabolic network model, &lt;i&gt;OptMDFpathway&lt;/i&gt; identifies both the optimal MDF for a desired phenotypic behavior as well as the respective pathway itself that supports the optimal driving force. &lt;i&gt;OptMDFpathway&lt;/i&gt; is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program and is applicable to genome-scale metabolic networks. As an important theoretical result, we also show that there exists always at least one elementary mode in the network that reaches the maximal MDF. We employed our new approach to systematically identify all substrate-product combinations in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; where product synthesis allows for concomitant net CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; assimilation via thermodynamically feasible pathways. Although biomass synthesis cannot be coupled to net CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation in &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; we found that as many as 145 of the 949 cytosolic carbon metabolites contained in the genome-scale model &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;JO1366 enable net CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; incorporation along thermodynamically feasible pathways with glycerol as substrate and 34 with glucose. The most promising products in terms of carbon assimilation yield and thermodynamic driving forces are orotate, aspartate and the C4-metabolites of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. We also identified thermodynamic bottlenecks frequently limiting the maximal driving force of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-fixing pathways. Our results indicate that heterotrophic organisms like &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; hold a possibly underestimated potential for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; assimilation which may complement existing biotechnological approaches for capturing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, we envision that the developed &lt;i&gt;OptMDFpathway&lt;/i&gt; approach can be used for many other applications within the framework of constrained-based modeling and for rational design of metabolic networks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4gUy88yqGt0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Studies of neuron-behaviour correlation and causal manipulation have long been used separately to understand the neural basis of perception. Yet these approaches sometimes lead to drastically conflicting conclusions about the functional role of brain areas. Theories that focus only on choice-related neuronal activity cannot reconcile those findings without additional experiments involving large-scale recordings to measure interneuronal correlations. By expanding current theories of neural coding and incorporating results from inactivation experiments, we demonstrate here that it is possible to infer decoding weights of different brain areas at a coarse scale without precise knowledge of the correlation structure. We apply this technique to neural data collected from two different cortical areas in macaque monkeys trained to perform a heading discrimination task. We identify two opposing decoding schemes, each consistent with data depending on the nature of correlated noise. Our theory makes specific testable predictions to distinguish these scenarios experimentally without requiring measurement of the underlying noise correlations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0oFfpAXFrZQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Proteins with low-complexity domains continue to emerge as key players in both normal and pathological cellular processes. Although low-complexity domains are often grouped into a single class, individual low-complexity domains can differ substantially with respect to amino acid composition. These differences may strongly influence the physical properties, cellular regulation, and molecular functions of low-complexity domains. Therefore, we developed a bioinformatic approach to explore relationships between amino acid composition, protein metabolism, and protein function. We find that local compositional enrichment within protein sequences is associated with differences in translation efficiency, abundance, half-life, protein-protein interaction promiscuity, subcellular localization, and molecular functions of proteins on a proteome-wide scale. However, local enrichment of related amino acids is sometimes associated with opposite effects on protein regulation and function, highlighting the importance of distinguishing between different types of low-complexity domains. Furthermore, many of these effects are discernible at amino acid compositions below those required for classification as low-complexity or statistically-biased by traditional methods and in the absence of homopolymeric amino acid repeats, indicating that thresholds employed by classical methods may not reflect biologically relevant criteria. Application of our analyses to composition-driven processes, such as the formation of membraneless organelles, reveals distinct composition profiles even for closely related organelles. Collectively, these results provide a unique perspective and detailed insights into relationships between amino acid composition, protein metabolism, and protein functions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/x3TzhcTkcXI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A model of cortical cognitive function using hierarchical interactions of gating matrices in internal agents coding relational representations. (arXiv:1809.08203v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08203</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08203</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Flexible cognition requires the ability to rapidly detect systematic
functions of variables and guide future behavior based on predictions. The
model described here proposes a potential framework for patterns of neural
activity to detect systematic functions and relations between components of
sensory input and apply them in a predictive manner. This model includes
multiple internal gating agents that operate within the state space of neural
activity, in analogy to external agents behaving in the external environment.
The multiple internal gating agents represent patterns of neural activity that
detect and gate patterns of matrix connectivity representing the relations
between different neural populations. The patterns of gating matrix
connectivity represent functions that can be used to predict future components
of a series of sensory inputs or the relationship between different features of
a static sensory stimulus. The model is applied to the prediction of dynamical
trajectories, the internal relationship between features of different sensory
stimuli and to the prediction of affine transformations that could be useful
for solving cognitive tasks such as the Ravens progressive matrices task.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Stochasticity from function - why the Bayesian brain may need no noise. (arXiv:1809.08045v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08045</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08045</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;An increasing body of evidence suggests that the trial-to-trial variability
of spiking activity in the brain is not mere noise, but rather the reflection
of a sampling-based encoding scheme for probabilistic computing. Since the
precise statistical properties of neural activity are important in this
context, many models assume an ad-hoc source of well-behaved, explicit noise,
either on the input or on the output side of single neuron dynamics, most often
assuming an independent Poisson process in either case. However, these
assumptions are somewhat problematic: neighboring neurons tend to share
receptive fields, rendering both their input and their output correlated; at
the same time, neurons are known to behave largely deterministically, as a
function of their membrane potential and conductance. We suggest that spiking
neural networks may, in fact, have no need for noise to perform sampling-based
Bayesian inference. We study analytically the effect of auto- and
cross-correlations in functionally Bayesian spiking networks and demonstrate
how their effect translates to synaptic interaction strengths, rendering them
controllable through synaptic plasticity. This allows even small ensembles of
interconnected deterministic spiking networks to simultaneously and
co-dependently shape their output activity through learning, enabling them to
perform complex Bayesian computation without any need for noise, which we
demonstrate in silico, both in classical simulation and in neuromorphic
emulation. These results close a gap between the abstract models and the
biology of functionally Bayesian spiking networks, effectively reducing the
architectural constraints imposed on physical neural substrates required to
perform probabilistic computing, be they biological or artificial.

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Generation of a versatile BiFC ORFeome library for analyzing protein-protein interactions in live Drosophila</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38853</link>
	<description>Transcription factors achieve specificity by establishing intricate interaction networks that will change depending on the cell context. Capturing these interactions in live condition is however a challenging issue that requires sensitive and non-invasive methods. We present a set of fly lines, called 'multicolor BiFC library', which covers most of the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; transcription factors for performing Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC). The multicolor BiFC library can be used to probe two different binary interactions simultaneously and is compatible for large-scale interaction screens. The library can also be coupled with established &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; genetic resources to analyze interactions in the developmentally relevant expression domain of each protein partner. We provide proof of principle experiments of these various applications, using Hox proteins in the live &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; embryo as a case study. Overall this novel collection of ready-to-use fly lines constitutes an unprecedented genetic toolbox for the identification and analysis of protein-protein interactions &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Human VMPFC encodes early signatures of confidence in perceptual decisions</title>

	<description>Choice confidence, an individual's internal estimate of judgment accuracy, plays a critical role in adaptive behaviour, yet its neural representations during decision formation remain underexplored. Here, we recorded simultaneous EEG-fMRI while participants performed a direction discrimination task and rated their confidence on each trial. Using multivariate single-trial discriminant analysis of the EEG, we identified a stimulus-independent component encoding confidence, which appeared prior to subjects' choice and explicit confidence report, and was consistent with a confidence measure predicted by an accumulation-to-bound model of decision-making. Importantly, trial-to-trial variability in this electrophysiologically-derived confidence signal was uniquely associated with fMRI responses in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), a region not typically associated with confidence for perceptual decisions. Furthermore, activity in the VMPFC was functionally coupled with regions of the frontal cortex linked to perceptual decision-making and metacognition. Our results suggest the VMPFC holds an early confidence representation arising from decision dynamics, preceding and potentially informing metacognitive evaluation.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Expression of Transcripts Selective for GABA Neuron Subpopulations across the Cortical Visuospatial Working Memory Network in the Healthy State and Schizophrenia</title>

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy227/5106159?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Visuospatial working memory (WM), which is impaired in schizophrenia, depends on a distributed network including visual, posterior parietal, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortical regions. Within each region, information processing is differentially regulated by subsets of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons that express parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SST), or vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). In schizophrenia, WM impairments have been associated with alterations of PV and SST neurons in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Here, we quantified transcripts selectively expressed in GABA neuron subsets across four cortical regions in the WM network from comparison and schizophrenia subjects. In comparison subjects, PV mRNA levels declined and SST mRNA levels increased from posterior to anterior regions, whereas VIP mRNA levels were comparable across regions except for the primary visual cortex (V1). In schizophrenia subjects, each transcript in PV and SST neurons exhibited similar alterations across all regions, whereas transcripts in VIP neurons were unaltered in any region except for V1. These findings suggest that the contribution of each GABA neuron subset to inhibitory regulation of local circuitry normally differs across cortical regions of the visuospatial WM network and that in schizophrenia alterations of PV and SST neurons are a shared feature across these regions, whereas VIP neurons are affected only in V1.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Although less well appreciated, many other types of cells also send out similar finger-like projections. Indeed, unlike neuronal specific phenomena such as synapse formation or synaptic transmission, an important issue for thought is that this critical long-standing question of how a cellular process like an axon or dendrite forms and extends is not primarily a neuroscience problem but a cell biological problem. In that case, the use of simple cellular processes — such as the bristle cell process of Drosophila — can aid in the fight to answer these critical questions. Specifically, determining how a model cellular process is generated can provide a framework for manipulations of all types of membranous process-containing cells, including different types of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Condition-adaptive fused graphical lasso (CFGL): An adaptive procedure for inferring condition-specific gene co-expression network</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006436</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Yafei Lyu, Lingzhou Xue, Feipeng Zhang, Hillary Koch, Laura Saba, Katerina Kechris, Qunhua Li&lt;/p&gt;

Co-expression network analysis provides useful information for studying gene regulation in biological processes. Examining condition-specific patterns of co-expression can provide insights into the underlying cellular processes activated in a particular condition. One challenge in this type of analysis is that the sample sizes in each condition are usually small, making the statistical inference of co-expression patterns highly underpowered. A joint network construction that borrows information from related structures across conditions has the potential to improve the power of the analysis. One possible approach to constructing the co-expression network is to use the Gaussian graphical model. Though several methods are available for joint estimation of multiple graphical models, they do not fully account for the heterogeneity between samples and between co-expression patterns introduced by condition specificity. Here we develop the condition-adaptive fused graphical lasso (CFGL), a data-driven approach to incorporate condition specificity in the estimation of co-expression networks. We show that this method improves the accuracy with which networks are learned. The application of this method on a rat multi-tissue dataset and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer dataset provides interesting biological insights. In both analyses, we identify numerous modules enriched for Gene Ontology functions and observe that the modules that are upregulated in a particular condition are often involved in condition-specific activities. Interestingly, we observe that the genes strongly associated with survival time in the TCGA dataset are less likely to be network hubs, suggesting that genes associated with cancer progression are likely to govern specific functions or execute final biological functions in pathways, rather than regulating a large number of biological processes. Additionally, we observed that the tumor-specific hub genes tend to have few shared edges with normal tissue, revealing tumor-specific regulatory mechanism.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sYsvXJw3a1s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Cocaine Exposure Modulates Perineuronal Nets and Synaptic Excitability of Fast-spiking Interneurons in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0221-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;We previously reported that perineuronal nets (PNNs) are required for cocaine-associated memories. Perineuronal nets are extracellular matrix that primarily surrounds parvalbumin (PV)-containing, GABAergic fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Here we measured the impact of acute (1 day) or repeated (5 days) cocaine exposure on PNNs and PV cells within the prelimbic and infralimbic regions of the mPFC. Adult rats were exposed to 1 day or 5 days of cocaine and stained for PNNs (using &lt;i&gt;Wisteria floribunda&lt;/i&gt; agglutinin, WFA) and PV intensity 2 h or 24 h later. In the prelimbic and infralimbic PFC, PNN staining intensity decreased 2 hr after 1 day of cocaine but increased after 5 days of cocaine. Cocaine also produced changes in PV intensity, which generally lagged behind that of PNNs. In the prelimbic PFC, both 1 and 5 days of cocaine increased GAD65/67 puncta near PNN-surrounded PV cells, with an increase in the ratio of GAD65/67:VGluT1 puncta after 5 days of cocaine exposure. In the prelimbic PFC, slice electrophysiology studies in FSIs surrounded by PNNs revealed that both 1 and 5 days of cocaine reduced the number of action potentials 2 h later. Synaptic changes demonstrated that 5 d cocaine increased inhibition of FSIs, potentially reducing the inhibition of pyramidal neurons and contributing to their hyperexcitability during relapse behavior. These early and rapid responses to cocaine may alter network stability of PV FSIs that partially mediate the persistent and chronic nature of drug addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Parvalbumin-containing, FSIs control the inhibitory:excitatory balance in the adult CNS, and the majority of these are surrounded by PNNs. The mPFC is critical to relapse in cocaine addiction, yet few studies have focused on the impact of cocaine exposure on PV interneurons that profoundly control output of the mPFC. Our studies highlight the impact of cocaine on PV and PNN levels and intrinsic and synaptic properties of PNN-surrounded FSIs in the mPFC. These findings point to a key upstream mechanism by which FSIs may contribute to the consistently observed increase in mPFC excitatory output of pyramidal neurons that contribute to cocaine reinstatement, and they have broader implications for understanding how PNN-surrounded neurons may control aberrant learning processes involved in addiction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Systematic analysis of transmitter co-expression reveals organizing principles of local interneuron heterogeneity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0212-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Broad neuronal classes are surprisingly heterogeneous across many parameters and sub-classes often exhibit partially overlapping traits including transmitter co-expression. However, the extent to which transmitter co-expression occurs in predictable, consistent patterns is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that pairwise co-expression of GABA and multiple neuropeptide families by olfactory local interneurons (LNs) of the moth &lt;i&gt;Manduca sexta&lt;/i&gt; is highly heterogeneous, with a single LN capable of expressing neuropeptides from at least four peptide families and few instances in which neuropeptides are consistently co-expressed. Using computational modeling, we demonstrate that observed co-expression patterns cannot be explained by independent probabilities of expression of each neuropeptide. Our analyses point to three organizing principles that once taken into consideration allow replication of overall co-expression structure: 1- peptidergic neurons are highly likely to -co-express GABA; 2- expression probability of Allatotropin depends upon Myoinhibitory peptide expression; 3- the all-or-none co-expression patterns of Tachykinin neurons with several other neuropeptides. For other peptide pairs, the presence of one peptide was not predictive of the presence of the other and co-expression probability could be replicated by independent probabilities. The stochastic nature of these co-expression patterns highlights the heterogeneity of transmitter content among LNs and argues against clear-cut definition of subpopulation types based on the presence of &lt;i&gt;single&lt;/i&gt; neuropeptides. Furthermore, the receptors for all neuropeptides and GABA were expressed within each population of principal neuron type in the AL. Thus, activation of any given LN results in a dynamic cocktail of modulators that have the potential to influence every level of olfactory processing within the AL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Understanding the functional roles of individual local interneurons (LNs) is complex because traits, like transmitter co-expression, are often partially overlapping across the population. Here, we find that single olfactory LNs co-express neuropeptides from at least four individual peptide families, and that GABA and neuropeptides are partially and heterogeneously co-expressed across the entire population. The stochastic nature of many observed co-expression patterns argues against clear-cut and exclusive definition of subpopulations based on the expression of &lt;i&gt;single&lt;/i&gt; neuropeptides. Overall, our results suggest that activation of any given LN causes the release of a variable combination of neuropeptides and GABA that, based on receptor expression, target the input, output and local processing stages of the olfactory coding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The unreasonable effectiveness of small neural ensembles in high-dimensional brain. (arXiv:1809.07656v1 [cs.AI])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07656</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07656</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite the widely-spread consensus on the brain complexity, sprouts of the
single neuron revolution emerged in neuroscience in the 1970s. They brought
many unexpected discoveries, including grandmother or concept cells and sparse
coding of information in the brain.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In machine learning for a long time, the famous curse of dimensionality
seemed to be an unsolvable problem. Nevertheless, the idea of the blessing of
dimensionality becomes gradually more and more popular. Ensembles of
non-interacting or weakly interacting simple units prove to be an effective
tool for solving essentially multidimensional problems. This approach is
especially useful for one-shot (non-iterative) correction of errors in large
legacy artificial intelligence systems.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These simplicity revolutions in the era of complexity have deep fundamental
reasons grounded in geometry of multidimensional data spaces. To explore and
understand these reasons we revisit the background ideas of statistical
physics. In the course of the 20th century they were developed into the
concentration of measure theory. New stochastic separation theorems reveal the
fine structure of the data clouds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We review and analyse biological, physical, and mathematical problems at the
core of the fundamental question: how can high-dimensional brain organise
reliable and fast learning in high-dimensional world of data by simple tools?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two critical applications are reviewed to exemplify the approach: one-shot
correction of errors in intellectual systems and emergence of static and
associative memories in ensembles of single neurons.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Dynamic Adaptive Computation: Tuning network states to task requirements. (arXiv:1809.07550v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07550</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07550</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural circuits are able to perform computations under very diverse
conditions and requirements. The required computations impose clear constraints
on their fine-tuning: a rapid and maximally informative response to stimuli in
general requires decorrelated baseline neural activity. Such network dynamics
is known as asynchronous-irregular. In contrast, spatio-temporal integration of
information requires maintenance and transfer of stimulus information over
extended time periods. This can be realized at criticality, a phase transition
where correlations, sensitivity and integration time diverge. Being able to
flexibly switch, or even combine the above properties in a task-dependent
manner would present a clear functional advantage. We propose that cortex
operates in a &quot;reverberating regime&quot; because it is particularly favorable for
ready adaptation of computational properties to context and task. This
reverberating regime enables cortical networks to interpolate between the
asynchronous-irregular and the critical state by small changes in effective
synaptic strength or excitation-inhibition ratio. These changes directly adapt
computational properties, including sensitivity, amplification, integration
time and correlation length within the local network. We review recent
converging evidence that cortex in vivo operates in the reverberating regime,
and that various cortical areas have adapted their integration times to
processing requirements. In addition, we propose that neuromodulation enables a
fine-tuning of the network, so that local circuits can either decorrelate or
integrate, and quench or maintain their input depending on task. We argue that
this task-dependent tuning, which we call &quot;dynamic adaptive computation&quot;,
presents a central organization principle of cortical networks and discuss
first experimental evidence.

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Concerted IL-25R and IL-4Rα signaling drive innate type 2 effector immunity for optimal helminth expulsion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.38269</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38269</link>
	<description>Interleukin 25 (IL-25) is a major 'alarmin' cytokine, capable of initiating and amplifying the type 2 immune response to helminth parasites. However its role in the later effector phase of clearing chronic infection remains unclear. The helminth &lt;i&gt;Heligmosomoides polygyrus&lt;/i&gt; establishes long-term infections in susceptible C57BL/6 mice, but is slowly expelled in BALB/c mice from day 14 onwards. We noted that IL-25R (&lt;i&gt;Il17rb&lt;/i&gt;)-deficient BALB/c mice were unable to expel parasites despite type 2 immune activation comparable to the wild-type. We then established that in C57BL/6 mice, IL-25 adminstered late in infection (days 14-17) drove immunity. Moreover when IL-25 and IL-4 were delivered to &lt;i&gt;Rag1&lt;/i&gt;-deficient mice, the combination resulted in near complete expulsion of the parasite, even following administration of an anti-CD90 antibody to deplete innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). Hence, effective anti-helminth immunity during chronic infection requires an innate effector cell population that is synergistically activated by the combination of IL-4Rα and IL-25R signaling.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/35316</link>
	<description>Hypoxia and ischemia are linked to oxidative stress, which can activate the oxidant-sensitive transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) channel in cerebral artery endothelial cells, leading to vasodilation. We hypothesized that TRPA1 channels in endothelial cells are activated by hypoxia-derived reactive oxygen species, leading to cerebral artery dilation and reduced ischemic damage. Using isolated cerebral arteries expressing a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; biosensor in endothelial cells, we show that 4-hydroxynonenal and hypoxia increased TRPA1 activity, detected as TRPA1 sparklets. TRPA1 activity during hypoxia was blocked by antioxidants and by TRPA1 antagonism. Hypoxia caused dilation of cerebral arteries, which was disrupted by antioxidants, TRPA1 blockade and by endothelial cell-specific &lt;i&gt;Trpa1&lt;/i&gt; deletion (&lt;i&gt;Trpa1 &lt;/i&gt;ecKO mice). Loss of TRPA1 channels in endothelial cells increased cerebral infarcts, whereas TRPA1 activation with cinnamaldehyde reduced infarct in wildtype, but not &lt;i&gt;Trpa1 &lt;/i&gt;ecKO, mice. These data suggest that endothelial TRPA1 channels are sensors of hypoxia leading to vasodilation, thereby reducing ischemic damage.</description>

One of the marvels of biology is the phenotypic plasticity of microorganisms. It allows them to maintain high growth rates across conditions. Studies suggest that cells can express metabolic enzymes at tuned concentrations through adjustment of gene expression. The associated transcription factors are often regulated by intracellular metabolites. Here we study metabolite-mediated regulation of metabolic-gene expression that maximises metabolic fluxes across conditions. We developed an adaptive control theory, &lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt;ORAC (for ‘Specific Flux (q) Optimization by Robust Adaptive Control’), and illustrate it with several examples of metabolic pathways. The key feature of the theory is that it does not require knowledge of the regulatory network, only of the metabolic part. We derive that maximal metabolic flux can be maintained in the face of varying &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; environmental parameters only if the number of transcription-factor binding metabolites is at least equal to &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. The controlling circuits appear to require simple biochemical kinetics. We conclude that microorganisms likely can achieve maximal rates in metabolic pathways, in the face of environmental changes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xhqkoxj5QT8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Transition state characteristics during cell differentiation</title>

Models describing the process of stem-cell differentiation are plentiful, and may offer insights into the underlying mechanisms and experimentally observed behaviour. Waddington’s epigenetic landscape has been providing a conceptual framework for differentiation processes since its inception. It also allows, however, for detailed mathematical and quantitative analyses, as the landscape can, at least in principle, be related to mathematical models of dynamical systems. Here we focus on a set of dynamical systems features that are intimately linked to cell differentiation, by considering exemplar dynamical models that capture important aspects of stem cell differentiation dynamics. These models allow us to map the paths that cells take through gene expression space as they move from one fate to another, e.g. from a stem-cell to a more specialized cell type. Our analysis highlights the role of the transition state (TS) that separates distinct cell fates, and how the nature of the TS changes as the underlying landscape changes—change that can be induced by e.g. cellular signaling. We demonstrate that models for stem cell differentiation may be interpreted in terms of either a static or transitory landscape. For the static case the TS represents a particular transcriptional profile that all cells approach during differentiation. Alternatively, the TS may refer to the commonly observed period of heterogeneity as cells undergo stochastic transitions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/US819jwYZK0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Intrinsic plasticity is expressed in virtually all neuronal types including principal cells and interneurons. Activation of synaptic glutamate receptors initiates long-lasting changes in neuronal excitability at presynaptic and postsynaptic side. As synaptic plasticity, intrinsic plasticity is bi-directional and expresses a certain level of input-specificity or cell-specificity. We discuss here the nature of the learning rules shared by intrinsic and synaptic plasticity and the impact of intrinsic plasticity on temporal processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Testing Selective Influence Directly Using Trackball Movement Tasks. (arXiv:1809.06899v1 [stat.AP])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06899</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Systems factorial technology (SFT; Townsend &amp;amp; Nozawa, 1995) is regarded as a
useful tool to diagnose if features (or dimensions) of the investigated
stimulus are processed in a parallel or serial fashion. In order to use SFT,
one has to assume the speed to process each feature is influenced by that
feature only, termed as selective influence (Sternberg, 1969). This assumption
is usually untestable as the processing time for a stimulus feature is not
observable. Stochastic dominance is traditionally used as an indirect evidence
for selective influence (e.g., Townsend &amp;amp; Fifi\'c, 2004). However, one should
keep in mind that selective influence may be violated even when stochastic
dominance holds. The current study proposes a trackball movement paradigm for a
direct test of selective influence. The participants were shown a reference
stimulus and a test stimulus simultaneously on a computer screen. They were
asked to use the trackball to adjust the test stimulus until it appeared to
match the position or shape of the reference stimulus. We recorded the reaction
time, the parameters defined the reference stimulus (denoted as \alpha and
\beta ), and the parameters defined the test stimulus (denoted as A and B). We
tested selective influence of \alpha and \beta on the amount of time to adjust
A and B through testing selective influence of \alpha and \beta on the values
of A and B using the linear feasibility test (Dzhafarov &amp;amp; Kujala, 2010). We
found that when the test was passed and stochastic dominance held, the inferred
architecture was as expected, which was further confirmed by the trajectory of
A and B observed in each trial. However, with stochastic dominance only SFT can
suggest a prohibited architecture. Our results indicate the proposed method is
more reliable for testing selective influence on the processing speed than
examining stochastic dominance only.

The attenuation of either maintenance or plasticity leads to impaired circuit function and ultimately to neurodegenerative disorders. Over the last few years, significant discoveries of molecular mechanisms were made that mediate the formation and maintenance of axons. Here, we highlight intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms that ensure the health and survival of axons. We also briefly discuss examples of mutations associated with impaired axonal maintenance identified in specific neurological conditions. A better understanding of these mechanisms will therefore help to define targets for therapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Distinctive Structural and Molecular Features of Myelinated Inhibitory Axons in Human Neocortex</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Numerous types of inhibitory neurons sculpt the performance of human neocortical circuits, with each type exhibiting a constellation of subcellular phenotypic features in support of its specialized functions. Axonal myelination has been absent among the characteristics used to distinguish inhibitory neuron types; in fact, very little is known about myelinated inhibitory axons in human neocortex. Here, using array tomography to analyze samples of neurosurgically excised human neocortex, we show that inhibitory myelinated axons originate predominantly from parvalbumin-containing interneurons. Compared to myelinated excitatory axons, they have higher neurofilament and lower microtubule content, shorter nodes of Ranvier, and more myelin basic protein in their myelin sheath. Furthermore, these inhibitory axons have more mitochondria, likely to sustain the high energy demands of parvalbumin interneurons, as well as more 2’,3’-cyclic nucleotide 3’-phosphodiesterase, a protein enriched in the myelin cytoplasmic channels that are thought to facilitate the delivery of nutrients from ensheathing oligodendrocytes. Our results demonstrate that myelinated axons of parvalbumin inhibitory interneurons exhibit distinctive features that may support the specialized functions of this neuron type in human neocortical circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Numerous myelinated axons traverse the human neocortex, enabling fast and efficient signal transmission. Myelinated axons originate from both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, but their properties have rarely been studied in relation to parent neuron type. Here, we show that axons of inhibitory neurons have distinctive structural and molecular features that contrast with those of the majority of excitatory myelinated axons in human neocortex. These differences are likely to have important implications for neurological disorders that involve pathologies of myelinated axons. For example, the distinct molecular and structural organization of inhibitory and excitatory myelinated axons may underlie differences in their vulnerability in neurological disorders or to injuries, and may require different strategies for prevention and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Sniffing fast: paradoxical effects on odor concentration discrimination at the levels of olfactory bulb output and behavior</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0148-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;In awake mice, sniffing behavior is subject to complex contextual modulation. It has been hypothesized that variance in inhalation dynamics alters odor concentration profiles in the naris despite a constant environmental concentration. Using whole cell recordings in the olfactory bulb of awake mice, we directly demonstrate that rapid sniffing mimics the effect of odor concentration increase at the level of both mitral and tufted cell (MTC) firing rate responses and temporal responses. Paradoxically, we find that mice are capable of discriminating fine concentration differences within short timescales despite highly variable sniffing behavior. One way that the olfactory system could differentiate between a change in sniffing and a change in concentration would be to receive information about the inhalation parameters in parallel with information about the odor. We find that the sniff-driven activity of MTCs without odor input is informative of the kind of inhalation that just occurred, allowing rapid detection of a change in inhalation. Thus, a possible reason for sniff modulation of the early olfactory system may be to directly inform downstream centres of nasal flow dynamics, so that an inference can be made about environmental concentration independent of sniff variance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; One of the fundamental tasks of the brain is to represent the features of the environment in a stable way. In the olfactory system, it has been hypothesized that changing the way you sniff will alter the concentration of odor coming into the nasal passage, even though the environmental concentration has not changed. Here we show that indeed, the effect of faster sniffing on olfactory bulb responses is very similar to increasing odor concentration. Despite this, mice can easily tell the difference between a change in sniffing and a change in concentration in an olfactory task. To resolve this apparent discrepancy, we suggest and give evidence for ways in which olfactory bulb information about sniffing parameters may be utilised.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Morphological and Biophysical Determinants of the Intracellular and Extracellular Waveforms in Nigral Dopaminergic Neurons: A Computational Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/38/8295?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/38/8295?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Action potentials (APs) in nigral dopaminergic neurons often exhibit two separate components: the first reflecting spike initiation in the dendritically located axon initial segment (AIS) and the second the subsequent dendro-somatic spike. These components are separated by a &lt;i&gt;notch&lt;/i&gt; in the ascending phase of the somatic extracellular waveform and in the temporal derivative of the somatic intracellular waveform. Still, considerable variability exists in the presence and magnitude of the &lt;i&gt;notch&lt;/i&gt; across neurons. To systematically address the contribution of AIS, dendritic and somatic compartments to shaping the two-component APs, we modeled APs of previously &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiologically characterized and 3D-reconstructed male mouse and rat dopaminergic neurons. A parsimonious two-domain model, with high (AIS) and lower (dendro-somatic) Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductance, reproduced the notch in the temporal derivatives, but not in the extracellular APs, regardless of morphology. The notch was only revealed when somatic active currents were reduced, constraining the model to three domains. Thus, an initial AIS spike is followed by an actively generated spike by the axon-bearing dendrite (ABD), in turn followed mostly passively by the soma. The transition from being a source compartment for the AIS spike to a source compartment for the ABD spike satisfactorily explains the extracellular somatic notch. Larger AISs and thinner ABD (but not soma-to-AIS distance) accentuate the AIS component. We conclude that variability in AIS size and ABD caliber explains variability in AP extracellular waveform and separation of AIS and dendro-somatic components, given the presence of at least three functional domains with distinct excitability characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Midbrain dopamine neurons make an important contribution to circuits mediating motivation and movement. Understanding the basic rules that govern the electrical activity of single dopaminergic neurons is therefore essential to reveal how they ultimately contribute to movement and motivation as well as what goes wrong in associated disorders. Our computational study focuses on the generation and propagation of action potentials and shows that different morphologies and excitability characteristics of the cell body, dendrites and proximal axon can explain the diversity of action potentials shapes in this population. These compartments likely make differential contributions both to normal dopaminergic signaling and could potentially underlie pathological dopaminergic signaling implicated in addiction, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and other disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Dynamics of biomolecular assemblies offer invaluable insights into their functional mechanisms. For extremely large biomolecular systems, such as HIV-1 capsid that has nearly 5 millions atoms, obtaining its normal mode dynamics using even coarse-grained models can be a challenging task. In this work, we have successfully carried out a normal mode analysis of an entire HIV-1 capsid in full all-atom details. This is made possible through our newly developed BOSE (Block of Selected Elasticity) model that is founded on the principle of resonance discovered in our recent work. The resonance principle makes it possible to most efficiently compute the vibrations of a whole capsid at any given frequency by projecting the motions of component capsomeres into a narrow subspace. We have conducted also assessments of the quality of the BOSE modes by comparing them with benchmark modes obtained directly from the original Hessian matrix. Our all-atom normal mode dynamics study of the HIV-1 capsid reveals the dynamic role of the pentamers in stabilizing the capsid structure and is in agreement with experimental findings that suggest capsid disassembly and uncoating start when the pentamers become destabilized. Our results on the dynamics of hexamer pores suggest that nucleotide transport should take place mostly at hexamers near pentamers, especially at the larger hemispherical end.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6rrbmtVPD1U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Robust spatial memory maps encoded by networks with transient connections</title>

The spiking activity of principal cells in mammalian hippocampus encodes an internalized neuronal representation of the ambient space—a cognitive map. Once learned, such a map enables the animal to navigate a given environment for a long period. However, the neuronal substrate that produces this map is transient: the synaptic connections in the hippocampus and in the downstream neuronal networks never cease to form and to deteriorate at a rapid rate. How can the brain maintain a robust, reliable representation of space using a network that constantly changes its architecture? We address this question using a computational framework that allows evaluating the effect produced by the decaying connections between simulated hippocampal neurons on the properties of the cognitive map. Using novel Algebraic Topology techniques, we demonstrate that emergence of stable cognitive maps produced by networks with transient architectures is a generic phenomenon. The model also points out that deterioration of the cognitive map caused by weakening or lost connections between neurons may be compensated by simulating the neuronal activity. Lastly, the model explicates the importance of the complementary learning systems for processing spatial information at different levels of spatiotemporal granularity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gbbOgT7E6ek&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Despite significant progress in understanding cocaine-induced plasticity, an effective treatment of cocaine addiction is lacking. Chronic cocaine potentiates excitatory and alters inhibitory transmission to dopamine neurons, induces dopamine neuron hyperexcitability, and reduces dopamine release in projection areas. Understanding how intrinsic and synaptic plasticity interact to control dopamine neuron firing and dopamine release could prove useful in the development of new therapeutics. In this review, we examine recent literature discussing cocaine-induced plasticity in the VTA and highlight potential therapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Automatic Cell Segmentation by Adaptive Thresholding (ACSAT) for Large-Scale Calcium Imaging Datasets</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Advances in calcium imaging have made it possible to record from an increasingly larger number of neurons simultaneously. Neuroscientists can now routinely image hundreds to thousands of individual neurons. An emerging technical challenge that parallels the advancement in imaging a large number of individual neurons is the processing of correspondingly large datasets. One important step is the identification of individual neurons. Traditional methods rely mainly on manual or semimanual inspection, which cannot be scaled for processing large datasets. To address this challenge, we focused on developing an automated segmentation method, which we refer to as automated cell segmentation by adaptive thresholding (ACSAT). ACSAT works with a time-collapsed image and includes an iterative procedure that automatically calculates global and local threshold values during successive iterations based on the distribution of image pixel intensities. Thus, the algorithm is capable of handling variations in morphological details and in fluorescence intensities in different calcium imaging datasets. In this paper, we demonstrate the utility of ACSAT by testing it on 500 simulated datasets, two wide-field hippocampus datasets, a wide-field striatum dataset, a wide-field cell culture dataset, and a two-photon hippocampus dataset. For the simulated datasets with truth, ACSAT achieved &amp;gt;80% recall and precision when the signal-to-noise ratio was no less than ~24 dB.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The capacity to learn abstract concepts such as ‘sameness’ and ‘difference’ is considered a higher-order cognitive function, typically thought to be dependent on top-down neocortical processing. It is therefore surprising that honey bees apparantly have this capacity. Here we report a model of the structures of the honey bee brain that can learn sameness and difference, as well as a range of complex and simple associative learning tasks. Our model is constrained by the known connections and properties of the mushroom body, including the protocerebral tract, and provides a good fit to the learning rates and performances of real bees in all tasks, including learning sameness and difference. The model proposes a novel mechanism for learning the abstract concepts of ‘sameness’ and ‘difference’ that is compatible with the insect brain, and is not dependent on top-down or executive control processing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HFdx2Lid-Jk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Evolutionary footprint of epistasis</title>

Variation of an inherited trait across a population cannot be explained by additive contributions of relevant genes, due to epigenetic effects and biochemical interactions (epistasis). Detecting epistasis in genomic data still represents a significant challenge that requires a better understanding of epistasis from the mechanistic point of view. Using a standard Wright-Fisher model of bi-allelic asexual population, we study how compensatory epistasis affects the process of adaptation. The main result is a universal relationship between four haplotype frequencies of a single site pair in a genome, which depends only on the epistasis strength of the pair defined regarding Darwinian fitness. We demonstrate the existence, at any time point, of a quasi-equilibrium between epistasis and disorder (entropy) caused by random genetic drift and mutation. We verify the accuracy of these analytic results by Monte-Carlo simulation over a broad range of parameters, including the topology of the interacting network. Thus, epistasis assists the evolutionary transit through evolutionary hurdles leaving marks at the level of haplotype disequilibrium. The method allows determining selection coefficient for each site and the epistasis strength of each pair from a sequence set. The resulting ability to detect clusters of deleterious mutation close to full compensation is essential for biomedical applications. These findings help to understand the role of epistasis in multiple compensatory mutations in viral resistance to antivirals and immune response.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Uu1bJnHITJI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Every neuron is part of a network, exerting its function by transforming multiple spatiotemporal synaptic input patterns into a single spiking output. This function is specified by the particular shape and passive electrical properties of the neuronal membrane, and the composition and spatial distribution of ion channels across its processes. For a variety of physiological or pathological reasons, the intrinsic input/output function may change during a neuron’s lifetime. This process results in high variability in the peak specific conductance of ion channels in individual neurons. The mechanisms responsible for this variability are not well understood, although there are clear indications from experiments and modeling that degeneracy and correlation among multiple channels may be involved. Here, we studied this issue in biophysical models of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons and interneurons. Using a unified data-driven simulation workflow and starting from a set of experimental recordings and morphological reconstructions obtained from rats, we built and analyzed several ensembles of morphologically and biophysically accurate single cell models with intrinsic electrophysiological properties consistent with experimental findings. The results suggest that the set of conductances expressed in any given hippocampal neuron may be considered as belonging to two groups: one subset is responsible for the major characteristics of the firing behavior in each population and the other is responsible for a robust degeneracy. Analysis of the model neurons suggests several experimentally testable predictions related to the combination and relative proportion of the different conductances that should be expressed on the membrane of different types of neurons for them to fulfill their role in the hippocampus circuitry.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mPhNfP2JTzg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Filamentous actin (F-actin) and non-muscle myosin II motors drive cell motility and cell shape changes that guide large scale tissue movements during embryonic morphogenesis. To gain a better understanding of the role of actomyosin &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, we have developed a two-dimensional (2D) computational model to study emergent phenomena of dynamic unbranched actomyosin arrays in the cell cortex. These phenomena include actomyosin punctuated contractions, or &quot;actin asters&quot; that form within quiescent F-actin networks. Punctuated contractions involve both formation of high intensity aster-like structures and disassembly of those same structures. Our 2D model allows us to explore the kinematics of filament polarity sorting, segregation of motors, and morphology of F-actin arrays that emerge as the model structure and biophysical properties are varied. Our model demonstrates the complex, emergent feedback between filament reorganization and motor transport that generate as well as disassemble actin asters. Since intracellular actomyosin dynamics are thought to be controlled by localization of scaffold proteins that bind F-actin or their myosin motors we also apply our 2D model to recapitulate &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies that have revealed complex patterns of actomyosin that assemble from patterning filaments and motor complexes with microcontact printing. Although we use a minimal representation of filament, motor, and cross-linker biophysics, our model establishes a framework for investigating the role of other actin binding proteins, how they might alter actomyosin dynamics, and makes predictions that can be tested experimentally within live cells as well as within &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dg13yks3NAs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

While the neurobiology of simple and habitual choices is relatively well known, our current understanding of goal-directed choices and planning in the brain is still limited. Theoretical work suggests that goal-directed computations can be productively associated to model-based (reinforcement learning) computations, yet a detailed mapping between computational processes and neuronal circuits remains to be fully established. Here we report a computational analysis that aligns Bayesian nonparametrics and model-based reinforcement learning (MB-RL) to the functioning of the hippocampus (HC) and the ventral striatum (vStr)–a neuronal circuit that increasingly recognized to be an appropriate model system to understand goal-directed (spatial) decisions and planning mechanisms in the brain. We test the MB-RL agent in a contextual conditioning task that depends on intact hippocampus and ventral striatal (shell) function and show that it solves the task while showing key behavioral and neuronal signatures of the HC—vStr circuit. Our simulations also explore the benefits of biological forms of look-ahead prediction (forward sweeps) during both learning and control. This article thus contributes to fill the gap between our current understanding of computational algorithms and biological realizations of (model-based) reinforcement learning.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/g0hrusts6EA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus is integral to working and episodic memory, and is a central region of interest in diseases affecting these processes. Pig models are widely used in translational research, and may provide an excellent bridge between rodents and non-human primates for CNS disease models due to their gyrencephalic neuroanatomy and significant white matter composition. However, the laminar structure of the pig hippocampus has not been well characterized. Therefore, we histologically characterized the dorsal hippocampus of Yucatan miniature pigs and quantified the cytoarchitecture of the hippocampal layers. We then utilized stereotaxis combined with single unit electrophysiological mapping to precisely place multichannel laminar silicon probes into the dorsal hippocampus without the need for image guidance. We used &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiological recordings of simultaneous laminar field potentials and single unit activity in multiple layers of the dorsal hippocampus to physiologically identify and quantify these layers under anesthesia. Consistent with previous reports, we found the porcine hippocampus to have the expected archicortical laminar structure with some anatomical and histological features comparable to the rodent and others to the primate hippocampus. Importantly, we found these distinct features to be reflected in the laminar electrophysiology. This characterization, as well as our electrophysiology-based methodology targeting the porcine hippocampal lamina combined with high channel count silicon probes will allow for analysis of spike-field interactions during normal and disease states in both anesthetized and future awake behaving neurophysiology in this large animal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The hippocampus is central to working and episodic memory and is critically affected by diverse disease processes. In order to investigate hippocampal electrophysiology in translational large animal models, we developed an imaging-free stereotaxis and intraoperative electrophysiology methodology with custom silicon probes to precisely localize probe placement within the hippocampal laminar structure. We report for the first time the profile of single units and local field potentials in the pig dorsal hippocampus and relate them to a histological description. This characterization forms the basis for accessible translational pig models to study diseases of the central nervous system affecting hippocampal circuitry in the large animal gyrencephalic brain, as well as the groundwork for potential awake behaving neurophysiology of the porcine hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Dynamic and Sex-Specific Changes in Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Neuron Activity and Excitability in a Mouse Model of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Reproductive endocrine disorders are prominent co-morbidities of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in both men and women. The neural mechanisms underlying these co-morbidities remain unclear, but hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons may be involved. Here we report the first direct demonstrations of aberrant GnRH neuron function in an animal model of epilepsy. Recordings of GnRH neuron firing and excitability were made in acute mouse brain slices prepared 2 months after intrahippocampal injection of kainate (KA) or control saline, a well-established TLE model in which most females develop co-morbid estrous cycle disruption. GnRH neurons from control females showed elevated firing and excitability on estrus compared with diestrus. By contrast, cells from KA-injected females that developed prolonged, disrupted estrous cycles (KA-long) showed the reverse pattern. Firing rates of cells from KA-injected females that maintained regular cycles (KA-regular) were not different from controls on diestrus, but were reduced on estrus. In KA-injected males, only GnRH neurons in the medial septum displayed elevated firing. In contrast to the diestrus-vs.-estrus and sex-specific changes in firing, GnRH neuron intrinsic excitability was elevated in all KA-injected groups, indicating a role for afferent synaptic and neuromodulatory inputs in shaping overall changes in firing activity. Furthermore, KA-injected females showed cycle-stage-specific changes in circulating sex steroids on diestrus and estrus that also differed between KA-long and KA-regular groups. Together, these findings reveal that the effects of epilepsy on the neural control of reproduction are dynamic across the estrous cycle, distinct in association with co-morbid estrous cycle disruption severity, and sex-specific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; People with epilepsy are at higher risk of reproductive endocrine disorders compared with the general population, but the neural mechanisms linking epilepsy and these co-morbidities are unknown. Here we report changes in the function of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, which control fertility, in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. GnRH neurons from epileptic female mice showed changes in activity dependent on estrous cycle stage and associated with severity of cycle disruption. The impacts of epilepsy on GnRH neurons in males were less severe. These findings provide novel evidence for impacts of epilepsy on GnRH neuron function, and will thus be of clinical relevance in developing new strategies to ameliorate reproductive co-morbidities and to treat the underlying seizures and epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;A brain clock, constituted of ~20,000 peptidergically heterogeneous neurons, is located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). While many peptidergic cell types have been identified, little is known about the connections among these neurons in mice. We first sought to identify contacts among major peptidergic cell types in the SCN using triple-label fluorescent immunocytochemistry. To this end, contacts among vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), and calretinin (CALR) cells of the core, and arginine vasopressin (AVP) and met-enkephalin (ENK) cells of the shell were analyzed. Some core-to-shell and shell-to-core communications are specialized. We found that in wild-type mice, AVP fibers make extremely sparse contacts onto VIP neurons but contacts in the reverse direction are numerous. In contrast, AVP fibers make more contacts onto GRP neurons than conversely. For the other cell types tested, largely reciprocal connections are made. These results point to peptidergic cell type specific communications between core and shell SCN neurons. To further understand the impact of VIP-to-AVP communication, we next explored the SCN in VIP deficient mice (VIP-KO). In these animals, AVP expression is markedly reduced in the SCN, but it is not altered in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei. Surprisingly, in VIP-KO mice, the number of AVP appositions onto other peptidergic cell types is not different from controls. Colchicine administration, which blocks AVP transport, restored numbers of AVP neurons to that of wild-type littermates. The results indicate that VIP has an important role in modulating AVP expression levels in the SCN in this mouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement:&lt;/b&gt; The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) brain clock bears ~20,000 neurons of many peptidergic types. Numerous studies have focused broadly on the core- (VIP-rich) to shell (AVP-rich) areas, leaving aside questions of interconnections among specific peptidergic neuron types. Here we describe contacts between AVP, GRP, VIP, ENK, and CALR SCN peptidergic phenotypes in wild-type mice, and examine changes to these connections consequent to loss of the key core peptide, VIP. Thus, in the absence of VIP, expression of the shell peptide AVP was reduced. The work delineates interrelationships among specific SCN neurons and highlights a complexity in interpreting the consequences of single gene knockouts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Strategic and dynamic temporal weighting for perceptual decisions in humans and macaques</title>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Perceptual decision-making is often modeled as the accumulation of sensory evidence over time. Recent studies using psychophysical reverse correlation have shown that even though the sensory evidence is stationary over time, subjects may exhibit a time-varying weighting strategy, weighting some stimulus epochs more heavily than others. While previous work has explained time-varying weighting as a consequence of static decision mechanisms (e.g., decision bound or leak), here we show that time-varying weighting can reflect strategic adaptation to stimulus statistics, and thus can readily take a number of forms. We characterized the temporal weighting strategies of humans and macaques performing a motion discrimination task in which the amount of information carried by motion stimulus was manipulated over time. Both species could adapt their temporal weighting strategy to match the time-varying statistics of the sensory stimulus. When early stimulus epochs had higher mean motion strength than late, subjects adopted a pronounced early weighting strategy, where early information was weighted more heavily in guiding perceptual decisions. When the mean motion strength was greater in later stimulus epochs, in contrast, subjects shifted to a marked late-weighting strategy. These results demonstrate that perceptual decisions involve a temporally flexible weighting process in both humans and monkeys, and introduce a paradigm with which to manipulate sensory stimuli in decision-making tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; During decision-making, the weight assigned by subjects to sensory information over time is not necessarily constant. Such time-varying weighting is often interpreted as a signature of a particular decision-making model (e.g., higher weighting of early stimulus information is consistent with a bounded accumulation process). Temporal weighting may also result, however, from a strategic reweighting of the stimulus evidence itself that takes place before and/or independent of a decision-making mechanism. Here we use a psychophysical reverse correlation paradigm to both measure and manipulate temporal weighting behavior. We demonstrate that both humans and macaques adopt weighting strategies that are flexible, consistent with dynamic reweighing of the sensory stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Small GTP converting enzymes, GTPases, are essential for the efficient completion of many physiological and developmental processes. They are regulated by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). &lt;i&gt;Arhgap39&lt;/i&gt;, also known as preoptic regulatory factor-2 (Porf-2) or Vilse, a member of the Rho GAP group, was first identified in 1990 in the rat CNS. It has since been shown to regulate apoptosis, cell migration, neurogenesis and cerebral and hippocampal dendritic spine morphology. It plays a pivotal role in neurodevelopment and learning and memory. Homologous or orthologous genes are found in over 280 vertebrate and invertebrate species suggesting preservation through evolution. Not surprisingly, loss of the &lt;i&gt;Arhgap39/Porf-2&lt;/i&gt; gene in mice manifests as an embryonic lethal condition. Although &lt;i&gt;Arhgap39/Porf-2&lt;/i&gt; is highly expressed in the brain, it is also widely distributed throughout the body, with potential additional roles in oncogenesis and morphogenesis. This review summarizes, for the first time, the known information about this gene under its various names, in addition to considering its transcripts and proteins. The majority of findings described have been made in rats, mice, humans and fruit flies. This work surveys the known functions, functional mediators, variables modifying expression and upstream regulators of expression, and potential physiological and pathological roles of &lt;i&gt;Arhgap39/Porf-2&lt;/i&gt; in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This review comprehensively includes what is currently known about &lt;i&gt;Arhgap39/Porf-2&lt;/i&gt; under its multiple names. Arhgap39 is a critically required molecule for neurodevelopment, learning and memory that is expressed throughout the lifespan. It also has definitive roles in stem cell fate and cell migration, apoptosis and proliferation, in both neural and non-neural sites. Homologous or orthologous genes have been conserved for millennia through evolution with a wide phylogenetic distribution from invertebrates to mammals. Its expression is exquisitely regulated by age, sex, location and hormones. The consequences of dysregulation of &lt;i&gt;Arhgap39&lt;/i&gt; are currently under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Promoter-based genetic recombination (via, e.g., Cre-lox) is most useful when all cells of interest express a particular gene. The discovery that the actin-binding protein advillin is expressed in all somatic sensory neurons has been exploited repeatedly to drive DNA recombination therein, yet specificity of expression has not been well demonstrated. Here, we characterize advillin expression amongst sensory neurons and in several other neural and non-neural tissues. We first validate an advillin antibody against advillin knock-out tissue, advillin promoter-driven EGFP, and advillin mRNA expression. In the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), advillin is enriched in non-peptidergic nociceptors. We also show that advillin expression, and advillin promotor-driven EGFP and Cre-recombinase expression, occurs in multiple tissues including the dorsal habenula of the epithalamus, endocrine cells of the gut, Merkel cells in the skin, and most strikingly, throughout the autonomic nervous system (sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric neurons) in mice, rats, and non-human primates. In the mouse pelvic ganglion, advillin immunoreactivity is most intense in pairs of small neurons, and concentrated in spine-like structures on the axon initial segment contacted by sympathetic preganglionic axons. In autonomic targets (iris and blood vessels), advillin is distributed along cholinergic parasympathetic axons and in sympathetic varicosities. Developmentally, advillin expression is absent from sympathetics at postnatal day 4 but begins to emerge by day 7, accounting for previous reports (based on embryonic expression) of advillin’s specificity to sensory neurons. These results indicate that caution is warranted in interpreting previous studies in which advillin-driven genomic editing is either constitutive or performed after postnatal day 4.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: February 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 54&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Ilona C Grunwald Kadow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behaviors are often categorized into innate or learned. Innate behaviors are thought to be genetically encoded and hardwired into the brain, while learned behavior is a product of the interaction between experience and the plasticity of synapses and neurons. Recent work in different models show that innate behavior, too, is plastic and depends on the current behavioral context and the internal state of an animal. Furthermore, these studies suggest that the neural circuits underpinning innate and learned behavior interact and even overlap. For instance, hunger modulates several innate behaviors relying in part on neural circuits required for learning and memory such as the mushroom body in the fruit fly. These new findings suggest that state-dependent innate behavior and learning rely on functionally and anatomically overlapping and shared neural circuits indicating a common evolutionary history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Pharmacoresistant epilepsy is a common neurological disorder in which increased neuronal intrinsic excitability and synaptic excitation lead to pathologically synchronous behavior in the brain. In the majority of experimental and theoretical epilepsy models, epilepsy is associated with reduced inhibition in the pathological neural circuits, yet effects of intrinsic excitability are usually not explicitly analyzed. Here we present a novel neural mass model that includes intrinsic excitability in the form of spike-frequency adaptation in the excitatory population. We validated our model using local field potential data recorded from human hippocampal/subicular slices. We found that synaptic conductances and slow adaptation in the excitatory population both play essential roles for generating seizures and pre-ictal oscillations. Using bifurcation analysis, we found that transitions towards seizure and back to the resting state take place via Andronov-Hopf bifurcations. These simulations therefore suggest that single neuron adaptation as well as synaptic inhibition are responsible for orchestrating seizure dynamics and transition towards the epileptic state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Epileptic seizures are commonly thought to arise from a pathology of inhibition in the brain circuits. Theoretical models aiming to explain epileptic oscillations usually describe the neural activity solely in terms of inhibition and excitation. Single neuron adaptation properties are usually assumed to have only a limited contribution to seizure dynamics. To explore this issue, we developed a novel neural mass model with adaption in the excitatory population. By including adaptation together with inhibition in this model, we were able to account for several experimentally observed properties of seizures, resting state dynamics, and pre-ictal oscillations, leading to improved understanding of epileptic seizures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Cell cryopreservation improves reproducibility and enables flexibility in experimental design. Although conventional freezing methodologies have been used to preserve primary neurons, poor cell viability and reduced survival severely limited their utility. We screened several high-performance freezing media, and found that CryoStor®10 (CS10) provided superior cryoprotection to primary mouse embryonic cortical neurons compared to other commercially-available or traditional reagents, permitting the recovery of 68.8% of cells relative to a fresh dissection. We characterized developmental, morphometric and functional indicators of neuron maturation, and found that, without exception, neurons recovered from cryostorage in CS10 media faithfully recapitulate &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; neurodevelopment in-step with neurons obtained by fresh dissection. Our method establishes cryopreserved neurons as a reliable, efficient, and equivalent model to fresh neuron cultures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement:&lt;/b&gt; In this study, we have optimized and validated a methodology for the efficient cryopreservation of primary embryonic rodent neurons, yielding cells which are developmentally and functionally similar to fresh neurons. This approach serves as an effective alternative to regularly obtaining neurons by fresh dissection, and thus frees researchers from substantial labor and animal husbandry costs, enables flexibility in experimental timelines, and conserves animals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: A functionally defined in vivo astrocyte population identified by c-Fos activation in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis modulated by S1P signaling: immediate-early astrocytes (ieAstrocytes)</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes have prominent roles in central nervous system (CNS) function and disease, with subpopulations defined primarily by morphologies and molecular markers often determined in cell culture. Here, we identify an &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; astrocyte subpopulation termed &quot;&lt;i&gt;ieAstrocytes&lt;/i&gt; (immediate-early astrocytes)&quot; that is defined by &lt;i&gt;functional&lt;/i&gt; c-Fos activation during CNS disease development. An unbiased screen for CNS cells showing c-Fos activation during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model for multiple sclerosis (MS), was developed by using inducible, TetTag c-Fos reporter mice that label activated cells with a temporally stable, nuclear green fluorescent protein (GFP). Four-dimensional (3-D over time) c-Fos activation maps in the spinal cord were produced by combining tissue clearing (iDISCO) and confocal microscopy that identified onset and expansion of GFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cell populations during EAE. Over 95% of the GFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells showed glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity – in contrast to absent or rare labeling of neurons, microglia, and infiltrating immune cells – which constituted &lt;i&gt;ieAstrocytes&lt;/i&gt; that linearly increased in number with progression of EAE. &lt;i&gt;ieAstrocyte&lt;/i&gt; formation was reduced by either astrocyte-specific genetic removal of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) or pharmacological inhibition by fingolimod (FTY720), an FDA-approved MS medicine that can functionally antagonize S1P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ieAstrocyte&lt;/i&gt;s thus represent a &lt;i&gt;functionally&lt;/i&gt; defined subset of disease-linked astrocytes that are the first and predominant CNS cell population activated during EAE, and that track with disease severity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Their reduction by a disease-modifying agent supports their therapeutic relevance to MS and potentially other neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significant Statement&lt;/b&gt; A new, &lt;i&gt;functionally&lt;/i&gt; defined &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; subpopulation of astrocytes termed &quot;&lt;i&gt;ieAstrocyte&lt;/i&gt;s (immediate-early astrocytes)&quot; was identified as the first and predominant CNS cell type showing c-Fos activation, in an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). &lt;i&gt;ieAstrocyte&lt;/i&gt;s track with disease severity. The approved MS drug, fingolimod (FTY720, an S1P receptor modulator) reduced &lt;i&gt;ieAstrocyte&lt;/i&gt; formation as well as clinical disease. Agents that prevent or reduce &lt;i&gt;ieAstrocytes&lt;/i&gt; could represent a new strategic target for treating MS and other neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Dynamic and Sex-Specific Changes in Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Neuron Activity and Excitability in a Mouse Model of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Reproductive endocrine disorders are prominent co-morbidities of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in both men and women. The neural mechanisms underlying these co-morbidities remain unclear, but hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons may be involved. Here we report the first direct demonstrations of aberrant GnRH neuron function in an animal model of epilepsy. Recordings of GnRH neuron firing and excitability were made in acute mouse brain slices prepared 2 months after intrahippocampal injection of kainate (KA) or control saline, a well-established TLE model in which most females develop co-morbid estrous cycle disruption. GnRH neurons from control females showed elevated firing and excitability on estrus compared with diestrus. By contrast, cells from KA-injected females that developed prolonged, disrupted estrous cycles (KA-long) showed the reverse pattern. Firing rates of cells from KA-injected females that maintained regular cycles (KA-regular) were not different from controls on diestrus, but were reduced on estrus. In KA-injected males, only GnRH neurons in the medial septum displayed elevated firing. In contrast to the diestrus-vs.-estrus and sex-specific changes in firing, GnRH neuron intrinsic excitability was elevated in all KA-injected groups, indicating a role for afferent synaptic and neuromodulatory inputs in shaping overall changes in firing activity. Furthermore, KA-injected females showed cycle-stage-specific changes in circulating sex steroids on diestrus and estrus that also differed between KA-long and KA-regular groups. Together, these findings reveal that the effects of epilepsy on the neural control of reproduction are dynamic across the estrous cycle, distinct in association with co-morbid estrous cycle disruption severity, and sex-specific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; People with epilepsy are at higher risk of reproductive endocrine disorders compared with the general population, but the neural mechanisms linking epilepsy and these co-morbidities are unknown. Here we report changes in the function of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, which control fertility, in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. GnRH neurons from epileptic female mice showed changes in activity dependent on estrous cycle stage and associated with severity of cycle disruption. The impacts of epilepsy on GnRH neurons in males were less severe. These findings provide novel evidence for impacts of epilepsy on GnRH neuron function, and will thus be of clinical relevance in developing new strategies to ameliorate reproductive co-morbidities and to treat the underlying seizures and epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: February 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 54&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Reed L Ressler, Stephen Maren&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the years Pavlovian fear conditioning has proved to be a powerful model to investigate the neural underpinnings of aversive associative memory formation. Although it is well appreciated that plasticity occurring at excitatory synapses within the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) plays a critical role in associative memory formation, recent evidence suggests that plasticity within the amygdala is more distributed than previously appreciated. In particular, studies demonstrate that plasticity in the central nucleus (CeA) is critical for the acquisition of conditioned fear. In addition, a variety of interneuron populations within the amygdala, defined by unique neurochemical markers, contribute to distinct aspects of stimulus processing and memory formation during fear conditioning. Here, we will review and summarize recent advances in our understanding of amygdala networks and how unique players within this network contribute to synaptic plasticity associated with the acquisition of conditioned fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Inhibitory Neuron Activity Contributions to Hemodynamic Responses and Metabolic Load Examined Using an Inhibitory Optogenetic Mouse Model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy225</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy225/5095373?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Hemodynamic signals are routinely used to noninvasively assess brain function in humans and animals. This work examined the contribution of inhibitory neuron activity on hemodynamic responses captured by changes in blood flow, volume and oxygenation in the cortex of lightly anesthetized mice. Because cortical activity is not commonly initiated by inhibitory neurons, experiments were conducted to examine the neuronal activity properties elicited by photo-stimulation. We observed comparable increases in neuronal activity evoked by forelimb and photo-stimulation; however, significantly larger increases in blood flow and volume were produced by photo-stimulation of inhibitory neurons compared with forelimb stimulation. Following blockade of glutamate and GABA-A receptors to reduce postsynaptic activity contributions, neuronal activity was reliably modulated and hemodynamic changes persisted, though slightly reduced. More importantly, photo-stimulation-evoked changes in blood flow and volume were suppressed by 75–80% with the administration of a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, suggesting that inhibitory neurons regulate blood flow mostly via nitric oxide. Lastly, forelimb and photo-stimulation of excitatory neurons produced local decreases in blood oxygenation, while large increases were generated by photo-stimulation of inhibitory neurons. Estimates of oxygen metabolism suggest that inhibitory neuron activity has a small impact on tissue metabolic load, indicating a mismatch between the metabolic demand and blood flow regulation properties of inhibitory and excitatory neurons.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Dentate Granule Neurons Generated During Perinatal Life Display Distinct Morphological Features Compared With Later-Born Neurons in the Mouse Hippocampus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy224</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy224/5095371?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;In nonhuman mammals and in particular in rodents, most granule neurons of the dentate gyrus (DG) are generated during development and yet little is known about their properties compared with adult-born neurons. Although it is generally admitted that these populations are morphologically indistinguishable once mature, a detailed analysis of developmentally born neurons is lacking. Here, we used in vivo electroporation to label dentate granule cells (DGCs) generated in mouse embryos (E14.5) or in neonates (P0) and followed their morphological development up to 6 months after birth. By comparison with mature retrovirus-labeled DGCs born at weaning (P21) or young adult (P84) stages, we provide the evidence that perinatally born neurons, especially embryonically born cells, are morphologically distinct from later-born neurons and are thus easily distinguishable. In addition, our data indicate that semilunar and hilar GCs, 2 populations in ectopic location, are generated during the embryonic and the neonatal periods, respectively. Thus, our findings provide new insights into the development of the different populations of GCs in the DG and open new questions regarding their function in the brain.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Priority Switches in Visual Working Memory are Supported by Frontal Delta and Posterior Alpha Interactions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy223</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy223/5095368?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Visual working memory (VWM) distinguishes between representations relevant for imminent versus future perceptual goals. We investigated how the brain sequentially prioritizes visual working memory representations that serve consecutive tasks. Observers remembered two targets for a sequence of two visual search tasks, thus making one target currently relevant, and the other prospectively relevant. We show that during the retention interval prior to the first search, lateralized parieto-occipital EEG alpha (8–14 Hz) suppression is stronger for current compared with prospective search targets. Crucially, between the first and second search task, this difference in posterior alpha lateralization reverses, reflecting the change in priority states of the two target representations. Connectivity analyses indicate that this switch in posterior alpha lateralization is driven by frontal delta/low-theta (2–6 Hz) activity. Moreover, this frontal low-frequency signal also predicts task performance after the switch. We thus obtained evidence for large-scale network interactions underlying the flexible shifting between the priority states of multiple memory representations in VWM.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Frontoparietal Networks Mediate the Behavioral Impact of Alpha Inhibition in Visual Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy220</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Alpha oscillations are known to play a central role in the functional inhibition of visual cortices, but the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. One noninvasive method for modulating alpha activity experimentally is through the use of flickering visual stimuli that “entrain” visual cortices. Such alpha entrainment has been found to compromise visual perception and affect widespread cortical regions, but it remains unclear how the interference occurs and whether the widespread activity induced by alpha entrainment reflects a compensatory mechanism to mitigate the entrainment, or alternatively, a propagated interference signal that translates to impaired visual processing. Herein, we attempt to address these questions by integrating alpha entrainment into a modified Posner cueing paradigm, while measuring the underlying dynamics using magnetoencephalography. Our findings indicated that alpha entrainment is negatively related to task performance, such that as neural entrainment increases on the attended side (relative to the unattended side) accuracy decreases. Further, this attentional biasing is found to covary robustly with activity in the frontoparietal attention network. Critically, the observed negative entrainment effect on task accuracy was also fully mediated by activity in frontoparietal regions, signifying a propagation of the interfering alpha entrainment signal from bottom-up sensory to top-down regulatory networks.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: A Polygenic Score for Higher Educational Attainment is Associated with Larger Brains</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;People who score higher on intelligence tests tend to have larger brains. Twin studies suggest the same genetic factors influence both brain size and intelligence. This has led to the hypothesis that genetics influence intelligence partly by contributing to the development of larger brains. We tested this hypothesis using four large imaging genetics studies (combined &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 7965) with polygenic scores derived from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of educational attainment, a correlate of intelligence. We conducted meta-analysis to test associations among participants’ genetics, total brain volume (i.e., brain size), and cognitive test performance. Consistent with previous findings, participants with higher polygenic scores achieved higher scores on cognitive tests, as did participants with larger brains. Participants with higher polygenic scores also had larger brains. We found some evidence that brain size partly mediated associations between participants’ education polygenic scores and their cognitive test performance. Effect sizes were larger in the population-based samples than in the convenience-based samples. Recruitment and retention of population-representative samples should be a priority for neuroscience research. Findings suggest promise for studies integrating GWAS discoveries with brain imaging to understand neurobiology linking genetics with cognitive performance.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Zhong, Lu Chen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The molecular mechanisms underlying various types of synaptic plasticity are historically regarded as separate processes involved in independent cellular events. However, recent progress in our molecular understanding of Hebbian and homeostatic synaptic plasticity supports the observation that these two types of plasticity share common cellular events, and are often altered together in neurological diseases. Here, we discuss the emerging concept of homeostatic synaptic plasticity as a metaplasticity mechanism with a focus on cellular signaling processes that enable a direct interaction between Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity. We also identify distinct and shared molecular players involved in these cellular processes that may be explored experimentally in future studies to test the hypothesis that homeostatic synaptic plasticity serves as a metaplasticity mechanism to integrate changes in neuronal activity and support optimal Hebbian learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

In these situations, internal representations need to be updated, a process that requires long-term synaptic plasticity. Through a variety of common and divergent mechanisms, it is recently shown that all these neuromodulators facilitate the induction and/or expression of long-term synaptic plasticity within the hippocampus. Under physiological conditions, this may be critical for suprathreshold induction of plasticity endowing neuromodulators with a gating function and providing a mechanism by which neuromodulators enable the targeted updating of memory with relevant information to improve the accuracy of future predictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
