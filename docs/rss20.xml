	<title>Annals of Neurology: A mutation in the Tubb4a gene leads to microtubule accumulation with hypomyelination and demyelination</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24930</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24930</link>
	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24930-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our goal was to define the genetic cause of the profound hypomyelination in the &lt;em&gt;taiep&lt;/em&gt; rat model and determine its relevance to human white matter disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24930-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on previous localization of the &lt;em&gt;taiep&lt;/em&gt; mutation to rat chromosome 9, we tested whether the mutation resided within the &lt;em&gt;Tubb4a&lt;/em&gt; (β-tubulin 4A) gene, because mutations in the &lt;em&gt;TUBB4A&lt;/em&gt; gene have been described in patients with central nervous system hypomyelination. To determine whether accumulation of microtubules led to progressive demyelination, we analyzed the spinal cord and optic nerves of 2-year-old rats by light and electron microscopy. Cerebral white matter from a patient with &lt;em&gt;TUBB4A&lt;/em&gt; Asn414Lys mutation and magnetic resonance imaging evidence of severe hypomyelination were studied similarly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24930-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;em&gt;taiep&lt;/em&gt; rat ages, there is progressive loss of myelin in the brain and dorsal column of the spinal cord associated with increased oligodendrocyte numbers with accumulation of microtubules. This accumulation involved the entire cell body and distal processes of oligodendrocytes, but there was no accumulation of microtubules in axons. A single point mutation in &lt;em&gt;Tubb4a&lt;/em&gt; (p.Ala302Thr) was found in homozygous &lt;em&gt;taiep&lt;/em&gt; samples. A similar hypomyelination associated with increased oligodendrocyte numbers and arrays of microtubules in oligodendrocytes was demonstrated in the human patient sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24930-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;taiep&lt;/em&gt; rat is the first animal model of &lt;em&gt;TUBB4&lt;/em&gt; mutations in humans and a novel system in which to test the mechanism of microtubule accumulation. The finding of microtubule accumulation in a patient with a &lt;em&gt;TUBB4A&lt;/em&gt; mutation and leukodystrophy confirms the usefulness of &lt;em&gt;taiep&lt;/em&gt; as a model of the human disease.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We report 5 cases of acute heart failure (AHF) related to multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses. AHF was inaugural in 3 patients, always preceded or accompanied by signs of brainstem dysfunction; it was severe, requiring intensive care management. Echocardiography showed left ventricular hypokinesis. No other cause of AHF has been found. All patients showed a new medullary lesion on brain magnetic resonance imaging. All had rapid and complete recovery of ventricular function after intravenous corticosteroids. We concluded that the cases represent a takotsubo phenomenon. Physicians should be aware of rare cases of takotsubo cardiomyopathy in MS relapses. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;With image-based high-throughput experiments, new challenges arise in both,
the design of experiments and the automated analysis. To be able to handle the
massive number of single experiments and the corresponding amount of data, a
comprehensive concept for the design of experiments and a new evaluation method
is needed. This work proposes a new method for an optimized experiment layout
that enables the determination of parameters, adapted for the needs of
automated image analysis. Furthermore, a catalogue of new image analysis
modules, especially developed for zebrafish analysis, is presented. The
combination of both parts offers the user, usually a biologist, an approach for
high-throughput zebrafish image analysis, which enables the extraction of new
signals and optimizes the design of experiments. The result is a reduction of
data amount, redundant information and workload as well as classification
errors.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Consensus clustering approach to group brain connectivity matrices. (arXiv:1612.03760v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03760</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03760</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A novel approach rooted on the notion of consensus clustering, a strategy
developed for community detection in complex networks, is proposed to cope with
the heterogeneity that characterizes connectivity matrices in health and
disease. The method can be summarized as follows:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(i) define, for each node, a distance matrix for the set of subjects by
comparing the connectivity pattern of that node in all pairs of subjects; (ii)
cluster the distance matrix for each node; (iii) build the consensus network
from the corresponding partitions; (iv) extract groups of subjects by finding
the communities of the consensus network thus obtained.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Differently from the previous implementations of consensus clustering, we
thus propose to use the consensus strategy to combine the information arising
from the connectivity patterns of each node. The proposed approach may be seen
either as an exploratory technique or as an unsupervised pre-training step to
help the subsequent construction of a supervised classifier. Applications on a
toy model and two real data sets, show the effectiveness of the proposed
methodology, which represents heterogeneity of a set of subjects in terms of a
weighted network, the consensus matrix.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper proposes a neuronal circuitry layout and synaptic plasticity
principles that allow the (pyramidal) neuron to act as a &quot;combinatorial
switch&quot;. Namely, the neuron learns to be more prone to generate spikes given
those combinations of firing input neurons for which a previous spiking of the
neuron had been followed by a positive global reward signal. The reward signal
may be mediated by certain modulatory hormones or neurotransmitters, e.g., the
dopamine. More generally, a trial-and-error learning paradigm is suggested in
which a global reward signal triggers long-term enhancement or weakening of a
neuron's spiking response to the preceding neuronal input firing pattern. Thus,
rewards provide a feedback pathway that informs neurons whether their spiking
was beneficial or detrimental for a particular input combination. The neuron's
ability to discern specific combinations of firing input neurons is achieved
through a random or predetermined spatial distribution of input synapses on
dendrites that creates synaptic clusters that represent various permutations of
input neurons. The corresponding dendritic segments, or the enclosed individual
spines, are capable of being particularly excited, due to local sigmoidal
thresholding involving voltage-gated channel conductances, if the segment's
excitatory and absence of inhibitory inputs are temporally coincident. Such
nonlinear excitation corresponds to a particular firing combination of input
neurons, and it is posited that the excitation strength encodes the
combinatorial memory and is regulated by long-term plasticity mechanisms. It is
also suggested that the spine calcium influx that may result from the
spatiotemporal synaptic input coincidence may cause the spine head actin
filaments to undergo mechanical (muscle-like) contraction, with the ensuing
cytoskeletal deformation transmitted to the axon initial segment where it
may...

	<description>Microglia are the resident innate immune population of the central nervous system that constantly survey and influence their local environment. Transcriptomic profiling has led to significant advances in our understanding of microglia in several disease states, but tissue dissociation and purification of microglia is known to lead to cellular activation. Here we use RiboTag translational RNAseq profiling to demonstrate that commonly used cell sorting methods lead to a fundamental alteration of the microglial transcriptome, with several transcripts that can be used to mark artifacts of isolation. Microglial RiboTag RNAseq profiling after peripheral immune challenge with lipopolysaccharide demonstrates unique transcriptional targets that are not evident using cell sorting methodology. Finally, we applied our technique to reveal novel shared and distinct pathways when comparing microglial transcriptomes after peripheral challenge with bacterial or viral mimetics. This study has broad implications for approaches that examine microglial transcriptomes in normal and pathological states.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Post-transcriptional regulation across human tissues</title>

Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation shape tissue-type-specific proteomes, but their relative contributions remain contested. Estimates of the factors determining protein levels in human tissues do not distinguish between (&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;) the factors determining the variability between the abundances of different proteins, i.e., mean-level-variability and, (&lt;i&gt;ii&lt;/i&gt;) the factors determining the physiological variability of the same protein across different tissue types, i.e., across-tissues variability. We sought to estimate the contribution of transcript levels to these two orthogonal sources of variability, and found that scaled mRNA levels can account for most of the mean-level-variability but not necessarily for across-tissues variability. The reliable quantification of the latter estimate is limited by substantial measurement noise. However, protein-to-mRNA ratios exhibit substantial across-tissues variability that is functionally concerted and reproducible across different datasets, suggesting extensive post-transcriptional regulation. These results caution against estimating protein fold-changes from mRNA fold-changes between different cell-types, and highlight the contribution of post-transcriptional regulation to shaping tissue-type-specific proteomes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vF6zRaymzxo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Epidemiological modeling of &lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma cruzi&lt;/i&gt;: Low stercorarian transmission and failure of host adaptive immunity explain the frequency of mixed infections in humans</title>

People living in areas with active vector-borne transmission of Chagas disease have multiple contacts with its causative agent, &lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma cruzi&lt;/i&gt;. Reinfections by &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cruzi&lt;/i&gt; are possible at least in animal models leading to lower or even hardly detectable parasitaemia. In humans, although reinfections are thought to have major public health implications by increasing the risk of chronic manifestations of the disease, there is little quantitative knowledge about their frequency and the timing of parasite re-inoculation in the course of the disease. Here, we implemented stochastic agent-based models i) to estimate the rate of re-inoculation in humans and ii) to assess how frequent are reinfections during the acute and chronic stages of the disease according to alternative hypotheses on the adaptive immune response following a primary infection. By using a hybrid genetic algorithm, the models were fitted to epidemiological data of Argentinean rural villages where mixed infections by different genotypes of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cruzi&lt;/i&gt; reach 56% in humans. To explain this percentage, the best model predicted 0.032 (0.008–0.042) annual reinfections per individual with 98.4% of them occurring in the chronic phase. In addition, the parasite escapes to the adaptive immune response mounted after the primary infection in at least 20% of the events of re-inoculation. With these low annual rates, the risks of reinfection during the typically long chronic stage of the disease stand around 14% (4%-18%) and 60% (21%-70%) after 5 and 30 years, with most individuals being re-infected 1–3 times overall. These low rates are better explained by the weak efficiency of the stercorarian mode of transmission than a highly efficient adaptive immune response. Those estimates are of particular interest for vaccine development and for our understanding of the higher risk of chronic disease manifestations suffered by infected people living in endemic areas.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2z3OJKtFYUE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The decay of motor adaptation to novel movement dynamics reveals an asymmetry in the stability of motion state-dependent learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005492</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Eghbal A. Hosseini, Katrina P. Nguyen, Wilsaan M. Joiner&lt;/p&gt;

Motor adaptation paradigms provide a quantitative method to study short-term modification of motor commands. Despite the growing understanding of the role motion states (e.g., velocity) play in this form of motor learning, there is little information on the relative stability of memories based on these movement characteristics, especially in comparison to the initial adaptation. Here, we trained subjects to make reaching movements perturbed by force patterns dependent upon either limb position or velocity. Following training, subjects were exposed to a series of error-clamp trials to measure the temporal characteristics of the feedforward motor output during the decay of learning. The compensatory force patterns were largely based on the perturbation kinematic (e.g., velocity), but also showed a small contribution from the other motion kinematic (e.g., position). However, the velocity contribution in response to the position-based perturbation decayed at a slower rate than the position contribution to velocity-based training, suggesting a difference in stability. Next, we modified a previous model of motor adaptation to reflect this difference and simulated the behavior for different learning goals. We were interested in the stability of learning when the perturbations were based on different combinations of limb position or velocity that subsequently resulted in biased amounts of motion-based learning. We trained additional subjects on these combined motion-state perturbations and confirmed the predictions of the model. Specifically, we show that (1) there is a significant separation between the observed gain-space trajectories for the learning and decay of adaptation and (2) for combined motion-state perturbations, the gain associated to changes in limb position decayed at a faster rate than the velocity-dependent gain, even when the position-dependent gain at the end of training was significantly greater. Collectively, these results suggest that the state-dependent adaptation associated with movement velocity is relatively more stable than that based on position.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EIDcYz4LMtU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Pyrimethamine Significantly Lowers CSF/SOD1 in ALS Patients With SOD1 Mutations</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;underlined &quot;&gt;Background:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) reduction prolongs survival in SOD1-transgenic animal models. Pyrimethamine produces dose dependent SOD1 reduction in cell culture systems. A previous phase-1 trial showed pyrimethamine lowers SOD1 levels in leucocytes in patients with &lt;em&gt;SOD1&lt;/em&gt; mutations. This study investigated whether pyrimethamine lowered SOD1 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in patients carrying &lt;em&gt;SOD1&lt;/em&gt; mutations linked to ALS (fALS/SOD1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;underlined &quot;&gt;Methods and Study Design:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Multicenter (5 sites), open-label, 9-month duration, dose-ranging, to determine safety and efficacy of pyrimethamine to lower SOD1 levels in the CSF of FALS/SOD1. All participants underwent 3 lumbar punctures, blood draw, clinical assessment of strength, motor function, quality of life, and adverse effects assessments. SOD1 levels were measured in erythrocytes and CSF. Pyrimethamine was measured in plasma and CSF. Appel ALS, ALSFRS-R and single item McGill Quality of Life (SIS-MQoL) were measured at screening, visit 6 and 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;underlined &quot;&gt;Results:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; We enrolled 32 patients; 24 completed 6 visits (18 weeks) and 21 completed all study visits. A linear mixed effects model showed a significant reduction in CSF SOD1 at visit 6 (p&amp;lt;0.001) with a mean reduction of 13.5% (95% CI: 8.4, 18.5) and at visit 9 (p&amp;lt;0.001) with a mean reduction of 10.5% (95% CI: 5.2, 15.8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;underlined &quot;&gt;Interpretation:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Pyrimethamine is safe and well tolerated in ALS. Pyrimethamine is capable of producing a significant reduction in total CSF SOD1 protein content in patients with ALS caused by different &lt;em&gt;SOD1&lt;/em&gt; mutations. Further long-term studies are warranted to assess clinical efficacy. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite the relative simplicity of C. elegans, its locomotion machinery is
not yet well understood. We focus on the generation of dorsoventral body bends.
While central pattern generators are commonly involved in animal locomotion,
their presence in C. elegans has been questioned due to a lack of an evident
neural circuit to support it. We developed a computational model grounded in
the available neuroanatomy and neurophysiology and we used an evolutionary
algorithm to explore the space of possible configurations of the circuit that
matched the neural traces observed during forward and backward locomotion in
the worm. Our results demonstrate that it is possible for the rhythmic
contraction to be produced by a circuit present in the ventral nerve cord.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Network of Noisy Leaky Integrate and Fire (NNLIF) model describes the
behavior of a neural network at mesoscopic level. It is one of the simplest
self-contained mean-field models considered for that purpose. Even so, a lot of
questions remain open today. In this work we give answer to some of them,
extending the results obtained in C\'aceres-Carrillo-Perthame(2011),
C\'aceres-Perthame(2014), C\'aceres-Schneider(2017) to a general network with
two populations (excitatory and inhibitory), where there are transmission
delays between the neurons and where the neurons remain in a refractory state
for a time. More precisely, we have studied the number of steady states in
terms of the model parameters, its long time behaviour for small connectivity
parameters, and the blow-up phenomenon when there is no transmission delay
between excitatory neurons. Moreover, we have presented a numerical resolutor
for this model, based on high order WENO schemes and an explicit third order
TVD Runge-Kutta method, which produce a powerful numerical solver to describe
the wide range of phenomena in the network: blow-up, asynchronous/synchronous
solutions, instability/stability of the steady states ...

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Rich-Club Ordering and the Dyadic Effect: Two Interrelated Phenomena. (arXiv:1705.02201v1 [cs.SI])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02201</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02201</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Rich-club ordering and the dyadic effect are two phenomena observed in
complex networks that are based on the presence of certain substructures
composed of specific nodes. Rich-club ordering represents the tendency of
highly connected and important elements to form tight communities with other
central elements. The dyadic effect denotes the tendency of nodes that share a
common property to be much more interconnected than expected. In this study, we
consider the interrelation between these two phenomena, which until now have
always been studied separately. We contribute with a new formulation of the
rich-club measures in terms of the dyadic effect. Moreover, we introduce
certain measures related to the analysis of the dyadic effect, which are useful
in confirming the presence and relevance of rich-clubs in complex networks. In
addition, certain computational experiences show the usefulness of the

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Discrete Modeling of Multi-Transmitter Neural Networks with Neuron Competition. (arXiv:1705.02176v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We propose a novel discrete model of central pattern generators (CPG),
neuronal ensembles generating rhythmic activity. The model emphasizes the role
of nonsynaptic interactions and the diversity of electrical properties in
nervous systems. Neurons in the model release different neurotransmitters into
the shared extracellular space (ECS) so each neuron with the appropriate set of
receptors can receive signals from other neurons. We consider neurons,
differing in their electrical activity, represented as finite-state machines
functioning in discrete time steps. Discrete modeling is aimed to provide a
computationally tractable and compact explanation of rhythmic pattern
generation in nervous systems. The important feature of the model is the
introduced mechanism of neuronal competition which is shown to be responsible
for the generation of proper rhythms. The model is illustrated with two
examples: a half-center oscillator considered to be a basic mechanism of
emerging rhythmic activity and the well-studied feeding network of a pond
snail. Future research will focus on the neuromodulatory effects ubiquitous in
CPG networks and the whole nervous systems.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Graph-theoretical methods have rapidly become a standard tool in studies of
the structure and function of the human brain. Whereas the structural
connectome can be fairly straightforwardly mapped onto a complex network, there
are more degrees of freedom in constructing networks that represent functional
connections between brain areas. For fMRI data, such networks are typically
built by aggregating the BOLD signal time series of voxels into larger entities
(such as Regions of Interest in some brain atlas), and determining the
connection strengths between these from some measure of time-series
correlations. Although it is evident that the outcome of this procedure must be
affected by how the voxel-level time series are treated at the preprocessing
stage, there is a lack of systematic studies of the effects of preprocessing on
network structure. Here, we focus on the effects of spatial smoothing, which is
a standard preprocessing method for fMRI. We apply various levels of spatial
smoothing to resting-state fMRI data, and measure the changes induced in the
corresponding functional networks. We show that the level of spatial smoothing
clearly affects the degrees and other centrality measures of the nodes of the
functional networks; these changes are non-uniform, systematic, and depend on
the geometry of the brain. The composition of the largest connected network
component is also affected in a way that artificially increases the similarity
of the networks of different subjects. Our conclusion is that wherever
possible, spatial smoothing should be avoided when preprocessing fMRI data for
network analysis.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Exponential scaling of neural algorithms - a future beyond Moore's Law?. (arXiv:1705.02042v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although the brain has long been considered a potential inspiration for
future computing, Moore's Law - the scaling property that has seen revolutions
in technologies ranging from supercomputers to smart phones - has largely been
driven by advances in materials science. As the ability to miniaturize
transistors is coming to an end, there is increasing attention on new
approaches to computation, including renewed enthusiasm around the potential of
neural computation. Recent advances in neurotechnologies, many of which have
been aided by computing's rapid progression over recent decades, are now
reigniting this opportunity to bring neural computation insights into broader
computing applications. As we understand more about the brain, our ability to
motivate new computing paradigms with continue to progress. These new
approaches to computing, which we are already seeing in techniques such as deep
learning, will themselves improve our ability to learn about the brain and
accordingly can be projected to give rise to even further insights. Such a
positive feedback has the potential to change the complexion of how computing
sciences and neurosciences interact, and suggests that the next form of
exponential scaling in computing may emerge from our progressive understanding
of the brain.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Complex tensor factorisation with PARAFAC2 for the estimation of brain connectivity from the EEG. (arXiv:1705.02019v1 [cs.CE])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02019</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02019</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: The coupling between neuronal populations and its magnitude have
been shown to be informative for various clinical applications. One method to
estimate brain connectivity is with electroencephalography (EEG) from which the
cross-spectrum between different sensor locations is derived. We wish to test
the efficacy of tensor factorisation in the estimation of brain connectivity.
Methods: Complex tensor factorisation based on PARAFAC2 is used to decompose
the EEG into scalp components described by the spatial, spectral, and complex
trial profiles. An EEG model in the complex domain was derived that shows the
suitability of PARAFAC2. A connectivity metric was also derived on the complex
trial profiles of the extracted components. Results: Results on a benchmark EEG
dataset confirmed that PARAFAC2 can estimate connectivity better than
traditional tensor analysis such as PARAFAC within a range of signal-to-noise
ratios. The analysis of EEG from patients with mild cognitive impairment or
Alzheimer's disease showed that PARAFAC2 identifies loss of brain connectivity
better than traditional approaches and agreeing with prior pathological
knowledge. Conclusion: The complex PARAFAC2 algorithm is suitable for EEG
connectivity estimation since it allows to extract meaningful coupled sources
and provides better estimates than complex PARAFAC. Significance: A new
paradigm that employs complex tensor factorisation has demonstrated to be
successful in identifying brain connectivity and the location of couples
sources for both a benchmark and a real-world EEG dataset. This can enable
future applications and has the potential to solve some the issues that
deteriorate the performance of traditional connectivity metrics.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Understanding Epileptiform After-Discharges as Rhythmic Oscillatory Transients. (arXiv:1610.00262v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00262</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00262</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Electro-cortical activity in patients with epilepsy may show abnormal
rhythmic transients in response to stimulation. Even when using the same
stimulation parameters in the same patient, wide variability in the duration of
transient response has been reported. These transients have long been
considered important for the mapping of the excitability levels in the
epileptic brain but their dynamic mechanism is still not well understood.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the occurrence of abnormal transients dynamically, we use a
thalamo-cortical neural population model of epileptic spike-wave activity and
study the interaction between slow and fast subsystems.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a reduced version of the thalamo-cortical model, slow wave oscillations
arise from a fold of cycles (FoC) bifurcation. This marks the onset of a region
of bistability between a high amplitude oscillatory rhythm and the background
state. In vicinity of the bistability in parameter space, the model has
excitable dynamics, showing prolonged rhythmic transients in response to
suprathreshold pulse stimulation. We analyse the state space geometry of the
bistable and excitable states, and find that the rhythmic transient arises when
the impending FoC bifurcation deforms the state space and creates an area of
locally reduced attraction to the fixed point. This area essentially allows
trajectories to dwell there before escaping to the stable steady state, thus
creating rhythmic transients. In the full thalamo-cortical model, we find a
similar FoC bifurcation structure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the analysis, we propose an explanation of why stimulation induced
epileptiform activity may vary between trials, and predict how the variability
could be related to ongoing oscillatory background activity.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Mechanisms underlying different onset patterns of focal seizures. (arXiv:1609.07068v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07068</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07068</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Focal seizures are episodes of pathological brain activity that appear to
arise from a localised area of the brain. The onset patterns of focal seizure
activity have been studied intensively, and they have largely been
distinguished into two types - low amplitude fast oscillations (LAF), or high
amplitude spikes (HAS). Here we explore whether these two patterns arise from
fundamentally different mechanisms. Here, we use a previously established
computational model of neocortical tissue, and validate it as an adequate model
using clinical recordings of focal seizures. We then reproduce the two onset
patterns in their most defining properties and investigate the possible
mechanisms underlying the different focal seizure onset patterns in the model.
We show that the two patterns are associated with different mechanisms at the
spatial scale of a single ECoG electrode. The LAF onset is initiated by
independent patches of localised activity, which slowly invade the surrounding
tissue and coalesce over time. In contrast, the HAS onset is a global, systemic
transition to a coexisting seizure state triggered by a local event. We find
that such a global transition is enabled by an increase in the excitability of
the &quot;healthy&quot; surrounding tissue, which by itself does not generate seizures,
but can support seizure activity when incited. In our simulations, the
difference in surrounding tissue excitability also offers a simple explanation
of the clinically reported difference in surgical outcomes. Finally, we
demonstrate in the model how changes in tissue excitability could be
elucidated, in principle, using active stimulation. Taken together, our
modelling results suggest that the excitability of the tissue surrounding the
seizure core may play a determining role in the seizure onset pattern, as well
as in the surgical outcome.

	<description>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by memory loss, cognitive decline, and devastating neurodegeneration, not only as a result of the extracellular accumulation of beta-amyloid peptide (Aβ) and intracellular accumulation of tau, but also as a consequence of the dysfunction and loss of synapses. Although significant advances have been made in our understanding of the relationship of the pathological role of Aβ and tau in synapse dysfunction, several questions remain as to how Aβ and tau interdependently cause impairments in synaptic function in AD.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Distinct Temporal Filters In Mitral Cells And External Tufted Cells Of The Olfactory Bulb</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/135541v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/135541v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Short-term synaptic plasticity is a critical regulator of neural circuits, and largely determines how information is temporally processed. In the olfactory bulb, afferent olfactory receptor neurons respond to increasing concentrations of odorants with barrages of action potentials, and their terminals have an extraordinarily high release probability (Sicard, 1986; Murphy et al., 2004). These features suggest that during naturalistic stimuli, afferent input to the olfactory bulb is subject to strong synaptic depression, presumably truncating the postsynaptic response to afferent stimuli. To examine this issue, we used single glomerular stimulation in mouse olfactory bulb slices to measure the synaptic dynamics of afferent-evoked input at physiological stimulus frequencies. In cell-attached recordings, mitral cells responded to high frequency stimulation with sustained responses, whereas external tufted cells responded transiently. Consistent with previous reports (Murphy et al., 2004), olfactory nerve terminals onto both cell types had a high release probability (0.7), from a single pool of slowly recycling vesicles, indicating that the distinct responses of mitral and external tufted cells to high frequency stimulation did not originate presyaptically. Rather, distinct temporal response profiles in mitral cells and external tufted cells could be attributed to slow dendrodendritic responses in mitral cells, as blocking this slow current in mitral cells converted mitral cell responses to a transient response profile, typical of external tufted cells. Our results suggest that despite strong axodendritic synaptic depression, the balance of axodendritic and dendrodendritic circuitry in external tufted cells and mitral cells, respectively, tunes the postsynaptic responses to high frequency, naturalistic stimulation.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Gamma-Band Resonance Of Visual Cortex To Optogenetic Stimulation</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/135467v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Activated visual cortex typically engages in neuronal synchronization in the gamma-frequency band (30-90 Hz). Gamma-band synchronization is related to cognitive functioning, and its mechanisms have been extensively investigated, predominantly through in-vitro studies. To further elucidate its mechanisms in-vivo, we performed simultaneous optogenetic stimulation and electrophysiological recordings of visual cortical areas 17 and 21a in the anesthetized cat. Viral transfection with AAV1 or AAV9 under a CamKII promoter led to robust Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) expression. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that all ChR2-expressing neurons were negative for Parvalbumin, consistent with predominant or exclusive expression in excitatory neurons. Optogenetic stimulation used primarily surface illumination directly above the transfected and recorded cells. Stimulation with constant light led to strong and sustained gamma-band synchronization with strength and bandwidth similar to visually induced gamma. Rhythmic stimulation with light pulse trains or sinusoidal light modulation revealed strongest resonance for gamma-band frequencies. Gamma resonance was confirmed by optogenetic white-noise stimulation. White-noise stimulation allowed the quantification of the transfer function between the optogenetic stimulation and the local field potential response. This transfer function showed a dominant peak in the gamma band. Thus, we find that visual cortical circuits resonate most strongly to gamma-band components in their input. This resonance renders both the sensitivity to input, and the output of these circuits, selectively tuned to gamma.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/135418v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Central pattern generators are cell- or network-driven oscillators that underlie motor rhythmicity. The existence and identity of C. elegans CPGs are unknown. Through cell ablation, electrophysiology, and calcium imaging, we identified oscillators for C. elegans reverse locomotion. We show that the cholinergic and excitatory class A motor neurons exhibit intrinsic and oscillatory activity, and such an activity can drive reverse locomotion without premotor interneurons. Regulation of their oscillatory activity, either through effecting the P/Q/N high voltage-activated calcium channel, an endogenous constituent of their intrinsic oscillation, or, via the dual regulation by descending premotor interneurons, determines the propensity, velocity, and sustention of reverse locomotion. Thus, the reversal motor neuron themselves serve as distributed local oscillators; regulation of their intrinsic activity controls the reversal motor state. These findings exemplify anatomic and functional compression: motor executors integrate the role of rhythm generation in a locomotor network that is constrained by small cell numbers.</description>

	<description>Cognition and behavior emerge from the dynamic interaction of widely distributed, but functionally specialized brain networks. However, it remains unclear how network-level interactions dynamically reorganize to support ever-shifting cognitive and behavioral demands. Here, we investigate how the interaction between posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and lateral posterior (LP)/Pulvinar is shaped by ongoing fluctuations in pupil-linked arousal, which is a non-invasive measure related to neuromodulatory tone in the brain. We found that fluctuations in pupil-linked arousal tracked the dynamic interaction between PPC and LP/Pulvinar characterized by changes in the direction and carrier frequency of oscillatory interaction. Active visual exploration by saccadic eye movements elicited similar transitions in thalamo-cortical interaction. These findings suggest a common network substrate of both spontaneous activity and active vision. Thus, neuromodulators may play a role in dynamically sculpting the patterns of thalamo-cortical functional interaction that underlie visual processing.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/135251v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>It is hypothesised that the basal ganglia play a key role in solving the problem of action selection. Here we investigate this hypothesis through computational modelling of the primate saccadic oculomotor system. This system is an excellent target for computational modelling because it is supported by a reasonably well understood functional anatomy, has limited degrees of freedom, and there is a wealth of behavioural and electrophysiological data for model comparison. Here, we describe a computational model of the reflexive saccadic oculomotor system incorporating the basal ganglia, key structures in motor control and competition between possible actions. To restrict the likelihood of overfitting the model it is structured and parameterised by the known anatomy and neurophysiology along with data from a single experimental behavioural paradigm, then validated by testing against several additional behavioural experimental data without modification of the parameters. With this model we reproduce a range of fundamental reflexive saccadic results both qualitatively and quantitatively, comprising: the distribution of saccadic latencies; the effect of eccentricity, luminance and fixation-target interactions on saccadic latencies; and the effect of competing targets on saccadic endpoint. By investigating the model dynamics we are able to provide mechanistic explanations for the sources of these behaviours. Further, because of its accesibility, the oculomotor system has also been used to study general principle of sensorimotor control. We interpret the ability of the basal ganglia to successfully control saccade selection in our model as further evidence for the action selection hypothesis.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/135095v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>There is increasing evidence that sensorimotor learning under real-life conditions relies on a composition of several learning processes. Nevertheless, most studies examine learning behaviour in relation to one specific learning mechanism. In this study, we examined the interaction between reward-based skill acquisition and motor adaptation to changes of object dynamics. Thirty healthy subjects, split into two groups, acquired the skill of balancing a pole on a cart in virtual reality. In one group, we gradually increased the gravity, making the task easier in the beginning and more difficult towards the end. In the second group, subjects had to acquire the skill on the maximum, most difficult gravity level. We hypothesized that the gradual increase in gravity during skill acquisition supports learning despite the necessary adjustments to changes in cart-pole dynamics. We found that the gradual group benefits from the slow increment, although overall improvement was interrupted by the changes in gravity and resulting system dynamics, which caused short-term degradations in performance and timing of actions. In conclusion, our results deliver evidence for an interaction of reward-based skill acquisition and motor adaptation processes, which indicates the importance of both processes for the development of optimized skill acquisition schedules.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/135087v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a major technique for human brain mapping. We present a Fast Periodic Stimulation (FPS) fMRI approach, demonstrating its high effectiveness in defining category-selective brain regions. Observers see a dynamic stream of widely variable natural object images alternating at a fast rate (6 images/sec). Every 9 seconds, a short burst of variable face images contrasting with objects in pairs induces an objective 0.111 Hz face-selective neural response in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex and beyond. A model-free Fourier analysis achieves a two-fold increase in signal-to-noise ratio compared to a conventional block-design approach with identical stimuli. Periodicity of category contrast and random variability among images minimize low-level visual confounds while preserving naturalness of the stimuli, leading to the highest values (80-90%) of test-retest reliability yet reported in this area of research. FPS-fMRI opens a new avenue for understanding brain function with low temporal resolution methods.</description>

	<description>How the brain sequentially groups sensory events into temporal chunks and how this process is modulated by attention are fundamental questions in cognitive neuroscience. Sequential grouping includes bottom-up primitive grouping and top-down knowledge-based grouping. In speech perception, grouping acoustic features into syllables can rely on bottom-up acoustic continuity cues but grouping syllables into words critically relies on the listeners lexical knowledge. This study investigates whether top-down attention is required to apply lexical knowledge to group syllables into words, by concurrently monitoring neural entrainment to syllables and words using electroencephalography (EEG). When attention is directed to a competing speech stream or cross-modally to a silent movie, neural entrainment to syllables is weakened but neural entrainment to words largely diminishes. These results strongly suggest that knowledge-based grouping of syllables into words requires top-down attention and is a bottleneck for the neural processing of unattended speech.</description>

	<description>Investigating the dense meshwork of wires and synapses that form neuronal circuits is possible with the high resolution of serial-section electron microscopy (ssEM)1. However, the imaging scale required to comprehensively reconstruct axons and dendrites is more than 10 orders of magnitude smaller than the spatial extents occupied by networks of interconnected neurons2, some of which span nearly the entire brain. The difficulties in generating and handling data for relatively large volumes at nanoscale resolution has thus restricted all studies in vertebrates to neuron fragments, thereby hindering investigations of complete circuits. These efforts were transformed by recent advances in computing, sample handling, and imaging techniques1, but examining entire brains at high resolution remains a challenge. Here we present ssEM data for a complete 5.5 days post-fertilisation larval zebrafish brain. Our approach utilizes multiple rounds of targeted imaging at different scales to reduce acquisition time and data management. The resulting dataset can be analysed to reconstruct neuronal processes, allowing us to, for example, survey all the myelinated axons (the projectome). Further, our reconstructions enabled us to investigate the precise projections of neurons and their contralateral counterparts. In particular, we observed that myelinated axons of reticulospinal and lateral line afferent neurons exhibit remarkable bilateral symmetry. Additionally, we found that fasciculated reticulospinal axons maintain the same neighbour relations throughout the extent of their projections. Furthermore, we use the dataset to set the stage for whole-brain comparisons of structure and function by co-registering functional reference atlases and in vivo two-photon fluorescence microscopy data from the same specimen. We provide the complete dataset and reconstructions as an open-access resource for neurobiologists and others interested in the ultrastructure of the larval zebrafish.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: EyeBallGUI: A Tool For Visual Inspection And Binary Marking of Multi-Channel Bio-Signals</title>

	<description>A wide range of studies in human neuroscience rely on the analysis of electrophysiological bio-signals such as electroencephalogram (EEG) where customized data analysis may require supervised artefact rejection, binary marking through visual inspection, selection of noise and artefact samples for pre-processing algorithms, and selection of clinically-relevant signal segments in neurological conditions. Nevertheless, the existing preprocessing tools do not provide the needed flexibility to handle such tasks efficiently. We therefore developed a free open-source Graphical User Interface (GUI), EyeBallGUI, that allows visualization and flexible, manual marking (binary classification) of multi-channel bio-signal data. EyeBallGUI, developed for MATLAB, allows the user to interactively and accurately inspect and mark multi-channel digitized data with no restriction on marking periods of data in subsets of channels (a restriction in place in existing tools). The new tool facilitates precise, manual marking of bio-signals by allowing any desired segment of data to be marked in any subset of channels. It is therefore of utility in circumstances where such flexibility is essential. The developed GUI is an auxiliary analysis tool that shall facilitate neural signal (pre-)processing applications where it is desirable to perform accurate supervised artefact rejection, flexible data marking for increased data retention yield, extraction of specific signal segments by expert users from sample data, or labeling of data for clinical and scientific research purposes.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Widespread position-specific conservation of synonymous rare codons within coding sequences</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005531</guid>

Synonymous rare codons are considered to be sub-optimal for gene expression because they are translated more slowly than common codons. Yet surprisingly, many protein coding sequences include large clusters of synonymous rare codons. Rare codons at the 5’ terminus of coding sequences have been shown to increase translational efficiency. Although a general functional role for synonymous rare codons farther within coding sequences has not yet been established, several recent reports have identified rare-to-common synonymous codon substitutions that impair folding of the encoded protein. Here we test the hypothesis that although the usage frequencies of synonymous codons change from organism to organism, codon rarity will be conserved at specific positions in a set of homologous coding sequences, for example to tune translation rate without altering a protein sequence. Such conservation of rarity–rather than specific codon identity–could coordinate co-translational folding of the encoded protein. We demonstrate that many rare codon cluster positions are indeed conserved within homologous coding sequences across diverse eukaryotic, bacterial, and archaeal species, suggesting they result from positive selection and have a functional role. Most conserved rare codon clusters occur within rather than between conserved protein domains, challenging the view that their primary function is to facilitate co-translational folding after synthesis of an autonomous structural unit. Instead, many conserved rare codon clusters separate smaller protein structural motifs within structural domains. These smaller motifs typically fold faster than an entire domain, on a time scale more consistent with translation rate modulation by synonymous codon usage. While proteins with conserved rare codon clusters are structurally and functionally diverse, they are enriched in functions associated with organism growth and development, suggesting an important role for synonymous codon usage in organism physiology. The identification of conserved rare codon clusters advances our understanding of distinct, functional roles for otherwise synonymous codons and enables experimental testing of the impact of synonymous codon usage on the production of functional proteins.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LTnUBqKLU7k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A systems-level model reveals that 1,2-Propanediol utilization microcompartments enhance pathway flux through intermediate sequestration</title>

The spatial organization of metabolism is common to all domains of life. Enteric and other bacteria use subcellular organelles known as bacterial microcompartments to spatially organize the metabolism of pathogenicity-relevant carbon sources, such as 1,2-propanediol. The organelles are thought to sequester a private cofactor pool, minimize the effects of toxic intermediates, and enhance flux through the encapsulated metabolic pathways. We develop a mathematical model of the function of the 1,2-propanediol utilization microcompartment of &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/i&gt; and use it to analyze the function of the microcompartment organelles in detail. Our model makes accurate estimates of doubling times based on an optimized compartment shell permeability determined by maximizing metabolic flux in the model. The compartments function primarily to decouple cytosolic intermediate concentrations from the concentrations in the microcompartment, allowing significant enhancement in pathway flux by the generation of large concentration gradients across the microcompartment shell. We find that selective permeability of the microcompartment shell is not absolutely necessary, but is often beneficial in establishing this intermediate-trapping function. Our findings also implicate active transport of the 1,2-propanediol substrate under conditions of low external substrate concentration, and we present a mathematical bound, in terms of external 1,2-propanediol substrate concentration and diffusive rates, on when active transport of the substrate is advantageous. By allowing us to predict experimentally inaccessible aspects of microcompartment function, such as intra-microcompartment metabolite concentrations, our model presents avenues for future research and underscores the importance of carefully considering changes in external metabolite concentrations and other conditions during batch cultures. Our results also suggest that the encapsulation of heterologous pathways in bacterial microcompartments might yield significant benefits for pathway flux, as well as for toxicity mitigation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LNEkJwfg_Ag&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) show outstanding performance in targeted high-throughput resequencing, being the most promising approach for the accurate identification of rare variants in complex DNA samples. This approach has application in multiple areas, including cancer diagnostics, thus demanding dedicated software and algorithms. Here we introduce MAGERI, a computational pipeline that efficiently handles all caveats of UMI-based analysis to obtain high-fidelity mutation profiles and call ultra-rare variants. Using an extensive set of benchmark datasets including gold-standard biological samples with known variant frequencies, cell-free DNA from tumor patient blood samples and publicly available UMI-encoded datasets we demonstrate that our method is both robust and efficient in calling rare variants. The versatility of our software is supported by accurate results obtained for both tumor DNA and viral RNA samples in datasets prepared using three different UMI-based protocols.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/f2FC_Y8VHZU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Rhythmic production of consonant-vowel syllables synchronizes traveling waves in speech-processing brain regions. (arXiv:1705.01615v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01615</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01615</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nature is abundant in oscillatory activity, with oscillators that have the
remarkable ability of synchronizing to external events. Using
electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings from a subject rhythmically producing
consonant-vowel syllables (CVSs) we show that neural oscillators recorded at
individual ECoG electrodes become precisely synchronized to initiations of the
production of CVSs (i.e., that these initiations occur at precise phases of
bandpassed-filtered voltages recorded at most ECoG electrodes). This
synchronization is not a trivial consequence of the rhythmic production of
CVSs, since it takes several minutes to be fully established and is observed at
the frequency of CVS production and at its second harmonic. The phase of
filtered voltages at which CVSs are produced varies systematically across the
grid of electrodes, consistently with the propagation of traveling waves (TWs).
Using these synchronized phases we isolate a first TW in voltages (filtered at
the median CVS-production frequency) moving from primary auditory to premotor
cortex, and a second TW in high-gamma amplitude (coupled to phase at the
CVS-production frequency) moving along the same path but in opposite direction.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of rhythmic motor acts synchronizing
spatio-temporally organized cortical activity in the human brain.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: An integrate-and-fire model to generate spike trains with long memory. (arXiv:1702.03762v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03762</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03762</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Long-range dependence (LRD) has been observed in a variety of phenomena in
nature, and for several years also in the spiking activity of neurons. Often,
this is interpreted as originating from a non-Markovian system. Here we show
that a purely Markovian integrate-and-fire (IF) model, with a noisy slow
adaptation term, can generate data that appears as having LRD with a Hurst
exponent (H) greater than 0.5. A proper analysis shows that the asymptotic
value of H is 0.5 if a long enough sequence of events is taken into account.
For comparison, we also consider a new model of individual IF neuron with
fractional noise. The correlations of its spike trains are studied and proved
to have long memory, unlike classical IF models. On the other hand, to
correctly measure long-range dependence, it is usually necessary to know if the
data are stationary. Thus, a methodology to evaluate stationarity of the
interspike intervals (ISIs) is presented and applied to the various IF models.
In conclusion, the spike trains of our fractional model have the long-range
dependence property, while those from classical Markovian models do not.
However, Markovian IF models may seem to have it because of apparent
non-stationarities.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The models in statistical physics such as an Ising model offer a convenient
way to characterize stationary activity of neural populations. Such stationary
activity of neurons may be expected for recordings from in vitro slices or
anesthetized animals. However, modeling activity of cortical circuitries of
awake animals has been more challenging because both spike-rates and
interactions can change according to sensory stimulation, behavior, or an
internal state of the brain. Previous approaches modeling the dynamics of
neural interactions suffer from computational cost; therefore, its application
was limited to only a dozen neurons. Here by introducing multiple analytic
approximation methods to a state-space model of neural population activity, we
make it possible to estimate dynamic pairwise interactions of up to 60 neurons.
More specifically, we applied the pseudolikelihood approximation to the
state-space model, and combined it with the Bethe or TAP mean-field
approximation to make the sequential Bayesian estimation of the model
parameters possible. The large-scale analysis allows us to investigate dynamics
of macroscopic properties of neural circuitries underlying stimulus processing
and behavior. We show that the model accurately estimates dynamics of network
properties such as sparseness, entropy, and heat capacity by simulated data,
and demonstrate utilities of these measures by analyzing activity of monkey V4
neurons as well as a simulated balanced network of spiking neurons.

	<description>How neuronal diversity emerges from complex patterns of gene expression remains poorly understood. Here we present an approach to understand electrophysiological diversity through gene expression by integrating transcriptomics with intracellular electrophysiology. Using a brain-wide dataset of 34 neuron types, we identified 420 genes whose expression levels significantly correlated with variability in one or more of 11 electrophysiological parameters. The majority of these correlations were consistent in an independent sample of 12 visual cortex cell types. Many associations reported here have the potential to provide new insights into how neurons generate functional diversity, and correlations of ion channel genes like Gabrd and Scn1a (Nav1.1) with resting potential and spiking frequency are consistent with known causal mechanisms. These results suggest that despite the complexity linking gene expression to electrophysiology, there are likely some general principles that govern how individual genes establish phenotypic diversity across very different cell types.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Optogenetic Characterization Of CeA CRF Pathways In Alcohol Dependence</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/134759v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>In alcohol dependent animals, withdrawal from alcohol activates a neuronal ensemble in the central nucleus of amygdala (CeA) that is responsible for escalation of alcohol drinking. However, the neuronal phenotype and neuronal pathways controlled by these neurons is unknown. We investigated the cellular identity of this CeA neuronal ensemble and found that most neurons express corticotropin releasing factor (CRF). Using Crh-Cre transgenic rats combined with in vivo optogenetics, we tested if inactivation of CeA CRF neurons prevents excessive alcohol self-administration during withdrawal. Rats were injected with AAV-DIO-NpHR-eYFP or AAV-DIO-eYFP (control) and implanted with optical fibers in the CeA. Animals were then exposed to chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) to induce alcohol dependence. Inactivation of CeA CRF neurons decreased alcohol drinking in dependent rats to levels observed before the animals became dependent, and completely prevented the activation of the entire CeA neuronal ensemble (Fos+ neurons) during withdrawal. No effect was observed in the AAV-DIO-eYFP control group or on water or saccharin self-administration in either group. In a second experiment, rats were injected with AAV-DIO-NpHR-eYFP in the CeA and optical fibers were implanted into downstream projection regions of CeA CRF neurons including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), lateral hypothalamus (LH), parasubthalamic (pSTN), substantia innominata (SI) or parabrachial nuclei (PBN). Optogenetic inactivation of CRF terminals in the BNST recapitulated the effect on alcohol drinking observed with inactivation of CeA CRF cell bodies, whereas inactivation of the LH, SI or PBN had no effect. Taken together, these results demonstrate that activation of CeA CRF neurons during withdrawal is required for the recruitment of the CeA neuronal ensemble that is responsible for excessive alcohol drinking in dependent rats, and that the CRF projection to the BNST, but not the LH, pSTN, SI, and PBN is the main downstream pathway responsible for excessive alcohol drinking in dependent rats.</description>

	<description>The minimum audible movement angle increases as a function of source azimuth. If listeners do not perceptually compensate for this change in acuity, then sounds rotating around the head should appear to move faster at the front than at the side. We examined whether judgments of relative amounts of acoustic motion depend on signal center angle and found that the azimuth of two signals strongly affects their point of subjective similarity for motion. Signal motion centered at 90{degrees} had to be roughly twice as large as motion centered at 0{degrees} to be judged as equivalent. This distortion of acoustic space around the listener suggests that the perceived velocity of moving sound sources changes as a function of azimuth around the head. The &quot;equivalent arc ratio,&quot; a mathematical framework based on these results, is used to successfully provide quantitative explanations for previously documented discrepancies in spatial localization, motion perception, and head-to-world coordinate transformations.</description>

	<description>Visual systems transduce, process and transmit light-dependent environmental cues. Computation of visual features depends on the types of photoreceptor neurons (PR) present, the organization of the eye and the wiring of the underlying neural circuit. Here, we describe the circuit architecture of the visual system of Drosophila larvae by mapping the synaptic wiring diagram and neurotransmitters. By contacting different targets, the two larval PR-subtypes create parallel circuits potentially underlying the computation of absolute light intensity and temporal light changes already within this first visual processing center. Locally processed visual information then signals via dedicated projection interneurons to higher brain areas including the lateral horn and mushroom body. The stratified structure of the LON suggests common organizational principles with the adult fly and vertebrate visual systems. The complete synaptic wiring diagram of the LON paves the way to understanding how circuits with reduced numerical complexity control wide ranges of behaviors.</description>

Protrusion and retraction of lamellipodia are common features of eukaryotic cell motility. As a cell migrates through its extracellular matrix (ECM), lamellipod growth increases cell-ECM contact area and enhances engagement of integrin receptors, locally amplifying ECM input to internal signaling cascades. In contrast, contraction of lamellipodia results in reduced integrin engagement that dampens the level of ECM-induced signaling. These changes in cell shape are both influenced by, and feed back onto ECM signaling. Motivated by experimental observations on melanoma cells lines (1205Lu and SBcl2) migrating on fibronectin (FN) coated topographic substrates (anisotropic post-density arrays), we probe this interplay between intracellular and ECM signaling. Experimentally, cells exhibited one of three lamellipodial dynamics: persistently polarized, random, or oscillatory, with competing lamellipodia oscillating out of phase (Park et al., 2017). Pharmacological treatments, changes in FN density, and substrate topography all affected the fraction of cells exhibiting these behaviours. We use these observations as constraints to test a sequence of hypotheses for how intracellular (GTPase) and ECM signaling jointly regulate lamellipodial dynamics. The models encoding these hypotheses are predicated on mutually antagonistic Rac-Rho signaling, Rac-mediated protrusion (via activation of Arp2/3 actin nucleation) and Rho-mediated contraction (via ROCK phosphorylation of myosin light chain), which are coupled to ECM signaling that is modulated by protrusion/contraction. By testing each model against experimental observations, we identify how the signaling layers interact to generate the diverse range of cell behaviors, and how various molecular perturbations and changes in ECM signaling modulate the fraction of cells exhibiting each. We identify several factors that play distinct but critical roles in generating the observed dynamic: (1) competition between lamellipodia for shared pools of Rac and Rho, (2) activation of RhoA by ECM signaling, and (3) feedback from lamellipodial growth or contraction to cell-ECM contact area and therefore to the ECM signaling level.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0dOY9je4PeE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Top-down control of cortical gamma-band communication via pulvinar induced phase shifts in the alpha rhythm</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Silvan Quax, Ole Jensen, Paul Tiesinga&lt;/p&gt;

Selective routing of information between cortical areas is required in order to combine different sources of information according to cognitive demand. Recent experiments have suggested that alpha band activity originating from the pulvinar coordinates this inter-areal cortical communication. Using a computer model we investigated whether top-down induced shifts in the relative alpha phase between two cortical areas could modulate cortical communication, quantified in terms of changes in gamma band coherence between them. The network model was comprised of two uni-directionally connected neuronal populations of spiking neurons, each representing a cortical area. We find that the phase difference of the alpha oscillations modulating the two neuronal populations strongly affected the interregional gamma-band neuronal coherence. We confirmed that a higher gamma band coherence also resulted in more efficient transmission of spiking information between cortical areas, thereby confirming the value of gamma coherence as a proxy for cortical information transmission. In a model where both neuronal populations were connected bi-directionally, the relative alpha phase determined the directionality of communication between the populations. Our results show the feasibility of a physiological realistic mechanism for routing information in the brain based on coupled oscillations. Our model results in a set of testable predictions regarding phase shifts in alpha oscillations under different task demands requiring quantification of neuronal oscillations in different regions in e.g. attention paradigms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/alHtK1rJtLs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Mechanisms underlying different onset patterns of focal seizures</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005475</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Yujiang Wang, Andrew J Trevelyan, Antonio Valentin, Gonzalo Alarcon, Peter N Taylor, Marcus Kaiser&lt;/p&gt;

Focal seizures are episodes of pathological brain activity that appear to arise from a localised area of the brain. The onset patterns of focal seizure activity have been studied intensively, and they have largely been distinguished into two types—low amplitude fast oscillations (LAF), or high amplitude spikes (HAS). Here we explore whether these two patterns arise from fundamentally different mechanisms. Here, we use a previously established computational model of neocortical tissue, and validate it as an adequate model using clinical recordings of focal seizures. We then reproduce the two onset patterns in their most defining properties and investigate the possible mechanisms underlying the different focal seizure onset patterns in the model. We show that the two patterns are associated with different mechanisms at the spatial scale of a single ECoG electrode. The LAF onset is initiated by independent patches of localised activity, which slowly invade the surrounding tissue and coalesce over time. In contrast, the HAS onset is a global, systemic transition to a coexisting seizure state triggered by a local event. We find that such a global transition is enabled by an increase in the excitability of the “healthy” surrounding tissue, which by itself does not generate seizures, but can support seizure activity when incited. In our simulations, the difference in surrounding tissue excitability also offers a simple explanation of the clinically reported difference in surgical outcomes. Finally, we demonstrate in the model how changes in tissue excitability could be elucidated, in principle, using active stimulation. Taken together, our modelling results suggest that the excitability of the tissue surrounding the seizure core may play a determining role in the seizure onset pattern, as well as in the surgical outcome.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/inZ1GBSMWus&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Mutations in the nuclear gene, &lt;em&gt;TK2&lt;/em&gt;, cause TK2 deficiency, which manifests predominantly in children as myopathy with mtDNA depletion. Molecular bypass therapy with the TK2 products, deoxycytidine monophosphate (dCMP) and deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP), prolongs the life span of Tk2-deficient (Tk2&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;) mice by 2- to 3-fold. Because we observed rapid catabolism of the deoxynucleoside monophosphates to deoxythymidine (dT) and deoxycytidine (dC), we hypothesized that: (1) deoxynucleosides might be the major active agents and (2) inhibition of deoxycytidine deamination might enhance dTMP+dCMP therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In contrast, dCMP+dTMP+THU therapy decreased life span of Tk2&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; animals compared to dCMP+dTMP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We studied whether continuous lower normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid β1-42 (≥640pg/ml) levels were related with rate of clinical progression in a sample of 393 nondemented memory clinic patients. Lower normal levels were associated with faster clinical progression, and this depended on baseline cognitive status (subjective cognitive decline: hazard ratio [HR] = 0.57, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05; mild cognitive impairment: HR = 0.19, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .01), indicating that normal CSF amyloid levels do not exclude incident Alzheimer disease. These findings suggest that research on preclinical markers for Alzheimer disease should take the continuum of CSF amyloid β1-42 levels within the normal range into account.

Two approaches were used: gray scale level (GSL), measured from the ultrasound image, and quantitative backscatter analysis (QBA), measured directly from the received echoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

We used a linear mixed effects model with random intercept and slope terms to compare trajectories of GSL, QBA, and functional assessments. We analyzed separately a subset of boys who initiated corticosteroids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

QBA performed similarly to GSL (eg, DMD boys &amp;gt; 7 years old: 0.41dB/mo, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.01, 95% CI = 0.096–0.72, in anterior forearm at 6 months). Ultrasound identified differences earlier than functional measures including 6-minute walk and supine-to-stand tests. However, neither QBA nor GSL showed an effect of corticosteroid initiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In this study, we evaluated whether electrical impedance myography (EIM) could serve this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24874-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this nonblinded study, 36 boys with DMD and 29 age-similar healthy boys underwent multifrequency EIM measurements for up to 2 years on 6 muscles unilaterally along with functional assessments. A linear mixed-effects model with random intercept and slope terms was used for the analysis of multifrequency EIM values and functional measures. Seven DMD boys were initiated on corticosteroids; these data were analyzed using a piecewise linear mixed-effects model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24874-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In boys &amp;gt; 7.0 years old, a significant difference in the slope of EIM phase ratio trajectories in the upper extremity was observed by 6 months of −0.074/month, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.023, 95% confidence interval (CI) = −0.013, −0.14; at 2 years, this difference was −0.048/month, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001, 95% CI = −0.028, −0.068. In boys ≤ 7.0 years old, differences appeared at 6 months in gastrocnemius (EIM phase slope = −0.83 °/kHz/mo, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.007, 95% CI = −0.26, −1.40). EIM outcomes showed significant differences earlier than functional tests. Initiation of corticosteroids significantly improved the slope of EIM phase ratio (0.057/mo, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.00019, 95% CI = 0.028, 0.086) and EIM phase slope (0.14 °/kHz/mo, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.013, 95% CI = 0.028, 0.25), consistent with corticosteroids' known clinical benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Because EIM is rapid to apply, painless, and requires minimal operator training, the technique deserves to be further evaluated as a biomarker in DMD clinical therapeutic trials.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Balanced Excitation and Inhibition are Required for High-Capacity, Noise-Robust Neuronal Selectivity. (arXiv:1705.01502v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01502</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01502</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurons and networks in the cerebral cortex must operate reliably despite
multiple sources of noise. To evaluate the impact of both input and output
noise, we determine the robustness of single-neuron stimulus selective
responses, as well as the robustness of attractor states of networks of neurons
performing memory tasks. We find that robustness to output noise requires
synaptic connections to be in a balanced regime in which excitation and
inhibition are strong and largely cancel each other. We evaluate the conditions
required for this regime to exist and determine the properties of networks
operating within it. A plausible synaptic plasticity rule for learning that
balances weight configurations is presented. Our theory predicts an optimal
ratio of the number of excitatory and inhibitory synapses for maximizing the
encoding capacity of balanced networks for a given statistics of afferent
activations. Previous work has shown that balanced networks amplify
spatio-temporal variability and account for observed asynchronous irregular
states. Here we present a novel type of balanced network that amplifies small
changes in the impinging signals, and emerges automatically from learning to
perform neuronal and network functions robustly.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Target-distractor Synchrony Affects Performance in a Novel Motor Task for Studying Action Selection. (arXiv:1705.01436v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01436</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The study of action selection in humans can present challenges of task design
since our actions are usually defined by many degrees of freedom and therefore
occupy a large action-space. While saccadic eye-movement offers a more
constrained paradigm for investigating action selection, the study of
reach-and-grasp in upper limbs has often been defined by more complex
scenarios, not easily interpretable in terms of such selection. Here we present
a novel motor behaviour task which addresses this by limiting the action space
to a single degree of freedom in which subjects have to track (using a stylus)
a vertical coloured target line displayed on a tablet computer, whilst ignoring
a similarly oriented distractor line in a different colour. We ran this task
with 55 subjects and showed that, in agreement with previous studies, the
presence of the distractor generally increases the movement latency and
directional error rate. Further, we used two distractor conditions according to
whether the distractor's location changes asynchronously or synchronously with
the location of the target. We found that the asynchronous distractor yielded
poorer performance than its synchronous counterpart, with significantly higher
movement latencies and higher error rates. We interpret these results in an
action selection framework with two actions (move left or right) and competing
'action requests' offered by the target and distractor. As such, the results
provide insights into action selection performance in humans and supply data
for directly constraining future computational models therein.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A Rule-Based Computational Model of Cognitive Arithmetic. (arXiv:1705.01208v1 [cs.AI])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive arithmetic studies the mental processes used in solving math
problems. This area of research explores the retrieval mechanisms and
strategies used by people during a common cognitive task. Past research has
shown that human performance in arithmetic operations is correlated to the
numerical size of the problem. Past research on cognitive arithmetic has
pinpointed this trend to either retrieval strength, error checking, or
strategy-based approaches when solving equations. This paper describes a
rule-based computational model that performs the four major arithmetic
operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) on two
operands. We then evaluated our model to probe its validity in representing the
prevailing concepts observed in psychology experiments from the related works.
The experiments specifically explore the problem size effect, an
activation-based model for fact retrieval, backup strategies when retrieval
fails, and finally optimization strategies when faced with large operands. From
our experimental results, we concluded that our model's response times were
comparable to results observed when people performed similar tasks during
psychology experiments. The fit of our model in reproducing these results and
incorporating accuracy into our model are discussed.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Untuned But Not Irrelevant: A Role For Untuned Neurons In Sensory Information Coding</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/134379v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/134379v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>In the sensory systems, most neurons' firing rates are tuned to at least one aspect of the stimulus. Other neurons are untuned, meaning that their firing rates appear not to depend on the stimulus. Previous work on information coding in neural populations has ignored the untuned neurons, based on the tacit assumption that they are unimportant. Using theoretical calculations and analyses of in vivo neural data, I show that untuned neurons can contribute significantly to the population code. Ignoring untuned neurons can lead to severe underestimates of the amount of stimulus information encoded, and in some cases population codes can be made more informative by replacing tuned neurons with untuned ones.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Increases Phase-Amplitude Coupling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/134239v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/134239v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>A prominent feature of brain activity with relevance to cognitive processes is Phase-Amplitude Coupling (PAC) between slow and fast oscillatory signals. A newly developed neural mass model of cross-frequency coupling [1] predicts, counter-intuitively, that PAC shows sustained increases after repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS). This is because rTMS leads to simultaneous neuronal firing in distinct regions, thereby enhancing the connectivity that, according to the model, is needed for PAC to be increased. We tested this prediction in healthy human volunteers. Two seconds of 10Hz rTMS were applied to the intraparietal sulcus, temporal-parietal junction, and lateral occipital complex. PAC in the subsequent electro-encephalogram was analyzed for two band pairs, theta-gamma and alpha-gamma, and compared to a sham condition. For all stimulation loci, PAC was higher in both band pairs after rTMS than in the sham condition. These results were found to be conform the model prediction. The perspective for using rTMS to modulate cross-band coupling is discussed.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Fronto-parietal Organization for Response Times in Inhibition of Return: The FORTIOR Model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/134163v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/134163v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Inhibition of Return (IOR) refers to a slowing of response times (RTs) for visual stimuli repeated at the same spatial location, as compared to stimuli occurring at novel locations. The functional mechanisms and the neural bases of this phenomenon remain debated. Here we present FORTIOR, a model of the cortical control of IOR in the human brain. The model is based on known facts about the anatomical and functional organization of fronto-parietal attention networks, and accounts for a broad range of behavioral findings in healthy participants and brain-damaged patients. FORTIOR does that by combining four principles of asymmetry: a) Asymmetry in the networks topography, whereby the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) nodes are lateralized to the right hemisphere, causing higher activation levels in the right intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and frontal eye field (FEF) nodes; b) Asymmetry in inter-hemispheric connectivity, in which inter-hemispheric connections from left hemisphere IPS to right hemisphere IPS and from left hemisphere FEF to right hemisphere FEF are weaker than in the opposite direction; c) Asymmetry of visual inputs, stipulating that the FEF receives direct visual input coming from the ipsilateral visual cortex, while the right TPJ and vlPFC and IPS nodes receive input from both the contralateral and the ipsilateral visual fields; d) Asymmetry in the response modality, with a higher response threshold for the manual response system than that required to trigger a saccadic response. This asymmetry results in saccadic IOR being more reliable and robust to interference than manual IOR. FORTIOR accounts for spatial asymmetries in the occurrence of IOR after brain damage and after non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation on parietal and frontal regions. It also provides a framework to understand dissociations between manual and saccadic IOR, and makes testable predictions for future experiments to assess its validity.</description>

	<description>The goal of computational neuroscience is to find mechanistic explanations of how the nervous system processes information to support cognitive function and behaviour. At the heart of the field are its models, i.e. mathematical and computational descriptions of the system being studied. These models typically map sensory stimuli to neural responses and/or neural to behavioural responses and range for simple to complex. Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs), using either feedforward and recurrent architectures, have come to dominate several domains of artificial intelligence (AI). As the term &quot;neural network&quot; suggests, these models are inspired by biological brains. However, current DNN models abstract from many details of biological neural networks. Their abstractions contribute to their computational efficiency, enabling to perform complex feats of intelligence, ranging from perceptual tasks (e.g. visual object and auditory speech recognition) to cognitive tasks (e.g. machine translation), and on to motor control tasks (e.g. playing computer games or controlling a robot arm). In addition to their ability to model complex intelligent behaviours, DNNs have been shown to predict neural responses to novel sensory stimuli that cannot be predicted with any other currently available type of model. DNNs can have millions of parameters (connection strengths), which are required to capture the domain knowledge needed for task performance. These parameters are often set by task training using stochastic gradient descent. The computational properties of the units are the result of four directly manipulable elements: input statistics, network structure, functional objective, and learning algorithm. The advances with neural nets in engineering provide the technological basis for building task-performing models of varying degrees of biological realism that promise substantial insights for computational neuroscience.</description>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Degeneration of oligodendroglial distal processes has been identified as an early event in MS lesion development. Our objective was to further define the development of the “dying-back” oligodendrocyte lesion in situ and to model the development and potential reversibility of such responses using dissociated cultures of adult human brain-derived oligodendrocytes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt; In situ analyses were performed on glutaraldehyde-fixed thin sections of clinically acute and pathologically active cases of MS. In vitro studies were conducted using adult human brain-derived oligodendrocytes challenged by metabolic stress conditions (low nutrient/glucose).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: In situ analyses indicated a spectrum of myelin changes in the presence of morphologically intact oligodendrocytes; these included degeneration of the inner cytoplasmic tongue with increasing sizes of intramyelinic bleb formation that could result in radial fractures of the myelin sheath. Macrophages with ingested myelin fragments were identified only once the fragmentation was established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In vitro studies indicated that oligodendrocyte process retraction that was linked to reduced glycolytic respiratory activity is reversible until a critical time point. Subsequent cell death was not linked to caspase-3 dependent programs. Gene expression studies conducted at the latest reversible time point revealed reduced expression of pathways associated with cell process outgrowth and myelination, as well as with metabolic activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Our findings reveal the potential to protect and possibly restore myelin elaborated by existent oligodendrocytes in early and evolving MS lesions, and suggest the necessity of ongoing studies on the mechanisms underlying subsequent adult human oligodendrocyte cell death.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: STN-DBS is neuroprotective in the A53T α-synuclein Parkinson's disease rat model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24947</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a highly effective symptomatic therapy for motor deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD). An additional, disease-modifying effect has been suspected from studies in toxin-based PD animal models, but these models do not reflect the molecular pathology and progressive nature of PD, that would be required to evaluate a disease-modifying action. Defining a disease-modifying effect, could radically change the way in which DBS is used in PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We applied STN-DBS in an AAV1/2-driven human mutated A53T α-synuclein (aSyn)-overexpressing PD rat model (AAV1/2-A53T-aSyn). Rats were injected unilaterally, in the substantia nigra (SN), with AAV1/2-A53T-aSyn or control vector. Three weeks later, after behavioural and nigrostriatal dopaminergic deficits had developed, rats underwent STN-DBS electrode implantation ipsilateral to the vector-injected SN. Stimulation lasted for three weeks. Control groups remained OFF stimulation. Animals were sacrificed at six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Motor performance in the single pellet reaching task was impaired in the AAV1/2-A53T-aSyn injected stim-OFF group, six weeks after AAV1/2-A53T-aSyn injection, compared to pre-operative levels (-82%, P&amp;lt;0.01). Deficits were reversed in AAV1/2-A53T-aSyn, stim-ON rats after three weeks of active stimulation, compared to the AAV1/2-A53T-aSyn stim-OFF rats (an increase of ∼400%, P&amp;lt;0.05), demonstrating a beneficial effect of DBS. This motor improvement was maintained when the stimulation was turned off and was accompanied by a higher number of TH+ SN neurons (increase of ∼29%), compared to AAV1/2-A53T-aSyn stim-OFF rats (P&amp;lt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prognostication studies on comatose cardiac arrest (CA) patients are limited by lack of blinding, potentially causing overestimation of outcome predictors and self-fulfilling prophecy. Using a blinded approach, we analysed the value of quantitative automated pupillometry to predict neurological recovery after CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We examined a prospective cohort of 103 comatose adult patients who were unconscious 48 hours after CA and underwent repeated measurements of quantitative pupillary light reflex (PLR) using the Neurolight-Algiscan® device. Clinical examination, electroencephalography (EEG), somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) and serum neuron specific enolase (NSE) were performed in parallel, as part of standard multimodal assessment. Automated pupillometry results were blinded to clinicians involved in patient care. Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) at 1 year was the outcome endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Survivors (n=50 patients; 32 CPC 1, 16 CPC 2, 2 CPC 3) had higher quantitative PLR (median 20 [range 13-41] vs. 11 [0-55] %, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001) and constriction velocity (1.46 [0.85-4.63] vs. 0.94 [0.16-4.97] mm/sec, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001) than non-survivors. At 48 hours, a quantitative PLR &amp;lt;13% had 100% specificity and positive predictive value to predict poor recovery (0% false-positive rate), and provided equal performance than that of EEG and SSEP. Reduced quantitative PLR correlated with higher serum neuron specific enolase (Spearman's &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; -0.52, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reduced quantitative PLR correlates with post-anoxic brain injury and, when compared to standard multimodal assessment, is highly accurate in predicting long-term prognosis after CA. This is the first prognostication study to show the value of automated pupillometry using a blinded approach to minimize self-fulfilling prophecy. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Rabies Tracing of Birthdated Dentate Granule Cells in Rat Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: To understand how monosynaptic inputs onto adult-born dentate granule cells (DGCs) are altered in experimental mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) and whether their integration differs from early-born DGCs that are mature at the time of epileptogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: A dual-virus tracing strategy combining retroviral birthdating with rabies virus-mediated putative retrograde trans-synaptic tracing was used to identify and compare presynaptic inputs onto adult- and early-born DGCs in the rat pilocarpine model of mTLE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Our results demonstrate that hilar ectopic DGCs preferentially synapse onto adult-born DGCs after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) while normotopic DGCs synapse onto both adult- and early-born DGCs. We also find that parvalbumin+ and somatostatin+ interneuron inputs are greatly diminished onto early-born DGCs after SE. However, somatostatin+ interneuron inputs onto adult-born DGCs are maintained, likely due to preferential sprouting. Intriguingly, CA3 pyramidal cell backprojections that specifically target adult-born DGCs arise in the epileptic brain, while axons of interneurons and pyramidal cells in CA1 appear to sprout across the hippocampal fissure to preferentially synapse onto early-born DGCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: These data support the presence of substantial hippocampal circuit remodeling after an epileptogenic insult that generates prominent excitatory monosynaptic inputs, both local recurrent and widespread feedback loops, involving DGCs. Both adult- and early-born DGCs are targets of new inputs from other DGCs as well as from CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells after pilocarpine-treatment, changes that likely contribute to epileptogenesis in experimental mTLE.

The dynamic of cancer is intimately linked to a dysregulation of the cell cycle and signalling pathways. It has been argued that selectivity of treatments could exploit loss of checkpoint function in cancer cells, a concept termed “cyclotherapy”. Quantitative approaches that describe these dysregulations can provide guidance in the design of novel or existing cancer therapies. We describe and illustrate this strategy via a mathematical model of the cell cycle that includes descriptions of the G1-S checkpoint and the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), the EGF signalling pathway and apoptosis. We incorporated sites of action of four drugs (palbociclib, gemcitabine, paclitaxel and actinomycin D) to illustrate potential applications of this approach. We show how drug effects on multiple cell populations can be simulated, facilitating simultaneous prediction of effects on normal and transformed cells. The consequences of aberrant signalling pathways or of altered expression of pro- or anti-apoptotic proteins can thus be compared. We suggest that this approach, particularly if used in conjunction with pharmacokinetic modelling, could be used to predict effects of specific oncogene expression patterns on drug response. The strategy could be used to search for synthetic lethality and optimise combination protocol designs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YEvuoiNxOEQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neural Correlates of Semantic Prediction and Resolution in Sentence Processing</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4848?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Most brain-imaging studies of language comprehension focus on activity following meaningful stimuli. Testing adult human participants with high-density EEG, we show that, already before the presentation of a critical word, context-induced semantic predictions are reflected by a neurophysiological index, which we therefore call the semantic readiness potential (SRP). The SRP precedes critical words if a previous sentence context constrains the upcoming semantic content (high-constraint contexts), but not in unpredictable (low-constraint) contexts. Specific semantic predictions were indexed by SRP sources within the motor system—in dorsolateral hand motor areas for expected hand-related words (e.g., &quot;write&quot;), but in ventral motor cortex for face-related words (&quot;talk&quot;). Compared with affirmative sentences, negated ones led to medial prefrontal and more widespread motor source activation, the latter being consistent with predictive semantic computation of alternatives to the negated expected concept. Predictive processing of semantic alternatives in negated sentences is further supported by a negative-going event-related potential at ~400 ms (N400), which showed the typical enhancement to semantically incongruent sentence endings only in high-constraint affirmative contexts, but not to high-constraint negated ones. These brain dynamics reveal the interplay between semantic prediction and resolution (match vs error) processing in sentence understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Most neuroscientists agree on the eminent importance of predictive mechanisms for understanding basic as well as higher brain functions. This contrasts with a sparseness of brain measures that directly reflects specific aspects of prediction, as they are relevant in the processing of language and thought. Here we show that when critical words are strongly expected in their sentence context, a predictive brain response reflects meaning features of these anticipated symbols already before they appear. The granularity of the semantic predictions was so fine grained that the cortical sources in sensorimotor and medial prefrontal cortex even distinguished between predicted face- or hand-related action words (e.g., the words &quot;lick&quot; or &quot;pick&quot;) and between affirmative and negated sentence meanings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Fluid Intelligence Predicts Novel Rule Implementation in a Distributed Frontoparietal Control Network</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4841?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fluid intelligence has been associated with a distributed cognitive control or multiple-demand (MD) network, comprising regions of lateral frontal, insular, dorsomedial frontal, and parietal cortex. Human fluid intelligence is also intimately linked to task complexity, and the process of solving complex problems in a sequence of simpler, more focused parts. Here, a complex target detection task included multiple independent rules, applied one at a time in successive task epochs. Although only one rule was applied at a time, increasing task complexity (i.e., the number of rules) impaired performance in participants of lower fluid intelligence. Accompanying this loss of performance was reduced response to rule-critical events across the distributed MD network. The results link fluid intelligence and MD function to a process of attentional focus on the successive parts of complex behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Fluid intelligence is intimately linked to the ability to structure complex problems in a sequence of simpler, more focused parts. We examine the basis for this link in the functions of a distributed frontoparietal or multiple-demand (MD) network. With increased task complexity, participants of lower fluid intelligence showed reduced responses to task-critical events. Reduced responses in the MD system were accompanied by impaired behavioral performance. Low fluid intelligence is linked to poor foregrounding of task-critical information across a distributed MD system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Nonsinusoidal Beta Oscillations Reflect Cortical Pathophysiology in Parkinson's Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4830?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4830?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Oscillations in neural activity play a critical role in neural computation and communication. There is intriguing new evidence that the nonsinusoidal features of the oscillatory waveforms may inform underlying physiological and pathophysiological characteristics. Time-domain waveform analysis approaches stand in contrast to traditional Fourier-based methods, which alter or destroy subtle waveform features. Recently, it has been shown that the waveform features of oscillatory beta (13–30 Hz) events, a prominent motor cortical oscillation, may reflect near-synchronous excitatory synaptic inputs onto cortical pyramidal neurons. Here we analyze data from invasive human primary motor cortex (M1) recordings from patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) implanted with a deep brain stimulator (DBS) to test the hypothesis that the beta waveform becomes less sharp with DBS, suggesting that M1 input synchrony may be decreased. We find that, in PD, M1 beta oscillations have sharp, asymmetric, nonsinusoidal features, specifically asymmetries in the ratio between the sharpness of the beta peaks compared with the troughs. This waveform feature is nearly perfectly correlated with beta-high gamma phase-amplitude coupling (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.94), a neural index previously shown to track PD-related motor deficit. Our results suggest that the pathophysiological beta generator is altered by DBS, smoothing out the beta waveform. This has implications not only for the interpretation of the physiological mechanism by which DBS reduces PD-related motor symptoms, but more broadly for our analytic toolkit in general. That is, the often-overlooked time-domain features of oscillatory waveforms may carry critical physiological information about neural processes and dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; To better understand the neural basis of cognition and disease, we need to understand how groups of neurons interact to communicate with one another. For example, there is evidence that parkinsonian bradykinesia and rigidity may arise from an oversynchronization of afferents to the motor cortex, and that these symptoms are treatable using deep brain stimulation. Here we show that the waveform shape of beta (13–30 Hz) oscillations, which may reflect input synchrony onto the cortex, is altered by deep brain stimulation. This suggests that mechanistic inferences regarding physiological and pathophysiological neural communication may be made from the temporal dynamics of oscillatory waveform shape.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Disconnection of the Perirhinal and Postrhinal Cortices Impairs Recognition of Objects in Context But Not Contextual Fear Conditioning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4819?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4819?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The perirhinal cortex (PER) is known to process object information, whereas the rodent postrhinal cortex (POR), homolog to the parahippocampal cortex in primates, is thought to process spatial information. A number of studies, however, provide evidence that both areas are involved in processing contextual information. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the rat POR relies on object information received from the PER to form complex representations of context. Using three fear-conditioning (FC) paradigms (signaled, unsignaled, and renewal) and two context-guided object recognition tasks (with 3D and 2D objects), we examined the effects of crossed excitotoxic lesions to the POR and the contralateral PER. Performance of rats with crossed lesions was compared with that of rats with ipsilateral POR plus PER lesions and sham-operated rats. We found that rats with contralateral PER–POR lesions were impaired in object–context recognition but not in contextual FC. Therefore, interaction between the POR and PER is necessary for context-guided exploratory behavior but not for associating fear with context. Our results provide evidence for the hypothesis that the POR relies on object and pattern information from the PER to encode representations of context. The association of fear with a context, however, may be supported by alternate cortical and/or subcortical pathways when PER–POR interaction is not available. Our results suggest that contextual FC may represent a special case of context-guided behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Representations of context are important for perception, memory, decision making, and other cognitive processes. Moreover, there is extensive evidence that the use of contextual representations to guide appropriate behavior is disrupted in neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders including developmental disorders, schizophrenia, affective disorders, and Alzheimer's disease. Many of these disorders are accompanied by changes in parahippocampal and hippocampal structures. Understanding how context is represented in the brain and how parahippocampal structures are involved will enhance our understanding and treatment of the cognitive and behavioral symptoms associated with neurological disorders and neuropsychiatric disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Active Avoidance: Neural Mechanisms and Attenuation of Pavlovian Conditioned Responding</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4808?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4808?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Patients with anxiety disorders often experience a relapse in symptoms after exposure therapy. Similarly, threat responses acquired during Pavlovian threat conditioning often return after extinction learning. Accordingly, there is a need for alternative methods to persistently reduce threat responding. Studies in rodents have suggested that exercising behavioral control over an aversive stimulus can persistently diminish threat responses, and that these effects are mediated by the amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and striatum. In this fMRI study, we attempted to translate these findings to humans. Subjects first underwent threat conditioning. We then contrasted two forms of safety learning: active avoidance, in which participants could prevent the shock through an action, and yoked extinction, with shock presentation matched to the active condition, but without instrumental control. The following day, we assessed subjects' threat responses (measured by skin conductance) to the conditioned stimuli without shock. Subjects next underwent threat conditioning with novel stimuli. Yoked extinction subjects showed an increase in conditioned response to stimuli from the previous day, but the active avoidance group did not. Additionally, active avoidance subjects showed reduced conditioned responding during novel threat conditioning, but the extinction group did not. We observed between-group differences in striatal BOLD responses to shock omission in Avoidance/Extinction. These findings suggest a differential role for the striatum in human active avoidance versus extinction learning, and indicate that active avoidance may be more effective than extinction in persistently diminishing threat responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Extinguished threat responses often reemerge with time, highlighting the importance of identifying more enduring means of attenuation. We compared the effects of active avoidance learning and yoked extinction on threat responses in humans and contrasted the neural circuitry engaged by these two processes. Subjects who learned to prevent a shock through an action maintained low threat responses after safety learning and showed attenuated threat conditioning with novel stimuli, in contrast to those who underwent yoked extinction. The results suggest that experiences of active control over threat engage the striatum and promote a shift from expression of innate defensive responses toward more adaptive behavioral responses to threatening stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Perineurial Glial Plasticity and the Role of TGF-{beta} in the Development of the Blood-Nerve Barrier</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4790?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Precisely orchestrated interactions between spinal motor axons and their ensheathing glia are vital for forming and maintaining functional spinal motor nerves. Following perturbations to peripheral myelinating glial cells, centrally derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) ectopically exit the spinal cord and myelinate peripheral nerves in myelin with CNS characteristics. However, whether remaining peripheral ensheathing glia, such as perineurial glia, properly encase the motor nerve despite this change in glial cell and myelin composition, remains unknown. Using zebrafish mutants in which OPCs migrate out of the spinal cord and myelinate peripheral motor axons, we assayed perineurial glial development, maturation, and response to injury. Surprisingly, in the presence of OPCs, perineurial glia exited the CNS normally. However, aspects of their development, response to injury, and function were altered compared with wildtype larvae. In an effort to better understand the plasticity of perineurial glia in response to myelin perturbations, we identified transforming growth factor-β1 as a partial mediator of perineurial glial development. Together, these results demonstrate the incredible plasticity of perineurial glia in the presence of myelin perturbations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Peripheral neuropathies can result from damage or dysregulation of the insulating myelin sheath surrounding spinal motor axons, causing pain, inefficient nerve conduction, and the ectopic migration of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), the resident myelinating glial cell of the CNS, into the periphery. How perineurial glia, the ensheathing cells that form the protective blood–nerve barrier, are impacted by this myelin composition change is unknown. Here, we report that certain aspects of perineurial glial development and injury responses are mostly unaffected in the presence of ectopic OPCs. However, perineurial glial function is disrupted along nerves containing centrally derived myelin, demonstrating that, although perineurial glial cells display plasticity despite myelin perturbations, the blood–nerve barrier is compromised in the presence of ectopic OPCs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Odorant Sensory Input Modulates DNA Secondary Structure Formation and Heterogeneous Ribonucleoprotein Recruitment on the Tyrosine Hydroxylase and Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase 1 Promoters in the Olfactory Bulb</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4778?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4778?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Adaptation of neural circuits to changes in sensory input can modify several cellular processes within neurons, including neurotransmitter biosynthesis levels. For a subset of olfactory bulb interneurons, activity-dependent changes in GABA are reflected by corresponding changes in &lt;i&gt;Glutamate decarboxylase 1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Gad1&lt;/i&gt;) expression levels. Mechanisms regulating &lt;i&gt;Gad1&lt;/i&gt; promoter activity are poorly understood, but here we show that a conserved G:C-rich region in the mouse &lt;i&gt;Gad1&lt;/i&gt; proximal promoter region both recruits heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) that facilitate transcription and forms single-stranded DNA secondary structures associated with transcriptional repression. This promoter architecture and function is shared with &lt;i&gt;Tyrosine hydroxylase&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Th&lt;/i&gt;), which is also modulated by odorant-dependent activity in the olfactory bulb. This study shows that the balance between DNA secondary structure formation and hnRNP binding on the mouse &lt;i&gt;Th&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Gad1&lt;/i&gt; promoters in the olfactory bulb is responsive to changes in odorant-dependent sensory input. These findings reveal that &lt;i&gt;Th&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Gad1&lt;/i&gt; share a novel transcription regulatory mechanism that facilitates sensory input-dependent regulation of dopamine and GABA expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Adaptation of neural circuits to changes in sensory input can modify several cellular processes within neurons, including neurotransmitter biosynthesis levels. This study shows that transcription of genes encoding rate-limiting enzymes for GABA and dopamine biosynthesis (&lt;i&gt;Gad1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Th&lt;/i&gt;, respectively) in the mammalian olfactory bulb is regulated by G:C-rich regions that both recruit heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) to facilitate transcription and form single-stranded DNA secondary structures associated with repression. hnRNP binding and formation of DNA secondary structure on the &lt;i&gt;Th&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Gad1&lt;/i&gt; promoters are mutually exclusive, and odorant sensory input levels regulate the balance between these regulatory features. These findings reveal that &lt;i&gt;Th&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Gad1&lt;/i&gt; share a transcription regulatory mechanism that facilitates odorant-dependent regulation of dopamine and GABA expression levels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Concurrent tACS-fMRI Reveals Causal Influence of Power Synchronized Neural Activity on Resting State fMRI Connectivity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4766?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) is commonly used to study the brain's intrinsic neural coupling, which reveals specific spatiotemporal patterns in the form of resting state networks (RSNs). It has been hypothesized that slow rs-fMRI oscillations (&amp;lt;0.1 Hz) are driven by underlying electrophysiological rhythms that typically occur at much faster timescales (&amp;gt;5 Hz); however, causal evidence for this relationship is currently lacking. Here we measured rs-fMRI in humans while applying transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to entrain brain rhythms in left and right sensorimotor cortices. The two driving tACS signals were tailored to the individual's α rhythm (8–12 Hz) and fluctuated in amplitude according to a 1 Hz power envelope. We entrained the left versus right hemisphere in accordance to two different coupling modes where either α oscillations were synchronized between hemispheres (phase-synchronized tACS) or the slower oscillating power envelopes (power-synchronized tACS). Power-synchronized tACS significantly increased rs-fMRI connectivity within the stimulated RSN compared with phase-synchronized or no tACS. This effect outlasted the stimulation period and tended to be more effective in individuals who exhibited a naturally weak interhemispheric coupling. Using this novel approach, our data provide causal evidence that synchronized power fluctuations contribute to the formation of fMRI-based RSNs. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that the brain's intrinsic coupling at rest can be selectively modulated by choosing appropriate tACS signals, which could lead to new interventions for patients with altered rs-fMRI connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) has become an important tool to estimate brain connectivity. However, relatively little is known about how slow hemodynamic oscillations measured with fMRI relate to electrophysiological processes. It was suggested that slowly fluctuating power envelopes of electrophysiological signals synchronize across brain areas and that the topography of this activity is spatially correlated to resting state networks derived from rs-fMRI. Here we take a novel approach to address this problem and establish a causal link between the power fluctuations of electrophysiological signals and rs-fMRI via a new neuromodulation paradigm, which exploits these power synchronization mechanisms. These novel mechanistic insights bridge different scientific domains and are of broad interest to researchers in the fields of Medical Imaging, Neuroscience, Physiology, and Psychology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Movement Rate Is Encoded and Influenced by Widespread, Coherent Activity of Cerebellar Molecular Layer Interneurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4751?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4751?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Inhibition from molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) is thought to play an important role in cerebellar function by sharpening the precision of Purkinje cell spike output. Yet the coding features of MLIs during behavior are poorly understood. To study MLI activity, we used &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging in head-fixed mice during the performance of a rhythmic motor behavior, licking during water consumption. MLIs were robustly active during lick-related movement across a lobule-specific region of the cerebellum showing high temporal correspondence within their population. Average MLI Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activity strongly correlated with movement rate but not to the intentional, or unexpected, adjustment of lick position or to sensory feedback that varied with task condition. Chemogenetic suppression of MLI output reduced lick rate and altered tongue movements, indicating that activity of these interneurons not only encodes temporal aspects of movement kinematics but also influences motor outcome pointing to an integral role in online control of rhythmic behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The cerebellum helps fine-tune coordinated motor actions via signaling from projection neurons called Purkinje cells. Molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) provide powerful inhibition onto Purkinje cells, but little is understood about how this inhibitory circuit is engaged during behavior or what type of information is transmitted through these neurons. Our work establishes that MLIs in the lateral cerebellum are broadly activated during movement with calcium activity corresponding to movement rate. We also show that suppression of MLI output slows and disorganizes the precise movement pattern. Therefore, MLIs are an important circuit element in the cerebellum allowing for accurate motor control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Correlates of Perceptual Orientation Biases in Human Primary Visual Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4744?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4744?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Vision can be considered as a process of probabilistic inference. In a Bayesian framework, perceptual estimates from sensory information are combined with prior knowledge, with a stronger influence of the prior when the sensory evidence is less certain. Here, we explored the behavioral and neural consequences of manipulating stimulus certainty in the context of orientation processing. First, we asked participants to judge whether a stimulus was oriented closer to vertical or the clockwise primary oblique (45°) for two stimulus types (spatially filtered noise textures and sinusoidal gratings) and three manipulations of certainty (orientation bandwidth, contrast, and duration). We found that participants consistently had a bias toward reporting orientation as closer to 45° during conditions of high certainty and that this bias was reduced when sensory evidence was less certain. Second, we measured event-related fMRI BOLD responses in human primary visual cortex (V1) and manipulated certainty via stimulus contrast (100% vs 3%). We then trained a multivariate classifier on the pattern of responses in V1 to cardinal and primary oblique orientations. We found that the classifier showed a bias toward classifying orientation as oblique at high contrast but categorized a wider range of orientations as cardinal for low-contrast stimuli. Orientation classification based on data from V1 thus paralleled the perceptual biases revealed through the behavioral experiments. This pattern of bias cannot be explained simply by a prior for cardinal orientations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Our perception of the world around us is biased through prior expectations rather than necessarily reflecting the true state of our environment. Here, we investigate biases in the visual processing of spatial orientation to understand how prior expectations and current sensory information interact to generate a percept. By degrading visual input in various ways, we are able to quantify the extent to which prior experience affects both perceptual judgments and neural responses in the human visual system. We observe systematic biases in the perception of orientation that correlate with the pattern of activity in the primary visual cortex of the human brain. These results indicate that prior expectations influence neural processing right from the earliest stage of the cortical hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Epigenetic Age Acceleration Assessed with Human White-Matter Images</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4735?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4735?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The accurate estimation of age using methylation data has proved a useful and heritable biomarker, with acceleration in epigenetic age predicting a number of age-related phenotypes. Measures of white matter integrity in the brain are also heritable and highly sensitive to both normal and pathological aging processes across adulthood. We consider the phenotypic and genetic interrelationships between epigenetic age acceleration and white matter integrity in humans. Our goal was to investigate processes that underlie interindividual variability in age-related changes in the brain. Using blood taken from a Mexican-American extended pedigree sample (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 628; age = 23.28–93.11 years), epigenetic age was estimated using the method developed by Horvath (2013). For &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 376 individuals, diffusion tensor imaging scans were also available. The interrelationship between epigenetic age acceleration and global white matter integrity was investigated with variance decomposition methods. To test for neuroanatomical specificity, 16 specific tracts were additionally considered. We observed negative phenotypic correlations between epigenetic age acceleration and global white matter tract integrity (&lt;sub&gt;pheno&lt;/sub&gt; = –0.119, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.028), with evidence of shared genetic (&lt;sub&gt;gene&lt;/sub&gt; = –0.463, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.013) but not environmental influences. Negative phenotypic and genetic correlations with age acceleration were also seen for a number of specific white matter tracts, along with additional negative phenotypic correlations between granulocyte abundance and white matter integrity. These findings (i.e., increased acceleration in epigenetic age in peripheral blood correlates with reduced white matter integrity in the brain and shares common genetic influences) provide a window into the neurobiology of aging processes within the brain and a potential biomarker of normal and pathological brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Epigenetic measures can be used to predict age with a high degree of accuracy and so capture acceleration in biological age, relative to chronological age. The white matter tracts within the brain are also highly sensitive to aging processes. We show that increased biological aging (measured using epigenetic data from blood samples) is correlated with reduced integrity of white matter tracts within the human brain (measured using diffusion tensor imaging) with data from a large sample of Mexican-American families. Given the family design of the sample, we are also able to demonstrate that epigenetic aging and white matter tract integrity also share common genetic influences. Therefore, epigenetic age may be a potential, and accessible, biomarker of brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Strength and Diversity of Inhibitory Signaling Differentiates Primate Anterior Cingulate from Lateral Prefrontal Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4717?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4717?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of the primate play distinctive roles in the mediation of complex cognitive tasks. Compared with the LPFC, integration of information by the ACC can span longer timescales and requires stronger engagement of inhibitory processes. Here, we reveal the synaptic mechanism likely to underlie these differences using &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; patch-clamp recordings of synaptic events and multiscale imaging of synaptic markers in rhesus monkeys. Although excitatory synaptic signaling does not differ, the level of synaptic inhibition is much higher in ACC than LPFC layer 3 pyramidal neurons, with a significantly higher frequency (~6&lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt;) and longer duration of inhibitory synaptic currents. The number of inhibitory synapses and the ratio of cholecystokinin to parvalbumin-positive inhibitory inputs are also significantly higher in ACC compared with LPFC neurons. Therefore, inhibition is functionally and structurally more robust and diverse in ACC than in LPFC, resulting in a lower excitatory: inhibitory ratio and a greater dynamic range for signal integration and network oscillation by the ACC. These differences in inhibitory circuitry likely underlie the distinctive network dynamics in ACC and LPC during normal and pathological brain states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) play temporally distinct roles during the execution of cognitive tasks (rapid working memory during ongoing tasks and long-term memory to guide future action, respectively). Compared with LPFC-mediated tasks, ACC-mediated tasks can span longer timescales and require stronger engagement of inhibition. This study shows that inhibitory signaling is much more robust and diverse in the ACC than in the LPFC. Therefore, there is a lower excitatory: inhibitory synaptic ratio and a greater dynamic range for signal integration and oscillatory behavior in the ACC. These significant differences in inhibitory synaptic transmission form an important basis for the differential timing of cognitive processing by the LPFC and ACC in normal and pathological brain states.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Domain Selectivity in the Parahippocampal Gyrus Is Predicted by the Same Structural Connectivity Patterns in Blind and Sighted Individuals</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4705?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4705?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human ventral occipital temporal cortex contains clusters of neurons that show domain-preferring responses during visual perception. Recent studies have reported that some of these clusters show surprisingly similar domain selectivity in congenitally blind participants performing nonvisual tasks. An important open question is whether these functional similarities are driven by similar innate connections in blind and sighted groups. Here we addressed this question focusing on the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), a region that is selective for large objects and scenes. Based on the assumption that patterns of long-range connectivity shape local computation, we examined whether domain selectivity in PHG is driven by similar structural connectivity patterns in the two populations. Multiple regression models were built to predict the selectivity of PHG voxels for large human-made objects from white matter (WM) connectivity patterns in both groups. These models were then tested using independent data from participants with similar visual experience (two sighted groups) and using data from participants with different visual experience (blind and sighted groups). Strikingly, the WM-based predictions between blind and sighted groups were as successful as predictions between two independent sighted groups. That is, the functional selectivity for large objects of a PHG voxel in a blind participant could be accurately predicted by its WM pattern using the connection-to-function model built from the sighted group data, and vice versa. Regions that significantly predicted PHG selectivity were located in temporal and frontal cortices in both sighted and blind populations. These results show that the large-scale network driving domain selectivity in PHG is independent of vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Recent studies have reported intriguingly similar domain selectivity in sighted and congenitally blind individuals in regions within the ventral visual cortex. To examine whether these similarities originate from similar innate connectional roots, we investigated whether the domain selectivity in one population could be predicted by the structural connectivity pattern of the other. We found that the selectivity for large objects of a PHG voxel in a blind participant could be predicted by its structural connectivity pattern using the connection-to-function model built from the sighted group data, and vice versa. These results reveal that the structural connectivity underlying domain selectivity in the PHG is independent of visual experience, providing evidence for nonvisual representations in this region.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: ST2/IL-33-Dependent Microglial Response Limits Acute Ischemic Brain Injury</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;ST2, a member of the interleukin (IL) 1 receptor family, and its ligand IL-33 play critical roles in immune regulation and inflammatory responses. This study explores the roles of endogenous IL-33/ST2 signaling in ischemic brain injury and elucidates the underlying mechanisms of action. The expression of IL-33 rapidly increased in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes after 60 min transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). ST2 receptor deficiency exacerbated brain infarction 3 d after tMCAO as well as distal permanent MCAO. ST2 deficiency also aggravated neurological deficits up to 7 d after tMCAO. Conversely, intracerebroventricular infusions of IL-33 after tMCAO attenuated brain infarction. Flow cytometry analyses demonstrated high levels of ST2 expression on microglia, and this expression was dramatically enhanced after tMCAO. The absence of ST2 enhanced the expression of M1 polarization markers on microglia/macrophages, and impaired the expression of M2 polarization markers after tMCAO. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies on various types of cultures and coculture systems confirmed that IL-33/ST2 signaling potentiated expression of &lt;i&gt;IL-10&lt;/i&gt; and other M2 genes in primary microglia. The activation of ST2 on microglia led to a protective phenotype that enhanced neuronal survival against oxygen glucose deprivation. Further &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies revealed that IL-33-activated microglia released IL-10, and that this was critical for their neuroprotective effects. Similarly, intracerebroventricular infusions of IL-33 into &lt;i&gt;IL-10&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mice failed to provide neuroprotection against tMCAO &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. These results shed new light on the IL-33/ST2 axis as an immune regulatory mechanism that serves as a natural brake on the progression of ischemic brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This is the first study to identify the function of interleukin (IL) 33/ST2 signaling in poststroke microglial responses and neuroprotection against ischemia. Using two models of ischemic stroke, we demonstrate here that ST2 deficiency shifted microglia/macrophages toward a M1-like phenotype, thereby expanding brain infarcts and exacerbating long-term behavioral deficits after stroke. Using stroke models and various &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; culture and coculture systems, we further characterized a previously undefined mechanism whereby IL-33/ST2 engagement stimulates the production of IL-10 from microglia, which, in turn, enhances neuronal survival upon ischemic challenge. These results shed light on endogenous IL-33/ST2 signaling as a potential immune regulatory mechanism that serves to promote beneficial microglial responses and mitigate ischemic brain injury after stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Densin-180 Controls the Trafficking and Signaling of L-Type Voltage-Gated Cav1.2 Ca2+ Channels at Excitatory Synapses</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4679?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4679?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Voltage-gated Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 and Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.3 (L-type) Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels regulate neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity, and learning and memory. Densin-180 (densin) is an excitatory synaptic protein that promotes Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent facilitation of voltage-gated Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.3 Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels in transfected cells. Mice lacking densin (densin KO) exhibit defects in synaptic plasticity, spatial memory, and increased anxiety-related behaviors—phenotypes that more closely match those in mice lacking Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 than Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.3. Therefore, we investigated the functional impact of densin on Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2. We report that densin is an essential regulator of Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 in neurons, but has distinct modulatory effects compared with its regulation of Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.3. Densin binds to the N-terminal domain of Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2, but not that of Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.3, and increases Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 currents in transfected cells and in neurons. In transfected cells, densin accelerates the forward trafficking of Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 channels without affecting their endocytosis. Consistent with a role for densin in increasing the number of postsynaptic Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 channels, overexpression of densin increases the clustering of Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 in dendrites of hippocampal neurons in culture. Compared with wild-type mice, the cell surface levels of Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 in the brain, as well as Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 current density and signaling to the nucleus, are reduced in neurons from densin KO mice. We conclude that densin is an essential regulator of neuronal Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1 channels and ensures efficient Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling at excitatory synapses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The number and localization of voltage-gated Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels are crucial determinants of neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission. We report that the protein densin-180 is highly enriched at excitatory synapses in the brain and enhances the cell surface trafficking and postsynaptic localization of Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 L-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels in neurons. This interaction promotes coupling of Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 channels to activity-dependent gene transcription. Our results reveal a mechanism that may contribute to the roles of Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 in regulating cognition and mood.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Active Dentate Granule Cells Encode Experience to Promote the Addition of Adult-Born Hippocampal Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4661?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4661?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The continuous addition of new dentate granule cells (DGCs), which is regulated exquisitely by brain activity, renders the hippocampus plastic. However, how neural circuits encode experiences to affect the addition of adult-born neurons remains unknown. Here, we used endoscopic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging to track the real-time activity of individual DGCs in freely behaving mice. For the first time, we found that active DGCs responded to a novel experience by increasing their Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; event frequency preferentially. This elevated activity, which we found to be associated with object exploration, returned to baseline by 1 h in the same environment, but could be dishabituated via introduction to a novel environment. To transition seamlessly between environments, we next established a freely controllable virtual reality system for unrestrained mice. We again observed increased firing of active neurons in a virtual enriched environment. Interestingly, multiple novel virtual experiences increased the number of newborn neurons accumulatively compared with a single experience. Finally, optogenetic silencing of existing DGCs during novel environmental exploration perturbed experience-induced neuronal addition. Our study shows that the adult brain conveys novel, enriched experiences to increase the addition of adult-born hippocampal neurons by increasing the firing of active DGCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Adult brains are constantly reshaping themselves from synapses to circuits as we encounter novel experiences from moment to moment. Importantly, this reshaping includes the addition of newborn hippocampal neurons. However, it remains largely unknown how our circuits encode experience-induced brain activity to govern the addition of new hippocampal neurons. By coupling &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging of dentate granule neurons with a novel, unrestrained virtual reality system for rodents, we discovered that a new experience increased firing of active dentate granule neurons rapidly and robustly. Exploration in multiple novel virtual environments, compared with a single environment, promoted dentate activation and enhanced the addition of new hippocampal neurons accumulatively. Finally, silencing this activation optogenetically during novel experiences perturbed experience-induced neuronal addition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Central and peripheral vision for scene recognition: A neurocomputational modeling exploration. (arXiv:1705.00816v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00816</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00816</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;What are the roles of central and peripheral vision in human scene
recognition? Larson and Loschky (2009) showed that peripheral vision
contributes more than central vision in obtaining maximum scene recognition
accuracy. However, central vision is more efficient for scene recognition than
peripheral, based on the amount of visual area needed for accurate recognition.
In this study, we model and explain the results of Larson and Loschky (2009)
using a neurocomputational modeling approach. We show that the advantage of
peripheral vision in scene recognition, as well as the efficiency advantage for
central vision, can be replicated using state-of-the-art deep neural network
models. In addition, we propose and provide support for the hypothesis that the
peripheral advantage comes from the inherent usefulness of peripheral features.
This result is consistent with data presented by Thibaut, Tran, Szaffarczyk,
and Boucart (2014), who showed that patients with central vision loss can still
categorize natural scenes efficiently. Furthermore, by using a deep
mixture-of-experts model (&quot;The Deep Model,&quot; or TDM) that receives central and
peripheral visual information on separate channels simultaneously, we show that
the peripheral advantage emerges naturally in the learning process: When
trained to categorize scenes, the model weights the peripheral pathway more
than the central pathway. As we have seen in our previous modeling work,
learning creates a transform that spreads different scene categories into
different regions in representational space. Finally, we visualize the features
for the two pathways, and find that different preferences for scene categories
emerge for the two pathways during the training process.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A Proposal for an Electron-Transfer Mechanism of Avian Magnetoreception. (arXiv:1705.00735v1 [physics.bio-ph])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00735</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00735</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In spite of many years of research, the mechanism of avian magnetoreception
remains a mystery due to its seemingly insurmountable intricacies. Recently Xie
and colleagues proposed that IscA1 can act as a protein biocompass due to the
measured intrinsic ferromagneticity, and thus named it MagR. However, Meister's
calculations showed that the interaction energy of the magnetic moment of IscA1
with Earth's magnetic field is five magnitudes smaller than thermal fluctuation
at room temperature. The other long-proposed compass protein is cryptochrome
(Cry) with a mechanism of forming singlet-triplet radical pairs. However, this
sensory mechanism still has no inferable information transmission routes. We
propose a magnetoreception mechanism involving both the Cry and IscA1 proteins,
through which photoinduced electrons are transported to redox-regulated ion
channels to provoke neuronal responses. The structural features of the
Cry-IscA1 complex that make it suitable for long-range electron transfer are
discussed and how the magnetic effect leads to neuronal activity is described.

Multi-regional sequencing provides new opportunities to investigate genetic heterogeneity within or between common tumors from an evolutionary perspective. Several state-of-the-art methods have been proposed for reconstructing cancer evolutionary trees based on multi-regional sequencing data to develop models of cancer evolution. However, there have been few studies on comparisons of a set of cancer evolutionary trees. We propose a clustering method (phyC) for cancer evolutionary trees, in which sub-groups of the trees are identified based on topology and edge length attributes. For interpretation, we also propose a method for evaluating the sub-clonal diversity of trees in the clusters, which provides insight into the acceleration of sub-clonal expansion. Simulation showed that the proposed method can detect true clusters with sufficient accuracy. Application of the method to actual multi-regional sequencing data of clear cell renal carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer allowed for the detection of clusters related to cancer type or phenotype. phyC is implemented with R(≥3.2.2) and is available from https://github.com/ymatts/phyC.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4SZEZkHIn9o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Slow diffusive dynamics in a chaotic balanced neural network</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Nimrod Shaham, Yoram Burak&lt;/p&gt;

It has been proposed that neural noise in the cortex arises from chaotic dynamics in the balanced state: in this model of cortical dynamics, the excitatory and inhibitory inputs to each neuron approximately cancel, and activity is driven by fluctuations of the synaptic inputs around their mean. It remains unclear whether neural networks in the balanced state can perform tasks that are highly sensitive to noise, such as storage of continuous parameters in working memory, while also accounting for the irregular behavior of single neurons. Here we show that continuous parameter working memory can be maintained in the balanced state, in a neural circuit with a simple network architecture. We show analytically that in the limit of an infinite network, the dynamics generated by this architecture are characterized by a continuous set of steady balanced states, allowing for the indefinite storage of a continuous parameter. In finite networks, we show that the chaotic noise drives diffusive motion along the approximate attractor, which gradually degrades the stored memory. We analyze the dynamics and show that the slow diffusive motion induces slowly decaying temporal cross correlations in the activity, which differ substantially from those previously described in the balanced state. We calculate the diffusivity, and show that it is inversely proportional to the system size. For large enough (but realistic) neural population sizes, and with suitable tuning of the network connections, the proposed balanced network can sustain continuous parameter values in memory over time scales larger by several orders of magnitude than the single neuron time scale.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dmVRgyMxy0k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Co-occurring protein phosphorylation are functionally associated</title>

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) add a further layer of complexity to the proteome and regulate a wide range of cellular protein functions. With the increasing number of known PTM sites, it becomes imperative to understand their functional interplays. In this study, we proposed a novel analytical strategy to explore functional relationships between PTM sites by testing their tendency to be modified together (co-occurrence) under the same condition, and applied it to proteome-wide human phosphorylation data collected under 88 different laboratory or physiological conditions. Co-occurring phosphorylation occurs significantly more frequently than randomly expected and include many known examples of cross-talk or functional connections. Such pairs, either within the same phosphoprotein or between interacting partners, are more likely to be in sequence or structural proximity, be phosphorylated by the same kinases, participate in similar biological processes, and show residue co-evolution across vertebrates. In addition, we also found that their co-occurrence states tend to be conserved in orthologous phosphosites in the mouse proteome. Together, our results support that the co-occurring phosphorylation are functionally associated. Comparison with existing methods further suggests that co-occurrence analysis can be a useful complement to uncover novel functional associations between PTM sites.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/e4mrR2lHnOw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Using a DNA polymerase to record intracellular calcium levels has been proposed as a novel neural recording technique, promising massive-scale, single-cell resolution monitoring of large portions of the brain. This technique relies on local storage of neural activity in strands of DNA, followed by offline analysis of that DNA. In simple implementations of this scheme, the time when each nucleotide was written cannot be determined directly by &lt;i&gt;post-hoc&lt;/i&gt; DNA sequencing; the timing data must be estimated instead. Here, we use a Dynamic Time Warping-based algorithm to perform this estimation, exploiting correlations between neural activity and observed experimental variables to translate DNA-based signals to an estimate of neural activity over time. This algorithm improves the parallelizability of traditional Dynamic Time Warping, allowing several-fold increases in computation speed. The algorithm also provides a solution to several critical problems with the molecular recording paradigm: determining recording start times and coping with DNA polymerase pausing. The algorithm can generally locate DNA-based records to within &amp;lt;10% of a recording window, allowing for the estimation of unobserved incorporation times and latent neural tunings. We apply our technique to an &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; motor control neuroscience experiment, using the algorithm to estimate both timings of DNA-based data and the directional tuning of motor cortical cells during a center-out reaching task. We also use this algorithm to explore the impact of polymerase characteristics on system performance, determining the precision of a molecular recorder as a function of its kinetic and error-generating properties. We find useful ranges of properties for DNA polymerase-based recorders, providing guidance for future protein engineering attempts. This work demonstrates a useful general extension to dynamic alignment algorithms, as well as direct applications of that extension toward the development of molecular recorders, providing a necessary stepping stone for future biological work.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tGLlsv46H7c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Although sentences unfold sequentially, one word at a time, most linguistic theories propose that their underlying syntactic structure involves a tree of nested phrases rather than a linear sequence of words. Whether and how the brain builds such structures, however, remains largely unknown. Here, we used human intracranial recordings and...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/BowF4ekL9O0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: When do correlations increase with firing rates in recurrent networks?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005506</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/ikUdtITg91g/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrea K. Barreiro, Cheng Ly&lt;/p&gt;

A central question in neuroscience is to understand how noisy firing patterns are used to transmit information. Because neural spiking is noisy, spiking patterns are often quantified via pairwise correlations, or the probability that two cells will spike coincidentally, above and beyond their baseline firing rate. One observation frequently made in experiments, is that correlations can increase systematically with firing rate. Theoretical studies have determined that stimulus-dependent correlations that increase with firing rate can have beneficial effects on information coding; however, we still have an incomplete understanding of what circuit mechanisms do, or do not, produce this correlation-firing rate relationship. Here, we studied the relationship between pairwise correlations and firing rates in recurrently coupled excitatory-inhibitory spiking networks with conductance-based synapses. We found that with stronger excitatory coupling, a positive relationship emerged between pairwise correlations and firing rates. To explain these findings, we used linear response theory to predict the full correlation matrix and to decompose correlations in terms of graph motifs. We then used this decomposition to explain why covariation of correlations with firing rate—a relationship previously explained in feedforward networks driven by correlated input—emerges in some recurrent networks but not in others. Furthermore, when correlations covary with firing rate, this relationship is reflected in low-rank structure in the correlation matrix.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ikUdtITg91g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Variable habitat conditions drive species covariation in the human microbiota</title>

Two species with similar resource requirements respond in a characteristic way to variations in their habitat—their abundances rise and fall in concert. We use this idea to learn how bacterial populations in the microbiota respond to habitat conditions that vary from person-to-person across the human population. Our mathematical framework shows that habitat fluctuations are sufficient for explaining intra-bodysite correlations in relative species abundances from the Human Microbiome Project. We explicitly show that the relative abundances of closely related species are positively correlated and can be predicted from taxonomic relationships. We identify a small set of functional pathways related to metabolism and maintenance of the cell wall that form the basis of a common resource sharing niche space of the human microbiota.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Wh_9v15ULkA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Personalized glucose forecasting for type 2 diabetes using data assimilation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005232</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/9dbozlTIYLE/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by David J. Albers, Matthew Levine, Bruce Gluckman, Henry Ginsberg, George Hripcsak, Lena Mamykina&lt;/p&gt;

Type 2 diabetes leads to premature death and reduced quality of life for 8% of Americans. Nutrition management is critical to maintaining glycemic control, yet it is difficult to achieve due to the high individual differences in glycemic response to nutrition. Anticipating glycemic impact of different meals can be challenging not only for individuals with diabetes, but also for expert diabetes educators. Personalized computational models that can accurately forecast an impact of a given meal on an individual’s blood glucose levels can serve as the engine for a new generation of decision support tools for individuals with diabetes. However, to be useful in practice, these computational engines need to generate accurate forecasts based on limited datasets consistent with typical self-monitoring practices of individuals with type 2 diabetes. This paper uses three forecasting machines: (i) data assimilation, a technique borrowed from atmospheric physics and engineering that uses Bayesian modeling to infuse data with human knowledge represented in a mechanistic model, to generate real-time, personalized, adaptable glucose forecasts; (ii) model averaging of data assimilation output; and (iii) dynamical Gaussian process model regression. The proposed data assimilation machine, the primary focus of the paper, uses a modified dual unscented Kalman filter to estimate states and parameters, personalizing the mechanistic models. Model selection is used to make a personalized model selection for the individual and their measurement characteristics. The data assimilation forecasts are empirically evaluated against actual postprandial glucose measurements captured by individuals with type 2 diabetes, and against predictions generated by experienced diabetes educators after reviewing a set of historical nutritional records and glucose measurements for the same individual. The evaluation suggests that the data assimilation forecasts compare well with specific glucose measurements and match or exceed in accuracy expert forecasts. We conclude by examining ways to present predictions as forecast-derived range quantities and evaluate the comparative advantages of these ranges.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9dbozlTIYLE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lesion-deficit association studies are important as they can reveal brain regions essential for specific functions, but sometimes appear to yield conflicting results. We aimed to show how pitfalls of lesions studies can be avoided, and converging results obtained, illustrating from studies of the role of posterior superior temporal gyrus in auditory word comprehension. We review published lesion studies on auditory comprehension and present new data from both acute and chronic stroke that address weaknesses in some previous studies. Results demonstrate how convergence of positive results from diverse lesion studies provides strong evidence for the role of a particular region in a given behavior.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Involvement of the cerebellum in Parkinson's disease and Dementia with Lewy bodies</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patient brains with Parkinson's disease or Dementia with Lewy bodies show aggregation of alpha-synuclein in pre-cerebellar brainstem structures. Furthermore, patients exhibit resting tremor, unstable gait and impaired balance which may be associated with cerebellar dysfunction. Therefore, we screened the cerebella of 12 patients with alpha-synucleinopathies for neuropathological changes. Cerebellar nuclei and neighboring white matter displayed numerous aggregates, while lobules were mildly affected. Cerebellar aggregation pathology may suggest a prion-like spread originating from affected precerebellar structures and the high homogeneity between patients with Dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease shows that both diseases likely belong to the same neuropathological spectrum.

&lt;p&gt;α-Synuclein is present at high levels in all neurons and their synapses. We now learn that this protein helps dilate the fusion pore, which forms transiently during vesicle exocytosis, promoting release of certain neurotransmitters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capillary endothelial cells sense neuronal activity-evoked increases in extracellular K+ via KIR2.1 inwardly rectifying K+ channels. The ensuing hyperpolarization travels upstream along the vascular network, reaching arterioles and evoking vasodilation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author: Darran Yates&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two new studies provide new tools for examining mechanisms of plasticity in dendrites. Tang and Yasuda developed new fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based sensors for extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and protein kinase A (PKA), which are implicated in synaptic plasticity, primarily by replacing the fluorophore &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans exhibit socially contagious behaviours, including contagious itching, but studying the underlying mechanisms has been difficult. Yu et al. found that they could socially transmit scratching to mice by allowing them to watch mice with chronic itch. The observer mice showed upregulated neuronal activity &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Author: Darran Yates&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axonal injuries can trigger a process of axonal disintegration known as Wallerian degeneration, which is thought to be largely driven by intrinsic mechanisms in the axon. Here, knocking out the death receptor 6 (Dr6) gene in cultured mouse sympathetic or dorsal root ganglion &lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Pharmacoresistant seizures and cytotoxic cerebral edema are serious complications of ischemic and traumatic brain injury. Intraneuronal Cl− concentration ([Cl−]i) regulation impacts on both cell volume homeostasis and Cl−-permeable GABAA receptor-dependent membrane excitability. Understanding the pleiotropic molecular determinants of neuronal [Cl−]i − cytoplasmic impermeant anions, polyanionic extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoproteins, and plasmalemmal Cl− transporters − could help the identification of novel anticonvulsive and neuroprotective targets.</description>

	<description>We sleep almost one-third of our lives and sleep plays an important role in critical brain functions like memory formation and consolidation. The role of sleep in cerebellar processing, however, constitutes an enigma in the field of neuroscience; we know little about cerebellar sleep-physiology, cerebro–cerebellar interactions during sleep, or the contributions of sleep to cerebellum-dependent memory consolidation. Likewise, we do not understand why cerebellar malfunction can lead to changes in the sleep–wake cycle and sleep disorders.</description>

&lt;p&gt;People have been told that 'brain training' will make them not only better at playing certain games but smarter in general. However, evidence indicates that brain plasticity is specific to the acquired skill. The search for neural mechanisms of transfer of training-induced benefits needs to build on this evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proper construction of neural circuits requires the generation of diverse cell types, their distribution to defined regions, and their specific and appropriate wiring. A major objective in neurobiology has been to understand the molecular determinants that link neural birth to terminal specification and functional &lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Deciphering Neural Codes of Memory during Sleep</title>

	<description>Memories of experiences are stored in the cerebral cortex. Sleep is critical for the consolidation of hippocampal memory of wake experiences into the neocortex. Understanding representations of neural codes of hippocampal–neocortical networks during sleep would reveal important circuit mechanisms in memory consolidation and provide novel insights into memory and dreams. Although sleep-associated ensemble spike activity has been investigated, identifying the content of memory in sleep remains challenging.</description>

&lt;p&gt;The nature and neural implementation of emotions is the subject of vigorous debate. Here, we use Bayesian decision theory to address key complexities in this field and conceptualize emotions in terms of their relationship to survival-relevant behavioural choices. Decision theory indicates which behaviours are optimal &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amyloid precursor protein (APP) gives rise to the amyloid-β peptide and thus has a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. By contrast, the physiological functions of APP and the closely related APP-like proteins (APLPs) remain less well understood. Studying these physiological functions has &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addictive substances hijack the reward system partly via synaptic plasticity onto dopamine neurons. Cadherins may contribute to cocaine-evoked adaptations, supporting the notion that drug addiction is a synaptic disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rate of development of the brain connectome distinguishes adolescents with and without psychiatric symptoms. Those with symptoms exhibit delayed development of connectome distinctiveness as compared to healthy adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal place cells are traditionally thought to represent locations where animals currently are or predict where they are headed. However, new results reveal that place cells also represent distant places that are actively avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
