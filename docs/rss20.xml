Machine learning algorithms trained to predict the regulatory activity of nucleic acid sequences have revealed principles of gene regulation and guided genetic variation analysis. While the human genome has been extensively annotated and studied, model organisms have been less explored. Model organism genomes offer both additional training sequences and unique annotations describing tissue and cell states unavailable in humans. Here, we develop a strategy to train deep convolutional neural networks simultaneously on multiple genomes and apply it to learn sequence predictors for large compendia of human and mouse data. Training on both genomes improves gene expression prediction accuracy on held out and variant sequences. We further demonstrate a novel and powerful approach to apply mouse regulatory models to analyze human genetic variants associated with molecular phenotypes and disease. Together these techniques unleash thousands of non-human epigenetic and transcriptional profiles toward more effective investigation of how gene regulation affects human disease.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kM70y0VLd6s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: A novel riboswitch classification based on imbalanced sequences achieved by machine learning</title>

Riboswitch, a part of regulatory mRNA (50–250nt in length), has two main classes: aptamer and expression platform. One of the main challenges raised during the classification of riboswitch is imbalanced data. That is a circumstance in which the records of a sequences of one group are very small compared to the others. Such circumstances lead classifier to ignore minority group and emphasize on majority ones, which results in a skewed classification. We considered sixteen riboswitch families, to be in accord with recent riboswitch classification work, that contain imbalanced sequences. The sequences were split into training and test set using a newly developed pipeline. From 5460 &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-mers (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; value 1 to 6) produced, 156 features were calculated based on &lt;i&gt;CfsSubsetEval&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;BestFirst&lt;/i&gt; function found in WEKA 3.8. Statistically tested result was significantly difference between balanced and imbalanced sequences (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Besides, each algorithm also showed a significant difference in sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and macro F-score when used in both groups (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Several &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-mers clustered from heat map were discovered to have biological functions and motifs at the different positions like interior loops, terminal loops and helices. They were validated to have a biological function and some are riboswitch motifs. The analysis has discovered the importance of solving the challenges of majority bias analysis and overfitting. Presented results were generalized evaluation of both balanced and imbalanced models, which implies their ability of classifying, to classify novel riboswitches.

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Mathematical modeling of plant cell fate transitions controlled by hormonal signals</title>

Coordination of fate transition and cell division is crucial to maintain the plant architecture and to achieve efficient production of plant organs. In this paper, we analysed the stem cell dynamics at the shoot apical meristem (SAM) that is one of the plant stem cells locations. We designed a mathematical model to elucidate the impact of hormonal signaling on the fate transition rates between different zones corresponding to slowly dividing stem cells and fast dividing transit amplifying cells. The model is based on a simplified two-dimensional disc geometry of the SAM and accounts for a continuous displacement towards the periphery of cells produced in the central zone. Coupling growth and hormonal signaling results in a nonlinear system of reaction-diffusion equations on a growing domain with the growth rate depending on the model components. The model is tested by simulating perturbations in the level of key transcription factors that maintain SAM homeostasis. The model provides new insights on how the transcription factor HECATE is integrated in the regulatory network that governs stem cell differentiation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UQNwiS0rmxI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Structure and function of yeast Lso2 and human CCDC124 bound to hibernating ribosomes</title>

Cells adjust to nutrient deprivation by reversible translational shutdown. This is accompanied by maintaining inactive ribosomes in a hibernation state, in which they are bound by proteins with inhibitory and protective functions. In eukaryotes, such a function was attributed to suppressor of target of Myb protein 1 (Stm1; SERPINE1 mRNA-binding protein 1 [SERBP1] in mammals), and recently, late-annotated short open reading frame 2 (Lso2; coiled-coil domain containing short open reading frame 124 [CCDC124] in mammals) was found to be involved in translational recovery after starvation from stationary phase. Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of translationally inactive yeast and human ribosomes. We found Lso2/CCDC124 accumulating on idle ribosomes in the nonrotated state, in contrast to Stm1/SERBP1-bound ribosomes, which display a rotated state. Lso2/CCDC124 bridges the decoding sites of the small with the GTPase activating center (GAC) of the large subunit. This position allows accommodation of the duplication of multilocus region 34 protein (Dom34)-dependent ribosome recycling system, which splits Lso2-containing, but not Stm1-containing, ribosomes. We propose a model in which Lso2 facilitates rapid translation reactivation by stabilizing the recycling-competent state of inactive ribosomes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/7HDgOnINe_s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Proteome-wide identification of HSP70/HSC70 chaperone clients in human cells</title>

The 70 kDa heat shock protein (HSP70) family of chaperones are the front line of protection from stress-induced misfolding and aggregation of polypeptides in most organisms and are responsible for promoting the stability, folding, and degradation of clients to maintain cellular protein homeostasis. Here, we demonstrate quantitative identification of HSP70 and 71 kDa heat shock cognate (HSC70) clients using a ubiquitin-mediated proximity tagging strategy and show that, despite their high degree of similarity, these enzymes have largely nonoverlapping specificities. Both proteins show a preference for association with newly synthesized polypeptides, but each responds differently to changes in the stoichiometry of proteins in obligate multi-subunit complexes. In addition, expression of an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-associated superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) mutant protein induces changes in HSP70 and HSC70 client association and aggregation toward polypeptides with predicted disorder, indicating that there are global effects from a single misfolded protein that extend to many clients within chaperone networks. Together these findings show that the ubiquitin-activated interaction trap (UBAIT) fusion system can efficiently isolate the complex interactome of HSP chaperone family proteins under normal and stress conditions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ADIksXEycdo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Standing on the Shoulders of Giants: Hardware and Neural Architecture Co-Search with Hot Start. (arXiv:2007.09087v1 [cs.LG])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hardware and neural architecture co-search that automatically generates
Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions from a given dataset is promising to
promote AI democratization; however, the amount of time that is required by
current co-search frameworks is in the order of hundreds of GPU hours for one
target hardware. This inhibits the use of such frameworks on commodity
hardware. The root cause of the low efficiency in existing co-search frameworks
is the fact that they start from a &quot;cold&quot; state (i.e., search from scratch). In
this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely HotNAS, that starts from a
&quot;hot&quot; state based on a set of existing pre-trained models (a.k.a. model zoo) to
avoid lengthy training time. As such, the search time can be reduced from 200
GPU hours to less than 3 GPU hours. In HotNAS, in addition to hardware design
space and neural architecture search space, we further integrate a compression
space to conduct model compressing during the co-search, which creates new
opportunities to reduce latency but also brings challenges. One of the key
challenges is that all of the above search spaces are coupled with each other,
e.g., compression may not work without hardware design support. To tackle this
issue, HotNAS builds a chain of tools to design hardware to support
compression, based on which a global optimizer is developed to automatically
co-search all the involved search spaces. Experiments on ImageNet dataset and
Xilinx FPGA show that, within the timing constraint of 5ms, neural
architectures generated by HotNAS can achieve up to 5.79% Top-1 and 3.97% Top-5
accuracy gain, compared with the existing ones.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: FSpiNN: An Optimization Framework for Memory- and Energy-Efficient Spiking Neural Networks. (arXiv:2007.08860v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08860</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08860</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are gaining interest due to their event-driven
processing which potentially consumes low power/energy computations in hardware
platforms, while offering unsupervised learning capability due to the
spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) rule. However, state-of-the-art SNNs
require a large memory footprint to achieve high accuracy, thereby making them
difficult to be deployed on embedded systems, for instance on battery-powered
mobile devices and IoT Edge nodes. Towards this, we propose FSpiNN, an
optimization framework for obtaining memory- and energy-efficient SNNs for
training and inference processing, with unsupervised learning capability while
maintaining accuracy. It is achieved by (1) reducing the computational
requirements of neuronal and STDP operations, (2) improving the accuracy of
STDP-based learning, (3) compressing the SNN through a fixed-point
quantization, and (4) incorporating the memory and energy requirements in the
optimization process. FSpiNN reduces the computational requirements by reducing
the number of neuronal operations, the STDP-based synaptic weight updates, and
the STDP complexity. To improve the accuracy of learning, FSpiNN employs
timestep-based synaptic weight updates, and adaptively determines the STDP
potentiation factor and the effective inhibition strength. The experimental
results show that, as compared to the state-of-the-art work, FSpiNN achieves
7.5x memory saving, and improves the energy-efficiency by 3.5x on average for
training and by 1.8x on average for inference, across MNIST and Fashion MNIST
datasets, with no accuracy loss for a network with 4900 excitatory neurons,
thereby enabling energy-efficient SNNs for edge devices/embedded systems.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: A biological plausible audio-visual integration model for continual lifelong learning. (arXiv:2007.08855v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The problem of catastrophic forgetting can be traced back to the 1980s, but
it has not been completely solved. Since human brains are good at continual
lifelong learning, brain-inspired methods may provide solutions to this
problem. The end result of learning different objects in different categories
is the formation of concepts in the brain. Experiments showed that concepts are
likely encoded by concept cells in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) of the human
brain. Furthermore, concept cells encode concepts sparsely and are responsive
to multi-modal stimuli. However, it is unknown how concepts are formed in the
MTL. Here we assume that the integration of audio and visual perceptual
information in the MTL during learning is a crucial step to form concepts and
make continual learning possible, and we propose a biological plausible
audio-visual integration model (AVIM), which is a spiking neural network with
multi-compartmental neuron model and a calcium based synaptic tagging and
capture plasticity model, as a possible mechanism of concept formation. We then
build such a model and run on different datasets to test its ability of
continual learning. Our simulation results show that the AVIM not only achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared with other advanced methods but also the
output of AVIM for each concept has stable representations during the continual
learning process. These results support our assumption that concept formation
is essential for continuous lifelong learning, and suggest the AVIM we propose
here is a possible mechanism of concept formation, and hence is a brain-like
solution to the problem of catastrophic forgetting.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, there has been an increasing interest in (supervised) learning with
graph data, especially using graph neural networks. However, the development of
meaningful benchmark datasets and standardized evaluation procedures is
lagging, consequently hindering advancements in this area. To address this, we
introduce the TUDataset for graph classification and regression. The collection
consists of over 120 datasets of varying sizes from a wide range of
applications. We provide Python-based data loaders, kernel and graph neural
network baseline implementations, and evaluation tools. Here, we give an
overview of the datasets, standardized evaluation procedures, and provide
baseline experiments. All datasets are available at www.graphlearning.io. The
experiments are fully reproducible from the code available at
www.github.com/chrsmrrs/tudataset.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: A Framework for Automatic Behavior Generation in Multi-Function Swarms. (arXiv:2007.08656v1 [cs.MA])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multi-function swarms are swarms that solve multiple tasks at once. For
example, a quadcopter swarm could be tasked with exploring an area of interest
while simultaneously functioning as ad-hoc relays. With this type of
multi-function comes the challenge of handling potentially conflicting
requirements simultaneously. Using the Quality-Diversity algorithm MAP-elites
in combination with a suitable controller structure, a framework for automatic
behavior generation in multi-function swarms is proposed. The framework is
tested on a scenario with three simultaneous tasks: exploration, communication
network creation and geolocation of RF emitters. A repertoire is evolved,
consisting of a wide range of controllers, or behavior primitives, with
different characteristics and trade-offs in the different tasks. This
repertoire would enable the swarm to transition between behavior trade-offs
online, according to the situational requirements. Furthermore, the effect of
noise on the behavior characteristics in MAP-elites is investigated. A moderate
number of re-evaluations is found to increase the robustness while keeping the
computational requirements relatively low. A few selected controllers are
examined, and the dynamics of transitioning between these controllers are
explored. Finally, the study develops a methodology for analyzing the makeup of
the resulting controllers. This is done through a parameter variation study
where the importance of individual inputs to the swarm controllers is assessed
and analyzed.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.09431</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite the remarkable similarities between convolutional neural networks
(CNN) and the human brain, CNNs still fall behind humans in many visual tasks,
indicating that there still exist considerable differences between the two
systems. Here, we leverage adversarial noise (AN) and adversarial interference
(AI) images to quantify the consistency between neural representations and
perceptual outcomes in the two systems. Humans can successfully recognize AI
images as corresponding categories but perceive AN images as meaningless noise.
In contrast, CNNs can correctly recognize AN images but mistakenly classify AI
images into wrong categories with surprisingly high confidence. We use
functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure brain activity evoked by
regular and adversarial images in the human brain, and compare it to the
activity of artificial neurons in a prototypical CNN-AlexNet. In the human
brain, we find that the representational similarity between regular and
adversarial images largely echoes their perceptual similarity in all early
visual areas. In AlexNet, however, the neural representations of adversarial
images are inconsistent with network outputs in all intermediate processing
layers, providing no neural foundations for perceptual similarity. Furthermore,
we show that voxel-encoding models trained on regular images can successfully
generalize to the neural responses to AI images but not AN images. These
remarkable differences between the human brain and AlexNet in the
representation-perception relation suggest that future CNNs should emulate both
behavior and the internal neural presentations of the human brain.

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Peripersonal Visuospatial Abilities in Williams Syndrome Analyzed by a Table Radial Arm Maze Task</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00254</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Williams syndrome (WS) is a genetic deletion syndrome characterized by severe visuospatial deficits affecting spatial exploration and navigation abilities in extra-personal space.To date, little is known about spatial elaboration and reaching abilities in the peripersonal space in individuals with WS. The present study is aimed at evaluating the visuospatial abilities in individuals with WS and comparing their performances with those of mental age-matched typically developing (TD) children by using a highly sensitive ecological version of the Radial Arm Maze (table RAM). We evaluated 15 individuals with WS and 15 TD children in two different table RAM paradigms: the free-choice paradigm, mainly to analyze the aspects linked to procedural and memory components, and the forced-choice paradigm, to disentangle the components linked to spatial working memory from the procedural ones.Data show that individuals with WS made significantly more working memory errors as compared with TD children, thus evidencing a marked deficit in resolving the task when the mnesic load increased. Our findings provide new insights on the cognitive profile of WS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: S-phase-independent silencing establishment in Saccharomyces cerevisiae</title>

	<description>The establishment of silent chromatin, a heterochromatin-like structure at &lt;i&gt;HML &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;HMR&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, depends on progression through S phase of the cell cycle, but the molecular nature of this requirement has remained elusive despite intensive study. Using high-resolution chromatin immunoprecipitation and single-molecule RNA analysis, we found that silencing establishment proceeded via gradual repression of transcription in individual cells over several cell cycles, and that the cell-cycle-regulated step was downstream of Sir protein recruitment. In contrast to prior results, &lt;i&gt;HML&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;HMR&lt;/i&gt; had identical cell-cycle requirements for silencing establishment, with no apparent contribution from a tRNA gene adjacent to &lt;i&gt;HMR&lt;/i&gt;. We identified the cause of the S-phase requirement for silencing establishment: removal of transcription-favoring histone modifications deposited by Dot1, Sas2, and Rtt109. These results revealed that silencing establishment was absolutely dependent on the cell-cycle-regulated interplay between euchromatic and heterochromatic histone modifications.</description>

	<title>eLife: Expandable and reversible copy number amplification drives rapid adaptation to antifungal drugs</title>

	<description>Previously, we identified long repeat sequences that are frequently associated with genome rearrangements, including copy number variation (CNV), in many diverse isolates of the human fungal pathogen &lt;i&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt; (Todd et al., 2019). Here, we describe the rapid acquisition of novel, high copy number CNVs during adaptation to azole antifungal drugs. Single-cell karyotype analysis indicates that these CNVs appear to arise via a dicentric chromosome intermediate and breakage-fusion-bridge cycles that are repaired using multiple distinct long inverted repeat sequences. Subsequent removal of the antifungal drug can lead to a dramatic loss of the CNV and reversion to the progenitor genotype and drug susceptibility phenotype. These findings support a novel mechanism for the rapid acquisition of antifungal drug resistance and provide genomic evidence for the heterogeneity frequently observed in clinical settings.</description>

	<title>eLife: IL18 signaling promotes homing of mature Tregs into the thymus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.58213</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58213</link>
	<description>Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are potent suppressor cells, essential for the maintenance of immune homeostasis. Most Tregs develop in the thymus and are then released into the immune periphery. However, some Tregs populate the thymus and constitute a major subset of yet poorly understood cells. Here we describe a subset of thymus recirculating IL18R&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; Tregs with molecular characteristics highly reminiscent of tissue-resident effector Tregs. Moreover, we show that IL18R&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; Tregs are endowed with higher capacity to populate the thymus than their IL18R&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; or IL18R&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; counterparts, highlighting the key role of IL18R in this process. Finally, we demonstrate that IL18 signaling is critical for the induction of the key thymus-homing chemokine receptor – CCR6 on Tregs. Collectively, this study provides a detailed characterization of the mature Treg subsets in the mouse thymus and identifies a key role of IL18 signaling in controlling the CCR6-CCL20-dependent migration of Tregs into the thymus.</description>

	<title>eLife: Different theta frameworks coexist in the rat hippocampus and are coordinated during memory-guided and novelty tasks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.57313</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57313</link>
	<description>Hippocampal firing is organized in theta sequences controlled by internal memory processes and by external sensory cues, but how these computations are coordinated is not fully understood. Although theta activity is commonly studied as a unique coherent oscillation, it is the result of complex interactions between different rhythm generators. Here, by separating hippocampal theta activity in three different current generators, we found epochs with variable theta frequency and phase coupling, suggesting flexible interactions between theta generators. We found that epochs of highly synchronized theta rhythmicity preferentially occurred during behavioral tasks requiring coordination between internal memory representations and incoming sensory information. In addition, we found that gamma oscillations were associated with specific theta generators and the strength of theta-gamma coupling predicted the synchronization between theta generators. We propose a mechanism for segregating or integrating hippocampal computations based on the flexible coordination of different theta frameworks to accommodate the cognitive needs.</description>

	<title>eLife: Alterations in the intrinsic properties of striatal cholinergic interneurons after dopamine lesion and chronic L-DOPA</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.56920</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56920</link>
	<description>Changes in striatal cholinergic interneuron (ChI) activity are thought to contribute to Parkinson's disease pathophysiology and dyskinesia from chronic L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) treatment, but the physiological basis of these changes is unknown. We find that dopamine lesion decreases the spontaneous firing rate of ChIs, whereas chronic treatment with L-DOPA of lesioned mice increases baseline ChI firing rates to levels beyond normal activity. The effect of dopamine loss on ChIs was due to decreased currents of both hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) and small conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels. L-DOPA reinstatement of dopamine normalized HCN activity, but SK current remained depressed. Pharmacological blockade of HCN and SK activities mimicked changes in firing, confirming that these channels are responsible for the molecular adaptation of ChIs to dopamine loss and chronic L-DOPA treatment. These findings suggest that targeting ChIs with channel-specific modulators may provide therapeutic approaches for alleviating L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in PD patients.</description>

	<title>eLife: Persistent firing in LEC III neurons is differentially modulated by learning and aging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.56816</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56816</link>
	<description>Whether and how persistent firing in lateral entorhinal cortex layer III (LEC III) supports temporal associative learning is still unknown. In this study, persistent firing was evoked in vitro from LEC III neurons from young and aged rats that were behaviorally naive or trained on trace eyeblink conditioning. Persistent firing ability from neurons from behaviorally naive aged rats was lower compared to neurons from young rats. Neurons from learning impaired aged animals also exhibited reduced persistent firing capacity, which may contribute to aging-related learning impairments. Successful acquisition of the trace eyeblink task, however, increased persistent firing ability in both young and aged rats. These changes in persistent firing ability are due to changes to the afterdepolarization, which may in turn be modulated by the postburst afterhyperpolarization. Together, these data indicate that successful learning increases persistent firing ability and decreases in persistent firing ability contribute to learning impairments in aging.</description>

	<title>eLife: Universality of clonal dynamics poses fundamental limits to identify stem cell self-renewal strategies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.56532</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56532</link>
	<description>How adult stem cells maintain self-renewing tissues is in vivo commonly assessed by analysing clonal data from cell lineage tracing assays. To identify strategies of stem cell self-renewal requires that different models of stem cell fate choice predict sufficiently different clonal statistics. Here we show that models of cell fate choice can, in homeostatic tissues, be categorized by exactly two 'universality classes', whereby models of the same class predict, under asymptotic conditions, the same clonal statistics. Those classes relate to generalizations of the canonical asymmetric vs. symmetric stem cell self-renewal strategies and are distinguished by a conservation law. This poses both challenges and opportunities to identify stem cell self-renewal strategies: while under asymptotic conditions, self-renewal models of the same universality class cannot be distinguished by clonal data only, models of different classes can be distinguished by simple means.</description>

	<title>eLife: DAZL mediates a broad translational program regulating expansion and differentiation of spermatogonial progenitors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.56523</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56523</link>
	<description>Fertility across metazoa requires the germline-specific DAZ family of RNA-binding proteins. Here we examine whether DAZL directly regulates progenitor spermatogonia using a conditional genetic mouse model and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; biochemical approaches combined with chemical synchronization of spermatogenesis. We find that the absence of &lt;i&gt;Dazl &lt;/i&gt;impairs both expansion and differentiation of the spermatogonial progenitor population. In undifferentiated spermatogonia, DAZL binds the 3' UTRs of ~2,500 protein-coding genes. Some targets are known regulators of spermatogonial proliferation and differentiation while others are broadly expressed, dosage-sensitive factors that control transcription and RNA metabolism. DAZL binds 3' UTR sites conserved across vertebrates at a UGUU(U/A) motif. By assessing ribosome occupancy in undifferentiated spermatogonia, we find that DAZL increases translation of its targets. In total, DAZL orchestrates a broad translational program that amplifies protein levels of key spermatogonial and gene regulatory factors to promote the expansion and differentiation of progenitor spermatogonia.</description>

	<title>eLife: Stochastic logistic models reproduce experimental time series of microbial communities</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55650</link>
	<description>We analyze properties of experimental microbial time series, from plankton and the human microbiome, and investigate whether stochastic generalized Lotka-Volterra models could reproduce those properties. We show that this is the case when the noise term is large and a linear function of the species abundance, while the strength of the self-interactions varies over multiple orders of magnitude. We stress the fact that all the observed stochastic properties can be obtained from a logistic model, i.e. without interactions, even the niche character of the experimental time series. Linear noise is associated with growth rate stochasticity, which is related to changes in the environment. This suggests that fluctuations in the sparsely sampled experimental time series may be caused by extrinsic sources.</description>

	<title>eLife: Protective role of neuronal and lymphoid cannabinoid CB2 receptors in neuropathic pain</title>

	<description>Cannabinoid CB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor (CB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) agonists are potential analgesics void of psychotropic effects. Peripheral immune cells, neurons and glia express CB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, however the involvement of CB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from these cells in neuropathic pain remains unresolved. We explored spontaneous neuropathic pain through on-demand self-administration of the selective CB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; agonist JWH133 in wild-type and knockout mice lacking CB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in neurons, monocytes or constitutively. Operant self-administration reflected drug-taking to alleviate spontaneous pain, nociceptive and affective manifestations. While constitutive deletion of CB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; disrupted JWH133-taking behavior, this behavior was not modified in monocyte-specific CB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; knockouts and was increased in mice defective in neuronal CB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; knockouts suggestive of increased spontaneous pain. Interestingly, CB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-positive lymphocytes infiltrated the injured nerve and possible CB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;transfer from immune cells to neurons was found. Lymphocyte CB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;depletion also exacerbated JWH133 self-administration and inhibited antinociception. This work identifies a simultaneous activity of neuronal and lymphoid CB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;that protects against spontaneous and evoked neuropathic pain.</description>

	<title>eLife: Human DECR1 is an androgen-repressed survival factor that regulates PUFA oxidation to protect prostate tumor cells from ferroptosis</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54166</link>
	<description>Fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) is the main bioenergetic pathway in human prostate cancer (PCa) and a promising novel therapeutic vulnerability. Here we demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of targeting FAO in clinical prostate tumors cultured &lt;i&gt;ex vivo, &lt;/i&gt;and identify&lt;i&gt; DECR1, &lt;/i&gt;encoding the rate-limiting enzyme for oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), as robustly overexpressed in PCa tissues and associated with shorter relapse-free survival. &lt;i&gt;DECR1&lt;/i&gt; is a negatively-regulated androgen receptor (AR) target gene and, therefore, may promote PCa cell survival and resistance to AR targeting therapeutics. DECR1 knockdown selectively inhibited β-oxidation of PUFAs, inhibited proliferation and migration of PCa cells, including treatment resistant lines, and suppressed tumor cell proliferation and metastasis in mouse xenograft models. Mechanistically, targeting of DECR1 caused cellular accumulation of PUFAs, enhanced mitochondrial oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, and induced ferroptosis. These findings implicate PUFA oxidation via DECR1 as an unexplored facet of FAO that promotes survival of PCa cells.</description>

	<title>eLife: Neural dynamics of perceptual inference and its reversal during imagery</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53588</link>
	<description>After the presentation of a visual stimulus, neural processing cascades from low-level sensory areas to increasingly abstract representations in higher-level areas. It is often hypothesised that a reversal in neural processing underlies the generation of mental images as abstract representations are used to construct sensory representations in the absence of sensory input. According to predictive processing theories, such reversed processing also plays a central role in later stages of perception. Direct experimental evidence of reversals in neural information flow has been missing. Here, we used a combination of machine learning and magnetoencephalography to characterise neural dynamics in humans. We provide direct evidence for a reversal of the perceptual feed-forward cascade during imagery and show that, during perception, such reversals alternate with feed-forward processing in an 11 Hz oscillatory pattern. Together, these results show how common feedback processes support both veridical perception and mental imagery.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Aβ-induced synaptic injury is mediated by presynaptic expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in hippocampal neurons</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.18.210344v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The patterns of A{beta}-induced synaptic injury were examined after targeting of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) preferentially to either CA1 or CA3 neurons using Cre-lox technology combined with tetracycline-regulated expression. Both CA1- and CA3-APP-expressing transgenic mouse lines exhibited reduction in long-term potentiation (LTP) only when APP was expressed in neurons presynaptic to the recording site, whereas LTP remained comparable to wild-type mice when APP was expressed in postsynaptic neurons. As quantified by both light and electron microscopy, this orientation-specific impairment in synaptic plasticity was mirrored by synaptic loss in regions receiving axonal inputs from neurons expressing APP. Furthermore, A{beta} plaque deposition also occurred only in the postsynaptic axonal fields of APP-expressing neurons. These deficits were reversed not only with doxycycline to inhibit APP expression but also with {gamma}-secretase and Fyn kinase inhibitors, supporting the interpretation that the observed synaptic injury was mediated by A{beta}. Taken together, these results demonstrate that APP/A{beta}-induced synaptic toxicity is preferentially initiated by signaling of presynaptically expressed APP to the postsynaptic compartment.</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;An open access mouse brain flatmap and upgraded rat and human brain flatmaps based on current reference atlases&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/32c71b0d-eb47-4208-8815-e363e2699b9c/cne24966-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Graphical Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The illustration shows several flatmap representations of the mammalian brain, selected and modified from a collection of new and enhanced flatmap representations of the mouse, rat, and human brain. The human brain flatmap primarily details cortical regionalization. The rat and mouse brain flatmaps are based on current brain reference atlases, and they represent all depths of the divisional hierarchy of central nervous system gray matter represented therein. Also represented for rat and mouse are white matter tracts, ganglia, and nerves, and for the rat a series of flatmaps illustrating stages of brain development. The rat and mouse brain flatmaps are designed to facilitate comparative analysis between these species, and for adaptability to novel parcellation schemas and computational applications. We give examples of these uses, including a proof‐of‐concept workflow demonstrating how the flatmaps could be adapted to form the basis of a web‐based graphical data viewer and analysis platform to represent a wide variety of brain data.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we present a flatmap of the mouse central nervous system (CNS) (brain) and substantially enhanced flatmaps of the rat and human brain. Also included are enhanced representations of nervous system white matter tracts, ganglia, and nerves, and an enhanced series of 10 flatmaps showing different stages of rat brain development. The adult mouse and rat brain flatmaps provide layered diagrammatic representation of CNS divisions, according to their arrangement in corresponding reference atlases: Brain Maps 4.0 (BM4, rat) (Swanson, The Journal of Comparative Neurology, 2018, 526, 935–943), and the first version of the Allen Reference Atlas (mouse) (Dong, The Allen reference atlas, (book + CD‐ROM): A digital color brain atlas of the C57BL/6J male mouse, 2007). To facilitate comparative analysis, both flatmaps are scaled equally, and the divisional hierarchy of gray matter follows a topographic arrangement used in BM4. Also included with the mouse and rat brain flatmaps are cerebral cortex atlas level contours based on the reference atlases, and direct graphical and tabular comparison of regional parcellation. To encourage use of the brain flatmaps, they were designed and organized, with supporting reference tables, for ease‐of‐use and to be amenable to computational applications. We demonstrate how they can be adapted to represent novel parcellations resulting from experimental data, and we provide a proof‐of‐concept for how they could form the basis of a web‐based graphical data viewer and analysis platform.

	<description>Epidermal keratinocytes mediate touch sensation by detecting and encoding tactile information to sensory neurons. However, the specific mechanotransducers that enable keratinocytes to respond to mechanical stimulation are unknown. Here, we found that the mechanically-gated ion channel Piezo1 is the major keratinocyte mechanotransducer. Keratinocyte expression of Piezo1 is critical for normal sensory afferent firing and behavioral responses to mechanical stimuli.</description>

	<description>Learning induces structural changes in the brain. Especially repeated, long-term behaviors, such as extensive training of playing a musical instrument, are likely to produce characteristic features to brain structure. However, it is not clear to what extent such structural features can be extracted from magnetic resonance images of the brain. Here we show that it is possible to predict whether a person is a musician or a non-musician based on the thickness of the cerebral cortex measured at 148 brain regions encompassing the whole cortex. Using a supervised machine learning technique called support vector machines, we achieved significant (k = 0.321, p &amp;lt; 0.001) agreement between the actual and predicted participant groups of 30 musicians and 85 non-musicians. The areas contributing to the prediction were mostly in the frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes of the left hemisphere. Our results suggest that decoding an acquired skill from magnetic resonance images of brain structure is feasible to some extent. Further, the distribution of the areas that were informative in the classification, which mostly, but not entirely overlapped with earlier findings, implies that decoding-based analyses of structural properties of the brain can reveal novel aspects of musical aptitude.</description>

	<description>Eye movements alter the relationship between the visual and auditory spatial scenes. Signals related to eye movements affect the brain's auditory pathways from the ear through auditory cortex and beyond, but how these signals might contribute to computing the locations of sounds with respect to the visual scene is poorly understood. Here, we evaluated the information contained in the signals observed at the earliest processing stage, eye movement-related eardrum oscillations (EMREOs). We report that human EMREOs carry information about both horizontal and vertical eye displacement as well as initial/final eye position. We conclude that all of the information necessary to contribute to a suitable coordinate transformation of auditory spatial cues into a common reference frame with visual information is present in this signal. We hypothesize that the underlying mechanism causing EMREOs could impose a transfer function on any incoming sound signal, which could permit subsequent processing stages to compute the positions of sounds in relation to the visual scene.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Gaze dynamics of feature-based distractor inhibition under the prior-knowledge and expectation</title>

	<description>Prior information about distractor facilitates selective attention to task-relevant items and helps the optimization of oculomotor planning. Particularly, feature-based attentional inhibition could be benefited from the pre-knowledge of critical features of the distractors. In the present study, we capitalized on gaze-position decoding to examine the dynamics of attentional deployment in a feature-based attentional task that involved two groups of dots (target/distractor dots) moving toward different directions. Specifically, this measurement revealed how pre-knowledge of the target's or distractor's direction modulated real-time feature-based attentional bias. In Experiment 1, participants were provided with target cues indicating the moving direction of target dots. The results showed that participants were biased towards the cued direction and tracked the target dots throughout the task period. In Experiment 2 and Experiment 3, participants were provided with cues that informed the moving direction of distractor dots. The results showed that participants would continuously monitor the distractor's direction when the distractor cue varied on a trial-by-trial basis (Experiment 2). However, when the to-be-ignored distractor direction remained constant (Experiment 3), participants would strategically bias their attention to the distractor's direction before the cue onset and reduce the cost of re-deployment of attention between trials. These results suggest that monitoring the distractor's feature is a prerequisite for feature-based attentional inhibition and this process is facilitated by the predictability of the distractor's feature.</description>

	<description>Despite the inherent sociality of human nature, other people pose some of the most difficult challenges to the mind. To successfully interact with other individuals, we need to predict their future responses, a computationally-vexing problem given the enormous range of behaviors in which other people can engage. Decades of research have demonstrated that to simplify this task, perceivers routinely draw on prior beliefs-that is, rather than wait to construct social predictions solely on relevant incoming information, people regularly use prior knowledge, stereotypes, and other sources of information to proactively predict the traits and behaviors of other people. Such research has also demonstrated that once formed, these predictions strongly influence social interactions even when people attempt to change or ignore them. Here, we test the hypothesis that our social predictions resist change because perceivers place high subjective value on having their expectations of others confirmed. Across four studies, we report data consistent with this hypothesis, both when perceivers' expectations derive from gender stereotypes and when they derive from knowledge of familiar individuals. Specifically, in two neuroimaging experiments (n = 58), we observed increased activation in brain regions associated with reward processing-including the nucleus accumbens-when social expectations were confirmed. In two additional behavioral experiments (n = 704), we observed that perceivers were willing to forgo money to encounter an expectation-confirming target and avoid an expectation-violating target. Together, these findings suggest that perceivers value having their social expectations confirmed, much like other primary or secondary rewards.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Modelling cortical laminar connectivity in the macaque brain</title>

	<description>In 1991, Felleman and Van Essen published their seminal study regarding hierarchical processing in the primate cerebral cortex. Their work encompassed a widescale analysis of connections reported through tracing between 35 regions in the macaque visual cortex, extending from cortical regions to the laminar level. Since then, great strides have been made in the field of MRI neuroimaging of white matter connectivity, also known as connectomics, as well as grey matter laminar composition. In this work, we revisit laminar-level connectivity in the macaque brain using a whole-brain MRI-based approach. We use multi-modal ex-vivo MRI imaging of both white and grey matter, which are then integrated via our simple model of laminar connectivity. This model uses a granularity-based approach to define a set of rules that expands cortical connections to the laminar level. The resulting whole-brain network of macaque cortical laminar connectivity is then validated in the visual cortex by comparison to results from the 1991 study by Felleman and Van Essen. By using an unbiased definition of the cortex that addresses its heterogenous laminar composition, we are able to explore a new avenue of connectomics on the laminar level.</description>

	<description>When humans handle a tool, such as a tennis racket or hammer, for the first time, they often wield it to determine its inertial properties, however, the mechanisms that contribute to perception of inertial properties are not fully understood. The goal of the present study was to investigate how proprioceptive afferents contribute to effortful perception of heaviness and mass distribution of a manually wielded object in the absence of vision. Blindfolded participants manually wielded a set of specially-designed experimental objects of different mass and mass distribution about the wrist at different wrist angles and wrist angular kinematics. By independently manipulating these variables, we aimed to elicit different levels of tonic and rhythmic activity in the muscle spindles of the wrist flexors and extensors and relate them to reported perceptual judgments of heaviness and length. Perception of heaviness and length were predominantly dependent on an object's static moment and the moment of inertia, respectively. Manipulations of wrist angle and wrist angular kinematics affected perceptual judgments of heaviness and length in relatively opposite ways. As for wrist angle, ulnar deviation consistently resulted in an object being perceived heavier but shorter. Compared to static holding, wielding the object resulted in it being perceived heavier but wielding did not affect perceived length. These results suggest that proprioceptive afferents differentially contribute to effortful perception of object heaviness and mass distribution.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Structure and function of the nervous system in nectophores of the siphonophore Nanomia bijuga</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.18.210310v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Although Nanomia nectophores are specialized for locomotion, their cellular elements and complex nerve structures suggest they have multiple subsidiary functions. The main nerve complex is a nerve ring, an adjacent columnar-shaped matrix plus two associated nerve projections. An upper nerve tract appears to provide a sensory input while a lower nerve tract connects with the rest of the colony. The nerve cell cluster that gives rise to the lower nerve tract may relay information from the colony stem. The structure of the extensively innervated 'flask cells' located around the bell margin suggests a secretory function. They are ideally placed to release chemical messengers or toxins into the jet of water that leaves the nectophore during each swim. The numerous nematocytes present on exposed nectophore ridges appear to have an entangling rather than a penetrating role. Movements of the velum, produced by contraction of the Claus' muscle system during backwards swimming, can be elicited by electrical stimulation of the surface epithelium even when the major nerve tracts serving the nerve ring have been destroyed (confirming Mackie, 1964). Epithelial impulses generated by electrical stimulation elicit synaptic potentials in Claus' muscle fibres. Their amplitude suggests a neural input in the vicinity of the Claus' muscle system. The synaptic delay is &amp;lt;1.3 ms (Temperature 11.5 to 15{degrees}C). During backward swimming radial muscle fibres in the endoderm contract isometrically providing the Claus' fibres with a firm foundation.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Algorithms underlying flexible phototaxis in larval zebrafish</title>

	<description>To thrive, organisms must maintain physiological and environmental variables in optimal ranges. However, in a dynamic world, the optimal range of a variable might fluctuate depending on the organism's state or environmental conditions. Given these fluctuations, how do biological control systems maintain optimal control of physiological and environmental variables? We explored this question by studying the phototactic behavior of larval zebrafish. We demonstrate, with behavioral experiments and computational modeling, that larval zebrafish use phototaxis to maintain environmental luminance at a set point that depends on luminance history. We further show that fish compute this set point using information from both eyes, and that the set point fluctuates on a timescale of seconds when environmental luminance changes. These results expand on previous studies, where phototaxis was found to be primarily positive, and suggest that larval zebrafish, rather than consistently turning towards the brighter areas, exert homeostatic control over the luminance of their surroundings. Furthermore, we show that fluctuations in the surrounding luminance feed back on the system to drive allostatic changes to the luminance set point. Our work has uncovered a novel principle underlying phototaxis in larval zebrafish and characterized a behavioral algorithm by which larval zebrafish exert control over a sensory variable.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Basolateral amygdala CB1 receptors modulate HPA axis activation and context-cocaine memory strength during reconsolidation</title>

	<description>Re-exposure to a cocaine-associated context triggers craving and relapse through the retrieval of salient context-drug memories. Upon retrieval, context-drug memories become labile and temporarily sensitive to modification before they are reconsolidated into long-term memory stores. Cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1R) signaling is necessary for cocaine-memory reconsolidation and associated glutamatergic plasticity in the basolateral amygdala (BLA); however, it remains unclear whether CB1Rs in the BLA mediate this phenomenon. To investigate this question, we examined whether CB1R antagonist or agonist administration into the BLA immediately after cocaine-memory retrieval (i.e., during memory reconsolidation) alters cocaine-memory strength and subsequent drug context-induced cocaine-seeking behavior in an instrumental rodent model of cocaine relapse. Intra-BLA administration of the CB1R antagonist, AM251 (0.3 /hemisphere) - during, but not after, memory reconsolidation - increased drug context-induced cocaine-seeking behavior three days later, while the CB1R agonist, WIN55,212-2 (0.5 /hemisphere) failed to alter this behavior. Furthermore, AM251 administration into the posterior caudate putamen (anatomical control region) during memory reconsolidation did not alter subsequent context-induced cocaine-seeking behavior. In a follow-up experiment, cocaine-memory retrieval elicited robust hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation, as indicated by an increase in blood serum corticosterone concentration, and this response was selectively extended by intra-BLA AM251 administration during the putative time of memory reconsolidation relative to all control conditions. Together, these findings suggest that CB1R populations in the BLA gate memory strength or interfere with memory maintenance, possibly by diminishing the impact of cue-induced arousal on the integrity of the reconsolidating memory trace or on the efficiency of the memory reconsolidation process.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Cortical recycling in high-level visual cortex during childhood development</title>

	<description>Human ventral temporal cortex (VTC) contains category-selective regions that respond preferentially to ecologically-relevant categories such as faces1, bodies2, places3, and words4 and are causally involved in the perception of these categories5-7. However, it is unknown how these regions develop during childhood. Here we used functional MRI and images from many categories to measure longitudinal development of category-selectivity in individual school-age children over the course of 5 years. We show that from young childhood to the teens, face- and word-selective regions in VTC expand and increase in their respective category-selectivity, but limb-selective regions in VTC shrink and lose their preference for limbs. Critically, as a child develops, increases in their face- and word-selectivity are directly linked to decreases in limb-selectivity. These data show that during childhood limb-selectivity in VTC is repurposed into word- and face-selectivity providing the first empirical evidence for cortical recycling8 during childhood development. These results suggest a rethinking of prevailing hypotheses that cortical development involves sculpting of new representations upon general-purpose cortex9,10. Instead, they suggest a new hypothesis that during development VTC representations adjust to changes in the salience and social relevance of visual inputs11, which has important implications for both typical and atypical brain development.</description>

	<description>Maternal environmental exposures, such as high-fat diets, diabetes and obesity, can induce long term effects in offspring. These effects include increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression and anxiety. The mechanisms underlying these late-life neurologic effects are unknown. In this article, we measured changes in the offspring brain and determined which brain regions are sensitive to maternal metabolic milieu and therefore may mediate NDD risk. We showed that mice exposed to maternal high-fat diet display extensive brain changes in adulthood despite being switched to low-fat diet at weaning. Brain regions impacted by early-life diet include the extended amygdalar system, which plays an important role in reward-seeking behaviour. Genes preferentially expressed in these regions have functions related to feeding behavior, while also being implicated in human NDDs, such as autism. Our data demonstrated that exposure to maternal high-fat diet in early-life leads to brain alterations that persist into adulthood, even after dietary modifications.</description>

	<description>A growing consensus across otherwise disparate perspectives on perception and action is that visually guided postural control emerges from within task constraints. Task constraints generate physiological fluctuations across various parts of the body. These fluctuations foster exploration of the available sensory information. For instance, standard deviation (SD) and temporal correlations of bodily sway can indicate how richly postural control samples available mechanical and visual information. Too much or too little SD entails destabilization of posture. Temporal correlations show a similar relationship, but they have also been shown to support carrying sampled information to other aspects of the postural system. The present study shows that increasing visual constraints on posture reveals an adaptive relationship between SD and temporal correlations of postural fluctuations. In short, changing the viewing distance of a fixation target shows that temporal correlations self-correct themselves across time and diminish SD across time as well. Notably, these relationships were strong for all viewing distances except the most comfortable viewing and reaching distance. This self-correcting relationship allows the visual layout itself to press the postural system into a poise for engaging with objects and events in the surrounding.</description>

	<description>Standing still and focusing on a visible target in front of us is a preamble to many coordinated behaviors (e.g., reaching an object). Hiding behind its apparent simplicity is a deep layering of texture at many scales. The task of standing still laces together activities at multiple scales: from ensuring that a few photoreceptors on the retina cover the target in the visual field on an extremely fine-scale to synergies spanning the limbs and joints at smaller scales to the mechanical layout of the ground underfoot and optic flow in the visual field on the coarser scales. Here, we used multiscale probability distribution function (PDF) analysis to show that postural fluctuations exhibit similar statistical signatures of cascade dynamics as found in fluid flow. Critically, the oculomotor strain of visually fixating different distances moderates postural cascade dynamics. Visually fixating at a comfortable viewing distance elicited posture with a similar cascade dynamics as posture with eyes closed. Greater viewing distances known to stabilize posture showed more diminished cascade dynamics. In contrast, nearest and farthest viewing distances requiring greater oculomotor strain to focus on targets elicited a dramatic strengthening postural cascade dynamics, reflecting active postural adjustments. Critically, these findings suggest that vision stabilizes posture by reconfiguring the prestressed poise that prepares the body to interact with different spatial layouts.</description>

	<description>When the environment changes, vision adapts to maintain accurate perception. For repeatedly encountered environments, learning to switch immediately to prior adaptive states would be beneficial, but past work remains inconclusive. We tested if the visual system can learn such visual mode switching for a strongly tinted environment, where adaptation causes the dominant hue to fade over time. Eleven observers wore red glasses for five one-hour periods per day, for five days. Color adaptation was measured by asking observers to identify unique yellow, appearing neither reddish nor greenish. As expected, the world appeared less and less reddish during the one-hour periods of glasses wear. Critically, across days the world also appeared significantly less reddish immediately after donning the glasses. This indicates that the visual system learned to shift rapidly to a partially adapted state, switching modes to stabilize color vision. Mode switching likely provides a general strategy to optimize perceptual processes.</description>

	<description>In the early and mid 1800s, scientists debated whether the human brain was functionally differentiated with respect to cognition. The issue was largely resolved when specific language impairments were identified following focal patterns of brain damage. However, neuroimaging has revived this discussion, as many studies find similar syntactic and semantic effects across the set of brain regions implicated in language. Here we address this modern debate using lesion-symptom mapping in two large, partially-overlapping groups of people with left hemisphere brain damage due to stroke (N=121, N=92). We identified multiple measure by region interaction effects, associating damage to the posterior middle temporal gyrus with syntactic comprehension deficits, damage to posterior inferior frontal gyrus with expressive agrammatism, and damage to inferior angular gyrus with semantic category word fluency deficits. Our results are inconsistent with recent hypotheses that regions of the language network play similar roles in high-level linguistic processing.</description>

	<description>The pig is growing in popularity as an experimental animal because its gyrencephalic brain is similar to humans. Currently however, there is a lac of appropriate brain templates to support functional and structural neuroimaging pipelines. The primary contribution of this work is an averag volume from an iterative, non-linear registration of 70 male Yucatan minipig subjects whose ages ranged from five to seven months. In addition, several aspects of this study are unique, including the comparison of linear and non-linear template generation, the characterization of a large and homogeneous cohort, an analysis of effective resolution after averaging, and the evaluation of potential within template bias as well as a comparison with a template from another minipig species using a &quot;left-out&quot; validation set. We found that within our highly homogeneous cohort, non-linear registration produced better templates, but only marginally so. Although our T1-weighted data were resolution limited, we preserved effective resolution across the multi-subject average, produced templates that have high gray-white matter contrast, and demonstrated superior registration accuracy compared to the only known alternative minipig template.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The Effect of Refractive Blur in the Vividness of Mental Imagery</title>

	<description>Background: Visual mental imagery or seeing with the mind's eye is an everyday phenomenon. Visual mental imagery and visual perception share common neural networks. Hence deficits that affect the visual perception may also affect visual mental imagery. Aim: We aimed to study the effect of refractive blur on the vividness of mental imagery. Methods: Subjects were recruited from volunteers and divided into two groups; individuals with refractive errors Ametropes(AM), and individuals without refractive errors Emmetropes(EM). After filling in the Verbalizer-Visualizer-Questionnaire (VVQ), the subjects were asked to perform a mental imagery task with and without refractive blur. The participants were asked to generate a mental image of a specific object initially with eyes closed, eyes open and then with refractive blur in random order, and then judge the vividness of the mental image on a Likert scale ranging from 1 (low vividness) to 5 (good vividness). The EM participants had to wear a + 2D spectacles to produce refractive blur. Results: A total of 162 participants were recruited to the study. Of these 73 were EM and 89 were AM. Of the AM, 30 had additional astigmatism. The mean VVQ score was 64.9(11.2). The mean refractive error was 1.8(1.3)D. Following the mental imagery task, at baseline with eyes closed, 138 (85.5%)subjects had vivid mental imagery close to visual perception(Likert scale:5). With the opening of the eyes, the vividness dropped by at least 1 point in the Likert scale in 139(85.8%). With the introduction of refractive blur, 153(94.4%) subjects had a drop in the vividness of the image by at least 1 point and 22(13.6%) subjects by at least 2 points. Conclusion: Introduction of refractory blur results in the reduction of the vividness of mental imagery.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Biased orientation representations can be explained by experience with non-uniform training set statistics</title>

	<description>Visual acuity is better for vertical and horizontal compared to other orientations. This cross-species phenomenon is often explained by &quot;efficient coding&quot;, whereby more neurons show sharper tuning for the orientations most common in natural vision. However, it is unclear if experience alone can account for such biases. Here, we measured orientation representations in a convolutional neural network, VGG-16, trained on modified versions of ImageNet (rotated by 0, 22.5, or 45 degrees counter-clockwise of upright). Discriminability for each model was highest near the orientations that were most common in the network's training set. Furthermore, there was an over-representation of narrowly tuned units selective for the most common orientations. These effects emerged in middle layers and increased with depth in the network. Our results suggest that biased orientation representations can emerge through experience with a non-uniform distribution of orientations. These findings thus support the efficient coding hypothesis and highlight that biased training data can systematically distort processing in CNNs.</description>

	<description>Global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues unabated. Binding of SARS-CoV-2s Spike protein to host angiotensin converting enzyme 2 triggers viral entry, but other proteins may participate, including neuropilin-1 receptor (NRP-1). As both Spike protein and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) - a pronociceptive and angiogenic factor, bind NRP-1, we tested if Spike could block VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling. VEGF-A-triggered sensory neuronal firing was blocked by Spike protein and NRP-1 inhibitor EG00229. Pro-nociceptive behaviors of VEGF-A were similarly blocked via suppression of spontaneous spinal synaptic activity and reduction of electrogenic currents in sensory neurons. Remarkably, preventing VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling was antiallodynic in a neuropathic pain model. A  silencing of pain via subversion of VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling may underlie increased disease transmission in asymptomatic individuals.

One Sentence SummarySARS-CoV-2s Spike protein promotes analgesia by interfering with VEGF-A/NRP1 pathway, which may affect disease transmission dynamics.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: A novel approach for assessing hypoperfusion in stroke using spatial independent component analysis of resting-state fMRI data</title>

	<description>ObjectiveTo identify, characterize, and automatically classify hypoperfusion-related changes in the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal in acute stroke using spatial independent component analysis of resting-state functional MRI data.

MethodsWe applied spatial independent component analysis to resting-state functional MRI data of 37 stroke patients scanned within 24 hours of symptom onset, 17 of whom received follow-up scans the next day. All patients also received dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI. After denoising and manually classifying the components, we extracted a set of temporal and spatial features from each independent component and used a generalized linear model to automatically identify components related to tissue hypoperfusion.

ResultsOur analysis revealed &quot;Hypoperfusion spatially-Independent Components&quot; (HICs) whose BOLD signal spatial patterns resembled regions of delayed perfusion depicted by dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI. These HICs were detected even in the presence of excessive patient motion, and disappeared following successful tissue reperfusion. The unique spatial and temporal features of HICs allowed them to be distinguished with high accuracy from other components in a user-independent manner (AUC = 0.95, accuracy = 0.96, sensitivity = 1.00, specificity = 0.96).

InterpretationOur study presents a new, non-invasive method for assessing blood flow in acute stroke that minimizes interpretative subjectivity and is robust to severe patient motion.</description>

	<description>Some of the most impressive functional specialization in the human brain is found in occipitotemporal cortex (OTC), where several areas exhibit selectivity for a small number of visual categories, such as faces and bodies, and spatially cluster based on stimulus animacy. Previous studies suggest this animacy organization reflects the representation of an intuitive taxonomic hierarchy, distinct from the presence of face- and body-selective areas in OTC. Using human fMRI, we investigated the independent contribution of these two factors - the face-body division and taxonomic hierarchy - in accounting for the animacy organization of OTC, and whether they might also be reflected in the architecture of several deep neural networks. We found that graded selectivity based on animal resemblance to human faces and bodies masquerades as an apparent animacy continuum, which suggests that taxonomy is not a separate factor underlying the organization of the ventral visual pathway.</description>

	<description>Rhythmic limb movements during locomotion are controlled by a central pattern generator (CPG) circuits located in the spinal cord. It is considered that these circuits are composed of individual rhythm generators (RGs) for each limb interacting with each other through multiple commissural and long propriospinal circuits. The organization and operation of each RG are not fully understood, and different competing theories exist about interactions between its flexor and extensor components, as well as about left-right commissural interactions between the RGs. The central idea of circuit organization proposed in this study is that with an increase of excitatory input to each RGs (or an increase in locomotor speed) the rhythmogenic mechanism within the RGs changes from &quot;flexor-driven&quot; rhythmicity to a &quot;classical half-center&quot; mechanism. We test this hypothesis using our experimental data on changes in duration of stance and swing phases in the intact and spinal cats walking on the ground or tied-belt treadmills (symmetric conditions) or split-belt treadmills with different left and right belt speeds (asymmetric conditions). We compare these experimental data with the results of mathematical modeling, in which simulated CPG circuits operate in similar symmetric and asymmetric conditions with matching or differing control drives to the left and right RGs. The obtained results support the proposed concept of state-dependent changes in RG operation and specific commissural interactions between the RGs. The performed simulations and mathematical analysis of model operation under different conditions provide new insights into CPG network organization and limb coordination during locomotion.

Key Point SummaryO_LILimb movements during locomotion are controlled by neural circuits located within the spinal cord. These circuits include rhythm generators (RGs) controlling each limb interacting through multiple commissural pathways.
C_LIO_LIThe organization and operation of spinal RGs are not fully understood, and different competing concepts exists. We suggest that the operation of RGs is state-dependent, so that with an increase of external excitation the rhythmogenesis changes from &quot;flexor-driven&quot; oscillations to a &quot;classical half-center&quot; mechanism.
C_LIO_LIA mathematical model of spinal circuits representing bilaterally-interacting RGs has been developed based on the above suggestion and used to interpret experimental data from intact and spinal cats walking on the ground or tied-belt treadmills (symmetric conditions) as well as on split-belt treadmills with different left and right belt speeds (asymmetric conditions).

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Distinct signatures of calcium activity in brain pericytes</title>

	<description>Even though pericytes have been implicated in various neurological disorders, little is known about their function and signaling pathways in the healthy brain. Here, we characterized cortical pericyte calcium dynamics using two-photon imaging of Pdgfr{beta}-CreERT2;GCaMP6s mice under anesthesia in vivo and in brain slices ex vivo. We found distinct differences between pericyte subtypes in vivo: Ensheathing pericytes exhibited smooth muscle cell-like calcium dynamics, while calcium signals in capillary pericytes were irregular, higher in frequency and occurred in cellular microdomains. In contrast to ensheathing pericytes, capillary pericytes retained their spontaneous calcium signals during prolonged anesthesia and in the absence of blood flow ex vivo. Chemogenetic activation of neurons in vivo and acute increase of extracellular potassium in brain slices strongly decreased calcium activity in capillary pericytes. We propose that neuronal activity-induced elevations in extracellular potassium suppress calcium activity in capillary pericytes, likely mediated by Kir2.2 and KATP channel activation.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Computational principles of neural adaptation for binaural signal integration</title>

Adaptation to statistics of sensory inputs is an essential ability of neural systems and extends their effective operational range. Having a broad operational range facilitates to react to sensory inputs of different granularities, thus is a crucial factor for survival. The computation of auditory cues for spatial localization of sound sources, particularly the interaural level difference (ILD), has long been considered as a static process. Novel findings suggest that this process of ipsi- and contra-lateral signal integration is highly adaptive and depends strongly on recent stimulus statistics. Here, adaptation aids the encoding of auditory perceptual space of various granularities. To investigate the mechanism of auditory adaptation in binaural signal integration in detail, we developed a neural model architecture for simulating functions of lateral superior olive (LSO) and medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) composed of single compartment conductance-based neurons. Neurons in the MNTB serve as an intermediate relay population. Their signal is integrated by the LSO population on a circuit level to represent excitatory and inhibitory interactions of input signals. The circuit incorporates an adaptation mechanism operating at the synaptic level based on local inhibitory feedback signals. The model’s predictive power is demonstrated in various simulations replicating physiological data. Incorporating the innovative adaptation mechanism facilitates a shift in neural responses towards the most effective stimulus range based on recent stimulus history. The model demonstrates that a single LSO neuron quickly adapts to these stimulus statistics and, thus, can encode an extended range of ILDs in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Most significantly, we provide a unique measurement of the adaptation efficacy of LSO neurons. Prerequisite of normal function is an accurate interaction of inhibitory and excitatory signals, a precise encoding of time and a well-tuned local feedback circuit. We suggest that the mechanisms of temporal competitive-cooperative interaction and the local feedback mechanism jointly sensitize the circuit to enable a response shift towards contra-lateral and ipsi-lateral stimuli, respectively.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jBJQd880EGA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Interactions between calmodulin and neurogranin govern the dynamics of CaMKII as a leaky integrator</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008015</guid>

Calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) has long been known to play an important role in learning and memory as well as long term potentiation (LTP). More recently it has been suggested that it might be involved in the time averaging of synaptic signals, which can then lead to the high precision of information stored at a single synapse. However, the role of the scaffolding molecule, neurogranin (Ng), in governing the dynamics of CaMKII is not yet fully understood. In this work, we adopt a rule-based modeling approach through the Monte Carlo method to study the effect of &lt;i&gt;Ca&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals on the dynamics of CaMKII phosphorylation in the postsynaptic density (PSD). Calcium surges are observed in synaptic spines during an EPSP and back-propagating action potential due to the opening of NMDA receptors and voltage dependent calcium channels. Using agent-based models, we computationally investigate the dynamics of phosphorylation of CaMKII monomers and dodecameric holoenzymes. The scaffolding molecule, Ng, when present in significant concentration, limits the availability of free calmodulin (CaM), the protein which activates CaMKII in the presence of calcium. We show that Ng plays an important modulatory role in CaMKII phosphorylation following a surge of high calcium concentration. We find a non-intuitive dependence of this effect on CaM concentration that results from the different affinities of CaM for CaMKII depending on the number of calcium ions bound to the former. It has been shown previously that in the absence of phosphatase, CaMKII monomers integrate over &lt;i&gt;Ca&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals of certain frequencies through autophosphorylation (Pepke et al, Plos Comp. Bio., 2010). We also study the effect of multiple calcium spikes on CaMKII holoenzyme autophosphorylation, and show that in the presence of phosphatase, CaMKII behaves as a leaky integrator of calcium signals, a result that has been recently observed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Our models predict that the parameters of this leaky integrator are finely tuned through the interactions of Ng, CaM, CaMKII, and PP1, providing a mechanism to precisely control the sensitivity of synapses to calcium signals.

Bacteria need to survive in a wide range of environments. Currently, there is an incomplete understanding of the genetic basis for mechanisms underpinning survival in stressful conditions, such as the presence of anti-microbials. Transposon directed insertion-site sequencing (TraDIS) is a powerful tool to identify genes and networks which are involved in survival and fitness under a given condition by simultaneously assaying the fitness of millions of mutants, thereby relating genotype to phenotype and contributing to an understanding of bacterial cell biology. A recent refinement of this approach allows the roles of essential genes in conditional stress survival to be inferred by altering their expression. These advancements combined with the rapidly falling costs of sequencing now allows comparisons between multiple experiments to identify commonalities in stress responses to different conditions. This capacity however poses a new challenge for analysis of multiple data sets in conjunction. To address this analysis need, we have developed ‘AlbaTraDIS’; a software application for rapid large-scale comparative analysis of TraDIS experiments that predicts the impact of transposon insertions on nearby genes. AlbaTraDIS can identify genes which are up or down regulated, or inactivated, between multiple conditions, producing a filtered list of genes for further experimental validation as well as several accompanying data visualisations. We demonstrate the utility of our new approach by applying it to identify genes used by &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; to survive in a wide range of different concentrations of the biocide Triclosan. AlbaTraDIS identified all well characterised Triclosan resistance genes, including the primary target, &lt;i&gt;fabI&lt;/i&gt;. A number of new loci were also implicated in Triclosan resistance and the predicted phenotypes for a selection of these were validated experimentally with results being consistent with predictions. AlbaTraDIS provides a simple and rapid method to analyse multiple transposon mutagenesis data sets allowing this technology to be used at large scale. To our knowledge this is the only tool currently available that can perform these tasks. AlbaTraDIS is written in Python 3 and is available under the open source licence GNU GPL 3 from https://github.com/quadram-institute-bioscience/albatradis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xOgmwvwDuoY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The evolution of transformed cancer cells into metastatic tumors is, in part, driven by altered intracellular signaling downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). The surface levels and activity of RTKs are governed mainly through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), endosomal recycling, or degradation. In turn, oncogenic signaling downstream of RTKs can reciprocally regulate endocytic trafficking by creating feedback loops in cells to enhance tumor progression. We previously showed that FCH/F-BAR and Double SH3 Domain-Containing Protein (FCHSD2) has a cancer-cell specific function in regulating CME in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Here, we report that FCHSD2 loss impacts recycling of the RTKs, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and proto-oncogene c-Met (MET), and shunts their trafficking into late endosomes and lysosomal degradation. Notably, FCHSD2 depletion results in the nuclear translocation of active extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), leading to enhanced transcription and up-regulation of EGFR and MET. The small GTPase, Ras-related protein Rab-7A (Rab7), is essential for the FCHSD2 depletion-induced effects. Correspondingly, FCHSD2 loss correlates to higher tumor grades of NSCLC. Clinically, NSCLC patients expressing high FCHSD2 exhibit elevated survival, whereas patients with high Rab7 expression display decreased survival rates. Our study provides new insight into the molecular nexus for crosstalk between oncogenic signaling and RTK trafficking that controls cancer progression.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ON9Dv7qRL7g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;H‐ABC is a neurodegenerative disease due to mutations in TUBB4A. Auditory evoked potentials are abnormal in this disease. Human mutation D249N impairs central function. A302T‐mutant &lt;i&gt;Taiep &lt;/i&gt; rats presents longer latencies in central waves. Both mutations severely impair the central hearing pathway by progressive central white matter degeneration.

&lt;p&gt;Hypomyelination with atrophy of the basal ganglia and cerebellum (H‐ABC) is a neurodegenerative disease due to mutations in TUBB4A. Patients suffer from extrapyramidal movements, spasticity, ataxia, and cognitive deficits. Magnetic resonance imaging features are hypomyelination and atrophy of the striatum and cerebellum. A correlation between the mutations and their cellular, tissue and organic effects is largely missing. The effects of these mutations on sensory functions have not been described so far. We have previously reported a rat carring a TUBB4A (A302T) mutation and sharing most of the clinical and radiological signs with H‐ABC patients. Here, for the first time, we did a comparative study of the hearing function in an H‐ABC patient and in this mutant model. By analyzing hearing function we found that there are no significant differences in the auditory brainstem response thresholds between mutant rats and WT controls. Nevertheless, auditory brainstem responses show longer latencies in central waves (II‐IV), that in some cases disappear when compared to WT. The patient also shows abnormal AEPs showing only waves I and II. Distortion product of otoacustic emissions and immunohistochemistry in the rat show that the peripheral hearing function and morphology of the Organ of Corti are normal. We conclude that the tubulin mutation severely impairs the central hearing pathway most probably by progressive central white matter degeneration. Hearing function might be affected in a significant fraction of patients with H‐ABC, therefore screening for auditory function should be done on patients with tubulinopathies to evaluate hearing support therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immunohistochemical staining for parvalbumin reveals the various nuclei of the superior olivary complex and trapezoid body within the brain of the African wild dog. We could identify the medial (&lt;b&gt;MSO &lt;/b&gt;) and lateral (&lt;b&gt;LSO &lt;/b&gt;) superior olivary nuclei, the superior (&lt;b&gt;SPO &lt;/b&gt;), medioventral (&lt;b&gt;MVPO &lt;/b&gt;) and lateroventral (&lt;b&gt;LVPO &lt;/b&gt;) periolivary nuclei, the nucleus of the trapezoid body (&lt;b&gt;Tz &lt;/b&gt;), and the fibre bundles forming the trapezoid body (&lt;b&gt;tz &lt;/b&gt;). Scale bar = 1 mm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The large external pinnae and extensive vocal repertoire of the African wild dog (&lt;i&gt;Lycaon pictus &lt;/i&gt;) has led to the assumption that the auditory system of this unique canid may be specialized. Here, using cytoarchitecture, myeloarchitecture, and a range of immunohistochemical stains, we describe the systems‐level anatomy of the auditory system of the African wild dog. We observed the cochlear nuclear complex, superior olivary nuclear complex, lateral lemniscus, inferior colliculus, medial geniculate body and auditory cortex all being in their expected locations, and exhibiting the standard subdivisions of this system. While located in the ectosylvian gyri, the auditory cortex includes several areas, resembling the parcellation observed in cats and ferrets, although not all of the auditory areas known from these species could be identified in the African wild dog. These observations suggest that, broadly speaking, the systems‐level anatomy of the auditory system, and by extension the processing of auditory information, within the brain of the African wild dog closely resembles that observed in other carnivores. Our findings indicate that it is likely that the extraction of the semantic content of the vocalizations of African wild dogs, and the behaviours generated, occurs beyond the classically defined auditory system, in limbic or association neocortical regions involved in cognitive functions. Thus, to obtain a deeper understanding of how auditory stimuli are processed, and how communication is achieved, in the African wild dog compared to other canids, cortical regions beyond the primary sensory areas will need to be examined in detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neurons of the dorsomedial division of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTdm) project onto hypothalamic nuclei including the paraventricular (PVH), dorsomedial (DMH), arcuate (ARH) nuclei and the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA). In particular, BNSTdm neurons innervate proopiomelanocortin‐ (POMC), agouti‐related peptide‐ (AgRP), melanin‐concentrating hormone‐ (MCH) and orexin‐ (ORX) expressing neurons of the ARH and the LHA, respectively.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stressful environment is a potent modulator of feeding, we seek in the present work to decipher the neuroanatomical basis for an interplay between stress and feeding behaviors. For this, we combined anterograde and retrograde tracing with immunohistochemical approaches to investigate the patterns of projections between the dorsomedial division of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), well connected to the amygdala, and hypothalamic structures such as the paraventricular (PVH) and dorsomedial (DMH), the arcuate (ARH) nuclei and the lateral hypothalamic areas (LHA) known to control feeding and motivated behaviors. We particularly focused our study on afferences to proopiomelanocortin (POMC), agouti‐related peptide (AgRP), melanin‐concentrating‐hormone (MCH) and orexin (ORX) neurons characteristics of the ARH and the LHA, respectively. We found light to intense innervation of all these hypothalamic nuclei. We particularly showed an innervation of POMC, AgRP, MCH and ORX neurons by the dorsomedial and dorsolateral divisions of the BNST.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, these results lay the foundation for a better understanding of the neuroanatomical basis of the stress‐related feeding behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Campaniform sensilla are a sensory system in insects that detect deformations of the exoskeleton. The comparison of front, middle, and hindleg sensilla reveals robust locations with a small amount of interindividual variability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sensory systems provide input to motor networks on the state of the body and environment. One such sensory system in insects is the campaniform sensilla (CS), which detect deformations of the exoskeleton arising from resisted movements or external perturbations. When physical strain is applied to the cuticle, CS external structures are compressed, leading to transduction in an internal sensory neuron. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster &lt;/i&gt;, the distribution of CS on the exoskeleton has not been comprehensively described. To investigate CS number, location, spatial arrangement and potential differences between individuals, we compared the front, middle, and hind legs of multiple flies using scanning electron microscopy. Additionally, we imaged the entire body surface to confirm known CS locations. On the legs, the number and relative arrangement of CS varied between individuals, and single CS of corresponding segments showed characteristic differences between legs. This knowledge is fundamental for studying the relevance of cuticular strain information within the complex neuromuscular networks controlling posture and movement. This comprehensive account of all &lt;i&gt;D. melanogaster &lt;/i&gt; CS helps set the stage for experimental investigations into their responsivity, sensitivity, and roles in sensory acquisition and motor control in a light‐weight model organism.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Distribution and overlap of entorhinal, premotor, and amygdalar connections in the monkey anterior cingulate cortex&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/0ae9f33d-1b78-4a68-9cde-ca891149e460/cne24986-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bidirectional tracer injections in macaque monkey entorhinal cortex (EC), amygdala (AMY), and premotor cortex (PMC) reveal distinct distributions across the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). We show that EC and PMC connections are segregated across ventral (A25, A24a) and dorsal (A24b,c) ACC, while AMY connections are evenly distributed. These distinct ACC networks are likely important for temporal integration and affective, contextual, and motor processing in flexible goal‐directed behavior.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is important for decision‐making as it integrates motor plans with affective and contextual limbic information. Disruptions in these networks have been observed in depression, bipolar disorder, and post‐traumatic stress disorder. Yet, overlap of limbic and motor connections within subdivisions of the ACC is not well understood. Hence, we administered a combination of retro and anterograde tracers into structures important for contextual memories (entorhinal cortex), affective processing (amygdala) and motor planning (dorsal premotor cortex) to assess overlap of labeled projection neurons from (outputs) and axon terminals to (inputs) the ACC of adult rhesus monkeys (&lt;i&gt;Macaca mulatta &lt;/i&gt;). Our data show that entorhinal and dorsal premotor cortical (dPMC) connections are segregated across ventral (A25, A24a) and dorsal (A24b,c) subregions of the ACC, while amygdalar connections are evenly distributed across subregions. Among all areas, the rostral ACC (A32) had the lowest relative density of inter‐connections with all three regions. In the ventral ACC, entorhinal and amygdalar inter‐connections strongly overlap across all layers, especially in A25. In the dorsal ACC, outputs to dPMC and the amygdala strongly overlap in deep layers. However, dPMC input to the dorsal ACC was densest in deep layers, while amygdalar inputs predominantly localized in upper layers. This is consistent with roles of the dorsal ACC in motor evaluation and the ventral ACC in affective and contextual memory. Further, distinct laminar patterns suggest unique interactions within specific ACC compartments that are likely important for the temporal integration of motor and limbic information during flexible goal‐directed behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Open-endedness, primarily studied in the context of artificial life, is the
ability of systems to generate potentially unbounded ontologies of increasing
novelty and complexity. Engineering generative systems displaying at least some
degree of this ability is a goal with clear applications to procedural content
generation in games. The Paired Open-Ended Trailblazer (POET) algorithm,
heretofore explored only in a biped walking domain, is a coevolutionary system
that simultaneously generates environments and agents that can solve them. This
paper introduces a POET-Inspired Neuroevolutionary System for KreativitY
(PINSKY) in games, which co-generates levels for multiple video games and
agents that play them. This system leverages the General Video Game Artificial
Intelligence (GVGAI) framework to enable co-generation of levels and agents for
the 2D Atari-style games Zelda and Solar Fox. Results demonstrate the ability
of PINSKY to generate curricula of game levels, opening up a promising new
avenue for research at the intersection of procedural content generation and
artificial life. At the same time, results in these challenging game domains
highlight the limitations of the current algorithm and opportunities for
improvement.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;As the world's first primary morbidity factor, depression has a considerable
impact on both an individual as well as a societal level. despite their
discovery several decades ago, classical antidepressants have been shown to
provide limited benefits against this condition. However, substances such as
ketamine and psychedelics have recently shown promising results and even
received the grade of Breakthrough therapy for this indication. The accurate
mechanisms of action underlying the efficacy of these substances are still to
be defined, but some similarities appear to be shared on different levels
across these substances. These include their structural, functional and
behavioral plasticity promoting abilities, as well as their capacity to promote
Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor overexpression, which seems to constitute a
key element underlying their immediate and long-lasting action. From this
observation, the present review aims to examine and connect the pharmacological
pathways involved in these therapies to the neurobiological, cognitive and
psychological responses that could be shared by both 5-HT2AR agonists and NMDA
antagonists. It is suggested that BDNF overexpression resulting from mTOR
activation mediates both structural and functional plasticity, resulting in
connectivity changes among high-level cognitive networks such as the Default
Mode Network, finally leading to an increased and long-lasting psychological
flexibility. Connecting these pieces of evidence could provide insights about
their precise mechanisms of action and help researchers to develop biomarkers
for antidepressant response. If the hypotheses suggested in this review are
verified by further trials, they could also constitute a starting point to
developing safer and more efficient antidepressants, as well as provide
information about the interactions that exist between different
neurotransmitters systems.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Brain volume: An important determinant of functional outcome after acute ischemic stroke. (arXiv:2007.08374v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08374</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08374</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: To determine whether brain volume is associated with functional
outcome after acute ischemic stroke (AIS).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional data of the multi-site, international
hospital-based MRI-GENetics Interface Exploration (MRI-GENIE) study (July 1,
2014- March 16, 2019) with clinical brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
obtained on admission for index stroke and functional outcome assessment.
Post-stroke outcome was determined using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score
(0-6; 0: asymptomatic; 6 death) recorded between 60-190 days after stroke.
Demographics and other clinical variables including acute stroke severity
(measured as National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score), vascular risk
factors, and etiologic stroke subtypes (Causative Classification of Stroke)
were recorded during index admission.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results: Utilizing the data from 912 acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients
(65+/-15 years of age, 58% male, 57% history of smoking, and 65% hypertensive)
in a generalized linear model, brain volume (per 155.1cm^3 ) was associated
with age (beta -0.3 (per 14.4 years)), male sex (beta 1.0) and prior stroke
(beta -0.2). In the multivariable outcome model, brain volume was an
independent predictor of mRS (beta -0.233), with reduced odds of worse
long-term functional outcomes (OR: 0.8, 95% CI 0.7-0.9) in those with larger
brain volumes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Larger brain volume quantified on clinical MRI of AIS patients
at time of stroke purports a protective mechanism. The role of brain volume as
a prognostic, protective biomarker has the potential to forge new areas of
research and advance current knowledge of mechanisms of post-stroke recovery.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The problem of fast items retrieval from a fixed collection is often
encountered in most computer science areas, from operating system components to
databases and user interfaces. We present an approach based on hash tables that
focuses on both minimizing the number of comparisons performed during the
search and minimizing the total collection size. The standard open-addressing
double-hashing approach is improved with a non-linear transformation that can
be parametrized in order to ensure a uniform distribution of the data in the
hash table. The optimal parameter is determined using a genetic algorithm. The
paper results show that near-perfect hashing is faster than binary search, yet
uses less memory than perfect hashing, being a good choice for
memory-constrained applications where search time is also critical.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: The Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm Copes Well With Deception and Epistasis. (arXiv:2007.08277v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08277</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08277</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In their recent work, Lehre and Nguyen (FOGA 2019) show that the univariate
marginal distribution algorithm (UMDA) needs time exponential in the parent
populations size to optimize the DeceptiveLeadingBlocks (DLB) problem. They
conclude from this result that univariate EDAs have difficulties with deception
and epistasis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we show that this negative finding is caused by an unfortunate
choice of the parameters of the UMDA. When the population sizes are chosen
large enough to prevent genetic drift, then the UMDA optimizes the DLB problem
with high probability with at most $\lambda(\frac{n}{2} + 2 e \ln n)$ fitness
evaluations. Since an offspring population size $\lambda$ of order $n \log n$
can prevent genetic drift, the UMDA can solve the DLB problem with $O(n^2 \log
n)$ fitness evaluations. In contrast, for classic evolutionary algorithms no
better run time guarantee than $O(n^3)$ is known (which we prove to be tight
for the ${(1+1)}$ EA), so our result rather suggests that the UMDA can cope
well with deception and epistatis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a broader perspective, our result shows that the UMDA can cope better
with local optima than evolutionary algorithms; such a result was previously
known only for the compact genetic algorithm. Together with the result of Lehre
and Nguyen, our result for the first time rigorously proves that running EDAs
in the regime with genetic drift can lead to drastic performance losses.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The scaling of correlations as a function of system size provides important
hints to understand critical phenomena on a variety of systems. Its study in
biological systems offers two challenges: usually they are not of infinite
size, and in the majority of cases sizes can not be varied at will. Here we
discuss how finite-size scaling can be approximated in an experimental system
of fixed and relatively small size by computing correlations inside of a
reduced field of view of various sizes (i.e., &quot;box-scaling&quot;). Numerical
simulations of a neuronal network are used to verify such approximation, as
well as the ferromagnetic 2D Ising model. The numerical results support the
validity of the heuristic approach, which should be useful to characterize
relevant aspects of critical phenomena in biological systems.

is already underway. One of these potential technologies for the 6G networks
are Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs). They offer unprecedented
degrees of freedom towards engineering the wireless channel, i.e., the ability
to modify the characteristics of the channel whenever and however required.
Nevertheless, such properties demand that the response of the associated
metasurface (MSF) is well understood under all possible operational conditions.
While an understanding of the radiation pattern characteristics can be obtained
through either analytical models or full wave simulations, they suffer from
inaccuracy under certain conditions and extremely high computational
complexity, respectively. Hence, in this paper we propose a novel neural
networks based approach that enables a fast and accurate characterization of
the MSF response. We analyze multiple scenarios and demonstrate the
capabilities and utility of the proposed methodology. Concretely, we show that
this method is able to learn and predict the parameters governing the reflected
wave radiation pattern with an accuracy of a full wave simulation (98.8%-99.8%)
and the time and computational complexity of an analytical model. The
aforementioned result and methodology will be of specific importance for the
design, fault tolerance and maintenance of the thousands of RISs that will be
deployed in the 6G network environment.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent advances in deep learning have made available large, powerful
convolutional neural networks (CNN) with state-of-the-art performance in
several real-world applications. Unfortunately, these large-sized models have
millions of parameters, thus they are not deployable on resource-limited
platforms (e.g. where RAM is limited). Compression of CNNs thereby becomes a
critical problem to achieve memory-efficient and possibly computationally
faster model representations. In this paper, we investigate the impact of lossy
compression of CNNs by weight pruning and quantization, and lossless weight
matrix representations based on source coding. We tested several combinations
of these techniques on four benchmark datasets for classification and
regression problems, achieving compression rates up to $165$ times, while
preserving or improving the model performance.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this work, we present a simple and general search space shrinking method,
called Angle-Based search space Shrinking (ABS), for Neural Architecture Search
(NAS). Our approach progressively simplifies the original search space by
dropping unpromising candidates, thus can reduce difficulties for existing NAS
methods to find superior architectures. In particular, we propose an
angle-based metric to guide the shrinking process. We provide comprehensive
evidences showing that, in weight-sharing supernet, the proposed metric is more
stable and accurate than accuracy-based and magnitude-based metrics to predict
the capability of child models. We also show that the angle-based metric can
converge fast while training supernet, enabling us to get promising shrunk
search spaces efficiently. ABS can easily apply to most of NAS approaches (e.g.
SPOS, FairNAS, ProxylessNAS, DARTS and PDARTS). Comprehensive experiments show
that ABS can dramatically enhance existing NAS approaches by providing a
promising shrunk search space.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Evolving Robust Neural Architectures to Defend from Adversarial Attacks. (arXiv:1906.11667v3 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural networks are prone to misclassify slightly modified input images.
Recently, many defences have been proposed, but none have improved the
robustness of neural networks consistently. Here, we propose to use adversarial
attacks as a function evaluation to search for neural architectures that can
resist such attacks automatically. Experiments on neural architecture search
algorithms from the literature show that although accurate, they are not able
to find robust architectures. A significant reason for this lies in their
limited search space. By creating a novel neural architecture search with
options for dense layers to connect with convolution layers and vice-versa as
well as the addition of concatenation layers in the search, we were able to
evolve an architecture that is inherently accurate on adversarial samples.
Interestingly, this inherent robustness of the evolved architecture rivals
state-of-the-art defences such as adversarial training while being trained only
on the non-adversarial samples. Moreover, the evolved architecture makes use of
some peculiar traits which might be useful for developing even more robust
ones. Thus, the results here confirm that more robust architectures exist as
well as opens up a new realm of feasibilities for the development and
exploration of neural networks.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Representation Quality Of Neural Networks Links To Adversarial Attacks and Defences. (arXiv:1906.06627v5 [cs.CV] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural networks have been shown vulnerable to a variety of adversarial
algorithms. A crucial step to understanding the rationale for this lack of
robustness is to assess the potential of the neural networks' representation to
encode the existing features. Here, we propose a method to understand the
representation quality of the neural networks using a novel test based on
Zero-Shot Learning, entitled Raw Zero-Shot. The principal idea is that, if an
algorithm learns rich features, such features should be able to interpret
&quot;unknown&quot; classes as an aggregate of previously learned features. This is
because unknown classes usually share several regular features with recognised
classes, given the features learned are general enough. We further introduce
two metrics to assess these learned features to interpret unknown classes. One
is based on inter-cluster validation technique (Davies-Bouldin Index), and the
other is based on the distance to an approximated ground-truth. Experiments
suggest that adversarial defences improve the representation of the
classifiers, further suggesting that to improve the robustness of the
classifiers, one has to improve the representation quality also. Experiments
also reveal a strong association (a high Pearson Correlation and low p-value)
between the metrics and adversarial attacks. Interestingly, the results
indicate that dynamic routing networks such as CapsNet have better
representation while current deeper neural networks are trading off
representation quality for accuracy.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Adversarial Robustness Assessment: Why both $L_0$ and $L_\infty$ Attacks Are Necessary. (arXiv:1906.06026v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;There exists a vast number of adversarial attacks and defences for machine
learning algorithms of various types which makes assessing the robustness of
algorithms a daunting task. To make matters worse, there is an intrinsic bias
in these adversarial algorithms. Here, we organise the problems faced: a) Model
Dependence, b) Insufficient Evaluation, c) False Adversarial Samples, and d)
Perturbation Dependent Results). Based on this, we propose a model agnostic
dual quality assessment method, together with the concept of robustness levels
to tackle them. We validate the dual quality assessment on state-of-the-art
neural networks (WideResNet, ResNet, AllConv, DenseNet, NIN, LeNet and CapsNet)
as well as adversarial defences for image classification problem. We further
show that current networks and defences are vulnerable at all levels of
robustness. The proposed robustness assessment reveals that depending on the
metric used (i.e., $L_0$ or $L_\infty$), the robustness may vary significantly.
Hence, the duality should be taken into account for a correct evaluation.
Moreover, a mathematical derivation, as well as a counter-example, suggest that
$L_1$ and $L_2$ metrics alone are not sufficient to avoid spurious adversarial
samples. Interestingly, the threshold attack of the proposed assessment is a
novel $L_\infty$ black-box adversarial method which requires even less
perturbation than the One-Pixel Attack (only $12\%$ of One-Pixel Attack's
amount of perturbation) to achieve similar results.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: FNS: an event-driven spiking neural network simulator based on the LIFL neuron model. (arXiv:1801.00864v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Limitations in processing capabilities and memory of today's computers make
spiking neuron-based (human) whole-brain simulations inevitably characterized
by a compromise between bio-plausibility and computational cost. It translates
into brain models composed of a reduced number of neurons and a simplified
neuron's mathematical model, leading to the search for new simulation
strategies. Taking advantage of the sparse character of brain-like computation,
the event-driven technique could represent a way to carry out efficient
simulation of large-scale Spiking Neural Networks (SNN). The recent Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire with Latency (LIFL) spiking neuron model is event-driven
compatible and exhibits some realistic neuronal features, opening new avenues
for brain modelling. In this paper we introduce FNS, the first LIFL-based
spiking neural network framework, which combines spiking/synaptic neural
modelling with the event-driven approach, allowing us to define heterogeneous
neuron modules and multi-scale connectivity with delayed connections and
plastic synapses. In order to allow multi-thread implementations a novel
parallelization strategy is also introduced. This paper presents mathematical
models, software implementation and simulation routines on which FNS is based.
Finally, a brain subnetwork is modeled on the basis of real brain structural
data, and the resulting simulated activity is compared with associated brain
functional (source-space MEG) data, demonstrating a good matching between the
activity of the model and that of the experimetal data. This work aims to lay
the groundwork for future event-driven based personalised brain models.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Intramuscular Delivery of Gene Therapy for Targeting the Nervous System</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Virus-mediated gene therapy has the potential to deliver exogenous genetic material into specific cell types to promote survival and counteract disease. This is particularly enticing for neuronal conditions, as the nervous system is renowned for its intransigence to therapeutic targeting. Administration of gene therapy viruses into skeletal muscle, where distal terminals of motor and sensory neurons reside, has been shown to result in extensive transduction of cells within the spinal cord, brainstem, and sensory ganglia. This route is minimally invasive and therefore clinically relevant for gene therapy targeting to peripheral nerve soma. For successful transgene expression, viruses administered into muscle must undergo a series of processes, including host cell interaction and internalization, intracellular sorting, long-range retrograde axonal transport, endosomal liberation, and nuclear import. In this review article, we outline key characteristics of major gene therapy viruses—adenovirus, adeno-associated virus (AAV), and lentivirus—and summarize the mechanisms regulating important steps in the virus journey from binding at peripheral nerve terminals to nuclear delivery. Additionally, we describe how neuropathology can negatively influence these pathways, and conclude by discussing opportunities to optimize the intramuscular administration route to maximize gene delivery and thus therapeutic potential.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Optimal Multichannel Artifact Prediction and Removal for Neural Stimulation and Brain Machine Interfaces</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00709</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural implants that deliver multi-site electrical stimulation to the nervous systems are no longer the last resort but routine treatment options for various neurological disorders. Multi-site electrical stimulation is also widely used to study nervous system function and neural circuit transformations. These technologies increasingly demand dynamic electrical stimulation and closed-loop feedback control for real-time assessment of neural function, which is technically challenging since stimulus-evoked artifacts overwhelm the small neural signals of interest. We report a novel and versatile artifact removal method that can be applied in a variety of settings, from single- to multi-site stimulation and recording and for current waveforms of arbitrary shape and size. The method capitalizes on linear electrical coupling between stimulating currents and recording artifacts, which allows us to estimate a multi-channel linear Wiener filter to predict and subsequently remove artifacts via subtraction. We confirm and verify the linearity assumption and demonstrate feasibility in a variety of recording modalities, including in vitro sciatic nerve stimulation, bilateral cochlear implant stimulation, and multi-channel stimulation and recording between the auditory midbrain and cortex. We demonstrate a vast enhancement in the recording quality with a typical artifact reduction of 25−40 dB. The method is efficient and can be scaled to arbitrary number of stimulus and recording sites, making it ideal for applications in large-scale arrays, closed-loop implants, and high-resolution multi-channel brain-machine interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Extramuscular Recording of Spontaneous EMG Activity and Transcranial Electrical Elicited Motor Potentials in Horses: Characteristics of Different Subcutaneous and Surface Electrode Types and Practical Guidelines</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00652</guid>

	<description>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Adhesive surface electrodes are worthwhile to explore in detail as alternative to subcutaneous needle electrodes to assess myogenic evoked potentials (MEP) in human and horses. Extramuscular characteristics of both electrode types and different brands are compared in simultaneous recordings by also considering electrode impedances and background noise under not mechanically secured (not taped) and taped conditions.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;In five ataxic and one non-ataxic horses, transcranial electrical MEPs, myographic activity, and noise were simultaneously recorded from subcutaneous needle (three brands) together with pre-gelled surface electrodes (five brands) on four extremities. In three horses, the impedances of four adjacent-placed surface-electrode pairs of different brands were measured and compared. The similarity between needle and surface EMGs was assessed by cross-correlation functions, pairwise comparison of motor latency times (MLT), and amplitudes. The influence of electrode noise and impedance on the signal quality was assessed by a failure rate (FR) function. Geometric means and impedance ranges under not taped and taped conditions were derived for each brand.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;High coherencies between EMGs of needle-surface pairs degraded to 0.7 at moderate and disappeared at strong noise. MLTs showed sub-millisecond simultaneous differences while sequential variations were several milliseconds. Subcutaneous MEP amplitudes were somewhat lower than epidermal. The impedances of subcutaneous needle electrodes were below 900 Ω and FR = 0. For four brands, the FR for surface electrodes was between 0 and 80% and declined to below 25% after taping. A remaining brand (27G DSN2260 Medtronic) revealed impedances over 100 kΩ and FR = 100% under not taped and taped conditions.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Subcutaneous needle and surface electrodes yield highly coherent EMGs and TES–MEP signals. When taped and allowing sufficient settling time, adhesive surface-electrode signals may approach the signal quality of subcutaneous needle electrodes but still depend on unpredictable conditions of the skin. The study provides a new valuable practical guidance for selection of extramuscular EMG electrodes. This study on horses shares common principles for the choice of adhesive surface or sc needle electrodes in human applications such as in intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring of motor functions of the brain and spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: A Case of Psychogenic Myoclonus Responding to a Novel Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Approach: Rationale, Feasibility, and Possible Neurophysiological Basis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can relieve motor symptoms related to psychogenic movement disorders (PMDs), but the subtending neurophysiological basis is unclear. We report on a 50-year-old woman with a diagnosis of psychogenic myoclonus in the right lower limb, who was treated with a daily session (in the late morning/early afternoon) of 1 Hz rTMS over the left premotor cortex (PMC), five times a week for 6 weeks. Clinical data and EEG at rest were collected before and immediately and 2-month after the rTMS protocol completion. The patient reported a significant reduction of involuntary movement frequency and intensity and the related disability burden up to the follow-up. In parallel, any abnormality in terms of source current density within and connectivity between the frontal and parietal areas was reset. The short follow–up period, the lack of extensive neurophysiological measures, and the lack of control treatment represent the main limitation of the study. However, low-frequency rTMS over PMC seems a safe and promising approach for the management of psychogenic myoclonus owing to the combination of cortical neuromodulation and non-specific mechanisms suggesting cognitive-behavioral effects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Losses Motivate Cognitive Effort More Than Gains in Effort-Based Decision Making and Performance</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00287</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00287</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human behavior is more strongly driven by the motivation to avoid losses than to pursue gains (loss aversion). However, there is little research on how losses influence the motivation to exert effort. We compared the effects of loss and gain incentives on cognitive task performance and effort-based decision making. In three experiments, participants performed a cognitively effortful task under gain and loss conditions and made choices about effort expenditure in a decision-making task. Results consistently showed significant loss aversion in effort-based decision making. Participants were willing to invest more effort in the loss compared to the gain condition (i.e., perform a longer duration task: Experiments 1 and 2; or higher task load: Experiment 3). On the other hand, losses did not lead to improved performance (sustained attention), or higher physiological effort (pupil diameter) in Experiments 1 and 2. In Experiment 3, losses did enhance working memory performance, but only at the highest load level. Taken together, these results suggest that loss aversion motivates higher effort investment in effort-based decision-making, while the effect of loss aversion during a performance may depend on the task type or effort level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Diffusion Tensor Imaging Revealing the Relation of Age-Related Differences in the Corpus Callosum With Cognitive Style</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00285</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00285</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;People may differ in their ways of processing tasks or situations, which may be explained by cognitive styles that define individual differences in information processing strategies. The cognitive style ranges between two extremes: analytic and holistic processing style. The concept of cognitive style has been widely investigated in the literature, but its age-related differences in the neural substrates have remained elusive. In this study, we focused on the white matter structure of the corpus callosum and its possible link to age-related differences in cognitive style, given its functional ability to connect and facilitate efficient communication between the left and right cerebral hemispheres. Seventy-two participants aged 20–75 years participated in this study. Participants’ cognitive styles were measured by the Analysis-Holism Scale (AHS), and their white matter microstructures were acquired using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. The results revealed that older adults tend to have a more holistic processing style than younger adults. We then compared the white matter of tracts of interest between high and low AHS groups and found that the white matter microstructure in the genu of the corpus callosum can be used to distinguish between AHS subgroups. Interestingly, we found that age negatively correlated with the white matter tracts across the brain, indicating that aging is associated with reduced microstructure integrity. Together, our findings suggest that analytic-holistic cognitive styles of information processing possibly reflect that the microstructure development in the anterior part of the corpus callosum may influence the type of age-related information processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Lesion Topography Impact on Shoulder Abduction and Finger Extension Following Left and Right Hemispheric Stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00282</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00282</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The existence of shoulder abduction and finger extension movement capacity shortly after stroke onset is an important prognostic factor, indicating favorable functional outcomes for the hemiparetic upper limb (HUL). Here, we asked whether variation in lesion topography affects these two movements similarly or distinctly and whether lesion impact is similar or distinct for left and right hemisphere damage. Shoulder abduction and finger extension movements were examined in 77 chronic post-stroke patients using relevant items of the Fugl-Meyer test. Lesion effects were analyzed separately for left and right hemispheric damage patient groups, using voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping. In the left hemispheric damage group, shoulder abduction and finger extension were affected only by damage to the corticospinal tract in its passage through the corona radiata. In contrast, following the right hemispheric damage, these two movements were affected not only by corticospinal tract damage but also by damage to white matter association tracts, the putamen, and the insular cortex. In both groups, voxel clusters have been found where damage affected shoulder abduction and also finger extension, along with voxels where damage affected only one of the two movements. The capacity to execute shoulder abduction and finger extension movements following stroke is affected significantly by damage to shared and distinct voxels in the corticospinal tract in left-hemispheric damage patients and by damage to shared and distinct voxels in a larger array of cortical and subcortical regions in right hemispheric damage patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Resting-State Connectivity of Auditory and Reward Systems in Alzheimer’s Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Music-based interventions (MBI) have become increasingly widely adopted for dementia and related disorders. Previous research shows that music engages reward-related regions through functional connectivity with the auditory system, but evidence for the effectiveness of MBI is mixed in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This underscores the need for a unified mechanistic understanding to motivate MBIs. The main objective of the present study is to characterize the intrinsic connectivity of the auditory and reward systems in healthy aging individuals with MCI, and those with AD. Using resting-state fMRI data from the Alzheimer’s Database Neuroimaging Initiative, we tested resting-state functional connectivity within and between auditory and reward systems in older adults with MCI, AD, and age-matched healthy controls (N = 105). Seed-based correlations were assessed from regions of interest (ROIs) in the auditory network (i.e., anterior superior temporal gyrus, posterior superior temporal gyrus, Heschl’s Gyrus), and the reward network (i.e., nucleus accumbens, caudate, putamen, and orbitofrontal cortex). AD individuals were lower in both within-network and between-network functional connectivity in the auditory network and reward networks compared to MCI and controls. Furthermore, graph theory analyses showed that the MCI group had higher clustering and local efficiency than both AD and control groups, whereas AD individuals had lower betweenness centrality than MCI and control groups. Together, the auditory and reward systems show preserved within- and between-network connectivity in MCI individuals relative to AD. These results motivate future music-based interventions in individuals with MCI due to the preservation of functional connectivity within and between auditory and reward networks at that initial stage of neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Electrocortical Signature of Successful and Unsuccessful Deception in a Face-to-Face Social Interaction</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deceptive behavior, and the evaluation of others’ behavior as truthful or deceptive, are crucial aspects of human social interaction. We report a study investigating two participants in a social interaction, performing a deception task. The first participant, the “informant,” made true or false autobiographical statements. The second participant, the “detective,” then classified these statements as truth or lie. Behavioral data showed that detectives performed slightly above chance and were better at correctly identifying true as compared with deceptive statements. This presumably reflects the “truth bias”: the finding that individuals are more likely to classify others’ statements as truthful than as deceptive – even when informed that a lie is as likely to be told as the truth. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded from the informant. Event-related potential (ERP) analysis revealed a smaller contingent negative variation (CNV) preceding “convincing” statements (statements classified as true by the detective) compared to “unconvincing” statements (statements classified as lie by the detective) – irrespective of whether the statements were actually truthful or deceptive. This finding suggests a distinct electrocortical signature of “successful” compared to “unsuccessful” deceptive statements. One possible explanation is that the pronounced CNV indicates the individuals’ higher “cognitive load” when processing unconvincing statements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Persistent Differences in Brain Structure in Developmental Dyscalculia: A Longitudinal Morphometry Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00272</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Developmental dyscalculia (DD) is a learning disability affecting the acquisition of numerical-arithmetical skills. Affected people show persistent deficits in number processing, which are associated with aberrant brain activation and structure. Reduced gray matter has been reported in DD for the parietal cortex including the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), but also the frontal and occipito-temporal cortex. Furthermore, dyscalculics show white matter differences for instance in the inferior (ILF) and superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). However, the longitudinal development of these structural differences is unknown. Therefore, our goal was to investigate the developmental trajectory of gray and white matter in children with and without DD. In this longitudinal study, neuropsychological measures and T1-weighted structural images were collected twice with an interval of 4 years from 13 children with DD (8.2–10.4 years) and 10 typically developing (TD) children (8.0–10.4 years). Voxel-wise estimation of gray and white matter volumes was assessed using voxel-based morphometry for longitudinal data. The present findings reveal for the first time that DD children show persistently reduced gray and white matter volumes over development. Reduced gray matter was found in the bilateral inferior parietal lobes including the IPS, supramarginal gyri, left precuneus, cuneus, right superior occipital gyrus, bilateral inferior and middle temporal gyri, and insula. White matter volumes were reduced in the bilateral ILF and SLF, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), corticospinal tracts, and right anterior thalamic radiation (ATR). Behaviorally, children with DD performed significantly worse in various numerical tasks at baseline and follow-up, corroborating persistent deficits in number processing. The present results are in line with the literature showing that children with DD have reduced gray and white matter volumes in the numerical network. Our study further sheds light on the trajectory of brain development, revealing that these known structural differences in the long association fibers and the adjacent regions of the temporal- and frontoparietal cortex persist in dyscalculic children from childhood into adolescence. In conclusion, our results underscore that DD is a persistent learning disorder accompanied by deficits in number processing and reduced gray and white matter volumes in number related brain areas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The feasibility of the random subspace ensemble learning method was explored to improve the performance of functional near-infrared spectroscopy-based brain-computer interfaces (fNIRS-BCIs). Feature vectors have been constructed using the temporal characteristics of concentration changes in fNIRS chromophores such as mean, slope, and variance to implement fNIRS-BCIs systems. The mean and slope, which are the most popular features in fNIRS-BCIs, were adopted. Linear support vector machine and linear discriminant analysis were employed, respectively, as a single strong learner and multiple weak learners. All features in every channel and available time window were employed to train the strong learner, and the feature subsets were selected at random to train multiple weak learners. It was determined that random subspace ensemble learning is beneficial to enhance the performance of fNIRS-BCIs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Subjective Evaluation of Performance in a Collaborative Task Is Better Predicted From Autonomic Response Than From True Achievements</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Whereas the fundamental role of the body in social cognition seems to be generally accepted, elucidating the bodily mechanisms associated with non-verbal communication and cooperation between two or more persons is still a challenging endeavor. In this article we propose a fresh approach for investigating the function of the autonomic nervous system that is reflected in parameters of heart rate variability, respiration, and electrodermal activity in a social setting. We analyzed autonomic parameters of dyads solving a target-tracking task together with the partner or individually. A machine classifier was trained to predict the subjects' rating of performance and collaboration either from tracking error data or from the set of autonomic parameters. When subjects collaborated, this classifier could predict the subjective performance ratings better from the autonomic response than from the objective performance of the subjects. However, when they solved the task individually, predictability from autonomic parameters dropped to the level of objective performance, indicating that subjects were more rational in rating their performance in this condition. Moreover, the model captured general knowledge about the population that allows it to predict the performance ratings of an unseen subject significantly better than chance. Our results suggest that, in particular in situations that require collaboration with others, evaluation of performance is shaped by the bodily processes that are quantified by autonomic parameters. Therefore, subjective performance assessments appear to be modulated not only by the output of a rational or discriminative system that tracks the objective performance but to a significant extent also by interoceptive processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Protective Effects of Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide and Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide Against Cognitive Decline in Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive impairment is one of the major symptoms in most neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s (AD), Parkinson (PD), and Huntington diseases (HD), affecting millions of people worldwide. Unfortunately, there is no treatment to cure or prevent the progression of those diseases. Cognitive impairment has been related to neuronal cell death and/or synaptic plasticity alteration in important brain regions, such as the cerebral cortex, substantia nigra, striatum, and hippocampus. Therefore, compounds that can act to protect the neuronal loss and/or to reestablish the synaptic activity are needed to prevent cognitive decline in neurodegenerative diseases. Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) are two highly related multifunctional neuropeptides widely distributed in the central nervous system (CNS). PACAP and VIP exert their action through two common receptors, VPAC1 and VPAC2, while PACAP has an additional specific receptor, PAC1. In this review article, we first presented evidence showing the therapeutic potential of PACAP and VIP to fight the cognitive decline observed in models of AD, PD, and HD. We also reviewed the main transduction pathways activated by PACAP and VIP receptors to reduce cognitive dysfunction. Furthermore, we identified the therapeutic targets of PACAP and VIP, and finally, we evaluated different novel synthetic PACAP and VIP analogs as promising pharmacological tools.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Silent Synapse-Based Mechanisms of Critical Period Plasticity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00213</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00213</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Critical periods are postnatal, restricted time windows of heightened plasticity in cortical neural networks, during which experience refines principal neuron wiring configurations. Here, we propose a model with two distinct types of synapses, innate synapses that establish rudimentary networks with innate function, and gestalt synapses that govern the experience-dependent refinement process. Nascent gestalt synapses are constantly formed as AMPA receptor-silent synapses which are the substrates for critical period plasticity. Experience drives the unsilencing and stabilization of gestalt synapses, as well as synapse pruning. This maturation process changes synapse patterning and consequently the functional architecture of cortical excitatory networks. Ocular dominance plasticity (ODP) in the primary visual cortex (V1) is an established experimental model for cortical plasticity. While converging evidence indicates that the start of the critical period for ODP is marked by the maturation of local inhibitory circuits, recent results support our model that critical periods end through the progressive maturation of gestalt synapses. The cooperative yet opposing function of two postsynaptic signaling scaffolds of excitatory synapses, PSD-93 and PSD-95, governs the maturation of gestalt synapses. Without those proteins, networks do not progress far beyond their innate functionality, resulting in rather impaired perception. While cortical networks remain malleable throughout life, the cellular mechanisms and the scope of critical period and adult plasticity differ. Critical period ODP is initiated with the depression of deprived eye responses in V1, whereas adult ODP is characterized by an initial increase in non-deprived eye responses. Our model proposes the gestalt synapse-based mechanism for critical period ODP, and also predicts a different mechanism for adult ODP based on the sparsity of nascent gestalt synapses at that age. Under our model, early life experience shapes the boundaries (the gestalt) for network function, both for its optimal performance as well as for its pathological state. Thus, reintroducing nascent gestalt synapses as plasticity substrates into adults may improve the network gestalt to facilitate functional recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Exosomes Secreted From Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells Attenuate Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation/Reoxygenation-Induced Pyroptosis in PC12 Cells by Promoting AMPK-Dependent Autophagic Flux</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00182</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Cerebral ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) injury can lead to severe dysfunction, and its treatment is difficult. It is reported that nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat family protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome-mediated cell pyroptosis is an important part of cerebral I/R injury and the activation of autophagy can inhibit pyroptosis in some tissue injury. Our previous study found that the protective effects of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in cerebral I/R injury may be associated with the regulation of autophagy. Recent studies have demonstrated that exosomes secreted from BMSCs (BMSC-Exos) may play an essential role in the effective biological performance of BMSCs and the protective mechanism of BMSC-Exos is associated with the activation of autophagy and the remission of inflammation, but it has not been reported in studies of cerebral I/R injury. We aimed to investigate the effects of BMSC-Exos on cerebral I/R injury and determine if the mechanism is associated with the regulation of pyroptosis and autophagic flux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: PC12 cells were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) to induce cerebral I/R in vitro and were cocultured with BMSC-Exos. Cell viability was determined with CCK-8 and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) detection kits. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Hoechst 33342/propidium iodide (PI) double staining, 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate assay, immunofluorescence, Western blot, and Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to detect cell pyroptosis. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), GFP-RFP-LC3 adenovirus transfection, and Western blot were used to detect autophagic flux and its influence on pyroptosis. Finally, coimmunoprecipitation was used to detect the binding interaction between NLRP3 and LC3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: BMSC-Exos increased cell viability in OGD/R. The inhibitory effect of BMSC-Exos on pyroptosis was comparable to the NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 and was reversed by NLRP3 overexpression. Furthermore, BMSC-Exos promoted autophagic flux through the AMP-activated kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of the rapamycin pathway, whereas chloroquine, AMPK silencing, and compound C blocked the inhibitory effect on pyroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: BMSC-Exos can protect PC12 cells against OGD/R injury via attenuation of NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis by promoting AMPK-dependent autophagic flux.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Region and Cell Type Distribution of TCF4 in the Postnatal Mouse Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00042</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00042</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transcription factor 4 is a class I basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor regulating gene expression. Altered TCF4 gene expression has been linked to non-syndromic intellectual disability, schizophrenia, and a severe neurodevelopmental disorder known as Pitt-Hopkins syndrome. An understanding of the cell types expressing TCF4 protein in the mouse brain is needed to help identify potential pathophysiological mechanisms and targets for therapeutic delivery in TCF4-linked disorders. Here we developed a novel green fluorescent protein reporter mouse to visualize TCF4-expressing cells throughout the brain. Using this TCF4 reporter mouse, we observed prominent expression of TCF4 in the pallial region and cerebellum of the postnatal brain. At the cellular level, both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons express TCF4 in the cortex and hippocampus, while only a subset of GABAergic interneurons express TCF4 in the striatum. Among glial cell groups, TCF4 is present in astrocytes and immature and mature oligodendrocytes. In the cerebellum, cells in the granule and molecular layer express TCF4. Our findings greatly extend our knowledge of the spatiotemporal and cell type-specific expression patterns of TCF4 in the brain, and hence, lay the groundwork to better understand TCF4-linked neurological disorders. Any effort to restore TCF4 functions through small molecule or genetic therapies should target these brain regions and cell groups to best recapitulate TCF4 expression patterns.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: A single point mutation in the Plasmodium falciparum FtsH1 metalloprotease confers actinonin resistance</title>

	<description>The antibiotic actinonin kills malaria parasites (&lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt;) by interfering with apicoplast function. Early evidence suggested that actinonin inhibited prokaryote-like post-translational modification in the apicoplast; mimicking its activity against bacteria. However, Amberg Johnson et al. (2017) identified the metalloprotease &lt;i&gt;Tg&lt;/i&gt;FtsH1 as the target of actinonin in the related parasite &lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/i&gt; and implicated &lt;i&gt;P. falciparum &lt;/i&gt;FtsH1 as a likely target in malaria parasites. The authors were not, however, able to recover actinonin resistant malaria parasites, leaving the specific target of actinonin uncertain. We generated actinonin resistant &lt;i&gt;P. falciparum &lt;/i&gt;by &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; selection and identified a specific sequence change in &lt;i&gt;Pf&lt;/i&gt;FtsH1 associated with resistance. Introduction of this point mutation using CRISPr-Cas9 allelic replacement was sufficient to confer actinonin resistance in &lt;i&gt;P. falciparum&lt;/i&gt;. Our data unequivocally identifies &lt;i&gt;Pf&lt;/i&gt;FtsH1 as the target of actinonin and suggests that actinonin should not be included in the highly valuable collection of 'irresistible' drugs for combatting malaria.</description>

	<description>Peer review is often criticized for being flawed, subjective and biased, but research into peer review has been hindered by a lack of access to peer review reports. Here we report the results of a study in which text-analysis software was used to determine the linguistic characteristics of 472,449 peer review reports. A range of characteristics (including analytical tone, authenticity, clout, three measures of sentiment, and morality) were studied as a function of reviewer recommendation, area of research, type of peer review and reviewer gender. We found that reviewer recommendation had the biggest impact on the linguistic characteristics of reports, and that area of research, type of peer review and reviewer gender had little or no impact. The lack of influence of research area, type of review or reviewer gender on the linguistic characteristics is a sign of the robustness of peer review.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Tonically active neurons in the monkey dorsal striatum signal outcome feedback during trial-and-error search behavior</title>

	<description>An animals choice behavior is shaped by the outcome feedback from selected actions in a trial-and-error approach. Tonically active neurons (TANs), presumed cholinergic interneurons in the striatum, are thought to be involved in the learning and performance of reward-directed behaviors, but it remains unclear how TANs are involved in shaping reward-directed choice behaviors based on the outcome feedback. To this end, we recorded activity of TANs from the dorsal striatum of two macaque monkeys (Macaca fuscata; 1 male, 1 female) while they performed a multi-step choice task to obtain multiple rewards. In this task, the monkeys first searched for a rewarding target from among three alternatives in a trial-and-error manner and then earned additional rewards by repeatedly choosing the rewarded target. We found that a considerable proportion of TANs selectively responded to either the reward or the no-reward outcome feedback during the trial-and-error search, but these feedback responses were not observed during repeat trials. Moreover, the feedback responses of TANs were similarly observed in any search trials, without distinctions regarding the predicted probability of rewards and the location of chosen targets. Unambiguously, TANs detected reward and no-reward feedback specifically when the monkeys performed trial-and-error searches, in which the monkeys were learning the value of the targets and adjusting their subsequent choice behavior based on the reward and no-reward feedback. These results suggest that striatal cholinergic interneurons signal outcome feedback specifically during search behavior, in circumstances where the choice outcomes cannot be predicted with certainty by the animals.

	<description>Here we demonstrate the Argo System, a massively parallel neural recording system based on platinum-iridium microwire electrode arrays bonded to a CMOS voltage amplifier array. The Argo system is the highest channel count in vivo neural recording system built to date, supporting simultaneous recording from 65,536 channels, sampled at over 32 kHz and 12-bit resolution. This system is designed for cortical recordings, compatible with both penetrating and surface microelectrodes. We have validated this system by recording spiking activity from 791 neurons in rats and cortical surface Local Field Potential (LFP) activity from over 30,000 channels in sheep. While currently adapted for head-fixed recording, the microwire-CMOS architecture is well suited for clinical translation. Thus, this demonstration helps pave the way for a future high data rate intracortical implant.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Does the phase of ongoing EEG oscillations predict auditory perception?</title>

	<description>Effective processing of information from the environment requires the brain to selectively sample relevant inputs. The visual perceptual system has been shown to sample information rhythmically, oscillating rapidly between more and less input-favorable states. Evidence of parallel effects in auditory perception is inconclusive. Here, we combined a bilateral pitch-identification task with electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate whether the phase of ongoing EEG predicts auditory discrimination accuracy. We compared prestimulus phase distributions between correct and incorrect trials. Shortly before stimulus onset, each of these distributions showed significant phase concentration, but centered at different phase angles. The effects were strongest in theta and beta frequency bands. The divergence between phase distributions showed a linear relation with accuracy, accounting for at least 10% of inter-individual variance. Discrimination performance oscillated rhythmically at a rate predicted by the neural data. These findings indicate that auditory discrimination threshold oscillates over time along with the phase of ongoing EEG activity. Thus, it appears that auditory perception is discrete rather than continuous, with the phase of ongoing EEG oscillations shaping auditory perception by providing a temporal reference frame for information processing.</description>

	<description>Advances in virtual reality (VR) technology have greatly benefited spatial navigation research. By presenting space in a controlled manner, changing aspects of the environment one at a time or manipulating the gain from different sensory inputs, the mechanisms underlying behaviour can be investigated. In parallel, a growing body of evidence suggests that the processes involved in spatial navigation extend to non-spatial domains. Here, we leverage VR technology advances to test whether participants can navigate abstract knowledge. We designed a two-dimensional quantity space - presented using a head-mounted display - to test if participants can navigate abstract knowledge using a first-person perspective navigation paradigm. To investigate the effect of physical movement, we divided participants into two groups: one walking and rotating on a motion platform, the other group using a gamepad to move through the abstract space. We found that both groups learned to navigate using a first-person perspective and formed accurate representations of the abstract space. Interestingly, exploratory behaviour in the abstract space resembled behavioural patterns observed in spatial navigation studies. Notably, both groups demonstrated similar patterns of learning. Taken together, these results imply that both self-movement and remote exploration can be used to learn the relational mapping between abstract, non-spatial stimuli.</description>

	<description>Animal locomotion requires dynamic interactions between neural circuits, muscles, and surrounding environments. In contrast to intensive studies on neural circuits, the neuromechanical basis for animal behaviour remains unclear due to the lack of information on the physical properties of animals. Here, taking Drosophila larvae as a model system, we proposed an integrated neuromechanical model based on physical measurements. The physical parameters were obtained by a stress-relaxation assay, and the neural circuit motif was extracted from a chain of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons, which was identified previously by connectomics. Based on the model, we systematically performed perturbation analyses on the parameters in the model to study their kinematic effects on locomotion performance. We found that modification of most of the parameters in the simulation could increase the speed of locomotion. Our physical measurement and modelling would provide a new framework for neural circuit studies and soft robot engineering.</description>

The estimation of parameters controlling the electrical properties of biological neurons is essential to determine their complement of ion channels and to understand the function of biological circuits. By synchronizing conductance models to time series observations of the membrane voltage, one may construct models capable of predicting neuronal dynamics. However, identifying the actual set of parameters of biological ion channels remains a formidable theoretical challenge. Here, we present a regularization method that improves convergence towards this optimal solution when data are noisy and the model is unknown. Our method relies on the existence of an offset in parameter space arising from the interplay between model nonlinearity and experimental error. By tuning this offset, we induce saddle-node bifurcations from sub-optimal to optimal solutions. This regularization method increases the probability of finding the optimal set of parameters from 67% to 94.3%. We also reduce parameter correlations by implementing adaptive sampling and stimulation protocols compatible with parameter identifiability requirements. Our results show that the optimal model parameters may be inferred from imperfect observations provided the conditions of observability and identifiability are fulfilled.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/N2xySdvpohw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The modeling of the spreading of communicable diseases has experienced significant advances in the last two decades or so. This has been possible due to the proliferation of data and the development of new methods to gather, mine and analyze it. A key role has also been played by the latest advances in new disciplines like network science. Nonetheless, current models still lack a faithful representation of all possible heterogeneities and features that can be extracted from data. Here, we bridge a current gap in the mathematical modeling of infectious diseases and develop a framework that allows to account simultaneously for both the connectivity of individuals and the age-structure of the population. We compare different scenarios, namely, i) the homogeneous mixing setting, ii) one in which only the social mixing is taken into account, iii) a setting that considers the connectivity of individuals alone, and finally, iv) a multilayer representation in which both the social mixing and the number of contacts are included in the model. We analytically show that the thresholds obtained for these four scenarios are different. In addition, we conduct extensive numerical simulations and conclude that heterogeneities in the contact network are important for a proper determination of the epidemic threshold, whereas the age-structure plays a bigger role beyond the onset of the outbreak. Altogether, when it comes to evaluate interventions such as vaccination, both sources of individual heterogeneity are important and should be concurrently considered. Our results also provide an indication of the errors incurred in situations in which one cannot access all needed information in terms of connectivity and age of the population.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_p5v-5p47nE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

For knowledge to benefit research and society, it must be trustworthy. Trustworthy research is robust, rigorous, and transparent at all stages of design, execution, and reporting. Assessment of researchers still rarely includes considerations related to trustworthiness, rigor, and transparency. We have developed the Hong Kong Principles (HKPs) as part of the 6th World Conference on Research Integrity with a specific focus on the need to drive research improvement through ensuring that researchers are explicitly recognized and rewarded for behaviors that strengthen research integrity. We present five principles: responsible research practices; transparent reporting; open science (open research); valuing a diversity of types of research; and recognizing all contributions to research and scholarly activity. For each principle, we provide a rationale for its inclusion and provide examples where these principles are already being adopted.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/1PqEX9TbqCM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Disability in multiple sclerosis (MS) is considered primarily a result of axonal loss. However, correlation with spinal cord cross‐sectional area—a predictor of disability—is poor, questioning the unique role of axonal loss. We investigated the degree of synaptic loss in postmortem spinal cords (18 chronic MS, 8 healthy controls) using immunohistochemistry for synaptophysin and synapsin. Substantial (58–96%) loss of synapses throughout the spinal cord was detected, along with moderate (47%) loss of anterior horn neurons, notably in demyelinating MS lesions. We conclude that synaptic loss is significant in chronic MS, likely contributing to disability accrual. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25803?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We screened 662 subjects comprising 462 essential tremor (ET) subjects (285 sporadic, 125 with family history, and 52 probands from well‐characterized ET pedigrees) and 200 controls and identified pathogenic &lt;i&gt;NOTCH2NLC &lt;/i&gt; GGC repeat expansions in 4 sporadic ET patients. Two patients were followed up for &amp;gt;1 decade; one with 90 repeats remained an ET phenotype that did not evolve after 40 years, whereas another patient with 107 repeats developed motor symptoms and cognitive impairment after 8 to 10 years. Neuroimaging in this patient revealed severe leukoencephalopathy; diffusion‐weighted imaging hyperintensity in the corticomedullary junction and skin biopsy revealed intranuclear inclusions suggestive of intranuclear inclusion body disease (NIID). No GGC repeats of &amp;gt;60 units were detected in familial ET cases and controls, although 4 ET patients carried 47 to 53 “intermediate” repeats. &lt;i&gt;NOTCH2NLC &lt;/i&gt; GGC repeat expansions can be associated with sporadic ET. Carriers presenting with a pure ET phenotype may or may not convert to NIID up to 4 decades after initial tremor onset. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Application of the hierarchical bootstrap to multi-level data in neuroscience. (arXiv:2007.07797v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A common feature in many neuroscience datasets is the presence of
hierarchical data structures, most commonly recording the activity of multiple
neurons in multiple animals across multiple trials. Accordingly, the
measurements constituting the dataset are not independent, even though the
traditional statistical analyses often applied in such cases (e.g., Students
t-test) treat them as such. The hierarchical bootstrap has been shown to be an
effective tool to accurately analyze such data and while it has been used
extensively in the statistical literature, its use is not widespread in
neuroscience - despite the ubiquity of hierarchical datasets. In this paper, we
illustrate the intuitiveness and utility of this approach to analyze
hierarchically nested datasets. We use simulated neural data to show that
traditional statistical tests can result in a false positive rate of over 45%,
even if the Type-I error rate is set at 5%. While summarizing data across
non-independent points (or lower levels) can potentially fix this problem, this
approach greatly reduces the statistical power of the analysis. The
hierarchical bootstrap, when applied sequentially over the levels of the
hierarchical structure, keeps the Type-I error rate within the intended bound
and retains more statistical power than summarizing methods. We conclude by
demonstrating the effectiveness of the method in two real-world examples, first
analyzing singing data in male Bengalese finches (Lonchura striata var.
domestica) and second quantifying changes in behavior under optogenetic control
in flies (Drosophila melanogaster).

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Signal Fluctuations and the Information Transmission Rates in Binary Communication Channels. (arXiv:2007.07734v1 [q-bio.QM])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07734</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07734</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In nervous system information is conveyed by sequence of action potentials
(spikes-trains). As MacKay and McCulloch proposed, spike-trains can be
represented as bits sequences coming from Information Sources. Previously, we
studied relations between Information Transmission Rates (ITR) carried out by
the spikes, their correlations, and frequencies. Here, we concentrate on the
problem of how spikes fluctuations affect ITR. The Information Theory Method
developed by Shannon is applied. Information Sources are modeled as stationary
stochastic processes. We assume such sources as two states Markov processes. As
a spike-trains' fluctuation measure, we consider the Standard Deviation SD,
which, in fact, measures average fluctuation of spikes around the average spike
frequency. We found that character of ITR and signal fluctuations relation
strongly depends on parameter s which is a sum of transitions probabilities
from no spike state to spike state and vice versa. It turned out that for
smaller s (s&amp;lt;1) the quotient ITR/SD has a maximum and can tend to zero
depending on transition probabilities. While for s large enough 1&amp;lt;s the ITR/SD
is separated from 0 for each s. Similar behavior was observed when we replaced
Shannon entropy terms in Markov entropy formula by their approximation with
polynomials. We also show that the ITR quotient by Variance behaves in a
completely different way. We show that for large transition parameter s the
Information Transmission Rate by SD will never decrease to 0. Specifically, for
1&amp;lt;s&amp;lt;1.7 the ITR will be always, independently on transition probabilities which
form this s, above the level of fluctuations, i.e. we have SD&amp;lt;ITR. We conclude
that in a more noisy environment, to get appropriate reliability and efficiency
of transmission, Information Sources with higher tendency of transition from
the state no spike to spike state and vice versa should be applied.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Multivariate white matter alterations are associated with epilepsy duration. (arXiv:2007.07643v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07643</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07643</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Previous studies investigating associations between white matter alterations
and duration of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) have shown differing results, and
were typically limited to univariate analyses of tracts in isolation. In this
study we apply a multivariate measure (the Mahalanobis distance), to capture
the distinct ways white matter may differ in individual patients, and relate
this to epilepsy duration.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diffusion MRI, from a cohort of 94 subjects (28 healthy controls, 33 left-TLE
and 33 right-TLE), was used to assess associations between tract fractional
anisotropy (FA) and epilepsy duration. Using ten white matter tracts, we
analysed associations using traditional univariate analyses (z-scores) and a
complementary multivariate approach (Mahalanobis distance), incorporating
multiple white matter tracts into a single unified analysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In patients with right-TLE, FA was not significantly associated with epilepsy
duration for any tract studied in isolation. In patients with left-TLE, the FA
of two limbic tracts (ipsilateral fornix, contralateral cingulum gyrus) was
significantly negatively associated with epilepsy duration (Bonferonni
corrected p&amp;lt;0.05). Using a multivariate approach we found significant
ipsilateral positive associations with duration in both left, and right-TLE
cohorts (left-TLE: Spearman's rho=0.487, right-TLE: Spearman's rho=0.422).
Extrapolating our multivariate results to duration equals zero (i.e. at onset)
we found no significant difference between patients and controls. Associations
using the multivariate approach were more robust than univariate methods.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multivariate distance measure provides non-overlapping and more robust
results than traditional univariate analyses. Future studies should consider
adopting both frameworks into their analysis in order to ascertain a more
complete understanding of epilepsy progression, regardless of laterality.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Functional and effective networks inferred from time series are at the core
of network neuroscience. Since it is common practice to compare network
properties between patients and controls, it is crucial for inferred network
models to reflect key underlying structural properties. However, even a few
spurious links severely distort the shortest-path length and derived measures
including the small-world coefficient, providing misleading insights into the
macroscopic topology of the network. This poses a challenge for functional
connectomes based on correlation, whose transitivity necessarily induce
numerous false positives. We study how false positives bias the properties of
the networks inferred by bivariate and multivariate algorithms. Mutual
information, bivariate transfer entropy, and multivariate transfer entropy are
respectively used for inferring functional, directed-functional, and effective
networks. The validation is performed on synthetic ground truth networks with
100--200 nodes and various topologies (regular lattice, small-world, random,
scale-free, modular), as well as on a real macaque connectome. The time series
of node activity are simulated via autoregressive dynamics. We find that
multivariate transfer entropy captures key properties of all network structures
for longer time series. Bivariate methods can achieve higher recall
(sensitivity) for shorter time series; however, as available data increases,
they are unable to control false positives (lower specificity). This leads to
overestimated clustering, small-world, and rich-club coefficients,
underestimated shortest path lengths and hub centrality, and fattened degree
distribution tails. Caution should therefore be used when interpreting network
properties of functional connectomes obtained via correlation or pairwise
statistical dependence measures, rather than more holistic (yet data-hungry)
multivariate models.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We propose a modular architecture for neuromorphic closed-loop control based
on bistable relaxation oscillator modules consisting of three spiking neurons
each. Like its biological prototypes, this basic component is robust to
parameter variation but can be modulated by external inputs. By combining these
modules, we can construct a neural state machine capable of generating the
cyclic or repetitive behaviors necessary for legged locomotion. A concrete case
study for the approach is provided by a modular robot constructed from flexible
plastic volumetric pixels, in which we produce a forward crawling gait
entrained to the natural frequency of the robot by a minimal system of twelve
neurons organized into four modules.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Online incremental clustering of sequentially incoming data without prior
knowledge suffers from changing cluster numbers and tends to fall into local
extrema according to given data order. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a stabilized developmental resonance network (s-DRN). First, we analyze
the instability of the conventional choice function during the node activation
process and design a scalable activation function to make clustering
performance stable over all input data scales. Next, we devise three criteria
for the node grouping algorithm: distance, intersection over union (IoU) and
size criteria. The proposed node grouping algorithm effectively excludes
unnecessary clusters from incrementally created clusters, diminishes the
performance dependency on vigilance parameters and makes the clustering process
robust. To verify the performance of the proposed s-DRN model, comparative
studies are conducted on six real-world datasets whose statistical
characteristics are distinctive. The comparative studies demonstrate the
proposed s-DRN outperforms baselines in terms of stability and accuracy.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Distinct scientific theories can make similar predictions. To adjudicate
between theories, we must design experiments for which the theories make
distinct predictions. Here we consider the problem of comparing deep neural
networks as models of human visual recognition. To efficiently compare models'
ability to predict human responses, we synthesize controversial stimuli: images
for which different models produce distinct responses. We applied this approach
to two visual recognition tasks, handwritten digits (MNIST) and objects in
small natural images (CIFAR-10). For each task, we synthesized controversial
stimuli to maximize the disagreement among models which employed different
architectures and recognition algorithms. Human subjects viewed hundreds of
these stimuli, as well as natural examples, and judged the probability of
presence of each digit/object category in each image. We quantified how
accurately each model predicted the human judgments. The best performing models
were a generative Analysis-by-Synthesis model (based on variational
autoencoders) for MNIST and a hybrid discriminative-generative Joint Energy
Model for CIFAR-10. These DNNs, which model the distribution of images,
performed better than purely discriminative DNNs, which learn only to map
images to labels. None of the candidate models fully explained the human
responses. Controversial stimuli generalize the concept of adversarial
examples, obviating the need to assume a ground-truth model. Unlike natural
images, controversial stimuli are not constrained to the stimulus distribution
models are trained on, thus providing severe out-of-distribution tests that
reveal the models' inductive biases. Controversial stimuli therefore provide
powerful probes of discrepancies between models and human perception.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Drift analysis aims at translating the expected progress of an evolutionary
algorithm (or more generally, a random process) into a probabilistic guarantee
on its run time (hitting time). So far, drift arguments have been successfully
employed in the rigorous analysis of evolutionary algorithms, however, only for
the situation that the progress is constant or becomes weaker when approaching
the target.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motivated by questions like how fast fit individuals take over a population,
we analyze random processes exhibiting a $(1+\delta)$-multiplicative growth in
expectation. We prove a drift theorem translating this expected progress into a
hitting time. This drift theorem gives a simple and insightful proof of the
level-based theorem first proposed by Lehre (2011). Our version of this theorem
has, for the first time, the best-possible near-linear dependence on $1/\delta$
(the previous results had an at least near-quadratic dependence), and it only
requires a population size near-linear in $\delta$ (this was super-quadratic in
previous results). These improvements immediately lead to stronger run time
guarantees for a number of applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also discuss the case of large $\delta$ and show stronger results for this
setting.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative diseases that share convergent disease features. A common symptom of these diseases is development of ataxia, involving impaired balance and motor coordination, usually stemming from cerebellar dysfunction and neurodegeneration. For most spinocerebellar ataxias, pathology can be attributed to an underlying gene mutation and the impaired function of the encoded protein through loss or gain-of-function effects. Strikingly, despite vast heterogeneity in the structure and function of disease-causing genes across the SCAs and the cellular processes affected, the downstream effects have considerable overlap, including alterations in cerebellar circuitry. Interestingly, aberrant function and degeneration of Purkinje cells, the major output neuronal population present within the cerebellum, precedes abnormalities in other neuronal populations within many SCAs, suggesting that Purkinje cells have increased vulnerability to cellular perturbations. Factors that are known to contribute to perturbed Purkinje cell function in spinocerebellar ataxias include altered gene expression resulting in altered expression or functionality of proteins and channels that modulate membrane potential, downstream impairments in intracellular calcium homeostasis and changes in glutamatergic input received from synapsing climbing or parallel fibers. This review will explore this enhanced vulnerability and the aberrant cerebellar circuitry linked with it in many forms of SCA. It is critical to understand why Purkinje cells are vulnerable to such insults and what overlapping pathogenic mechanisms are occurring across multiple SCAs, despite different underlying genetic mutations. Enhanced understanding of disease mechanisms will facilitate the development of treatments to prevent or slow progression of the underlying neurodegenerative processes, cerebellar atrophy and ataxic symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurogenesis: The Zebrafish Amygdaloid Complex – Functional Ground Plan, Molecular Delineation, and Everted Topology</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In mammals and other tetrapods, a multinuclear forebrain structure, called the amygdala, forms the neuroregulatory core essential for emotion, cognition, and social behavior. Currently, higher circuits of affective behavior in anamniote non-tetrapod vertebrates (“fishes”) are poorly understood, preventing a comprehensive understanding of amygdala evolution. Through molecular characterization and evolutionary-developmental considerations, we delineated the complex amygdala ground plan of zebrafish, whose everted telencephalon has made comparisons to the evaginated forebrains of tetrapods challenging. In this radical paradigm, thirteen telencephalic territories constitute the zebrafish amygdaloid complex and each territory is distinguished by conserved molecular properties and structure-functional relationships with other amygdaloid structures. Central to our paradigm, the study identifies the teleostean amygdaloid nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract (nLOT), an olfactory integrative structure that links dopaminergic telencephalic groups to the amygdala alongside redefining the putative zebrafish olfactory pallium (“Dp”). Molecular characteristics such as the distribution of substance P and the calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin (PV) and calretinin (CR) indicate, that the zebrafish extended centromedial (autonomic and reproductive) amygdala is predominantly located in the GABAergic and isl1-negative territory. Like in tetrapods, medial amygdaloid (MeA) nuclei are defined by the presence of substance P immunoreactive fibers and calretinin-positive neurons, whereas central amygdaloid (CeA) nuclei lack these characteristics. A detailed comparison of lhx5-driven and vGLut2a-driven GFP in transgenic reporter lines revealed ancestral topological relationships between the thalamic eminence (EmT), the medial amygdala (MeA), the nLOT, and the integrative olfactory pallium. Thus, the study explains how the zebrafish amygdala and the complexly everted telencephalon topologically relate to the corresponding structures in mammals indicating that an elaborate amygdala ground plan evolved early in vertebrates, in a common ancestor of teleosts and tetrapods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Dissociating Arithmetic Operations in the Parietal Cortex Using 1 Hz Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: The Importance of Strategy Use</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The triple-code model (TCM) of number processing suggests the involvement of distinct parietal cortex areas in arithmetic operations: the bilateral horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus (hIPS) for arithmetic operations that require the manipulation of numerical quantities (e.g., subtraction) and the left angular gyrus (AG) for arithmetic operations that require the retrieval of answers from long-term memory (e.g., multiplication). Although neuropsychological, neuroimaging, and brain stimulation studies suggest the dissociation of these operations into distinct parietal cortex areas, the role of strategy (online calculation vs. retrieval) is not yet fully established. In the present study, we further explored the causal involvement of the left AG for multiplication and left hIPS for subtraction using a neuronavigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) paradigm. Stimulation sites were determined based on an fMRI experiment using the same tasks. To account for the effect of strategy, participants were asked whether they used retrieval or calculation for each individual problem. We predicted that the stimulation of the left AG would selectively disrupt the retrieval of the solution to multiplication problems. On the other hand, stimulation of the left hIPS should selectively disrupt subtraction. Our results revealed that left AG stimulation was detrimental to the retrieval and online calculation of solutions for multiplication problems, as well as, the retrieval (but not online calculation) of the solutions to subtraction problems. In contrast, left hIPS stimulation had no detrimental effect on both operations regardless of strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Cholinergic Projections From the Pedunculopontine Tegmental Nucleus Contact Excitatory and Inhibitory Neurons in the Inferior Colliculus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00043</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The inferior colliculus processes nearly all ascending auditory information. Most collicular cells respond to sound, and for a majority of these cells, the responses can be modulated by acetylcholine (ACh). The cholinergic effects are varied and, for the most part, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. The major source of cholinergic input to the inferior colliculus is the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT), part of the pontomesencephalic tegmentum known for projections to the thalamus and roles in arousal and the sleep-wake cycle. Characterization of PPT inputs to the inferior colliculus has been complicated by the mixed neurotransmitter population within the PPT. Using selective viral-tract tracing techniques in a ChAT-Cre Long Evans rat, the present study characterizes the distribution and targets of cholinergic projections from PPT to the inferior colliculus. Following the deposit of viral vector in one PPT, cholinergic axons studded with boutons were present bilaterally in the inferior colliculus, with the greater density of axons and boutons ipsilateral to the injection site. On both sides, cholinergic axons were present throughout the inferior colliculus, distributing boutons to the central nucleus, lateral cortex, and dorsal cortex. In each inferior colliculus (IC) subdivision, the cholinergic PPT axons appear to contact both GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons. These findings suggest cholinergic projections from the PPT have a widespread influence over the IC, likely affecting many aspects of midbrain auditory processing. Moreover, the effects are likely to be mediated by direct cholinergic actions on both excitatory and inhibitory circuits in the inferior colliculus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Respiration-Locking of Olfactory Receptor and Projection Neurons in the Mouse Olfactory Bulb and Its Modulation by Brain State</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;For sensory systems of the brain, the dynamics of an animal’s own sampling behavior has a direct consequence on ensuing computations. This is particularly the case for mammalian olfaction, where a rhythmic flow of air over the nasal epithelium entrains activity in olfactory system neurons in a phenomenon known as sniff-locking. Parameters of sniffing can, however, change drastically with brain states. Coupled to the fact that different observation methods have different kinetics, consensus on the sniff-locking properties of neurons is lacking. To address this, we investigated the sniff-related activity of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), as well as the principal neurons of the olfactory bulb (OB), using 2-photon calcium imaging and intracellular whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in vivo, both in anesthetized and awake mice. Our results indicate that OSNs and OB output neurons lock robustly to the sniff rhythm, but with a slight temporal shift between behavioral states. We also observed a slight delay between methods. Further, the divergent sniff-locking by tufted cells (TCs) and mitral cells (MCs) in the absence of odor can be used to determine the cell type reliably using a simple linear classifier. Using this classification on datasets where morphological identification is unavailable, we find that MCs use a wider range of temporal shifts to encode odors than previously thought, while TCs have a constrained timing of activation due to an early-onset hyperpolarization. We conclude that the sniff rhythm serves as a fundamental rhythm but its impact on odor encoding depends on cell type, and this difference is accentuated in awake mice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Memory and Learning Deficits Are Associated With Ca2+ Dyshomeostasis in Normal Aging</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis is critical to the normal physiological functions of neurons and neuronal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dyshomeostasis has been associated with the age-related decline of cognitive functions. Accumulated evidence indicates that the underlying mechanism for this is that abnormal intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels stimulate the dysregulation of intracellular signaling, which subsequently induces neuronal cell death. We examined intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis in cortical (in vivo) and hippocampal (in vitro) neurons from young (3-months), middle-age (12-months), and aged (24-months) wild type C57BL6J mice. We found a progressive age-related elevation of intracellular resting calcium ([Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;) in cortical (in vivo) and hippocampal (in vitro) neurons associated with increased hippocampal neuronal calpain activity and reduced cell viability. In vitro, removal of extracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or treatment with SAR7334 or dantrolene reduced [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; in all age groups and dantrolene treatment lowered calpain activity and increased cell viability. In vivo, both middle-aged and aged mice showed cognitive deficits compared to young mice, which improved after dantrolene treatment. These findings support the hypothesis that intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dyshomeostasis is a major mechanism underlying the cognitive deficits seen in both normal aging and degenerative neurologic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Drosophila seminal Sex Peptide associates with rival as well as own sperm, providing SP function in polyandrous females</title>

	<description>When females mate with more than one male, the males' paternity share is affected by biases in sperm use. These competitive interactions occur while female and male molecules and cells work interdependently to optimize fertility, including modifying the female’s physiology through interactions with male seminal fluid proteins (SFPs). Some modifications last long-term, indirectly benefiting later males. Indeed, rival males tailor their ejaculates accordingly. Here we show that SFPs from one male can directly benefit a rival's sperm. We report that Sex Peptide (SP) that a female &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; receives from a male can bind sperm that she had stored from a previous male, and rescue the sperm utilization and fertility defects of an SP-deficient first-male. Other seminal proteins received in the first mating 'primed' the sperm (or the female) for this binding. Thus, SP from one male can directly benefit another, making SP a key molecule in inter-ejaculate interaction.</description>

	<description>Genome-wide association studies have implicated common genomic variants in the gene desert upstream of &lt;i&gt;TBX3&lt;/i&gt; in cardiac conduction velocity. Whether these noncoding variants affect expression of &lt;i&gt;TBX3&lt;/i&gt; or neighboring genes and how they affect cardiac conduction is not understood. Here, we use high-throughput STARR-seq to test the entire 1.3 Mb human and mouse &lt;i&gt;TBX3&lt;/i&gt; locus, including two cardiac conduction-associated variant regions, for regulatory function. We identified multiple accessible and functional regulatory DNA elements that harbor variants affecting their activity. Both variant regions drove gene expression in the cardiac conduction tissue in transgenic reporter mice. Genomic deletion from the mouse genome of one of the regions caused increased cardiac expression of only &lt;i&gt;Tbx3,&lt;/i&gt; PR interval shortening and increased QRS duration. Combined, our findings address the mechanistic link between trait-associated variants in the gene desert, &lt;i&gt;TBX3&lt;/i&gt; regulation and cardiac conduction.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/45530</link>
	<description>The Cambrian explosion was a unique animal radiation ~540 million years ago that produced the full range of body plans across bilaterians. The genetic mechanisms underlying these events are unknown, leaving a fundamental question in evolutionary biology unanswered. Using large-scale comparative genomics and advanced orthology evaluation techniques, we identified 157 bilaterian-specific genes. They include the entire Nodal pathway, a key regulator of mesoderm development and left-right axis specification; components for nervous system development, including a suite of G protein-coupled receptors that control physiology and behaviour, the Robo-Slit midline repulsion system, and the neurotrophin signalling system; a high number of zinc finger transcription factors; and novel factors that previously escaped attention. Contradicting the current view, our study reveals that genes with bilaterian origin are robustly associated with key features in extant bilaterians, suggesting a causal relationship.</description>

	<description>Keyes et al. establish the PVT as a key node in the opiate-associated memory network. The PVT→CeA pathway associates opiate reward to the environment, whereas transient manipulation of the PVT→NAc pathway or its downstream NAc→LH pathway during retrieval erases opiate-associated memory and causes enduring protection against relapse to opioid use.</description>

Computational drug repositioning and drug-target prediction have become essential tasks in the early stage of drug discovery. In previous studies, these two tasks have often been considered separately. However, the entities studied in these two tasks (i.e., drugs, targets, and diseases) are inherently related. On one hand, drugs interact with targets in cells to modulate target activities, which in turn alter biological pathways to promote healthy functions and to treat diseases. On the other hand, both drug repositioning and drug-target prediction involve the same drug feature space, which naturally connects these two problems and the two domains (diseases and targets). By using the &lt;i&gt;wisdom of the crowds&lt;/i&gt;, it is possible to transfer knowledge from one of the domains to the other. The existence of relationships among drug-target-disease motivates us to jointly consider drug repositioning and drug-target prediction in drug discovery. In this paper, we present a novel approach called iDrug, which seamlessly integrates drug repositioning and drug-target prediction into one coherent model via cross-network embedding. In particular, we provide a principled way to transfer knowledge from these two domains and to enhance prediction performance for both tasks. Using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that iDrug achieves superior performance on both learning tasks compared to several state-of-the-art approaches.

Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is the propagation of a relatively slow wave in cortical brain tissue that is linked to a number of pathological conditions such as stroke and migraine. Most of the existing literature investigates the dynamics of short term phenomena such as the depolarization and repolarization of membrane potentials or large ion shifts. Here, we focus on the clinically-relevant hour-long state of neurovascular malfunction in the wake of CSDs. This dysfunctional state involves widespread vasoconstriction and a general disruption of neurovascular coupling. We demonstrate, using a mathematical model, that dissolution of calcium that has aggregated within the mitochondria of vascular smooth muscle cells can drive an hour-long disruption. We model the rate of calcium clearance as well as the dynamical implications on overall blood flow. Based on reaction stoichiometry, we quantify a possible impact of calcium phosphate dissolution on the maintenance of F&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-ATP synthase activity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v1HJAxQQnVE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Cancer cells have genetic alterations that often directly affect intracellular protein signaling processes allowing them to bypass control mechanisms for cell death, growth and division. Cancer drugs targeting these alterations often work initially, but resistance is common. Combinations of targeted drugs may overcome or prevent resistance, but their selection requires context-specific knowledge of signaling pathways including complex interactions such as feedback loops and crosstalk. To infer quantitative pathway models, we collected a rich dataset on a melanoma cell line: Following perturbation with 54 drug combinations, we measured 124 (phospho-)protein levels and phenotypic response (cell growth, apoptosis) in a time series from 10 minutes to 67 hours. From these data, we trained time-resolved mathematical models that capture molecular interactions and the coupling of molecular levels to cellular phenotype, which in turn reveal the main direct or indirect molecular responses to each drug. Systematic model simulations identified novel combinations of drugs predicted to reduce the survival of melanoma cells, with partial experimental verification. This particular application of perturbation biology demonstrates the potential impact of combining time-resolved data with modeling for the discovery of new combinations of cancer drugs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eMmy4prvFL0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Towards optogenetic vision restoration with high resolution</title>

In many cases of inherited retinal degenerations, ganglion cells are spared despite photoreceptor cell death, making it possible to stimulate them to restore visual function. Several studies have shown that it is possible to express an optogenetic protein in ganglion cells and make them light sensitive, a promising strategy to restore vision. However the spatial resolution of optogenetically-reactivated retinas has rarely been measured, especially in the primate. Since the optogenetic protein is also expressed in axons, it is unclear if these neurons will only be sensitive to the stimulation of a small region covering their somas and dendrites, or if they will also respond to any stimulation overlapping with their axon, dramatically impairing spatial resolution. Here we recorded responses of mouse and macaque retinas to random checkerboard patterns following an in vivo optogenetic therapy. We show that optogenetically activated ganglion cells are each sensitive to a small region of visual space. A simple model based on this small receptive field predicted accurately their responses to complex stimuli. From this model, we simulated how the entire population of light sensitive ganglion cells would respond to letters of different sizes. We then estimated the maximal acuity expected by a patient, assuming it could make an optimal use of the information delivered by this reactivated retina. The obtained acuity is above the limit of legal blindness. Our model also makes interesting predictions on how acuity might vary upon changing the therapeutic strategy, assuming an optimal use of the information present in the retinal activity. Optogenetic therapy could thus potentially lead to high resolution vision, under conditions that our model helps to determinine.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CmixbOwQ2Ss&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Photoreceptors are specialized cells devoted to the transduction of the incoming visual signals. Rods are able also to shed from their tip old disks and to synthesize at the base of the outer segment (OS) new disks. By combining electrophysiology, optical tweezers (OTs), and biochemistry, we investigate mechanosensitivity in the rods of &lt;i&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/i&gt;, and we show that 1) mechanosensitive channels (MSCs), transient receptor potential canonical 1 (TRPC1), and Piezo1 are present in rod inner segments (ISs); 2) mechanical stimulation—of the order of 10 pN—applied briefly to either the OS or IS evokes calcium transients; 3) inhibition of MSCs decreases the duration of photoresponses to bright flashes; 4) bright flashes of light induce a rapid shortening of the OS; and 5) the genes encoding the TRPC family have an ancient association with the genes encoding families of protein involved in phototransduction.

Mutations create genetic variation for other evolutionary forces to operate on and cause numerous genetic diseases. Nevertheless, how de novo mutations arise remains poorly understood. Progress in the area is hindered by the fact that error rates of conventional sequencing technologies (1 in 100 or 1,000 base pairs) are several orders of magnitude higher than de novo mutation rates (1 in 10,000,000 or 100,000,000 base pairs per generation). Moreover, previous analyses of germline de novo mutations examined pedigrees (and not germ cells) and thus were likely affected by selection. Here, we applied highly accurate duplex sequencing to detect low-frequency, de novo mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) directly from oocytes and from somatic tissues (brain and muscle) of 36 mice from two independent pedigrees. We found mtDNA mutation frequencies 2- to 3-fold higher in 10-month-old than in 1-month-old mice, demonstrating mutation accumulation during the period of only 9 mo. Mutation frequencies and patterns differed between germline and somatic tissues and among mtDNA regions, suggestive of distinct mutagenesis mechanisms. Additionally, we discovered a more pronounced genetic drift of mitochondrial genetic variants in the germline of older versus younger mice, arguing for mtDNA turnover during oocyte meiotic arrest. Our study deciphered for the first time the intricacies of germline de novo mutagenesis using duplex sequencing directly in oocytes, which provided unprecedented resolution and minimized selection effects present in pedigree studies. Moreover, our work provides important information about the origins and accumulation of mutations with aging/maturation and has implications for delayed reproduction in modern human societies. Furthermore, the duplex sequencing method we optimized for single cells opens avenues for investigating low-frequency mutations in other studies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/K9Qc6_N4PD0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: The pregnant myometrium is epigenetically activated at contractility-driving gene loci prior to the onset of labor in mice</title>

During gestation, uterine smooth muscle cells transition from a state of quiescence to one of contractility, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this transition at a genomic level are not well-known. To better understand these events, we evaluated the epigenetic landscape of the mouse myometrium during the pregnant, laboring, and postpartum stages. We generated gestational time point–specific enrichment profiles for histone H3 acetylation on lysine residue 27 (H3K27ac), histone H3 trimethylation of lysine residue 4 (H3K4me3), and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) occupancy by chromatin immunoprecipitation with massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq), as well as gene expression profiles by total RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). Our findings reveal that 533 genes, including known contractility-driving genes (Gap junction alpha 1 [&lt;i&gt;Gja1&lt;/i&gt;], FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene [&lt;i&gt;Fos&lt;/i&gt;], Fos-like antigen 2 [&lt;i&gt;Fosl2&lt;/i&gt;], Oxytocin receptor [&lt;i&gt;Oxtr&lt;/i&gt;], and Prostaglandin G/H synthase 2 (&lt;i&gt;Ptgs2&lt;/i&gt;), for example), are up-regulated at day 19 during active labor because of an increase in transcription at gene bodies. Labor-associated promoters and putative intergenic enhancers, however, are epigenetically activated as early as day 15, by which point the majority of genome-wide H3K27ac or H3K4me3 peaks present in term laboring tissue is already established. Despite this early exhibited histone signature, increased noncoding enhancer RNA (eRNA) production at putative intergenic enhancers and recruitment of RNAPII to the gene bodies of labor-associated loci were detected only during labor. Our findings indicate that epigenetic activation of the myometrial genome precedes active labor by at least 4 days in the mouse model, suggesting that the myometrium is poised for rapid activation of contraction-associated genes in order to exit the state of quiescence.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/prDhSEHk-O0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Chemospecific deficits in taste sensitivity following bilateral or right hemispheric gustatory cortex lesions in rats</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Chemospecific deficits in taste sensitivity following bilateral or right hemispheric gustatory cortex lesions in rats&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3358896d-62ed-44b2-b3b8-b479a13d44e4/cne24928-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our prior studies showed bilateral gustatory cortex (GC) lesions significantly impair taste sensitivity to salts (NaCl and KCl) and quinine (“bitter”) but not to sucrose (“sweet”). The range of qualitative tastants tested here has been extended in a theoretically relevant way to include the maltodextrin, Maltrin, a preferred stimulus by rats thought to represent a unique taste quality, and the “sour” stimulus citric acid; NaCl was also included as a positive control. Male rats (Sprague–Dawley) with histologically confirmed neurotoxin‐induced bilateral (BGCX, &lt;i&gt;n &lt;/i&gt; = 13), or right (RGCX, &lt;i&gt;n &lt;/i&gt; = 13) or left (LGCX, &lt;i&gt;n &lt;/i&gt; = 9) unilateral GC lesions and sham‐operated controls (SHAM, &lt;i&gt;n &lt;/i&gt; = 16) were trained to discriminate a tastant from water in an operant two‐response detection task. A mapping system was used to determine placement, size, and symmetry (when bilateral) of the lesion. BGCX significantly impaired taste sensitivity to NaCl, as expected, but not to Maltrin or citric acid, emulating our prior results with sucrose. However, in the case of citric acid, there was some disruption in performance at higher concentrations. Interestingly, RGCX, but not LGCX, also significantly impaired taste sensitivity, but only to NaCl, suggesting some degree of lateralized function. Taken together with our prior findings, extensive bilateral lesions in GC do not disrupt basic taste signal detection to all taste stimuli uniformly. Moreover, GC lesions do not preclude the ability of rats to learn and perform the task, clearly demonstrating that, in its absence, other brain regions are able to maintain sensory‐discriminative taste processing, albeit with attenuated sensitivity for select stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Applying Dynamic Training-Subset Selection Methods Using Genetic Programming for Forecasting Implied Volatility. (arXiv:2007.07207v1 [q-fin.GN])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07207</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07207</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Volatility is a key variable in option pricing, trading and hedging
strategies. The purpose of this paper is to improve the accuracy of forecasting
implied volatility using an extension of genetic programming (GP) by means of
dynamic training-subset selection methods. These methods manipulate the
training data in order to improve the out of sample patterns fitting. When
applied with the static subset selection method using a single training data
sample, GP could generate forecasting models which are not adapted to some out
of sample fitness cases. In order to improve the predictive accuracy of
generated GP patterns, dynamic subset selection methods are introduced to the
GP algorithm allowing a regular change of the training sample during evolution.
Four dynamic training-subset selection methods are proposed based on random,
sequential or adaptive subset selection. The latest approach uses an adaptive
subset weight measuring the sample difficulty according to the fitness cases
errors. Using real data from SP500 index options, these techniques are compared
to the static subset selection method. Based on MSE total and percentage of non
fitted observations, results show that the dynamic approach improves the
forecasting performance of the generated GP models, specially those obtained
from the adaptive random training subset selection method applied to the whole
set of training samples.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Domain Adaptation for Robust Workload Classification using fNIRS. (arXiv:2007.06706v1 [cs.CV])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06706</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06706</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Significance: We demonstrated the potential of using domain adaptation on
functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) data to detect and discriminate
different levels of n-back tasks that involve working memory across different
experiment sessions and subjects.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aim: To address the domain shift in fNIRS data across sessions and subjects
for task label alignment, we exploited two domain adaptation approaches -
Gromov-Wasserstein (G-W) and Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FG-W).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approach: We applied G-W for session-by-session alignment and FG-W for
subject-by-subject alignment with Hellinger distance as underlying metric to
fNIRS data acquired during different n-back task levels. We also compared with
a supervised method - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results: For session-by-session alignment, using G-W resulted in alignment
accuracy of 70 $\pm$ 4 % (weighted mean $\pm$ standard error), whereas using
CNN resulted in classification accuracy of 58 $\pm$ 5 % across five subjects.
For subject-by-subject alignment, using FG-W resulted in alignment accuracy of
55 $\pm$ 3 %, whereas using CNN resulted in classification accuracy of 45 $\pm$
1 %. Where in both cases 25 % represents chance. We also showed that removal of
motion artifacts from the fNIRS data plays an important role in improving
alignment performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Domain adaptation is potential for session-by-session and
subject-by-subject alignment using fNIRS data.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Dense Crowds Detection and Counting with a Lightweight Architecture. (arXiv:2007.06630v1 [cs.CV])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06630</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06630</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the context of crowd counting, most of the works have focused on improving
the accuracy without regard to the performance leading to algorithms that are
not suitable for embedded applications. In this paper, we propose a lightweight
convolutional neural network architecture to perform crowd detection and
counting using fewer computer resources without a significant loss on count
accuracy. The architecture was trained using the Bayes loss function to further
improve its accuracy and then pruned to further reduce the computational
resources used. The proposed architecture was tested over the USF-QNRF
achieving a competitive Mean Average Error of 154.07 and a superior Mean Square
Error of 241.77 while maintaining a competitive number of parameters of 0.067
Million. The obtained results suggest that the Bayes loss can be used with
other architectures to further improve them and also the last convolutional
layer provides no significant information and even encourage over-fitting at
training.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: RNA Binding Motif 5 (RBM5) in the CNS—Moving Beyond Cancer to Harness RNA Splicing to Mitigate the Consequences of Brain Injury</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Gene splicing modulates the potency of cell death effectors, alters neuropathological disease processes, influences neuronal recovery, but may also direct distinct mechanisms of secondary brain injury. Therapeutic targeting of RNA splicing is a promising avenue for next-generation CNS treatments. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) regulate a variety of RNA species and are prime candidates in the hunt for druggable targets to manipulate and tailor gene-splicing responses in the brain. RBPs preferentially recognize unique consensus sequences in targeted mRNAs. Also, RBPs often contain multiple RNA-binding domains (RBDs)—each having a unique consensus sequence—suggesting the possibility that drugs could be developed to block individual functional domains, increasing the precision of RBP-targeting therapies. Empirical characterization of most RBPs is lacking and represents a major barrier to advance this emerging therapeutic area. There is a paucity of data on the role of RBPs in the brain including, identification of their unique mRNA targets, defining how CNS insults affect their levels and elucidating which RBPs (and individual domains within) to target to improve neurological outcomes. This review focuses on the state-of-the-art of the RBP tumor suppressor RNA binding motif 5 (RBM5) in the CNS. We discuss its potent pro-death roles in cancer, which motivated our interest to study it in the brain. We review recent studies showing that RBM5 levels are increased after CNS trauma and that it promotes neuronal death in vitro. Finally, we conclude with recent reports on the first set of RBM5 regulated genes identified in the intact brain, and discuss how those findings provide new clues germane to its potential function(s) in the CNS, and pose new questions on its therapeutic utility to mitigate CNS injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: A Radiomics Approach to Predicting Parkinson’s Disease by Incorporating Whole-Brain Functional Activity and Gray Matter Structure</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive, chronic, and neurodegenerative disorder that is primarily diagnosed by clinical examinations and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this study, we proposed a machine learning based radiomics method to predict PD. Fifty healthy controls (HC) along with 70 PD patients underwent resting-state magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). For all subjects, we extracted five types of 6664 features, including mean amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (mALFF), mean regional homogeneity (mReHo), resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC), voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) and gray matter (GM) volume. After conducting dimension reduction utilizing Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), fifty-three radiomic features including 46 RSFCs, 1 mALFF, 3 mReHos, 1 VMHC, 2 GM volumes and 1 clinical factor were retained. The selected features also indicated the most discriminative regions for PD. We further conducted model fitting procedure for classifying subjects in the training set employing random forest and support volume machine (SVM) to evaluate the performance of the two methods. After cross-validation, both methods achieved 100% accuracy and area under curve (AUC) for distinguishing between PD and HC in the training set. In the testing set, SVM performed better than random forest with the accuracy, true positive rate (TPR) and AUC being 85%, 1 and 0.97, respectively. These findings demonstrate the radiomics technique has the potential to support radiological diagnosis and to achieve high classification accuracy for clinical diagnostic systems for patients with PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Neurogenesis, and Epigenetics: Putative Implications for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Neurodegeneration and Treatment</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive and devastating multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder. Although the pathogenesis of ALS is still not completely understood, numerous studies suggest that mitochondrial deregulation may be implicated in its onset and progression. Interestingly, mitochondrial deregulation has also been associated with changes in neural stem cells (NSC) proliferation, differentiation, and migration. In this review, we highlight the importance of mitochondrial function for neurogenesis, and how both processes are correlated and may contribute to the pathogenesis of ALS; we have focused primarily on preclinical data from animal models of ALS, since to date no studies have evaluated this link using human samples. As there is currently no cure and no effective therapy to counteract ALS, we have also discussed how improving neurogenic function by epigenetic modulation could benefit ALS. In support of this hypothesis, changes in histone deacetylation can alter mitochondrial function, which in turn might ameliorate cellular proliferation as well as neuronal differentiation and migration. We propose that modulation of epigenetics, mitochondrial function, and neurogenesis might provide new hope for ALS patients, and studies exploring these new territories are warranted in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are the most frequent cause of familial Parkinson’s disease (PD). Several genetic manipulations of the LRRK2 gene have been developed in animal models such as rodents, Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, and zebrafish. These models can help us further understand the biological function and derive potential pathological mechanisms for LRRK2. Here we discuss common phenotypic themes found in LRRK2-associated PD animal models, highlight several issues that should be addressed in future models, and discuss emerging areas to guide their future development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Alterations of Spontaneous Brain Activity in Hemodialysis Patients</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive impairment is prevalent in hemodialysis end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. It might be associated with poor prognosis. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms have not been completely clarified. This study explored spontaneous brain activity in ESRD patients on hemodialysis by using the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF). Nineteen ESRD patients on regular hemodialysis were included in this study. Eighteen age-, sex- and education level-matched volunteers were enrolled as the healthy control group. All participants had resting-state functional MRI scanning, neuropsychological tests, and laboratory testing. ALFF was used for assessing intrinsic brain activity. Independent samples t-test was used for obtaining group differences. Spearman correlation analysis was applied to assess the association between ALFF changes, neuropsychological, and clinical indices. Compared to the healthy control group, hemodialysis patients showed decreased ALFF in the precuneus, right angular gyrus/inferior lobule as well as increased ALFF in the left parahippocampus/hippocampus and right precentral/postcentral gyrus. The ALFF abnormalities in these regions were closely associated with hemoglobin levels. Also, increased ALFF in the left parahippocampus/hippocampus showed a negative correlation with the score of long-delayed free recall. Hemodialysis patients had aberrant ALFF in the default mode network (DMN) regions, particularly in the precuneus and parahippocampus/hippocampus, which may be correlated with neuropathological mechanisms involved in hemodialysis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Occupational Physical Stress Is Negatively Associated With Hippocampal Volume and Memory in Older Adults</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00266</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Our jobs can provide intellectually and socially enriched environments but also be the source of major psychological and physical stressors. As the average full-time worker spends &amp;gt;8 h at work per weekday and remains in the workforce for about 40 years, occupational experiences must be important factors in cognitive and brain aging. Therefore, we studied whether occupational complexity and stress are associated with hippocampal volume and cognitive ability in 99 cognitively normal older adults. We estimated occupational complexity, physical stress, and psychological stress using the Work Design Questionnaire (Morgeson and Humphrey, 2006), Quantitative Workload Inventory and Interpersonal Conflict at Work Scale (Spector and Jex, 1998). We found that physical stress, comprising physical demands and work conditions, was associated with smaller hippocampal volume and poorer memory performance. These associations were independent of age, gender, brain size, socioeconomic factors (education, income, and job title), duration of the job, employment status, leisure physical activity and general stress. This suggests that physical demands at work and leisure physical activity may have largely independent and opposite effects on brain and cognitive health. Our findings highlight the importance of considering midlife occupational experiences, such as work physical stress, in understanding individual trajectories of cognitive and brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Automated Curation of CNMF-E-Extracted ROI Spatial Footprints and Calcium Traces Using Open-Source AutoML Tools</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In vivo 1-photon (1p) calcium imaging is an increasingly prevalent method in behavioral neuroscience. Numerous analysis pipelines have been developed to improve the reliability and scalability of pre-processing and ROI extraction for these large calcium imaging datasets. Despite these advancements in pre-processing methods, manual curation of the extracted spatial footprints and calcium traces of neurons remains important for quality control. Here, we propose an additional semi-automated curation step for sorting spatial footprints and calcium traces from putative neurons extracted using the popular constrained non-negative matrixfactorization for microendoscopic data (CNMF-E) algorithm. We used the automated machine learning (AutoML) tools TPOT and AutoSklearn to generate classifiers to curate the extracted ROIs trained on a subset of human-labeled data. AutoSklearn produced the best performing classifier, achieving an F1 score &amp;gt;92% on the ground truth test dataset. This automated approach is a useful strategy for filtering ROIs with relatively few labeled data points and can be easily added to pre-existing pipelines currently using CNMF-E for ROI extraction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Challenges for Therapeutic Applications of Opsin-Based Optogenetic Tools in Humans</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;As the technological hurdles are overcome and optogenetic techniques advance to have more control over neurons, therapies based on these approaches will begin to emerge in the clinic. Here, we consider the technical challenges surrounding the transition of this breakthrough technology from an investigative tool to a true therapeutic avenue. The emerging strategies and remaining tasks surrounding genetically encoded molecules which respond to light as well as the vehicles required to deliver them are discussed.The use of optogenetics in humans would represent a completely new paradigm in medicine and would be associated with unprecedented technical considerations. To be applied for stimulation of neurons in humans, an ideal optogenetic tool would need to be non-immunogenic, highly sensitive, and activatable with red light or near-infrared light (to maximize light penetration while minimizing photodamage). To enable sophisticated levels of neuronal control, the combined use of optogenetic actuators and indicators could enable closed-loop all-optical neuromodulation. Such systems would introduce additional challenges related to spectral orthogonality between actuator and indicator, the need for decision making computational algorithms and requirements for large gene cassettes. As in any gene therapy, the therapeutic efficiency of optogenetics will rely on vector delivery and expression in the appropriate cell type. Although viral vectors such as those based on AAVs are showing great potential in human trials, barriers to their general use remain, including immune responses, delivery/transport, and liver clearance. Limitations associated with the gene cassette size which can be packaged in currently approved vectors also need to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Telomere Attrition in Neurodegenerative Disorders</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00219</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00219</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Telomere attrition is increased in various disorders and is therefore a potential biomarker for diagnosis and/or prognosis of these disorders. The contribution of telomere attrition in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders is yet to be fully elucidated. We are reviewing the current knowledge regarding the telomere biology in two common neurodegenerative disorders, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Furthermore, we are discussing future prospective of telomere research in these disorders. The majority of studies reported consistent evidence of the accelerated telomere attrition in AD patients, possibly in association with elevated oxidative stress levels. On the other hand in PD, various studies reported contradictory evidence regarding telomere attrition. Consequently, due to the low specificity and sensitivity, the clinical benefit of telomere length as a biomarker of neurodegenerative disease development and progression is not yet recognized. Nevertheless, longitudinal studies in large carefully selected cohorts might provide further elucidation of the complex involvement of the telomeres in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Telomere length maintenance is a complex process characterized by environmental, genetic, and epigenetic determinants. Thus, in addition to the selection of the study cohort, also the selection of analytical methods and types of biological samples for evaluation of the telomere attrition is of utmost importance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Spinal Inhibition of GABAB Receptors by the Extracellular Matrix Protein Fibulin-2 in Neuropathic Rats</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the central nervous system, the inhibitory GABAB receptor is the archetype of heterodimeric G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Receptor interaction with partner proteins has emerged as a novel mechanism to alter GPCR signaling in pathophysiological conditions. We propose here that GABAB activity is inhibited through the specific binding of fibulin-2, an extracellular matrix protein, to the B1a subunit in a rat model of neuropathic pain. We demonstrate that fibulin-2 hampers GABAB activation, presumably through decreasing agonist-induced conformational changes. Fibulin-2 regulates the GABAB-mediated presynaptic inhibition of neurotransmitter release and weakens the GABAB-mediated inhibitory effect in neuronal cell culture. In the dorsal spinal cord of neuropathic rats, fibulin-2 is overexpressed and colocalized with B1a. Fibulin-2 may thus interact with presynaptic GABAB receptors, including those on nociceptive afferents. By applying anti-fibulin-2 siRNA in vivo, we enhanced the antinociceptive effect of intrathecal baclofen in neuropathic rats, thus demonstrating that fibulin-2 limits the action of GABAB agonists in vivo. Taken together, our data provide an example of an endogenous regulation of GABAB receptor by extracellular matrix proteins and demonstrate its functional impact on pathophysiological processes of pain sensitization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: FKBP5 Exacerbates Impairments in Cerebral Ischemic Stroke by Inducing Autophagy via the AKT/FOXO3 Pathway</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00193</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cerebral ischemic stroke is regarded as one of the most serious diseases in the human central nervous system. The secondary ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury increased the difficulty of treatment. Moreover, the latent molecular regulating mechanism in I/R injury is still unclear. Based on our previous clinical study, we discovered that FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5) is significantly upregulated in patients, who suffered acute ischemic stroke (AIS), with high diagnostic value. Levels of FKBP5 were positively correlated with patients’ neurological impairments. Furthermore, a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model of mice was used to confirm that FKBP5 expression in plasma could reflect its relative level in brain tissue. Thus, we hypothesized that FKBP5 participated in the regulation of cerebral I/R injury. In order to explore the possible roles FKBP5 acted, the oxygen and glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) model was established to mimic I/R injury in vitro. FKBP5 expressing levels were changed by plasmid stable transfection. The altered expression of FKBP5 influenced cell viability and autophagy after OGD/R injury notably. Besides, AKT/FOXO3 cascade was involved in the FKBP5-regulating process. In the present study, FKBP5 was verified upregulated in cerebral I/R injury, related to the severity of ischemia and reperfusion injury. Additionally, our analyses revealed that FKBP5 regulates autophagy induced by OGD/R via the downstream AKT/FOXO3 signaling pathway. Our findings provide a novel biomarker for the early diagnosis of ischemic stroke and a potential strategy for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Heart Rate Variability Mainly Relates to Cognitive Executive Functions and Improves Through Exergame Training in Older Adults: A Secondary Analysis of a 6-Month Randomized Controlled Trial</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00197</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00197</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Heart rate variability (HRV) mirrors autonomic nervous system activities and might serve as a parameter to monitor health status in older adults. However, it is currently unknown which functional health measures, including cognitive, physical, and gait performance parameters, are most strongly related to HRV indices. This knowledge would enable implementing HRV assessments into health monitoring routines and training planning for older adults. Simultaneous cognitive–motor and exergame training may be effective to improve HRV indices but has not been investigated yet. Eighty-nine healthy older adults (≥70 years of age) were randomized into three groups: (1) virtual reality video game dancing, i.e., exergaming (DANCE); (2) treadmill walking with simultaneous verbal memory training (MEMORY); or (3) treadmill walking only (PHYS). Strength and balance exercises complemented each program. Over 6 months, two weekly 1-h training sessions were performed. HRV indices (standard deviation of N–N intervals, SDNN; root mean square of successive R–R interval differences, RMSSD; and absolute power of high-frequency band (0.15–0.4 Hz), HF power) and various measures of cognitive, physical, and gait performance were assessed at baseline and after 3 months and 6 months. Multiple linear regression analyses with planned comparisons were calculated. At baseline, 8–12% of HRV variance was significantly explained by cognitive executive functions and leg strength (inversely related). Verbal long-term memory, aerobic and functional fitness, and gait performance did not contribute to the model (SDNN: R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.082, p = 0.016; RMSSD: R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.121, p = 0.013; HF power: R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.119, p = 0.015). After 6 months, DANCE improved HRV indices, while MEMORY and PHYS did not (time × intervention interactions: first-contrast DANCE/MEMORY vs. PHYS: SDNN p = 0.014 one-tailed, ΔR&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.020 and RMSSD p = 0.052 one-tailed (trend), ΔR&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.007; second-contrast DANCE vs. MEMORY: SDNN p = 0.002 one-tailed, ΔR&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.035, RMSSD p = 0.017 one-tailed, ΔR&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.012, and HF power p = 0.011 one-tailed, ΔR&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.013). We conclude that mainly cognitive executive functions are associated with HRV indices and that exergame training improves global and parasympathetic autonomic nervous system activities in older adults. Periodic assessments of HRV in older citizens could be particularly beneficial to monitor cognitive health and provide indications for preventative exercise measures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Structures reveal gatekeeping of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter by MICU1-MICU2</title>

	<description>The mitochondrial calcium uniporter is a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-gated ion channel complex that controls mitochondrial Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry and regulates cell metabolism. MCU and EMRE form the channel while Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent regulation is conferred by MICU1 and MICU2 through an enigmatic process. We present a cryo-EM structure of an MCU-EMRE-MICU1-MICU2 holocomplex comprising MCU and EMRE subunits from the beetle Tribolium castaneum in complex with a human MICU1-MICU2 heterodimer at 3.3 Å resolution. With analogy to how neuronal channels are blocked by protein toxins, a uniporter interaction domain on MICU1 binds to a channel receptor site comprising MCU and EMRE subunits to inhibit ion flow under resting Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; conditions. A Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-bound structure of MICU1-MICU2 at 3.1 Å resolution indicates how Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent changes enable dynamic response to cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals.</description>

	<title>eLife: Three-dimensional growth of breast cancer cells potentiates the anti-tumor effects of unacylated ghrelin and AZP-531</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.56913</guid>

	<description>Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women and notwithstanding important therapeutic advances, remains the second leading cause of cancer-related death. Despite extensive research relating to the hormone ghrelin, responsible for the stimulation of growth hormone release and appetite, little is known of the effects of its unacylated form, especially in cancer. The present study aimed to characterize effects of unacylated ghrelin on breast cancer cells, define its mechanism of action, and explore the therapeutic potential of unacylated ghrelin or analog AZP-531. We report potent anti-tumor effects of unacylated ghrelin, dependent on cells being cultured in 3D in a biologically-relevant extracellular matrix. The mechanism of unacylated ghrelin-mediated growth inhibition involves activation of Gαi and suppression of MAPK signaling. AZP-531 also suppresses the growth of breast cancer cells &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and in xenografts, and may be a novel approach for the safe and effective treatment of breast cancer.</description>

	<description>HIV attacks the body’s immune cells, frequently compromises the integrity of the blood–brain barrier (BBB), and infects the CNS in the early stages of infection. Dysfunction of the BBB further potentiates viral replication within the CNS, which can lead to HIV-associated neuropathology. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) significantly improves HIV patient outcomes and reduces mortality rates. However, there has been limited progress in targeting latent viral reservoirs within the CNS, which may eventually lead to rebound viremia.</description>

	<description>Human behavior comprises many aspects that stand out by their dynamic nature. To quantify its neural underpinnings, time-resolved fMRI methods have blossomed over the past decade. In this review we conceptually organize a broad repertoire of dynamic analytical pipelines and extract general observations on their application to the study of behavior and brain disorders. We aim to provide an extensive overview instead of examining only selected methodological families or specific behavioral domains.</description>

	<description>Coyne et al. demonstrate that G4C2 repeat RNA initiates a reduction of POM121 expression within C9orf72 neuronal nuclear pore complexes. Decreased nuclear POM121 affects the expression of seven additional nucleoporins, resulting in altered nuclear pore composition. This combined nucleoporin reduction affects the localization of nucleocytoplasmic transport proteins and neuronal survival.</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: PiVR: An affordable and versatile closed-loop platform to study unrestrained sensorimotor behavior</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by David Tadres, Matthieu Louis&lt;/p&gt;

Tools enabling closed-loop experiments are crucial to delineate causal relationships between the activity of genetically labeled neurons and specific behaviors. We developed the Raspberry Pi Virtual Reality (PiVR) system to conduct closed-loop optogenetic stimulation of neural functions in unrestrained animals. PiVR is an experimental platform that operates at high temporal resolution (70 Hz) with low latencies (&amp;lt;30 milliseconds), while being affordable (&amp;lt;6 hours). Through extensive documentation, this tool was designed to be accessible to a wide public, from high school students to professional researchers studying systems neuroscience. We illustrate the functionality of PiVR by focusing on sensory navigation in response to gradients of chemicals (chemotaxis) and light (phototaxis). We show how &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; adult flies perform negative chemotaxis by modulating their locomotor speed to avoid locations associated with optogenetically evoked bitter taste. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; larvae, we use innate positive chemotaxis to compare behavior elicited by real- and virtual-odor gradients. Finally, we examine how positive phototaxis emerges in zebrafish larvae from the modulation of turning maneuvers to orient in virtual white-light gradients. Besides its application to study chemotaxis and phototaxis, PiVR is a versatile tool designed to bolster efforts to map and to functionally characterize neural circuits.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/TZkBZnaofMc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Improving the reproducibility of biomedical research is a major challenge. Transparent and accurate reporting is vital to this process; it allows readers to assess the reliability of the findings and repeat or build upon the work of other researchers. The ARRIVE guidelines (Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments) were developed in 2010 to help authors and journals identify the minimum information necessary to report in publications describing in vivo experiments. Despite widespread endorsement by the scientific community, the impact of ARRIVE on the transparency of reporting in animal research publications has been limited. We have revised the ARRIVE guidelines to update them and facilitate their use in practice. The revised guidelines are published alongside this paper. This explanation and elaboration document was developed as part of the revision. It provides further information about each of the 21 items in ARRIVE 2.0, including the rationale and supporting evidence for their inclusion in the guidelines, elaboration of details to report, and examples of good reporting from the published literature. This document also covers advice and best practice in the design and conduct of animal studies to support researchers in improving standards from the start of the experimental design process through to publication.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/TVG_d0RsR0c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Reproducible science requires transparent reporting. The ARRIVE guidelines (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments) were originally developed in 2010 to improve the reporting of animal research. They consist of a checklist of information to include in publications describing in vivo experiments to enable others to scrutinise the work adequately, evaluate its methodological rigour, and reproduce the methods and results. Despite considerable levels of endorsement by funders and journals over the years, adherence to the guidelines has been inconsistent, and the anticipated improvements in the quality of reporting in animal research publications have not been achieved. Here, we introduce ARRIVE 2.0. The guidelines have been updated and information reorganised to facilitate their use in practice. We used a Delphi exercise to prioritise and divide the items of the guidelines into 2 sets, the “ARRIVE Essential 10,” which constitutes the minimum requirement, and the “Recommended Set,” which describes the research context. This division facilitates improved reporting of animal research by supporting a stepwise approach to implementation. This helps journal editors and reviewers verify that the most important items are being reported in manuscripts. We have also developed the accompanying Explanation and Elaboration (E&amp;amp;E) document, which serves (1) to explain the rationale behind each item in the guidelines, (2) to clarify key concepts, and (3) to provide illustrative examples. We aim, through these changes, to help ensure that researchers, reviewers, and journal editors are better equipped to improve the rigour and transparency of the scientific process and thus reproducibility.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/z2lkpZ3p6v0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Dvl (Dishevelled) is one of several essential nonenzymatic components of the Wnt signaling pathway. In most current models, Dvl forms complexes with Wnt ligand receptors, Fzd and LRP5/6 at the plasma membrane, which then recruits the destruction complex, eventually leading to inactivation of β-catenin degradation. Although this model is widespread,...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/Z_SSAjzWzOU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Selective Antagonism of A1 Adenosinergic Receptors Strengthens the Neuromodulation of the Sensorimotor Network During Epidural Spinal Stimulation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00044</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00044</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although epidural spinal stimulation (ESS) results in promising therapeutic effects in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI), its potential to generate functional motor recovery varies between individuals and remains largely unclear. However, both preclinical and clinical studies indicate the capacity of electrical and pharmacological interventions to synergistically increase the engagement of spinal sensorimotor networks and regain motor function after SCI. This study explored whether selective pharmacological antagonism of the adenosine A1 receptor subtype synergizes with ESS, thereby increasing motor response. We hypothesized that selective pharmacological antagonism of A1 receptors during ESS would produce facilitatory effects in spinal sensorimotor networks detected as an increased amplitude of spinally-evoked motor potentials and sustained duration of ESS induced activity. Terminal experiments were performed in adult rats using trains of stereotyped pulses at 40 Hz delivered at L5 with the local administration to the cord of 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX). We demonstrated that ESS combined with the blockage of A1 receptors increased the magnitude of the endogenous modulation and postponed the decay of responses that occur during ESS alone. Although DPCPX significantly increased the yield of repetitive stimulation in intact spinal cords, the effects of A1 antagonism on motor evoked responses after an acute spinal transection was not detected. These studies support the future investigation of the optimal dosage, methods of delivery, and systemic effects of the synergistic application of A1 antagonists and spinal stimulation in the intact and injured spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Evaluating the Efficacy of Taurodeoxycholic Acid in Providing Otoprotection Using an in vitro Model of Electrode Insertion Trauma</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00113</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cochlear implants (CIs) are widely used to provide auditory rehabilitation to individuals having severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). However, insertion of electrode leads to inner trauma and activation of inflammatory and apoptotic signaling cascades resulting in loss of residual hearing in implanted individuals. Pharmaceutical interventions that can target these signaling cascades hold great potential for preserving residual hearing by preventing sensory cell damage. Bile salts have shown efficacy in various regions of the body as powerful antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents. However, their efficacy against inner ear trauma has never been explored. The objective of this study was to determine whether taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA), a bile salt derivative, can prevent sensory cell damage employing an in vitro model of electrode insertion trauma (EIT). The organ of Corti (OC) explants were dissected from postnatal day 3 (P-3) rats and placed in serum-free media. Explants were divided into control and experimental groups: (1) untreated controls; (2) EIT; (3) EIT+ TDCA (different concentrations). Hair cell (HC) density, analyses of apoptosis pathway (cleaved caspase 3), levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity and Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (MMP) were assayed. Treatment with TDCA provided significant otoprotection against HC loss in a dose-dependent manner. The molecular mechanisms underlying otoprotection involved decreasing oxidative stress, lowering levels of iNOS, and abrogating generation of cleaved caspase 3. The results of the present study suggest that TDCA provides efficient otoprotection against EIT, in vitro and should be explored for developing pharmaceutical interventions to preserve residual hearing post-cochlear implantation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Intravenous Injection of PHF-Tau Proteins From Alzheimer Brain Exacerbates Neuroinflammation, Amyloid Beta, and Tau Pathologies in 5XFAD Transgenic Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation in the brain of intraneuronal aggregates of abnormally and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins and of extracellular deposits of amyloid-β surrounded by dystrophic neurites. Numerous experimental models have shown that tau pathology develops in the brain after intracerebral injection of brain homogenates or pathological tau [paired helical filaments (PHF)-tau)] from AD brains. Further investigations are however necessary to identify or exclude potential extracerebral routes of tau pathology transmission, e.g., through the intravascular route. In this study, we have analyzed the effect of intravenous injection of PHF-tau proteins from AD brains on the formation of tau and amyloid pathologies in the brain of wild-type (WT) mice and of 5XFAD mice (an amyloid model). We observed that 5XFAD mice with a disrupted blood–brain barrier showed increased plaque-associated astrogliosis, microgliosis, and increased deposits of Aβ40 and Aβ42 after intravenous injection of PHF-tau proteins. In addition, an increased phosphotau immunoreactivity was observed in plaque-associated dystrophic neurites. These results suggest that blood products contaminated by PHF-tau proteins could potentially induce an exacerbation of neuroinflammation and AD pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) caused by noise exposure and attendant loss of glutamatergic synapses between cochlear spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) and hair cells is the most common sensory deficit worldwide. We show here that systemic administration of a bisphosphonate to mice 24 h after synaptopathic noise exposure regenerated synapses between inner hair cells and SGNs and restored cochlear function. We further demonstrate that this effect is mediated by inhibition of the mevalonate pathway. These results are highly significant because they suggest that bisphosphonates could reverse cochlear synaptopathy for the treatment of SNHL.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Multisensory Audiovisual Processing in Children With a Sensory Processing Disorder (II): Speech Integration Under Noisy Environmental Conditions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00039</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00039</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: There exists a cohort of children and adults who exhibit an inordinately high degree of discomfort when experiencing what would be considered moderate and manageable levels of sensory input. That is, they show over-responsivity in the face of entirely typical sound, light, touch, taste, or smell inputs, and this occurs to such an extent that it interferes with their daily functioning and reaches clinical levels of dysfunction. What marks these individuals apart is that this sensory processing disorder (SPD) is observed in the absence of other symptom clusters that would result in a diagnosis of Autism, ADHD, or other neurodevelopmental disorders more typically associated with sensory processing difficulties. One major theory forwarded to account for these SPDs posits a deficit in multisensory integration, such that the various sensory inputs are not appropriately integrated into the central nervous system, leading to an overwhelming sensory-perceptual environment, and in turn to the sensory-defensive phenotype observed in these individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We tested whether children (6–16 years) with an over-responsive SPD phenotype (N = 12) integrated multisensory speech differently from age-matched typically-developing controls (TD: N = 12). Participants identified monosyllabic words while background noise level and sensory modality (auditory-alone, visual-alone, audiovisual) were varied in pseudorandom order. Improved word identification when speech was both seen and heard compared to when it was simply heard served to index multisensory speech integration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: School-aged children with an SPD show a deficit in the ability to benefit from the combination of both seen and heard speech inputs under noisy environmental conditions, suggesting that these children do not benefit from multisensory integrative processing to the same extent as their typically developing peers. In contrast, auditory-alone performance did not differ between the groups, signifying that this multisensory deficit is not simply due to impaired processing of auditory speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Children with an over-responsive SPD show a substantial reduction in their ability to benefit from complementary audiovisual speech, to enhance speech perception in a noisy environment. This has clear implications for performance in the classroom and other learning environments. Impaired multisensory integration may contribute to sensory over-reactivity that is the definitional of SPD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Abnormalities in Brain and Muscle Microstructure and Neurochemistry of the DMD Rat Measured by in vivo Diffusion Tensor Imaging and High Resolution Localized 1H MRS</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked disorder caused by the lack of dystrophin with progressive degeneration of skeletal muscles. Most studies regarding DMD understandably focus on muscle, but dystrophin is also expressed in the central nervous system, potentially resulting in cognitive and behavioral changes. Animal models are being used for developing more comprehensive neuromonitoring protocols and clinical image acquisition procedures. The recently developed DMD rat is an animal model that parallels the progressive muscle wasting seen in DMD. Here, we studied the brain and temporalis muscle structure and neurochemistry of wild type (WT) and dystrophic (DMD) rats using magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. Both structural and neurochemistry alterations were observed in the DMD rat brain and the temporalis muscle. There was a decrease in absolute brain volume (WT = 1579 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;; DMD = 1501 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;; p = 0.039, Cohen’s d = 1.867), but not normalized (WT = 4.27; DMD = 4.02; p = 0.306) brain volume. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) revealed structural alterations in the DMD temporalis muscle, with increased mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD). In the DMD rat thalamus, DTI revealed an increase in fractional anisotropy (FA) and a decrease in RD. Smaller normalized brain volume correlated to severity of muscle dystrophy (r = −0.975). Neurochemical changes in the DMD rat brain included increased GABA and NAA in the prefrontal cortex, and GABA in the hippocampus. Such findings could indicate disturbed motor and sensory signaling, resulting in a dysfunctional GABAergic neurotransmission, and an unstable osmoregulation in the dystrophin-null brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Static and Dynamic Changes of Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuations in Cervical Discogenic Pain</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cervical discogenic pain (CDP) is a clinically common pain syndrome caused by cervical disk degeneration. A large number of studies have reported that CDP results in brain functional impairments. However, the detailed dynamic brain functional abnormalities in CDP are still unclear. In this study, using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, we explored the neural basis of CDP with 40 CDP patients and 40 age-, gender-matched healthy controls to delineate the changes of the voxel-level static and dynamic amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF). We found increased static ALFF in left insula (INS) and posterior precuneus (PCu), and decreased static ALFF in left precentral/postcentral gyrus (PreCG/PoCG), thalamus (THA), and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex in CPD patients compared to healthy controls. We also found decreased dynamic ALFF in left PreCG/PoCG, right posterior middle temporal gyrus, and bilateral THA. Moreover, we found that static ALFF in left PreCG/PoCG and dynamic ALFF in THA were significantly negatively correlated with visual analog scale and disease duration, respectively. Our findings provide the neurophysiological basis for CDP and facilitate understanding the neuropathology of CDP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: NR4A1 Methylation Associated Multimodal Neuroimaging Patterns Impaired in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00727</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;DNA hypermethylation has been widely observed in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), in which NR4A1 knockdown has been reported to be able to alleviate seizure severity in mouse model, while the underlying methylation-imaging pathway modulated by aberrant methylation levels of NR4A1 remains to be clarified in patients with TLE. Here, using multi-site canonical correlation analysis with reference, methylation levels of NR4A1 in blood were used as priori to guide fusion of three MRI features: functional connectivity (FC), fractional anisotropy (FA), and gray matter volume (GMV) for 56 TLE patients and 65 healthy controls. Post-hoc correlations were further evaluated between the identified NR4A1-associated brain components and disease onset. Results suggested that higher NR4A1 methylation levels in TLE were related with impaired temporal-cerebellar and occipital-cerebellar FC strength, lower FA in cingulum (hippocampus), and reduced GMV in putamen, temporal pole, and cerebellum. Moreover, findings were also replicated well in both patient subsets with either right TLE or left TLE only. Particularly, right TLE patients showed poorer cognitive abilities and more severe brain impairment than left TLE patients, especially more reduced GMV in thalamus. In summary, this work revealed a potential imaging-methylation pathway modulated by higher NR4A1 methylation in TLE via data mining, which may impact the above-mentioned multimodal brain circuits and was also associated with earlier disease onset and more cognitive deficits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The aim of this perspective is to propose and discuss the integration of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with virtual reality (VR) food exposure for therapeutic interventions for food addiction. “Food addiction” is a dysfunctional eating pattern which is typically observed in eating disorders (ED) such as bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder. Food addiction has been compared to substance use disorder due to the necessity of consuming a substance (food) and the presence of a dependence behavior. In recent years, VR has been applied in the treatment of ED because it triggers psychological and physiological responses through food exposure in place of real stimuli. Virtual reality-Cue exposure therapy has been proven as a valid technique for regulating anxiety and food craving in ED. More, TMS has been proven to modulate circuits and networks implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders and is effective in treating addiction such as nicotine craving and consumption and cocaine use disorder. The combination of a simulative technology and a neurostimulation would presumably provide better improvement compared to a single intervention because it implies the presence of both cognitive and neuropsychological techniques. The possible advantage of this approach will be discussed in the perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding how neural networks generate activity patterns and communicate with each other requires monitoring the electrical activity from many neurons simultaneously. Perfectly suited tools for addressing this challenge are genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) because they can be targeted to specific cell types and optically report the electrical activity of individual, or populations of neurons. However, analyzing and interpreting the data from voltage imaging experiments is challenging because high recording speeds and properties of current GEVIs yield only low signal-to-noise ratios, making it necessary to apply specific analytical tools. Here, we present NOSA (Neuro-Optical Signal Analysis), a novel open source software designed for analyzing voltage imaging data and identifying temporal interactions between electrical activity patterns of different origin. In this work, we explain the challenges that arise during voltage imaging experiments and provide hands-on analytical solutions. We demonstrate how NOSA’s baseline fitting, filtering algorithms and movement correction can compensate for shifts in baseline fluorescence and extract electrical patterns from low signal-to-noise recordings. NOSA allows to efficiently identify oscillatory frequencies in electrical patterns, quantify neuronal response parameters and moreover provides an option for analyzing simultaneously recorded optical and electrical data derived from patch-clamp or other electrode-based recordings. To identify temporal relations between electrical activity patterns we implemented different options to perform cross correlation analysis, demonstrating their utility during voltage imaging in Drosophila and mice. All features combined, NOSA will facilitate the first steps into using GEVIs and help to realize their full potential for revealing cell-type specific connectivity and functional interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Elucidating the Relationship Between Diabetes Mellitus and Parkinson’s Disease Using 18F-FP-(+)-DTBZ, a Positron-Emission Tomography Probe for Vesicular Monoamine Transporter 2</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Diabetes mellitus (DM) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) have been and will continue to be two common chronic diseases globally that are difficult to diagnose during the prodromal phase. Current molecular genetics, cell biological, and epidemiological evidences have shown the correlation between PD and DM. PD shares the same pathogenesis pathways and pathological factors with DM. In addition, β-cell reduction, which can cause hyperglycemia, is a striking feature of DM. Recent studies indicated that hyperglycemia is highly relevant to the pathologic changes in PD. However, further correlation between DM and PD remains to be investigated. Intriguingly, polycystic monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), which is co-expressed in dopaminergic neurons and β cells, is responsible for taking up dopamine into the presynaptic vesicles and can specifically bind to the β cells. Furthermore, we have summarized the specific molecular and diagnostic functions of VMAT2 for the two diseases reported in this review. Therefore, VMAT2 can be applied as a target probe for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to detect β-cell and dopamine level changes, which can contribute to the diagnosis of DM and PD during the prodromal phase. Targeting VMAT2 with the molecular probe &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FP-(+)-DTBZ can be an entry point for the β cell mass (BCM) changes in DM at the molecular level, to clarify the potential relationship between DM and PD. VMAT2 has promising clinical significance in investigating the pathogenesis, early diagnosis, and treatment evaluation of the two diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Focused Ultrasound for Noninvasive, Focal Pharmacologic Neurointervention</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00675</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A long-standing goal of translational neuroscience is the ability to noninvasively deliver therapeutic agents to specific brain regions with high spatiotemporal resolution. Focused ultrasound (FUS) is an emerging technology that can noninvasively deliver energy up the order of 1 kW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with millimeter and millisecond resolution to any point in the human brain with Food and Drug Administration-approved hardware. Although FUS is clinically utilized primarily for focal ablation in conditions such as essential tremor, recent breakthroughs have enabled the use of FUS for drug delivery at lower intensities (i.e., tens of watts per square centimeter) without ablation of the tissue. In this review, we present strategies for image-guided FUS-mediated pharmacologic neurointerventions. First, we discuss blood–brain barrier opening to deliver therapeutic agents of a variety of sizes to the central nervous system. We then describe the use of ultrasound-sensitive nanoparticles to noninvasively deliver small molecules to millimeter-sized structures including superficial cortical regions and deep gray matter regions within the brain without the need for blood–brain barrier opening. We also consider the safety and potential complications of these techniques, with attention to temporal acuity. Finally, we close with a discussion of different methods for mapping the ultrasound field within the brain and describe future avenues of research in ultrasound-targeted drug therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Deciphering the Morphology of Motor Evoked Potentials</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00028</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00028</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs) are used to monitor disability progression in multiple sclerosis (MS). Their morphology plays an important role in this process. Currently, however, there is no clear definition of what constitutes a normal or abnormal morphology. To address this, five experts independently labeled the morphology (normal or abnormal) of the same set of 1,000 MEPs. The intra- and inter-rater agreement between the experts indicates they agree on the concept of morphology, but differ in their choice of threshold between normal and abnormal morphology. We subsequently performed an automated extraction of 5,943 time series features from the MEPs to identify a valid proxy for morphology, based on the provided labels. To do this, we compared the cross-validation performances of one-dimensional logistic regression models fitted to each of the features individually. We find that the approximate entropy (ApEn) feature can accurately reproduce the majority-vote labels. The performance of this feature is evaluated on an independent test set by comparing to the majority vote of the neurologists, obtaining an AUC score of 0.92. The model slightly outperforms the average neurologist at reproducing the neurologists consensus-vote labels. We can conclude that MEP morphology can be consistently defined by pooling the interpretations from multiple neurologists and that ApEn is a valid continuous score for this. Having an objective and reproducible MEP morphological abnormality score will allow researchers to include this feature in their models, without manual annotation becoming a bottleneck. This is crucial for large-scale, multi-center datasets. An exploratory analysis on a large single-center dataset shows that ApEn is potentially clinically useful. Introducing an automated, objective, and reproducible definition of morphology could help overcome some of the barriers that are currently obstructing broad adoption of evoked potentials in daily care and patient follow-up, such as standardization of measurements between different centers, and formulating guidelines for clinical use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Abnormal Contingent Negative Variation Drifts During Facial Expression Judgment in Schizophrenia Patients</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00274</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Schizophrenia patients often show impaired facial expression recognition, which leads to difficulties in adaptation to daily life. However, it remains unclear whether the deficit is at the perceptual or higher cognitive level of facial emotion processing. Recent studies have shown that earlier face-evoked event-related potential (ERP) components such as N170 and P100 can effectively distinguish schizophrenia patients from healthy controls; however, findings for later waveforms are ambiguous. To clarify this point, in this study we compared electroencephalographic signals in schizophrenia patients and control subjects during a facial expression judgment task. We found that group effects of the occipital N170 and frontal lobe contingent negative variation (CNV) were both significant. The effect sizes (ESs) of N170 and CNV amplitudes were generally medium or small, whereas that of CNV slope for an upright face was large (&amp;gt;0.8). Moreover, N170 amplitude and CNV slope but not CNV amplitude was correlated with Personal and Social Performance (PSP) Scale score. These results suggest that the slope of CNV drift during facial expression processing has a potential clinical value for schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: ABBaH: Activity Breaks for Brain Health. A Protocol for a Randomized Crossover Trial</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00273</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00273</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Extended periods of sitting may have detrimental effects on brain health. However, the effects of breaking up prolonged sedentary periods with frequent, short physical activity bouts on mechanisms to improve brain health remain unclear. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the immediate effects of uninterrupted sitting and frequent, short bouts of physical activity on cerebral blood flow and cognitive function in the prefrontal cortex in middle-aged adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: This is a protocol article to describe a randomized crossover study. We will collect data from 13 healthy adults, aged between 40 and 60 years old, with a body mass index &amp;lt;35 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Participants will be required to come into the laboratory on three occasions, sit for 3 h, and perform a different type of break for 3 min every 30 min at each visit in a random order, being either: (1) a social break; (2) brisk walk on a treadmill; or (3) simple resistance activities. Before and after each experimental condition, cerebral blood flow (primary outcome) will be measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), with short-separation channels, and working memory (1-, 2-, and 3-back on the computer) will be assessed. The following additional secondary outcomes will be collected: psychological factors (questionnaires); arterial stiffness; salivary cortisol levels; and blood glucose levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The results from this randomized crossover study will determine the effects of uninterrupted sitting and frequent, short bouts of physical activity on cerebral blood flow and cognitive performance. Publication of this study protocol emphasizes the importance of registration and publication of protocols in the field of sedentary behavior research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Graded fMRI Neurofeedback Training of Motor Imagery in Middle Cerebral Artery Stroke Patients: A Preregistered Proof-of-Concept Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00226</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), a major brain vessel that supplies the primary motor and premotor cortex, is one of the most common causes for severe upper limb impairment. Currently available motor rehabilitation training largely lacks satisfying efficacy with over 70% of stroke survivors showing residual upper limb dysfunction. Motor imagery-based functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (fMRI-NF) has been suggested as a potential therapeutic technique to improve motor impairment in stroke survivors. In this preregistered proof-of-concept study (https://osf.io/y69jc/), we translated graded fMRI-NF training, a new paradigm that we have previously studied in healthy participants, to first-time MCA stroke survivors with residual mild to severe impairment of upper limb motor function. Neurofeedback was provided from the supplementary motor area (SMA) targeting two different neurofeedback target levels (low and high). We hypothesized that MCA stroke survivors will show (1) sustained SMA-region of interest (ROI) activation and (2) a difference in SMA-ROI activation between low and high neurofeedback conditions during graded fMRI-NF training. At the group level, we found only anecdotal evidence for these preregistered hypotheses. At the individual level, we found anecdotal to moderate evidence for the absence of the hypothesized graded effect for most subjects. These null findings are relevant for future attempts to employ fMRI-NF training in stroke survivors. The study introduces a Bayesian sequential sampling plan, which incorporates prior knowledge, yielding higher sensitivity. The sampling plan was preregistered together with a priori hypotheses and all planned analysis before data collection to address potential publication/researcher biases. Unforeseen difficulties in the translation of our paradigm to a clinical setting required some deviations from the preregistered protocol. We explicitly detail these changes, discuss the accompanied additional challenges that can arise in clinical neurofeedback studies, and formulate recommendations for how these can be addressed. Taken together, this work provides new insights about the feasibility of motor imagery-based graded fMRI-NF training in MCA stroke survivors and serves as a first example for comprehensive study preregistration of an (fMRI) neurofeedback experiment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Resilience and Vulnerability: Neurodevelopment of Very Preterm Children at Four Years of Age</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00219</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00219</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Children born very preterm (VPT) are at high-risk for altered brain development and impaired neurodevelopmental outcomes but are not well-studied before school-age. We investigated 64 four-year-olds: 37 VPT children [&amp;lt;32 weeks gestational age [GA]; 22 males; mean GA: 28.8 weeks ± 1.6], 25 full-term (FT) children (12 males), plus two VPT cases with ventriculomegaly and exceptionally resilient outcomes. All children underwent high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging and developmental assessments. Measures of brain volume, cortical thickness, and surface area were obtained. Children born VPT demonstrated reduced cerebral and cerebellar white matter volumes yet increased cerebral gray matter, temporal lobe, occipital lobe and ventricle volumes after adjusting for total brain volume. Cortical thickness was greater in the VPT children compared to FT children across all lobes. On developmental assessments, the VPT children scored lower on average than FT children while the two cases had intact cognitive abilities. In addition to larger ventricle volumes, the two cases had white matter and gray matter volumes within the ranges of the FT children. The VPT children displayed distinct differences in structural brain volumes at 4 years of age, consistent with delayed maturation. The cases with persistent ventriculomegaly and good cognitive outcomes displayed typical gray matter and increased white matter volumes, indicating a potential protective developmental phenomenon contributing to their intact cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Optimization of Efficient Neuron Models With Realistic Firing Dynamics. The Case of the Cerebellar Granule Cell</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00161</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00161</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Biologically relevant large-scale computational models currently represent one of the main methods in neuroscience for studying information processing primitives of brain areas. However, biologically realistic neuron models tend to be computationally heavy and thus prevent these models from being part of brain-area models including thousands or even millions of neurons. The cerebellar input layer represents a canonical example of large scale networks. In particular, the cerebellar granule cells, the most numerous cells in the whole mammalian brain, have been proposed as playing a pivotal role in the creation of somato-sensorial information representations. Enhanced burst frequency (spiking resonance) in the granule cells has been proposed as facilitating the input signal transmission at the theta-frequency band (4–12 Hz), but the functional role of this cell feature in the operation of the granular layer remains largely unclear. This study aims to develop a methodological pipeline for creating neuron models that maintain biological realism and computational efficiency whilst capturing essential aspects of single-neuron processing. Therefore, we selected a light computational neuron model template (the adaptive-exponential integrate-and-fire model), whose parameters were progressively refined using an automatic parameter tuning with evolutionary algorithms (EAs). The resulting point-neuron models are suitable for reproducing the main firing properties of a realistic granule cell from electrophysiological measurements, including the spiking resonance at the theta-frequency band, repetitive firing according to a specified intensity-frequency (I-F) curve and delayed firing under current-pulse stimulation. Interestingly, the proposed model also reproduced some other emergent properties (namely, silent at rest, rheobase and negligible adaptation under depolarizing currents) even though these properties were not set in the EA as a target in the fitness function (FF), proving that these features are compatible even in computationally simple models. The proposed methodology represents a valuable tool for adjusting AdEx models according to a FF defined in the spiking regime and based on biological data. These models are appropriate for future research of the functional implication of bursting resonance at the theta band in large-scale granular layer network models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: The Neurodevelopmental Pathogenesis of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00039</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00039</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a model disorder for understanding brain development because the genes that cause TSC are known, many downstream molecular pathways have been identified, and the resulting perturbations of cellular events are established. TSC, therefore, provides an intellectual framework to understand the molecular and biochemical pathways that orchestrate normal brain development. The TSC1 and TSC2 genes encode Hamartin and Tuberin which form a GTPase activating protein (GAP) complex. Inactivating mutations in TSC genes (TSC1/TSC2) cause sustained Ras homologue enriched in brain (RHEB) activation of the mammalian isoform of the target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). TOR is a protein kinase that regulates cell size in many organisms throughout nature. mTORC1 inhibits catabolic processes including autophagy and activates anabolic processes including mRNA translation. mTORC1 regulation is achieved through two main upstream mechanisms. The first mechanism is regulation by growth factor signaling. The second mechanism is regulation by amino acids. Gene mutations that cause too much or too little mTORC1 activity lead to a spectrum of neuroanatomical changes ranging from altered brain size (micro and macrocephaly) to cortical malformations to Type I neoplasias. Because somatic mutations often underlie these changes, the timing, and location of mutation results in focal brain malformations. These mutations, therefore, provide gain-of-function and loss-of-function changes that are a powerful tool to assess the events that have gone awry during development and to determine their functional physiological consequences. Knowledge about the TSC-mTORC1 pathway has allowed scientists to predict which upstream and downstream mutations should cause commensurate neuroanatomical changes. Indeed, many of these predictions have now been clinically validated. A description of clinical imaging and histochemical findings is provided in relation to laboratory models of TSC that will allow the reader to appreciate how human pathology can provide an understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Comparison of Noninvasive Imagery Methods to Observe Healthy and Degenerated Olfactory Epithelium in Mice for the Early Diagnosis of Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Olfactory dysfunction could be an early and reliable indicator for the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer and Parkinson's diseases. In this paper, we compare the potential of different noninvasive medical imaging modalities (optical coherence tomography, confocal microscopy, and fluorescence endomicroscopy) to distinguish how the olfactory epithelium, both at the cellular and the structural levels, is altered. Investigations were carried out on three experimental groups: two pathological groups (mice models with deliberately altered olfactory epithelium and Alzheimer's disease transgenic mice models) were compared with healthy mice models. As histological staining, the three tested noninvasive imaging tools demonstrated the general tubular organization of the olfactory epithelium on healthy mice. Contrary to OCT, confocal microscopy, and endomicroscopy allowed visualizing the inner structure of olfactory epithelium as well as its morphological or functional changes on pathological models, alterations classically observed with histological assessment. The results could lead to relevant development of imaging tools for noninvasive and early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases through the in situ characterization of the olfactory epithelium.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Objectives&lt;p&gt;Clinical characteristics of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) include migraine, recurrent stroke, white matter lesions, and vascular dementia. CADASIL is one of the most common hereditary cerebral small vessel diseases. Clinical presentation of CADASIL varies and a racial gap may exist between the Asian and Caucasian populations. This is the first nationwide epidemiological survey which aimed to elucidate the clinical features of CADASIL in Japan. Moreover, the registration database of CADASIL was constructed.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Subjects included CADASIL patients who visited the hospitals (totally 1,448 hospitals) certified by the Japanese Society of Neurology and/or Japan Stroke Society in 2016. This study consisted of a two-step survey; patients with CADASIL were identified genetically by the first questionnaire, and their clinical features were assessed by the second questionnaire. Selected 6 hospitals registered the data of all CADASIL patients using a Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system for the second questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Based on the criteria, 88 patients (50 male and 38 female) with CADASIL were enrolled. The mean age of symptom onset was 49.5 years. Sixteen (18.2%) patients had an elderly onset (&amp;gt;60 years). Thirteen patients (13.6%) had history of migraine with aura and 33 patients (37.5%) had vascular risk factor(s). From among the 86 patients who were examined using magnetic resonance imaging, abnormal deep white matter lesions were detected in 85 patients (98.8%), WMLs extending to anterior temporal pole in 73 patients (84.9%), and cerebral microbleeds in 41 patients (47.7%). Anti-platelet therapy was received by 65 patients (73.9%). Thirty-eight patients (43.2%) underwent treatment with lomerizine hydrochloride. Thirty-four different mutations of NOTCH3 were found in exons 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 11, 14, and 19. Most of the mutations existed in exon 4 (n = 44, 60.3%).

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has become a major disease contributing to human death and is thought to be closely related to the aging process. The rich antioxidant substances in plants have been shown to play a role in delaying aging, and in recent years, significant research has focused on also examining their potential role in AD onset and progression. Many plant-derived antioxidant research studies have provided insights for the future treatment and prevention of AD. This article reviews various types of plant-derived antioxidants with anti-aging effects on neurons. Also it distinguishes the different types of active substances that exhibit different degrees of protection for the nervous system and summarizes the mechanism thereof. Plant-derived antioxidants with neuroprotective functions can protect various components of the nervous system in a variety of ways and can have a positive impact on interventions to prevent and alleviate AD. Furthermore, when considering neuroprotective agents, glial cells also contribute to the defense of the nervous system and should not be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Spotlight on Ferroptosis: Iron-Dependent Cell Death in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is an emerging global epidemic that is becoming increasingly unsustainable. Most of the clinical trials have been centered around targeting β-amyloid and have met with limited success. There is a great impetus to identify alternative drug targets. Iron appears to be the common theme prevalent across neurodegenerative diseases. Iron has been shown to promote aggregation and pathogenicity of the characteristic aberrant proteins, β-amyloid, tau, α-synuclein, and TDP43, in these diseases. Further support for the involvement of iron in pathogenesis is provided by the recent discovery of a new form of cell death, ferroptosis. Arising from iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, ferroptosis is augmented in conditions of cysteine deficiency and glutathione peroxidase-4 inactivation. Here, we review clinical trials that provide the rationale for targeting ferroptosis to delay the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), potentially of relevance to other neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Peroxiredoxin promotes longevity and H2O2-resistance in yeast through redox-modulation of protein kinase A</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.60346</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60346</link>
	<description>Peroxiredoxins are H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; scavenging enzymes that also carry H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; signaling and chaperone functions. In yeast, the major cytosolic peroxiredoxin, Tsa1 is required for both promoting resistance to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and extending lifespan upon caloric restriction. We show here that Tsa1 effects both these functions not by scavenging H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but by repressing the nutrient signaling Ras-cAMP-PKA pathway at the level of the protein kinase A (PKA) enzyme. Tsa1 stimulates sulfenylation of cysteines in the PKA catalytic subunit by H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and a significant proportion of the catalytic subunits are glutathionylated on two cysteine residues. Redox modification of the conserved Cys243 inhibits the phosphorylation of a conserved Thr241 in the kinase activation loop and enzyme activity, and preventing Thr241 phosphorylation can overcome the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sensitivity of Tsa1-deficient cells. Results support a model of aging where nutrient signaling pathways constitute hubs integrating information from multiple aging-related conduits, including a peroxiredoxin-dependent response to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.</description>

	<description>The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected more than 10 million people, including pregnant women. To date, no consistent evidence for the vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 exists. The novel coronavirus canonically utilizes the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for cell entry. Herein, building upon our previous single-cell study (Pique-Regi et al., 2019), another study, and new single-cell/nuclei RNA-sequencing data, we investigated the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 throughout pregnancy in the placenta as well as in third-trimester chorioamniotic membranes. We report that co-transcription of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 is negligible in the placenta, thus not a likely path of vertical transmission for SARS-CoV-2. By contrast, receptors for Zika virus and cytomegalovirus, which cause congenital infections, are highly expressed by placental cell types. These data show that the placenta minimally expresses the canonical cell-entry mediators for SARS-CoV-2.</description>

	<title>eLife: A two-lane mechanism for selective biological ammonium transport</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57183</link>
	<description>The transport of charged molecules across biological membranes faces the dual problem of accommodating charges in a highly hydrophobic environment while maintaining selective substrate translocation. This has been the subject of a particular controversy for the exchange of ammonium across cellular membranes, an essential process in all domains of life. Ammonium transport is mediated by the ubiquitous Amt/Mep/Rh transporters that includes the human Rhesus factors. Here, using a combination of electrophysiology, yeast functional complementation and extended molecular dynamics simulations, we reveal a unique two-lane pathway for electrogenic NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport in two archetypal members of the family, the transporters AmtB from &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli &lt;/i&gt;and Rh50 from &lt;i&gt;Nitrosomonas&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; europaea&lt;/i&gt;. The pathway underpins a mechanism by which charged H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and neutral NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are carried separately across the membrane after NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; deprotonation. This mechanism defines a new principle of achieving transport selectivity against competing ions in a biological transport process.</description>

	<title>eLife: Flotillin-mediated membrane fluidity controls peptidoglycan synthesis and MreB movement</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.57179</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57179</link>
	<description>The bacterial plasma membrane is an important cellular compartment. In recent years it has become obvious that protein complexes and lipids are not uniformly distributed within membranes. Current hypotheses suggest that flotillin proteins are required for the formation of complexes of membrane proteins including cell-wall synthetic proteins. We show here that bacterial flotillins are important factors for membrane fluidity homeostasis. Loss of flotillins leads to a decrease in membrane fluidity that in turn leads to alterations in MreB dynamics and, as a consequence, in peptidoglycan synthesis. These alterations are reverted when membrane fluidity is restored by a chemical fluidizer. In vitro, the addition of a flotillin increases membrane fluidity of liposomes. Our data support a model in which flotillins are required for direct control of membrane fluidity rather than for the formation of protein complexes via direct protein-protein interactions.</description>

	<title>eLife: Risk of psychiatric disorders among the surviving twins after a co-twin loss</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.56860</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56860</link>
	<description>Losing a co-twin by death is a severely stressful event yet with unknown impact on the surviving twin’s risk of psychiatric disorders. We identified all Swedish-born twins who lost a co-twin by death between 1973 and 2013 (n = 4,528), their 4939 non-twin full siblings, together with 22,640 age- and sex-matched non-bereaved twins. Compared to the non-bereaved twins, exposed twins were at increased risk of receiving a first diagnosis of psychiatric disorders (hazard ratio = 1.65, 95% confidence interval1.48–1.83), particularly during the first month after loss. Similarly, compared to non-twin full siblings, the relative risks were significantly increased after loss of monozygotic co-twin (2.45-fold), and loss of a dizygotic co-twin (1.29-fold), with higher HR observed with greater age gaps between twins and non-twin siblings. As dizygotic twins share equal genetic relatedness to the deceased twin as their full siblings, this pattern suggests that beyond the contribution of genetic factors, shared early life experiences and attachment contribute to the risk of psychiatric disorders among surviving twins after co-twin loss.</description>

	<title>eLife: RAB23 coordinates early osteogenesis by repressing FGF10-pERK1/2 and GLI1</title>

	<description>Mutations in the gene encoding &lt;i&gt;Ras-associated binding protein 23&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;RAB23&lt;/i&gt;) cause Carpenter Syndrome, which is characterized by multiple developmental abnormalities including polysyndactyly and defects in skull morphogenesis. To understand how RAB23 regulates skull development, we generated &lt;i&gt;Rab23&lt;/i&gt; deficient mice that survive to an age where skeletal development can be studied. Along with polysyndactyly, these mice exhibit premature fusion of multiple sutures resultant from aberrant osteoprogenitor proliferation and elevated osteogenesis in the suture. FGF10 driven FGFR1 signaling is elevated in &lt;i&gt;Rab23&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; sutures with a consequent imbalance in MAPK, Hedgehog signaling and RUNX2 expression. Inhibition of elevated pERK1/2 signaling results in the normalization of osteoprogenitor proliferation with a concomitant reduction of osteogenic gene expression, and prevention of craniosynostosis. Our results suggest a novel role for RAB23 as an upstream negative regulator of both FGFR and canonical Hh-GLI1 signaling, and additionally non-canonical regulation of GLI1. RAB23 regulates GLI1 through pERK1/2.</description>

	<title>eLife: Sleep is bi-directionally modified by amyloid beta oligomers</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.53995</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53995</link>
	<description>Disrupted sleep is a major feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), often arising years before symptoms of cognitive decline. Prolonged wakefulness exacerbates the production of amyloid-beta (Aβ) species, a major driver of AD progression, suggesting that sleep loss further accelerates AD through a vicious cycle. However, the mechanisms by which Aβ affects sleep are unknown. We demonstrate in zebrafish that Aβ acutely and reversibly enhances or suppresses sleep as a function of oligomer length. Genetic disruptions revealed that short Aβ oligomers induce acute wakefulness through Adrenergic receptor b2 (Adrb2) and Progesterone membrane receptor component 1 (Pgrmc1), while longer Aβ forms induce sleep through a pharmacologically tractable Prion Protein (PrP) signaling cascade. Our data indicate that Aβ can trigger a bi-directional sleep/wake switch. Alterations to the brain’s Aβ oligomeric milieu, such as during the progression of AD, may therefore disrupt sleep via changes in acute signaling events.</description>

	<title>eLife: Recurrent circuitry is required to stabilize piriform cortex odor representations across brain states</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53125</link>
	<description>Pattern completion, or the ability to retrieve stable neural activity patterns from noisy or partial cues, is a fundamental feature of memory. Theoretical studies indicate that recurrently connected auto-associative or discrete attractor networks can perform this process. Although pattern completion and attractor dynamics have been observed in various recurrent neural circuits, the role recurrent circuitry plays in implementing these processes remains unclear. In recordings from head-fixed mice, we found that odor responses in olfactory bulb degrade under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia while responses immediately downstream, in piriform cortex, remain robust. Recurrent connections are required to stabilize cortical odor representations across states. Moreover, piriform odor representations exhibit attractor dynamics, both within and across trials, and these are also abolished when recurrent circuitry is eliminated. Here, we present converging evidence that recurrently-connected piriform populations stabilize sensory representations in response to degraded inputs, consistent with an auto-associative function for piriform cortex supported by recurrent circuitry.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53080</link>
	<description>Tanzanian adult male volunteers were immunized by direct venous inoculation with radiation-attenuated, aseptic, purified, cryopreserved &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum &lt;/i&gt;(Pf) sporozoites (PfSPZ Vaccine) and protective efficacy assessed by homologous controlled human malaria infection (CHMI). Serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses were analyzed longitudinally using a Pf protein microarray covering 91% of the proteome, providing first insights into naturally acquired and PfSPZ Vaccine-induced whole parasite antibody profiles in malaria pre-exposed Africans. Immunoreactivity was identified against 2,239 functionally diverse Pf proteins, showing a wide breadth of humoral response. Antibody-based immune 'fingerprints' in these individuals indicated a strong person-specific immune response at baseline, with little changes in the overall humoral immunoreactivity pattern measured after immunization. The moderate increase in immunogenicity following immunization and the extensive and variable breadth of humoral immune response observed in the volunteers at baseline suggest that pre-exposure reduces vaccine-induced antigen reactivity in unanticipated ways.</description>

	<description>Misfolded protein accumulation causes cytotoxicity, but the mechanism remains poorly understood. Using budding yeast as a model organism, Higgins et al. show that ubiquitination of misfolded proteins depletes free ubiquitin, which compromises ubiquitin-dependent cellular functions and causes cytotoxicity. The Cdc48/p97 segregase antagonizes this cytotoxicity by promoting ubiquitin recycling from misfolded proteins.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Heart failure-induced atrial remodelling promotes electrical and conduction alternans</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008048</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Na Zhao, Qince Li, Kevin Zhang, Kuanquan Wang, Runnan He, Yongfeng Yuan, Henggui Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

Heart failure (HF) is associated with an increased propensity for atrial fibrillation (AF), causing higher mortality than AF or HF alone. It is hypothesized that HF-induced remodelling of atrial cellular and tissue properties promotes the genesis of atrial action potential (AP) alternans and conduction alternans that perpetuate AF. However, the mechanism underlying the increased susceptibility to atrial alternans in HF remains incompletely elucidated. In this study, we investigated the effects of how HF-induced atrial cellular electrophysiological (with prolonged AP duration) and tissue structural (reduced cell-to-cell coupling caused by atrial fibrosis) remodelling can have an effect on the generation of atrial AP alternans and their conduction at the cellular and one-dimensional (1D) tissue levels. Simulation results showed that HF-induced atrial electrical remodelling prolonged AP duration, which was accompanied by an increased sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; content and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transient amplitude. Further analysis demonstrated that HF-induced atrial electrical remodelling increased susceptibility to atrial alternans mainly due to the increased sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase (SERCA) Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; reuptake, modulated by increased phospholamban (PLB) phosphorylation, and the decreased transient outward K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current (&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;to&lt;/sub&gt;). The underlying mechanism has been suggested that the increased SR Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; content and prolonged AP did not fully recover to their previous levels at the end of diastole, resulting in a smaller SR Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release and AP in the next beat. These produced Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transient alternans and AP alternans, and further caused AP alternans and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transient alternans through Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;→AP coupling and AP→Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; coupling, respectively. Simulation of a 1D tissue model showed that the combined action of HF-induced ion channel remodelling and a decrease in cell-to-cell coupling due to fibrosis increased the heart tissue’s susceptibility to the formation of spatially discordant alternans, resulting in an increased functional AP propagation dispersion, which is pro-arrhythmic. These findings provide insights into how HF promotes atrial arrhythmia in association with atrial alternans.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QNHklWhCOGI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Single-cell DNA sequencing technologies are enabling the study of mutations and their evolutionary trajectories in cancer. Somatic copy number aberrations (CNAs) have been implicated in the development and progression of various types of cancer. A wide array of methods for CNA detection has been either developed specifically for or adapted to single-cell DNA sequencing data. Understanding the strengths and limitations that are unique to each of these methods is very important for obtaining accurate copy number profiles from single-cell DNA sequencing data. We benchmarked three widely used methods–Ginkgo, HMMcopy, and CopyNumber–on simulated as well as real datasets. To facilitate this, we developed a novel simulator of single-cell genome evolution in the presence of CNAs. Furthermore, to assess performance on empirical data where the ground truth is unknown, we introduce a phylogeny-based measure for identifying potentially erroneous inferences. While single-cell DNA sequencing is very promising for elucidating and understanding CNAs, our findings show that even the best existing method does not exceed 80% accuracy. New methods that significantly improve upon the accuracy of these three methods are needed. Furthermore, with the large datasets being generated, the methods must be computationally efficient.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/a13HESH3ra4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Heterogeneous, delayed-onset killing by multiple-hitting T cells: Stochastic simulations to assess methods for analysis of imaging data</title>

Although quantitative insights into the killing behaviour of Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs) are necessary for the rational design of immune-based therapies, CTL killing function remains insufficiently characterised. One established model of CTL killing treats CTL cytotoxicity as a Poisson process, based on the assumption that CTLs serially kill antigen-presenting target cells via delivery of lethal hits, each lethal hit corresponding to a single injection of cytotoxic proteins into the target cell cytoplasm. Contradicting this model, a recent &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; study of individual CTLs killing targets over a 12-hour period found significantly greater heterogeneity in CTL killing performance than predicted by Poisson-based killing. The observed killing process was dynamic and varied between CTLs, with the best performing CTLs exhibiting a marked increase in killing during the final hours of the experiments, along with a “burst killing” kinetic. Despite a search for potential differences between CTLs, no mechanistic explanation for the heterogeneous killing kinetics was found. Here we have used stochastic simulations to assess whether target cells might require multiple hits from CTLs before undergoing apoptosis, in order to verify whether multiple-hitting could explain the late onset, burst killing dynamics observed &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. We found that multiple-hitting from CTLs was entirely consistent with the observed killing kinetics. Moreover, the number of available targets and the spatiotemporal kinetics of CTL:target interactions influenced the realised CTL killing rate. We subsequently used realistic, spatial simulations to assess methods for estimating the hitting rate and the number of hits required for target death, to be applied to microscopy data of individual CTLs killing targets. We found that measuring the cumulative duration of individual contacts that targets have with CTLs would substantially improve accuracy when estimating the killing kinetics of CTLs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/a5KHho2JRgo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Diagrams showing the four different groups of secondary eye morphology found by the study. For each group, neuropils of the secondary eye visual pathway and the connections between the secondary eye visual pathway and the protocerebrum are given.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spiders possess a wide array of sensory‐driven behaviors and therefore provide rich models for studying evolutionary hypotheses about the relationship between brain morphology, sensory systems, and behavior. Despite this, only a handful of studies have examined brain variation across the order of Araneae. In this study, I present descriptions of the gross brain morphology for 19 families of spiders that vary in eye morphology. Spiders showed the most variation in the secondary eye visual pathway. Based on this variation, spiders could be categorized into four groups. Group 1 spiders had small, underdeveloped laminae, no medullae, and no mushroom bodies. Group 2 spiders had large laminae, no medullae and large mushroom bodies. Group 3 spiders had laminae and some evidence of reduced medullae and mushroom bodies. Group 4 spiders had the most complex systems, with large laminae, medullae formed from optical glomeruli, and robust mushroom bodies. Within groups, there was large variation in the shape and size of individual regions, indicating possible variation in neuronal organization. The possible evolutionary implications of the loss of a dedicated olfactory organ in spiders and its effects on the mushroom body are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Normal pressure hydrocephalus associated with Alzheimer’ disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25847?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25847?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate if neurodegenerative biomarkers in cerebro‐spinal fluid (CSF) diffferentiate patients with suspected normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) who respond to CSF drainage from patients who do not respond.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data of 62 consecutive patients who presented with MRI‐changes indicative of NPH were studied with regard to cognitive and gait functions before and after drainage of 40‐50 ml CSF. Additionally, S100, NSE, ß‐amyloid protein, tau‐protein, phospho‐tau were determined in CSF. Statistical analyses were carried out with ANOVA and multiple linear regression.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with CSF constellations typical for Alzheimer’s disease (N = 28) improved significantly in cognitive and gait‐related functions after CSF drainage. In contrast, those patients without CSF constellation typical for Alzheimer’s disease (N = 34) did not improve in cognitive and gait‐related functions after CSF drainage. In addition, Alzheimer’s positive CSF biomarkers predicted these improvements.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data suggest an association between Alzheimer’s disease and NPH‐changes supporting the recently suggested dichotomy of a neurodegenerative NPH and a true idiopathic NPH the latter of which appearing to be rare.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Association between Pregnancy and Cervical Artery Dissection</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25813?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25813?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted to determine whether pregnancy is associated with cervical artery dissection.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed a case–control study using claims data from all nonfederal emergency departments and acute care hospitals in New York and Florida between 2005 and 2015. Cases were women 12–42 years of age hospitalized with cervical artery dissection, defined using validated diagnosis codes for carotid/vertebral artery dissection. Controls were women 12–42 years of age with a primary diagnosis of renal colic. Cases and controls were matched 1:1 on age, race, insurance, income, state, and visit year. The exposure variable was pregnancy, defined as labor and delivery within 90 days before or 6 months after the index visit. Logistic regression was used to compare the odds of pregnancy between cases and controls. We performed a secondary cohort‐crossover study comparing the risk of cervical artery dissection during pregnancy versus the same time period 1 year later.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pregnancy was twice as common among 826 women with cervical artery dissection compared with the 826 matched controls with renal colic (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3–4.7). In our secondary analysis, pregnancy was associated with a higher risk of cervical artery dissection (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 2.2; 95% CI, 1.3–3.5), with the heightened risk limited to the postpartum period (IRR, 5.5; 95% CI, 2.6–11.7).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pregnancy, specifically the postpartum period, was associated with hospitalization for cervical artery dissection. Although these findings might in part reflect ascertainment bias, our results suggest that arterial dissection is one mechanism by which pregnancy can lead to stroke.

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Top-Down Control of Inhibitory Granule Cells in the Main Olfactory Bulb Reshapes Neural Dynamics Giving Rise to a Diversity of Computations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00059</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00059</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Growing evidence shows that top-down projections from excitatory neurons in piriform cortex selectively synapse onto local inhibitory granule cells in the main olfactory bulb, effectively gating their own inputs by controlling inhibition. An open question in olfaction is the role this feedback plays in shaping the dynamics of local circuits, and the resultant computational benefits it provides. Using rate models of neuronal firing in a network consisting of excitatory mitral and tufted cells, inhibitory granule cells and top-down piriform cortical neurons, we found that changes in the weight of feedback to inhibitory neurons generated diverse network dynamics and complex transitions between these dynamics. Changes in the weight of top-down feedback supported a number of computations, including both pattern separation and oscillatory synchrony. Additionally, the network could generate gamma oscillations though a mechanism we termed Top-down control of Inhibitory Neuron Gamma (TING). Collectively, these functions arose from a codimension-2 bifurcation in the dynamical system. Our results highlight a key role for this top-down feedback, gating inhibition to facilitate often diametrically different computations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is mechanism for non-apoptotic, iron-dependent, oxidative cell death that is characterized by glutathione consumption and lipid peroxides accumulation. Ferroptosis is crucially involved in neurological diseases, including neurodegeneration, stroke and neurotrauma. This review provides detailed discussions of the ferroptosis mechanisms in these neurological diseases. Moreover, it summarizes recent drugs that target ferroptosis for neurological disease treatment. Furthermore, it compares the differences and relationships among the various cell death mechanisms involved in neurological diseases. Elucidating the ferroptosis role in the brain can improve the understanding of neurological disease mechanism and provide potential prevention and treatment interventions for acute and chronic neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Kingsbury et al. find that prefrontal cortex neurons represent the sex of conspecifics during social interaction. Male animals show stronger encoding of female than male cues, which predicts their behavioral preference toward interaction with females. Activation of sex-encoding cells shapes preference behavior by controlling male- versus female-directed sociality.</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Microchiropterans have a diminutive cerebral cortex, not an enlarged cerebellum, compared to megachiropterans and other mammals&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f33393b0-8816-4e41-af4e-bc090a1089a0/cne24985-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herculano‐Houzel et al. examine numbers of neurons in the brain of 13 bat species and find that the apparently “enlarged” cerebellum of small echolocating bats has the same proportion of brain neurons as other mammals, and is more likely simply the result of a diminutive cerebral cortex.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small echolocating bats are set apart from most other mammals by their relatively large cerebellum, a feature that has been associated to echolocation, as it is presumed to indicate a relatively enlarged number of neurons in the cerebellum in comparison to other brain structures. Here we quantify the neuronal composition of the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and remaining brain structures of 7 species of large Pteropodid bats (formerly classified as megachiropterans), one of which echolocates, and 6 species of small bats (formerly classified as microchiropterans), all of which echolocate. This chiropteran data is compared to 60 mammalian species in our dataset to determine whether the relatively large cerebellum of the small echolocating bats, and possibly that of the echolocating Pteropodid, contains a relatively enlarged number of neurons. We find no evidence that the distribution of neurons differs between microchiropterans and megachiropterans, but our data indicate that microchiropterans, like the smallest shrew in our dataset, have diminutive cerebral cortices, which makes the cerebellum appear relatively large. We propose that, in agreement with the diminutive brain size of the earliest fossil mammals, this is a plesiomorphic, not a derived, feature of microchiropteran brains. The results of this study also reveal important neural characteristics related to the phylogenetic affinities and relationships of the chiropterans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Anticoagulation Timing in Cardioembolic Stroke and Recurrent Event Risk</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25844?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25844?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guidelines recommend to initiate anticoagulation within 4‐14 days after cardioembolic stroke. Data supporting this did not account for key factors potentially affecting the decision to initiate anticoagulation such as infarct size, hemorrhagic transformation, or high risk features on echocardiography.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pooled data from stroke registries of 8 comprehensive stroke centers across the United States. We included consecutive patients admitted with ischemic stroke and atrial fibrillation. The primary predictor was timing of initiating anticoagulation (0‐3 days, 4‐14 days, or &amp;gt;14 days) and outcomes were recurrent stroke/TIA/systemic embolism, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH), and major extracranial hemorrhage (ECH) within 90 days.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among 2084 patients, 1289 met the inclusion criteria. The combined endpoint occurred in 10.1% (n = 130) subjects (87 ischemic events, 20 sICH, and 29 ECH). Overall, there was no significant difference in the composite endpoint between the three groups: 0‐3 days [10.3% (64/617)], 4‐14 days [(9.7%) 52/535)], &amp;gt;14 days [10.2% (14/137), p=0.933]. In adjusted models, patients started on anticoagulation between 4‐14 days did not have a lower rate of sICH (vs. 0‐3 days) (OR 1.49 95% CI 0.50 – 4.43) neither did they have a lower rate of recurrent ischemic events (vs. &amp;gt; 14 days) (OR 0.76 95% CI 0.36 – 1.62, p = 0.482).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this multicenter real world cohort, the recommended (4‐14 days) time frame to start oral anticoagulation was not associated with reduced ischemic and hemorrhagic outcomes. Randomized trials are required to determine the optimal timing of anticoagulation initiation.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Mapping of the excitatory, inhibitory, and modulatory afferent projections to the anatomically defined active expiratory oscillator in adult male rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.24984?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lateral parafacial region (pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;; which encompasses the parafacial respiratory group, pFRG) is a conditional oscillator that drives active expiration during periods of high respiratory demand, and increases ventilation through the recruitment of expiratory muscles. The pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; activity is highly modulated, and systematic analysis of its afferent projections is required to understand its connectivity and modulatory control. We combined a viral retrograde tracing approach to map direct brainstem projections to the putative location of pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, with RNAScope and immunofluorescence to identify the neurochemical phenotype of the projecting neurons. Within the medulla, retrogradely‐labelled, glutamatergic, glycinergic and GABAergic neurons were found in the ventral respiratory column (Bötzinger and preBötzinger Complex [preBötC], ventral respiratory group, ventral parafacial region [pF&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;] and pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;), nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), reticular formation (RF), pontine and midbrain vestibular nuclei, and medullary raphe. In the pons and midbrain, retrogradely‐labelled neurons of the same phenotypes were found in the Kölliker‐Fuse and parabrachial nuclei, periaqueductal grey, pedunculopontine nucleus (PPT) and laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT). We also identified somatostatin‐expressing neurons in the preBötC and PHOX2B immunopositive cells in the pF&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;, NTS and part of the RF. Surprisingly, we found no catecholaminergic neurons in the NTS, A5 or &lt;i&gt;Locus Coeruleus, &lt;/i&gt; no serotoninergic raphe neurons nor any cholinergic neurons in the PPT and LDT that projected to the pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. Our results indicate that pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; neurons receive extensive excitatory and inhibitory inputs from several respiratory and non‐respiratory related brainstem regions that could contribute to the complex modulation of the conditional pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; oscillator for active expiration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Polysialic acid in the rat brainstem and thoracolumbar spinal cord: Distribution, cellular location and comparison with mouse&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/4592190f-6c9c-4a65-a910-a185653c5245/cne24982-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distribution of polysialic acid immunoreactivity in the adult rat brainstem (a) and thoracolumbar spinal cord (b‐e). Discrete neural regions express the glycan, including the NTS, Sp5C, A1 region (a) and dorsal horn and lateral horn (b) where ChAT positive sympathetic preganglionic neurons are often coated with polySia (c‐e).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polysialic acid (polySia), a homopolymer of α2,8‐linked glycans, is a post translational modification on a few glycoproteins, most commonly in the brain, on the neural cell adhesion molecule. Most research in the adult central nervous system has focused on its expression in higher brain regions, where its distribution coincides with regions known to exhibit high levels of synaptic plasticity. In contrast, scant attention has been paid to the expression of polySia in the hindbrain. The main aims of the study were to examine the distribution of polySia immunoreactivity in the brainstem and thoracolumbar spinal cord, to compare the distribution of polySia revealed by two commercial antibodies commonly used for its investigation, and to compare labelling in the rat and mouse. We present a comprehensive atlas of polySia immunoreactivity: we report that polySia labelling is particularly dense in the dorsal tegmentum, medial vestibular nuclei and lateral parabrachial nucleus, and in brainstem regions associated with autonomic function, including the dorsal vagal complex, A5, RVL, A1 and midline raphe, as well as sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord and central targets of primary sensory afferents (nucleus of the solitary tract, spinal trigeminal nucleus, and dorsal horn). Ultrastructural examination showed labelling was present predominantly on the plasma membrane/within the extracellular space/in or on astrocytes. Labelling throughout the brainstem and spinal cord were very similar for the two antibodies and was eliminated by the polySia‐specific sialidase, Endo‐NF. Similar patterns of distribution were found in rat and mouse brainstem with differences evident in dorsal horn.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: The entorhinal cortex of the monkey: VI. Organization of projections from the hippocampus, subiculum, presubiculum and parasubiculum</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The entorhinal cortex of the monkey: VI. Organization of projections from the hippocampus, subiculum, presubiculum and parasubiculum&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b5710ef4-d4ee-4f00-9b2f-117659696bd4/cne24983-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projections from hippocampal fields CA1 and the subiculum to the entorhinal cortex are topographically organized. Projections from the presubiculum preferentially distribute to the caudal half of the entorhinal cortex and thus provides a potential indicator for a primate homologue of the medial entorhinal cortex as defined in rodents.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organization of projections from the macaque monkey hippocampus, subiculum, presubiculum and parasubiculum to the entorhinal cortex was analyzed using anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques. Projections exclusively originate in the CA1 field of the hippocampus and in the subiculum, presubiculum and parasubiculum. The CA1 and subicular projections terminate most densely in layers V and VI of the entorhinal cortex, with sparser innervation of the deep portion of layer III and layer I. Entorhinal projections from CA1 and the subiculum are topographically organized such that a rostrocaudal axis of origin is related to a medial‐to‐lateral axis of termination. A proximodistal axis of origin in CA1 and distoproximal axis in subiculum are related to a rostrocaudal axis of termination in the entorhinal cortex. The presubiculum sends a dense, bilateral projection to caudal parts of the entorhinal cortex. This projection terminates most densely in layer III with sparser termination in layers I, II and V. The same parts of entorhinal cortex receive a dense projection from the parasubiculum. This projection terminates in layers III and II. Both presubicular and parasubicular projections demonstrate the same longitudinal topographic organization as the projections from CA1 and the subiculum. These studies demonstrate that: 1) hippocampal and subicular inputs to the entorhinal cortex in the monkey are organized similar to those described in non‐primate species; 2) the topographic organization of the projections from the hippocampus and subicular areas matches that of the reciprocal projections from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus and the subicular areas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Absence of Subcerebral Projection Neurons Is Beneficial in a Mouse Model of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25833?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25833?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent studies carried out on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients suggest that the disease might initiate in the motor cortex and spread to its targets along the corticofugal tracts. In this study, we aimed to test the corticofugal hypothesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis experimentally.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sod1 &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;G86R &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Fezf2 &lt;/i&gt; knockout mouse lines were crossed to generate a model that expresses a mutant of the murine &lt;i&gt;Sod1 &lt;/i&gt; gene ubiquitously, a condition sufficient to induce progressive motor symptoms and premature death, but genetically lacks corticospinal neurons and other subcerebral projection neurons, one of the main populations of corticofugal neurons. Disease onset and survival were recorded, and weight and motor behavior were followed longitudinally. Hyper‐reflexia and spasticity were monitored using electromyographic recordings. Neurodegeneration and gliosis were assessed by histological techniques.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absence of subcerebral projection neurons delayed disease onset, reduced weight loss and motor impairment, and increased survival without modifying disease duration. Absence of corticospinal neurons also limited presymptomatic hyper‐reflexia, a typical component of the upper motoneuron syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major corticofugal tracts are crucial to the onset and progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In the context of the disease, subcerebral projection neurons might carry detrimental signals to their downstream targets. In its entirety, this study provides the first experimental arguments in favor of the corticofugal hypothesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Reelin activates the small GTPase TC10 and VAMP7 to promote neurite outgrowth and regeneration of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24688?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24688?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Reelin activates the small GTPase TC10 and VAMP7 to promote neurite outgrowth and regeneration of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/483c8343-0984-40b6-b460-cea4777e0c37/jnr24688-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axonal growth is a relevant process for development and regeneration. After peripheral nervous system (PNS) injury, Reelin levels increase, and mice devoid of Reelin show an impairment in nerve regeneration. Here we show, for the first time, that Reelin increases the regenerative outcome of dorsal root ganglia axons after axotomy (a mock, b Reelin treated). (c) After binding to its receptor, Apolipoprotein E‐receptor 2, Reelin activates the Rho GTPases Cdc42 that regulates actin dynamics, and TC10, required for membrane addition by interacting with the exocyst complex. TC10 recruits to membrane vesicles that potentially could come from Golgi and/or recycling endosomes. TC10 vesicles also contain ApoER2 and the v‐SNARE protein VAMP7. Reelin increases the fusion of vesicles, containing VAMP7, at the growth cone. Therefore, Reelin signaling could have a therapeutic role in PNS lesions, improving axonal outgrowth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axonal outgrowth is a fundamental process during the development of central (CNS) and peripheral (PNS) nervous system as well as in nerve regeneration and requires accurate axonal navigation and extension to the correct target. These events need proper coordination between membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal rearrangements and are under the control of the small GTPases of the Rho family, among other molecules. Reelin, a relevant protein for CNS development and synaptic function in the adult, is also present in the PNS. Upon sciatic nerve damage, Reelin expression increases and, on the other hand, mice deficient in Reelin exhibit an impaired nerve regeneration. However, the mechanism(s) involved the Reelin‐dependent axonal growth is still poorly understood. In this work, we present evidence showing that Reelin stimulates dorsal root ganglia (DRG) regeneration after axotomy. Moreover, dissociated DRG neurons express the Reelin receptor Apolipoprotein E‐receptor 2 and also require the presence of TC10 to develop their axons. TC10 is a Rho GTPase that promotes neurite outgrowth through the exocytic fusion of vesicles at the growth cone. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that Reelin controls TC10 activation in DRG neurons. Besides, we confirmed that the known CNS Reelin target Cdc42 is also activated in DRG and controls TC10 activity. Finally, in the process of membrane addition, we found that Reelin stimulates the fusion of membrane carriers containing the v‐SNARE protein VAMP7 in vesicles that contain TC10. Altogether, our work shows a new role of Reelin in PNS, opening the option of therapeutic interventions to improve the regeneration process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: NMDAR Antibodies Alter Dopamine Receptors and Cause Psychotic Behavior in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25829?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25829?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim was to demonstrate that antibodies from patients with anti‐&lt;i&gt;N &lt;/i&gt;‐methyl‐&lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;d &lt;/span&gt;‐aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis alter the levels of dopamine 1 receptor (D1R) and dopamine 2 receptor (D2R) and cause psychotic‐like features in mice.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cultured rat hippocampal neurons were treated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis or controls, and the effects on clusters of D1R and D2R were quantified. In vivo studies included 71 C57BL/6J mice that were chronically infused with CSF from patients or controls through ventricular catheters connected to subcutaneous osmotic pumps. Prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startling reflex (PPI; a marker of psychotic‐like behavior), memory, locomotor activity, and the density of cell‐surface and synaptic D1R, D2R, and NMDAR clusters were examined at different time points using reported techniques.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cultured neurons, CSF from patients, but not from controls, caused a significant decrease of cell‐surface D1R and an increase of D2R clusters. In mice, CSF from patients caused a significant decrease of synaptic and total cell‐surface D1R clusters and an increase of D2R clusters associated with a decrease of PPI. These effects were accompanied by memory impairment and a reduction of surface NMDARs, as reported in this model. The psychotic‐like features, memory impairment, and changes in levels of D1R, D2R, and NMDAR progressively improved several days after the infusion of CSF from patients stopped.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to memory deficits and reduction of NMDARs, CSF antibodies from patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis cause reversible psychotic‐like features accompanied by changes (D1R decrease, D2R increase) in cell‐surface dopamine receptor clusters. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Unravelling the γ-butyrolactone network in &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces coelicolor&lt;/i&gt; by computational ensemble modelling</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Areti Tsigkinopoulou, Eriko Takano, Rainer Breitling&lt;/p&gt;

Antibiotic production is coordinated in the &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces coelicolor&lt;/i&gt; population through the use of diffusible signaling molecules of the γ-butyrolactone (GBL) family. The GBL regulatory system involves a small, and not completely defined two-gene network which governs a potentially bi-stable switch between the “on” and “off” states of antibiotic production. The use of this circuit as a tool for synthetic biology has been hampered by a lack of mechanistic understanding of its functionality. We hereby present the creation and analysis of a versatile and adaptable ensemble model of the &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; GBL system (detailed information on all model mechanisms and parameters is documented in http://www.systemsbiology.ls.manchester.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/Main_Page). We use the model to explore a range of previously proposed mechanistic hypotheses, including transcriptional interference, antisense RNA interactions between the mRNAs of the two genes, and various alternative regulatory activities. Our results suggest that transcriptional interference alone is not sufficient to explain the system’s behavior. Instead, antisense RNA interactions seem to be the system's driving force, combined with an aggressive &lt;i&gt;scbR&lt;/i&gt; promoter. The computational model can be used to further challenge and refine our understanding of the system’s activity and guide future experimentation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vQcdHwJpGWc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The importance of mRNA translation models has been demonstrated across many fields of science and biotechnology. However, a whole cell model with codon resolution and biophysical dynamics is still lacking. We describe a whole cell model of translation for &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt;. The model simulates all major translation components in the cell: ribosomes, mRNAs and tRNAs. It also includes, for the first time, fundamental aspects of translation, such as competition for ribosomes and tRNAs at a codon resolution while considering tRNAs wobble interactions and tRNA recycling. The model uses parameters that are tightly inferred from large scale measurements of translation. Furthermore, we demonstrate a robust modelling approach which relies on state-of-the-art practices of translation modelling and also provides a framework for easy generalizations. This novel approach allows simulation of thousands of mRNAs that undergo translation in the same cell with common resources such as ribosomes and tRNAs in feasible time. Based on this model, we demonstrate, for the first time, the direct importance of competition for resources on translation and its accurate modelling. An effective supply-demand ratio (ESDR) measure, which is related to translation factors such as tRNAs, has been devised and utilized to show superior predictive power in complex scenarios of heterologous gene expression. The devised model is not only more accurate than the existing models, but, more importantly, provides a framework for analyzing complex whole cell translation problems and variables that haven't been explored before, making it important in various biomedical fields.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XlLFYvqkEAQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: The interplay between somatic and dendritic inhibition promotes the emergence and stabilization of place fields</title>

During the exploration of novel environments, place fields are rapidly formed in hippocampal CA1 neurons. Place cell firing rate increases in early stages of exploration of novel environments but returns to baseline levels in familiar environments. Although similar in amplitude and width, place fields in familiar environments are more stable than in novel environments. We propose a computational model of the hippocampal CA1 network, which describes the formation, dynamics and stabilization of place fields. We show that although somatic disinhibition is sufficient to form place fields, dendritic inhibition along with synaptic plasticity is necessary for place field stabilization. Our model suggests that place cell stability can be attributed to strong excitatory synaptic weights and strong dendritic inhibition. We show that the interplay between somatic and dendritic inhibition balances the increased excitatory weights, such that place cells return to their baseline firing rate after exploration. Our model suggests that different types of interneurons are essential to unravel the mechanisms underlying place field plasticity. Finally, we predict that artificially induced dendritic events can shift place fields even after place field stabilization.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/riZBHO8GGwk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

High-throughput sequencing of human immunoglobulin genes allows analysis of antibody repertoires and the reconstruction of clonal lineage evolution. The study of antibodies (Abs) affinity maturation is of specific interest to understand the generation of Abs with high affinity or broadly neutralizing activities. Moreover, phylogenic analysis enables the identification of the key somatic mutations required to achieve optimal antigen binding. The Immcantation framework provides a start-to-finish set of analytical methods for high-throughput adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-Seq; Rep-Seq) data. Furthermore, Immcantation’s Change-O package has developed IgPhyML, an algorithm designed to build specifically immunoglobulin (Ig) phylogenic trees. Meanwhile Phylip, an algorithm that has been originally developed for applications in ecology and macroevolution, can also be used for the phylogenic reconstruction of antibodies maturation pathway. To complement Ig lineages made by IgPhyML or Dnaml (Phylip), we developed AncesTree, a graphic user interface (GUI) that aims to give researchers the opportunity to interactively explore antibodies clonal evolution. AncesTree displays interactive immunoglobulins phylogenic tree, Ig related mutations and sequence alignments using additional information coming from specialized antibody tools. The GUI is a Java standalone application allowing interaction with Ig tree that can run under Windows, Linux and Mac OS.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6Irkwzuv4fQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: A single touch can provide sufficient mechanical stimulation to trigger Venus flytrap closure</title>

The carnivorous Venus flytrap catches prey by an ingenious snapping mechanism. Based on work over nearly 200 years, it has become generally accepted that two touches of the trap’s sensory hairs within 30 s, each one generating an action potential, are required to trigger closure of the trap. We developed an electromechanical model, which, however, suggests that under certain circumstances one touch is sufficient to generate two action potentials. Using a force-sensing microrobotic system, we precisely quantified the sensory-hair deflection parameters necessary to trigger trap closure and correlated them with the elicited action potentials in vivo. Our results confirm the model’s predictions, suggesting that the Venus flytrap may be adapted to a wider range of prey movements than previously assumed.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/a8JG4sFhJUg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Rest-task modulation of fMRI-derived global signal topography is mediated by transient coactivation patterns</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000733</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/KpYFzcwnd0Q/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jianfeng Zhang, Zirui Huang, Shankar Tumati, Georg Northoff&lt;/p&gt;

Recent resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) studies have revealed that the global signal (GS) exhibits a nonuniform spatial distribution across the gray matter. Whether this topography is informative remains largely unknown. We therefore tested rest-task modulation of GS topography by analyzing static GS correlation and dynamic coactivation patterns in a large sample of an fMRI dataset (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 837) from the Human Connectome Project. The GS topography in the resting state and in seven different tasks was first measured by correlating the GS with the local time series (GSCORR). In the resting state, high GSCORR was observed mainly in the primary sensory and motor regions, whereas low GSCORR was seen in the association brain areas. This pattern changed during the seven tasks, with mainly decreased GSCORR in sensorimotor cortex. Importantly, this rest-task modulation of GSCORR could be traced to transient coactivation patterns at the peak period of GS (GS-peak). By comparing the topography of GSCORR and respiration effects, we observed that the topography of respiration mimicked the topography of GS in the resting state, whereas both differed during the task states; because of such partial dissociation, we assume that GSCORR could not be equated with a respiration effect. Finally, rest-task modulation of GS topography could not be exclusively explained by other sources of physiological noise. Together, we here demonstrate the informative nature of GS topography by showing its rest-task modulation, the underlying dynamic coactivation patterns, and its partial dissociation from respiration effects during task states.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/KpYFzcwnd0Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Bidirectional Dysregulation of AMPA Receptor-Mediated Synaptic Transmission and Plasticity in Brain Disorders</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are glutamate-gated ion channels that mediate the majority of fast excitatory synaptic transmission throughout the brain. Changes in the properties and postsynaptic abundance of AMPARs are pivotal mechanisms in synaptic plasticity, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission. A wide range of neurodegenerative, neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, despite their extremely diverse etiology, pathogenesis and symptoms, exhibit brain region-specific and AMPAR subunit-specific aberrations in synaptic transmission or plasticity. These include abnormally enhanced or reduced AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission or plasticity. Bidirectional reversal of these changes by targeting AMPAR subunits or trafficking ameliorates drug-seeking behavior, chronic pain, epileptic seizures, or cognitive deficits. This indicates that bidirectional dysregulation of AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission or plasticity may contribute to the expression of many brain disorders and therefore serve as a therapeutic target. Here, we provide a synopsis of bidirectional AMPAR dysregulation in animal models of brain disorders and review the preclinical evidence on the therapeutic targeting of AMPARs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;While non-invasive brain imaging has made substantial contributions to advance human brain science, estimation of individual state is becoming important to realize its applications in society. Brain activations were used to classify second-language proficiencies. Participants in functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) experiment were 20/20 native Japanese speakers with high/low English abilities and 19/19 native English speakers with high/low Japanese abilities. Their cortical activities were measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy while they were conducting Japanese/English listening comprehension tests. The data-driven method achieved classification accuracy of 77.5% in the case of Japanese speakers and 81.9% in the case of English speakers. The informative features predominantly originated from regions associated with language function. These results bring an insight of fNIRS neuroscience and its applications in society.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Relational Memory at Short and Long Delays in Individuals With Moderate-Severe Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00270</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Memory deficits are a common and frequently-cited consequence of moderate-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, we know less about how TBI influences relational memory, which allows the binding of the arbitrary elements of experience and the flexible use and recombination of relational representations in novel situations. Relational memory is of special interest for individuals with TBI, given the vulnerability of the hippocampus to injury mechanisms, as well as a growing body of literature establishing the role of relational memory in flexible and goal-directed behavior. In this study, participants with and without a history of moderate-severe TBI completed a continuous relational memory task for face-scene pairings. Participants with TBI exhibited a disruption in relational memory not only when tested after a delay, but also when tested with no experimenter-imposed delay after stimulus presentation. Further, canonical assessments of working and episodic memory did not correspond with performance on the face-scene task, suggesting that this task may tap into relational memory differently and with greater sensitivity than standardized memory assessments. These results highlight the need for rigorous assessment of relational memory in TBI, which is likely to detect deficits that have specific consequences for community reintegration and long-term functional outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Semantic Processing in Autism Spectrum Disorders Is Associated With the Timing of Language Acquisition: A Magnetoencephalographic Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00267</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00267</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Individuals with autism show difficulties in using sentence context to identify the correct meaning of ambiguous words, such as homonyms. In this study, the brain basis of sentence context effects on word understanding during reading was examined in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and typical development (TD) using magnetoencephalography. The correlates of a history of developmental language delay in ASD were also investigated. Event related field responses at early (150 ms after the onset of a final word) and N400 latencies are reported for three different types of sentence final words: dominant homonyms, subordinate homonyms, and unambiguous words. Clear evidence for semantic access was found at both early and conventional N400 latencies in both TD participants and individuals with ASD with no history of language delay. By contrast, modulation of evoked activity related to semantic access was weak and not significant at early latencies in individuals with ASD with a history of language delay. The reduced sensitivity to semantic context in individuals with ASD and language delay was accompanied by strong right hemisphere lateralization at early and N400 latencies; such strong activity was not observed in TD individuals and individuals with ASD without a history of language delay at either latency. These results provide new evidence and support for differential neural mechanisms underlying semantic processing in ASD, and indicate that delayed language acquisition in ASD is associated with different lateralization and processing of language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Wheelchair Control in a Virtual Environment by Healthy Participants Using a P300-BCI Based on Tactile Stimulation: Training Effects and Usability</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00265</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Tactile stimulation is less frequently used than visual for brain-computer interface (BCI) control, partly because of limitations in speed and accuracy. Non-visual BCI paradigms, however, may be required for patients who struggle with vision dependent BCIs because of a loss of gaze control. With the present study, we attempted to replicate earlier results by Herweg et al. (2016), with several minor adjustments and a focus on training effects and usability. We invited 16 healthy participants and trained them with a 4-class tactile P300-based BCI in five sessions. Their main task was to navigate a virtual wheelchair through a 3D apartment using the BCI. We found significant training effects on information transfer rate (ITR), which increased from a mean of 3.10–9.50 bits/min. Further, both online and offline accuracies significantly increased with training from 65% to 86% and 70% to 95%, respectively. We found only a descriptive increase of P300 amplitudes at Fz and Cz with training. Furthermore, we report subjective data from questionnaires, which indicated a relatively high workload and moderate to high satisfaction. Although our participants have not achieved the same high performance as in the Herweg et al. (2016) study, we provide evidence for training effects on performance with a tactile BCI and confirm the feasibility of the paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Frequency-Dependent Interictal Neuromagnetic Activities in Children With Benign Epilepsy With Centrotemporal Spikes: A Magnetoencephalography (MEG) Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00264</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00264</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: This study aimed to investigate interictal neuromagnetic activities in the low- to high-frequency ranges in patients with benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS), especially those without interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We studied 21 clinically-diagnosed BECTS patients and 11 age-matched healthy controls (HC) using high-sampling magnetoencephalography (MEG). Neuromagnetic sources were assessed with accumulated source imaging (ASI). The MEG data were analyzed in seven frequency bands. The MEG recordings distinguished BECTS without IEDs (n = 10) from those with IEDs (n = 11) and HC (n = 11).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: At 1–4 Hz, the neuromagnetic activities in healthy subjects tended to locate at the precuneus/posterior cingulate, while those of the BECTS patients without IEDs tended to locate at the medial frontal cortex (MFC) compared to BECTS patients with IEDs. The MEG source imaging at 30–80 Hz revealed that BECTS patients without IEDs had higher occurrences of interictal brain activity in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) compared to controls and the brain activity strength seemed to be weaker. There was a significant correlation between the source strength of the interictal gamma oscillations of BECTS patients without IEDs and the duration of epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: IEDs might disrupt the default mode network (DMN). Aberrant brain activities in BECTS patients without IEDs were associated with cognitive areas of the brain. The strength of gamma oscillations in the chronic epilepsy state reflected the duration of BECTS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significance: MEG could reveal the aberrant neural activities in BECTS patients during the interictal period, and such abnormality is frequency-dependent. Gamma oscillations could be used to identify BECTS patients without IEDs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: An Unusual, Intermediate-Sized Lesion Affecting Motor Organization in a Patient With Schizencephaly: A Case Report</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Schizencephalies are abnormal clefts of the cerebral hemispheres that result from abnormal late neuronal migration and cortical organization. In the present study, we report a different type of unusual motor organization in a patient with a schizencephalic cleft in the right hemisphere and polymicrogyria in the opposite hemisphere. Despite similar brain pathology affecting the sensorimotor cortex, motor organization differed from previously known bilateral congenital brain lesions. We conducted a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and diffusion tensor image (DTI) study to confirm the motor organization. In this case, ipsilateral corticospinal projections to the paretic hands were observed during TMS of the less affected hemisphere, along with polymicrogyria, similar to the previous study. However, a crossed corticospinal tract to the paretic hand from the more severely affected hemisphere was observed in this case-a pattern of motor organization that has yet to be reported in this patient population. Our findings indicate that motor organization after early brain injury may be affected by the interhemispheric competition of the corticospinal system and bilateral brain lesions, thereby resulting in unilateral hemiparesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Do Muscle Synergies Improve Optimization Prediction of Muscle Activations During Gait?</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Determination of muscle forces during motion can help to understand motor control, assess pathological movement, diagnose neuromuscular disorders, or estimate joint loads. Difficulty of in vivo measurement made computational analysis become a common alternative in which, as several muscles serve each degree of freedom, the muscle redundancy problem must be solved. Unlike static optimization (SO), synergy optimization (SynO) couples muscle activations across all time frames, thereby altering estimated muscle co-contraction. This study explores whether the use of a muscle synergy structure within an SO framework improves prediction of muscle activations during walking. A motion/force/electromyography (EMG) gait analysis was performed on five healthy subjects. A musculoskeletal model of the right leg actuated by 43 Hill-type muscles was scaled to each subject and used to calculate joint moments, muscle–tendon kinematics, and moment arms. Muscle activations were then estimated using SynO with two to six synergies and traditional SO, and these estimates were compared with EMG measurements. Synergy optimization neither improved SO prediction of experimental activation patterns nor provided SO exact matching of joint moments. Finally, synergy analysis was performed on SO estimated activations, being found that the reconstructed activations produced poor matching of experimental activations and joint moments. As conclusion, it can be said that, although SynO did not improve prediction of muscle activations during gait, its reduced dimensional control space could be beneficial for applications such as functional electrical stimulation or motion control and prediction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Electrical excitation of neural tissue has wide applications, but how electrical stimulation interacts with neural tissue remains to be elucidated. Here, we propose a new theory, named the Circuit-Probability theory, to reveal how this physical interaction happen. The relation between the electrical stimulation input and the neural response can be theoretically calculated. We show that many empirical models, including strength-duration relationship and linear-non-linear-Poisson model, can be theoretically explained, derived, and amended using our theory. Furthermore, this theory can explain the complex non-linear and resonant phenomena and fit in vivo experiment data. In this letter, we validated an entirely new framework to study electrical stimulation on neural tissue, which is to simulate voltage waveforms using a parallel RLC circuit first, and then calculate the excitation probability stochastically.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ischemic brain injuries are common diseases with high morbidity, disability, and mortality rates, which have significant impacts on human health and life. Microglia are resident cells of the central nervous system (CNS). The inflammatory responses mediated by microglia play an important role in the occurrence and development of ischemic brain injuries. This article summarizes the activation, polarization, depletion, and repopulation of microglia after ischemic brain injuries, proposing new treatment strategies for such injuries through the modulation of microglial function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Mouse Astrocytes Promote Microglial Ramification by Releasing TGF-β and Forming Glial Fibers</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00195</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00195</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The morphology of microglial cells is often closely related to their functions. The mechanisms that regulate microglial ramification are not well understood. Here we reveal the biological mechanisms by which astrocytes regulate microglial ramification. Morphological variation in mouse microglial cultures was measured in terms of cell area as well as branch number and length. Effects on microglial ramification were analyzed after microinjecting the toxin L-alpha-aminoadipic acid (L-AAA) in the mouse cortex or hippocampus to ablate astrocytes, and after culturing microglia on their own in an astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) or together with astrocytes in coculture. TGF-β expression was determined by Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and ELISA. The TGF-β signaling pathway was blocked by the TGF-β antibody to assess the role of TGF-β on microglial ramification. The results showed that microglia had more and longer branches and smaller cell bodies in brain areas where astrocytes were abundant. In the mouse cortex and hippocampus, ablation of astrocytes by L-AAA decreased number and length of microglial branches and increased the size of cell bodies. Similar results were obtained with isolated microglia in culture. However, isolated microglia were able to maintain their multibranched structure for a long time when cultured on astrocyte monolayers. Ameboid microglia isolated from P0 to P3 mice showed increased ramification when cultured in ACM or on astrocyte monolayers. Microglia cultured on astrocyte monolayers showed more complex branching structures than those cultured in ACM. Blocking astrocyte-derived TGF-β decreased microglial ramification. Astrocytes induced the formation of protuberances on branches of microglia by forming glial fibers that increased traction. These experiments in mice suggest that astrocytes promote microglial ramification by forming glial fibers to create traction and by secreting soluble factors into the surroundings. For example, astrocyte-secreted TGF-β promotes microglia to generate primitive branches, whose ramification is refined by glial fibers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Whole-Cell Photobleaching Reveals Time-Dependent Compartmentalization of Soluble Proteins by the Axon Initial Segment</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00180</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00180</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;By limiting protein exchange between the soma and the axon, the axon initial segment (AIS) enables the segregation of specific proteins and hence the differentiation of the somatodendritic compartment and the axonal compartment. Electron microscopy and super-resolution fluorescence imaging have provided important insights in the ultrastructure of the AIS. Yet, the full extent of its filtering properties is not fully delineated. In particular, it is unclear whether and how the AIS opposes the free exchange of soluble proteins. Here we describe a robust framework to combine whole-cell photobleaching and retrospective high-resolution imaging in developing neurons. With this assay, we found that cytoplasmic soluble proteins that are not excluded from the axon upon expression over tens of hours exhibit a strong mobility reduction at the AIS – i.e., are indeed compartmentalized – when monitored over tens of minutes. This form of compartmentalization is developmentally regulated, requires intact F-actin and may be correlated with the composition and ultrastructure of the submembranous spectrin cytoskeleton. Using computational modeling, we provide evidence that both neuronal morphology and the AIS regulate this compartmentalization but act on distinct time scales, with the AIS having a more pronounced effect on fast exchanges. Our results thus suggest that the rate of protein accumulation in the soma may impact to what extent and over which timescales freely moving molecules can be segregated from the axon. This in turn has important implications for our understanding of compartment-specific signaling in neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: COX5A Plays a Vital Role in Memory Impairment Associated With Brain Aging via the BDNF/ERK1/2 Signaling Pathway</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00215</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cytochrome c oxidase subunit Va (COX5A) is involved in maintaining normal mitochondrial function. However, little is known on the role of COX5A in the development and progress of Alzheimer’s disease (Martinez-Losa et al., 2018). In this study, we established and characterized the genomic profiles of genes expressed in the hippocampus of Senescence-Accelerated Mouse-prone 8 (SAMP8) mice, and revealed differential expression of COX5A among 12-month-aged SAMP8 mice and 2-month-aged SAMP8 mice. Newly established transgenic mice with systemic COX5A overexpression (51% increase) resulted in the improvement of spatial recognition memory and hippocampal synaptic plasticity, recovery of hippocampal CA1 dendrites, and activation of the BDNF/ERK1/2 signaling pathway in vivo. Moreover, mice with both COX5A overexpression and BDNF knockdown showed a poor recovery in spatial recognition memory as well as a decrease in spine density and branching of dendrites in CA1, when compared to mice that only overexpressed COX5A. In vitro studies supported that COX5A affected neuronal growth via BDNF. In summary, this study was the first to show that COX5A in the hippocampus plays a vital role in aging-related cognitive deterioration via BDNF/ERK1/2 regulation, and suggested that COX5A may be a potential target for anti-senescence drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Individuals in low socioeconomic brackets are considered at-risk for developing influenza-related complications and often exhibit higher than average influenza-related hospitalization rates. This disparity has been attributed to various factors, including restricted access to preventative and therapeutic health care, limited sick leave, and household structure. Adequate influenza surveillance in these at-risk populations is a critical precursor to accurate risk assessments and effective intervention. However, the United States of America’s primary national influenza surveillance system (ILINet) monitors outpatient healthcare providers, which may be largely inaccessible to lower socioeconomic populations. Recent initiatives to incorporate Internet-source and hospital electronic medical records data into surveillance systems seek to improve the timeliness, coverage, and accuracy of outbreak detection and situational awareness. Here, we use a flexible statistical framework for integrating multiple surveillance data sources to evaluate the adequacy of traditional (ILINet) and next generation (BioSense 2.0 and Google Flu Trends) data for situational awareness of influenza across poverty levels. We find that ZIP Codes in the highest poverty quartile are a critical vulnerability for ILINet that the integration of next generation data fails to ameliorate.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TufeTsxwbfw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Network-based intervention strategies can be effective and cost-efficient approaches to curtailing harmful contagions in myriad settings. As studied, these strategies are often impractical to implement, as they typically assume complete knowledge of the network structure, which is unusual in practice. In this paper, we investigate how different immunization strategies perform under realistic conditions—where the strategies are informed by partially-observed network data. Our results suggest that global immunization strategies, like degree immunization, are optimal in most cases; the exception is at very high levels of missing data, where stochastic strategies, like acquaintance immunization, begin to outstrip them in minimizing outbreaks. Stochastic strategies are more robust in some cases due to the different ways in which they can be affected by missing data. In fact, one of our proposed variants of acquaintance immunization leverages a logistically-realistic ongoing survey-intervention process as a form of targeted data-recovery to improve with increasing levels of missing data. These results support the effectiveness of targeted immunization as a general practice. They also highlight the risks of considering networks as idealized mathematical objects: overestimating the accuracy of network data and foregoing the rewards of additional inquiry.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lFc02eNMJ-g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Kindlin-1, -2, and -3 directly bind integrin β cytoplasmic tails to regulate integrin activation and signaling. Despite their functional significance and links to several diseases, structural information on full-length kindlin proteins remains unknown. Here, we report the crystal structure of human full-length kindlin-3, which reveals a novel homotrimer state. Unlike kindlin-3 monomer, which is the major population in insect and mammalian cell expression systems, kindlin-3 trimer does not bind integrin β cytoplasmic tail as the integrin-binding pocket in the F3 subdomain of 1 protomer is occluded by the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of another protomer, suggesting that kindlin-3 is auto-inhibited upon trimer formation. This is also supported by functional assays in which kindlin-3 knockout K562 erythroleukemia cells reconstituted with the mutant kindlin-3 containing trimer-disrupting mutations exhibited an increase in integrin-mediated adhesion and spreading on fibronectin compared with those reconstituted with wild-type kindlin-3. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel mechanism of kindlin auto-inhibition that involves its homotrimer formation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/_wp-lAqDT68&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

CRISPR-&lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; Cas9 (CRISPR-SaCas9) has been harnessed as an effective in vivo genome-editing tool to manipulate genomes. However, off-target effects remain a major bottleneck that precludes safe and reliable applications in genome editing. Here, we characterize the off-target effects of wild-type (WT) SaCas9 at single-nucleotide (single-nt) resolution and describe a directional screening system to identify novel SaCas9 variants with desired properties in human cells. Using this system, we identified enhanced-fidelity SaCas9 (efSaCas9) (variant Mut268 harboring the single mutation of N260D), which could effectively distinguish and reject single base-pair mismatches. We demonstrate dramatically reduced off-target effects (approximately 2- to 93-fold improvements) of Mut268 compared to WT using targeted deep-sequencing analyses. To understand the structural origin of the fidelity enhancement, we find that N260, located in the REC3 domain, orchestrates an extensive network of contacts between REC3 and the guide RNA-DNA heteroduplex. efSaCas9 can be broadly used in genome-editing applications that require high fidelity. Furthermore, this study provides a general strategy to rapidly evolve other desired CRISPR-Cas9 traits besides enhanced fidelity, to expand the utility of the CRISPR toolkit.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/7DlnCXht8Ac&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Therapeutic applications of chelating drugs in iron metabolic disorders of the brain and retina</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron is essential for normal cellular function, however, excessive accumulation of iron in neural tissue has been implicated in both cortical and retinal diseases. The exact role of iron in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders remains incompletely understood. However, iron‐induced damage to the brain and retina is often attributed to the redox ability of iron to generate dangerous free radicals, which exacerbates local oxidative stress and neuronal damage. Iron chelators are compounds designed to scavenge labile iron, aiding to regulate iron bioavailability. Recently there has been growing interest in the application of chelating agents for treatment of diseases including neurodegenerative conditions, characterized by increased oxidative stress. This article reviews both clinical and preclinical evidence relating to the effectiveness of iron chelation therapy in conditions of iron dyshomeostasis linked to neurodegeneration in the brain and retina. The limitations as well as future opportunities iron chelation therapy are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: SCN3A‐Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder: A Spectrum of Epilepsy and Brain Malformation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25809?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25809?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pathogenic variants in &lt;i&gt;SCN3A &lt;/i&gt;, encoding the voltage‐gated sodium channel subunit Nav1.3, cause severe childhood onset epilepsy and malformation of cortical development. Here, we define the spectrum of clinical, genetic, and neuroimaging features of &lt;i&gt;SCN3A &lt;/i&gt;‐related neurodevelopmental disorder.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients were ascertained via an international collaborative network. We compared sodium channels containing wild‐type versus variant Nav1.3 subunits coexpressed with β1 and β2 subunits using whole‐cell voltage clamp electrophysiological recordings in a heterologous mammalian system (HEK‐293T cells).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 22 patients with pathogenic &lt;i&gt;SCN3A &lt;/i&gt; variants, most had treatment‐resistant epilepsy beginning in the first year of life (16/21, 76%; median onset, 2 weeks), with severe or profound developmental delay (15/20, 75%). Many, but not all (15/19, 79%), exhibited malformations of cortical development. Pathogenic variants clustered in transmembrane segments 4 to 6 of domains II to IV. Most pathogenic missense variants tested (10/11, 91%) displayed gain of channel function, with increased persistent current and/or a leftward shift in the voltage dependence of activation, and all variants associated with malformation of cortical development exhibited gain of channel function. One variant (p.Ile1468Arg) exhibited mixed effects, with gain and partial loss of function. Two variants demonstrated loss of channel function.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study defines &lt;i&gt;SCN3A‐ &lt;/i&gt;related neurodevelopmental disorder along a spectrum of severity, but typically including epilepsy and severe or profound developmental delay/intellectual disability. Malformations of cortical development are a characteristic feature of this unusual channelopathy syndrome, present in &amp;gt;75% of affected individuals. Gain of function at the channel level in developing neurons is likely an important mechanism of disease pathogenesis. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: The CSF Profile Linked to Cortical Damage Predicts Multiple Sclerosis Activity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25786?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intrathecal inflammation correlates with the grey matter damage since the early stages of multiple sclerosis (MS), but whether the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile can help to identify patients at risk of disease activity is still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We evaluated the association between CSF levels of 18 cytokines, previously found to be associated to grey matter damage, and the disease activity, among 99 patients with relapsing‐remitting MS, who underwent blinded clinical and 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluations for 4 years. Groups with evidence of disease activity (EDA) or no evidence of disease activity (NEDA; occurrence of relapses, new white matter lesions, and Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] change) were identified. Cortical lesions and the annualized cortical thinning were also evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forty‐one patients experienced EDA and, compared to the NEDA group, had at diagnosis higher CSF levels of CXCL13, CXCL12, IFNγ, TNF, sCD163, LIGHT, and APRIL (&lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, CXCL13 (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.35; &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.0002), LIGHT (HR = 1.22; &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.005) and APRIL (HR = 1.78; &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.0001) were the CSF molecules more strongly associated with the risk of EDA. The model, including CSF variables, predicted more accurately the occurrence of disease activity than the model with only clinical/MRI parameters (C‐index at 4 years = 71% vs 44%). Finally, higher CSF levels of CXCL13 (β = 4.7*10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;; &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), TNF (β = 3.1*10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;; &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.004), LIGHT (β = 2.6*10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;; &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.003), sCD163 (β = 4.3*10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;; &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.009), and TWEAK (β = 3.4*10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;; &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.024) were associated with more severe cortical thinning.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A specific CSF profile, mainly characterized by elevated levels of B‐cell related cytokines, distinguishes patients at high risk of disease activity and severe cortical damage. The CSF analysis may allow stratifications of patients at diagnosis for optimizing therapeutic approaches. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In March 2020, we treated a cohort of 26 critically ill hospitalized SARS‐CoV‐2–infected patients who underwent electroencephalography to assess unexplained altered mental status, loss of consciousness, or poor arousal and responsiveness. Of the 26 patients studied, 5 patients had electroencephalograms that showed periodic discharges consisting of high‐amplitude frontal monomorphic delta waves with absence of epileptic activity. These findings may suggest central nervous system injury potentially related to COVID‐19 in these patients. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Vision therapy in the form of ocular motor training is increasingly used to treat visual complaints, particularly in the setting of persistent symptoms after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). In this review, we discuss the rationale behind this intervention and the evidence for its utility. Although the efficacy of exercises for primary convergence insufficiency is plausible and supported by data, there is not yet strong evidence of benefit for the post‐traumatic variant. It is not established that abnormalities in fixation, pursuit, and saccades in mTBI are the cause of post‐concussive symptoms, or that these abnormalities arise from ocular motor damage rather than being secondary effects of cognitive problems with attention or executive control. The few studies to date have significant methodological weaknesses. More substantial evidence is required before vision therapy can be accepted as a useful tool in the rehabilitation of patients with brain trauma. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Development and Validation of Forecasting Next Reported Seizure Using e‐Diaries</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25812?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25812?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no validated methods for predicting the timing of seizures. Using machine learning, we sought to forecast 24‐hour risk of self‐reported seizure from e‐diaries.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data from 5,419 patients on &lt;a href=&quot;http://SeizureTracker.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;SeizureTracker.com&lt;/a&gt; (including seizure count, type, and duration) were split into training (3,806 patients/1,665,215 patient‐days) and testing (1,613 patients/549,588 patient‐days) sets with no overlapping patients. An artificial intelligence (AI) program, consisting of recurrent networks followed by a multilayer perceptron (“deep learning” model), was trained to produce risk forecasts. Forecasts were made from a sliding window of 3‐month diary history for each day of each patient's diary. After training, the model parameters were held constant and the testing set was scored. A rate‐matched random (RMR) forecast was compared to the AI. Comparisons were made using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), a measure of binary discrimination performance, and the Brier score, a measure of forecast calibration. The Brier skill score (BSS) measured the improvement of the AI Brier score compared to the benchmark RMR Brier score. Confidence intervals (CIs) on performance statistics were obtained via bootstrapping.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AUC was 0.86 (95% CI = 0.85–0.88) for AI and 0.83 (95% CI = 0.81–0.85) for RMR, favoring AI (&lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Overall (all patients combined), BSS was 0.27 (95% CI = 0.23–0.31), also favoring AI (&lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AI produced a valid forecast superior to a chance forecaster, and provided meaningful forecasts in the majority of patients. Future studies will be needed to quantify the clinical value of these forecasts for patients. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Neur1 and Neur2 are required for hippocampus‐dependent spatial memory and synaptic plasticity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23247?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23247?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Neur1 &lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Neur2 &lt;/i&gt;, mouse homologs of the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila neur &lt;/i&gt; gene, consist of two neuralized homology repeat domains and a RING domain. Both &lt;i&gt;Neur1 &lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Neur2 &lt;/i&gt; are expressed in the whole adult brain and encode E3 ubiquitin ligases, which play a crucial role in the Notch signaling pathways. A previous study reported that overexpression of &lt;i&gt;Neur1 &lt;/i&gt; enhances hippocampus‐dependent memory, whereas the role of &lt;i&gt;Neur2 &lt;/i&gt; remains largely unknown. Here, we aimed to elucidate the respective roles of &lt;i&gt;Neur1 &lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Neur2 &lt;/i&gt; in hippocampus‐dependent memory using three lines of genetically modified mice: &lt;i&gt;Neur1 &lt;/i&gt; knock‐out, &lt;i&gt;Neur2 &lt;/i&gt; knock‐out, and &lt;i&gt;Neur1 &lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Neur2 &lt;/i&gt; double knock‐out (D‐KO). Our results showed that spatial memory was impaired when both &lt;i&gt;Neur1 &lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Neur2 &lt;/i&gt; were deleted, but not in the individual knock‐out of either &lt;i&gt;Neur1 &lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Neur2 &lt;/i&gt;. In addition, basal synaptic properties estimated by input–output relationships and paired‐pulse facilitation did not change, but a form of long‐term potentiation that requires protein synthesis was specifically impaired in the D‐KO mice. These results collectively suggest that &lt;i&gt;Neur1 &lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Neur2 &lt;/i&gt; are crucially involved in hippocampus‐dependent spatial memory and synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Degron capability of the hydrophobic C‐terminus of the polyglutamine disease protein, ataxin‐3</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24684?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Degron capability of the hydrophobic C‐terminus of the polyglutamine disease protein, ataxin‐3&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/283e528e-3b49-4485-ab82-8226112096af/jnr24684-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The C‐terminus of ataxin‐3 regulates its proteasomal degradation, with isoform 2 being more rapidly degraded. Fusion of the tail of ataxin‐3 isoform 2 to GFP also increases its proteasomal turnover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ataxin‐3 is a deubiquitinase and polyglutamine disease protein whose cellular properties and functions are not entirely understood. Mutations in ataxin‐3 cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), a neurodegenerative disorder that is a member of the polyglutamine family of diseases. Two major isoforms arise from alternative splicing of &lt;i&gt;ATXN3 &lt;/i&gt; and are differently toxic &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt; as a result of faster proteasomal degradation of one isoform compared to the other. The isoforms vary only at their C‐termini, suggesting that the hydrophobic C‐terminus of the more quickly degraded form of ataxin‐3 (here referred to as isoform 2) functions as a degron—that is, a peptide sequence that expedites the degradation of its host protein. We explored this notion in this study and present evidence that: (a) the C‐terminus of ataxin‐3 isoform 2 signals its degradation in a proteasome‐dependent manner, (b) this effect from the C‐terminus of isoform 2 does not require the ubiquitination of ataxin‐3, and (c) the isolated C‐terminus of isoform 2 can enhance the degradation of an unrelated protein. According to our data, the C‐terminus of ataxin‐3 isoform 2 is a degron, increasing overall understanding of the cellular properties of the SCA3 protein.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;LAMA2-related congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD; LAMA2-MD), also referred to as merosin deficient CMD (MDC1A), is a severe neonatal onset muscle disease caused by recessive mutations in the LAMA2 gene. LAMA2 encodes laminin α2, a subunit of the extracellular matrix (ECM) oligomer laminin 211. There are currently no treatments for MDC1A, and there is an incomplete understanding of disease pathogenesis. Zebrafish, due to their high degree of genetic conservation with humans, large clutch sizes, rapid development, and optical clarity, have emerged as an excellent model system for studying rare Mendelian diseases. They are particularly suitable as a model for muscular dystrophy because they contain at least one orthologue to all major human MD genes, have muscle that is similar to human muscle in structure and function, and manifest obvious and easily measured MD related phenotypes. In this review article, we present the existing zebrafish models of MDC1A, and discuss their contribution to the understanding of MDC1A pathomechanisms and therapy development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Electric Stimulation of Neurogenesis Improves Behavioral Recovery After Focal Ischemia in Aged Rats</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The major aim of stroke therapies is to stimulate brain repair and to improve behavioral recuperation after cerebral ischemia. Despite remarkable advances in cell therapy for stroke, stem cell-based tissue replacement has not been achieved yet stimulating the search for alternative strategies for brain self-repair using the neurogenic zones of the brain, the dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone (SVZ). However, during aging, the potential of the hippocampus and the SVZ to generate new neuronal precursors, declines. We hypothesized that electrically stimulation of endogenous neurogenesis in aged rats could increase the odds of brain self-repair and improve behavioral recuperation after focal ischemia. Following stroke in aged animals, the rats were subjected to two sessions of electrical non-convulsive stimulation using ear-clip electrodes, at 7- and 24 days after MCAO. Animal were sacrificed after 48 days. We report that electrical stimulation (ES) stimulation of post-stroke aged rats led to an improved functional recovery of spatial long-term memory (T-maze) but not on the rotating pole or the inclined plane, both tests requiring complex sensorimotor skills. Surprisingly, ES had a detrimental effect on the asymmetric sensorimotor deficit. Histologically, there was a robust increase in the number of doublecortin-positive cells in the dentate gyrus and SVZ of the infarcted hemisphere and the presence of a considerable number of neurons expressing tubulin beta III in the infarcted area. Among the gene that were unique to ES, we noted increases in the expression of seizure related 6 homolog like which is one of the physiological substrate of the β-secretase BACE1 involved in the pathophysiology of the Alzheimer’s disease and Igfbp3 and BDNF receptor mRNAs which has been shown to have a neuroprotective effect after cerebral ischemia. However, ES was associated with a long-term down regulation of cortical gene expression after stroke in aged rats suggesting that gene expression in the peri-infarcted cortical area may not be related to electrical stimulation induced-neurogenesis in the subventricular zone and hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy and Its Clinical Application in the Field of Neuroscience: Advances and Future Directions</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Similar to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) detects the changes of hemoglobin species inside the brain, but via differences in optical absorption. Within the near-infrared spectrum, light can penetrate biological tissues and be absorbed by chromophores, such as oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin. What makes fNIRS more advantageous is its portability and potential for long-term monitoring. This paper reviews the basic mechanisms of fNIRS and its current clinical applications, the limitations toward more widespread clinical usage of fNIRS, and current efforts to improve the temporal and spatial resolution of fNIRS toward robust clinical usage within subjects. Oligochannel fNIRS is adequate for estimating global cerebral function and it has become an important tool in the critical care setting for evaluating cerebral oxygenation and autoregulation in patients with stroke and traumatic brain injury. When it comes to a more sophisticated utilization, spatial and temporal resolution becomes critical. Multichannel NIRS has improved the spatial resolution of fNIRS for brain mapping in certain task modalities, such as language mapping. However, averaging and group analysis are currently required, limiting its clinical use for monitoring and real-time event detection in individual subjects. Advances in signal processing have moved fNIRS toward individual clinical use for detecting certain types of seizures, assessing autonomic function and cortical spreading depression. However, its lack of accuracy and precision has been the major obstacle toward more sophisticated clinical use of fNIRS. The use of high-density whole head optode arrays, precise sensor locations relative to the head, anatomical co-registration, short-distance channels, and multi-dimensional signal processing can be combined to improve the sensitivity of fNIRS and increase its use as a wide-spread clinical tool for the robust assessment of brain function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most prevalent and life-threatening neurodegenerative disease and mainly characterized by lack of sufficient dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Although current treatments help to alleviate clinical symptoms, effective therapies preventing neuronal loss remain scarce. Tovophyllin A (TA), one of the xanthones extracted from Garcinia mangostana L. (GM), has recently been reported to play a beneficial role in the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases. In our research, we explored whether TA has protective effects on dopaminergic neurons in PD models. We found that TA significantly reduced apoptotic cell death in primary cortical neurons treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl pyridinium (MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) or paraquat (PQ) in the in vitro PD model. In an in vivo acute PD model induced by 1-methyl4-phenyl-1,2,3,5-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) treatment, TA also attenuated the resulting behavioral dysfunctions and dopaminergic neuron loss. In the collected brain tissues, TA increased the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3β, which may be related to TA-mediated dopaminergic neuronal protective effects. In summary, our results illustrated that TA is a powerful cytoprotective agent for dopaminergic neurons in the MPTP-induced PD model, suggesting TA as a possible therapeutic candidate for PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Objectives&lt;p&gt;To investigate the bilateral hippocampal subfield volumetric differences in four types of mild dementia, namely typical Alzheimer’s disease (tAD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), semantic dementia (SD), and posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), to assist differential diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;One hundred three participants, including 22 tAD, 34 SD (17 left SD and 17 right SD), 15 DLB, 12 PCA patients, and 20 normal controls (NC), were recruited. All subjects received standard neuropsychological assessments and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The hippocampal subfields were automatically segmented via Freesurfer. The study compared the volumetric differences and used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to estimate the efficacy of each hippocampal subfield to distinguish between groups. Spearman correlation analysis was used to investigate the relationship between memory recall scores and hippocampal subfield volumes.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The hippocampal subfield atrophy varied in different groups: tAD, SD, and PCA patients had subregional atrophy in bilateral hippocampi compared to NC, and DLB patients showed preserved volumes; left SD patients suffered the most severe atrophy of the left hippocampus, and right SD patients were atrophied mostly in the right hippocampus. There was no significant difference in the volume of hippocampal subregions between tAD and PCA subjects, but the former tended to be atrophied more asymmetrically. ROC analysis showed that, for discrimination, the areas under the curve (AUC) of some subfields were larger than the total hippocampus, but none observed significant difference. In addition, immediate recall scores were correlated to left CA1, CA2/3, CA4/DG, subiculum, and presubiculum (p &amp;lt; 0.05), and delayed recall scores were strongly related to bilateral CA2/3, CA4/DG, subiculum, and presubiculum (r = 0.38–0.52, p &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Differential atrophy patterns in the bilateral hippocampal subfield volumes could serve the differential diagnosis in patients with different causes of mild dementia: left CA1 for tAD; left presubiculum for LSD; right CA4/DG, right presubiculum, and right subiculum for RSD; CA4/DG and right CA2/3 for DLB; right CA2/3 and right CA4/DG for PCA. Additionally, several hippocampal subfield volumes were significantly associated with memory scores, further highlighting the essential role of the hippocampus in memory decline.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cyclooxygenases (COX) are enzymes catalyzing arachidonic acid into prostanoids. COX exists in three isoforms: COX-1, 2, and 3. COX-1 and COX-2 have been widely studied in order to explore and understand their involvement in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a progressive neuroinflammatory dementia. COX-2 was traditionally viewed to be expressed only under pathological conditions and to have detrimental effects in AD pathophysiology and neurodegeneration. However, an increasing number of reports point to much more complex roles of COX-2 in AD. Mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) has been considered as a hub which integrates multiple signaling cascades, some of which are also involved in AD progression. COX-2 and mTOR are both involved in environmental sensing, growth, and metabolic processes of the cell. They are also known to act in cooperation in many different cancers and thus, their role together in normal cellular functions as well as AD has been explored in this review. Some of the therapeutic approaches targeting COX-2 and mTOR in AD and cancer are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Structural Brain Lesions and Gait Pathology in Children With Spastic Cerebral Palsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00275</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The interaction between brain damage and motor function is not yet fully understood in children with spastic cerebral palsy (CP). Therefore, a semi-quantitative MRI (sqMRI) scale was used to explore whether identified brain lesions related to functional abilities and gait pathology in this population. A retrospective cohort of ambulatory children with spastic CP was selected [N = 104; 52 bilateral (bCP) and 52 unilateral (uCP)]. Extent and location-specific scores were defined according to the sqMRI scale guidelines. The gross motor function classification system (GMFCS), the gait profile score (GPS), GPSs per motion plane, gait variable scores (GVS) and multiple-joint (MJ) gait patterns were related to brain lesion scores. In all groups, the global total brain scores correlated to the GPS (total: r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.404, p ≤ 0.001; bCP: r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.335, p ≤ 0.05; uCP: r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.493, p ≤ 0.001). The global total hemispheric scores correlated to the GMFCS (total: r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.392, p ≤ 0.001; bCP: r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.316, p ≤ 0.05; uCP: r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.331, p ≤ 0.05). The laterality scores of the hemispheres in the total group correlated negatively to the GMFCS level (r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = −0.523, p ≤ 0.001) and the GVS-knee sagittal (r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = −0.311, p ≤ 0.01). Lesion location, for the total group demonstrated positive correlations between parietal lobe involvement and the GPS (r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.321, p ≤ 0.001) and between periventricular layer damage and the GMFCS (r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.348, p ≤ 0.001). Involvement of the anterior part of the corpus callosum (CC) was associated with the GVS-hip sagittal in all groups (total: r&lt;sub&gt;pb&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.495, p ≤ 0.001; bCP: r&lt;sub&gt;pb&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.357, p ≤ 0.05; uCP: r&lt;sub&gt;pb&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.641, p ≤ 0.001). The global total hemispheric and laterality of the hemispheres scores differentiated between the minor and both the extension (p ≤ 0.001 and p ≤ 0.001) and flexion (p = 0.016 and p = 0.013, respectively) MJ patterns in the total group. Maximal periventricular involvement and CC intactness were associated with extension patterns (p ≤ 0.05 and p ≤ 0.001, respectively). Current findings demonstrated relationships between brain structure and motor function as well as pathological gait, in this cohort of children with CP. These results might facilitate the timely identification of gait pathology and, ultimately, guide individualized treatment planning of gait impairments in children with CP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Occipital Magnocellular VEP Non-linearities Show a Short Latency Interaction Between Contrast and Facial Emotion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00268</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00268</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The magnocellular system has been implicated in the rapid processing of facial emotions, such as fear. Of the various anatomical possibilities, the retino-colliculo-pulvinar route to the amygdala is currently favored. However, it is not clear whether and when amygdala arousal activates the primary visual cortex (V1). Non-linear visual evoked potentials provide a well-accepted technique for examining temporal processing in the magnocellular and parvocellular pathways in the visual cortex. Here, we investigated the relationship between facial emotion processing and the separable magnocellular (K2.1) and parvocellular (K2.2) components of the second-order non-linear multifocal visual evoked potential responses recorded from the occipital scalp (O&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;). Stimuli comprised pseudorandom brightening/darkening of fearful, happy, neutral faces (or no face) with surround patches decorrelated from the central face-bearing patch. For the central patch, the spatial contrast of the faces was 30% while the modulation of the per-pixel brightening/darkening was uniformly 10% or 70%. From 14 neurotypical young adults, we found a significant interaction between emotion and contrast in the magnocellularly driven K2.1 peak amplitudes, with greater K2.1 amplitudes for fearful (vs. happy) faces at 70% temporal contrast condition. Taken together, our findings suggest that facial emotional information is present in early V1 processing as conveyed by the M pathway, and more activated for fearful as opposed to happy and neutral faces. An explanation is offered in terms of the contest between feedback and response gain modulation models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Modulation of Brain Functional Connectivity and Efficiency During an Endurance Cycling Task: A Source-Level EEG and Graph Theory Approach</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00243</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00243</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Various methods have been employed to investigate different aspects of brain activity modulation related to the performance of a cycling task. In our study, we examined how functional connectivity and brain network efficiency varied during an endurance cycling task. For this purpose, we reconstructed EEG signals at source level: we computed current densities in 28 anatomical regions of interest (ROIs) through the eLORETA algorithm, and then we calculated the lagged coherence of the 28 current density signals to define the adjacency matrix. To quantify changes of functional network efficiency during an exhaustive cycling task, we computed three graph theoretical indices: local efficiency (LE), global efficiency (GE), and density (D) in two different frequency bands, Alpha and Beta bands, that indicate alertness processes and motor binding/fatigue, respectively. LE is a measure of functional segregation that quantifies the ability of a network to exchange information locally. GE is a measure of functional integration that quantifies the ability of a network to exchange information globally. D is a global measure of connectivity that describes the extent of connectivity in a network. This analysis was conducted for six different task intervals: pre-cycling; initial, intermediate, and final stages of cycling; and active recovery and passive recovery. Fourteen participants performed an incremental cycling task with simultaneous EEG recording and rated perceived exertion monitoring to detect the participants’ exhaustion. LE remained constant during the endurance cycling task in both bands. Therefore, we speculate that fatigue processes did not affect the segregated neural processing. We observed an increase of GE in the Alpha band only during cycling, which could be due to greater alertness processes and preparedness to stimuli during exercise. Conversely, although D did not change significantly over time in the Alpha band, its general reduction in the Beta bands during cycling could be interpreted within the framework of the neural efficiency hypothesis, which posits a reduced neural activity for expert/automated performances. We argue that the use of graph theoretical indices represents a clear methodological advancement in studying endurance performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Hydrogen Sulfide Reduces Cognitive Impairment in Rats After Subarachnoid Hemorrhage by Ameliorating Neuroinflammation Mediated by the TLR4/NF-κB Pathway in Microglia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00210</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00210</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background and Aims: Cognitive impairment is one of the major complications of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and is closely associated with neuroinflammation. Hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) has been shown to have an anti-inflammatory effect and reduce cognitive impairment in neurodegenerative diseases, but its effects in SAH have been little studied. This study aimed to investigate the effects of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S on cognitive impairment after SAH and the possible underlying mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Forty-eight male Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into three groups: a sham group, a SAH group, and a SAH + NaHS (an H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S donor) group. The endovascular perforation technique was used to establish the experimental SAH model. NaHS was administered intraperitoneally. An active avoidance test (AAT) was performed to investigate cognitive function. The expression of TNF-α, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and NF-κB p65 in the hippocampus was measured by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. The types of cells expressing TNF-α were detected by double immunofluorescence staining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Compared to that in the sham group, the learning and memory ability of rats in the SAH group was damaged. Furthermore, the expression of TNF-α, TLR4, and NF-κB p65 in the hippocampus was elevated in the SAH group (p &amp;lt; 0.05). TNF-α was mainly expressed in activated microglia, which was consistent with the expression of TLR4. Treatment with NaHS significantly decreased the cognitive impairment of rats after SAH and simultaneously reduced the expression of TNF-α, TLR4, and NF-κB p65 and alleviated the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 (p &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The neuroinflammation reaction in microglia contributes to cognitive impairment after SAH. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S reduced the cognitive impairment of rats after SAH by ameliorating neuroinflammation in microglia, potentially via the TLR4/NF-κB pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Cytoplasmic Polyadenylation Element Binding Proteins CPEB1 and CPEB3 Regulate the Translation of FosB and Are Required for Maintaining Addiction-Like Behaviors Induced by Cocaine</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00207</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00207</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A recurrent and devastating feature of addiction to a drug of abuse is its persistence, which is mediated by maladaptive long-term memories of the highly pleasurable experience initially associated with the consumption of the drug. We have recently found that members of the CPEB family of proteins (Cytoplasmic Polyadenylation Element-Binding Proteins) are involved in the maintenance of spatial memory. However, their possible role in the maintenance of memories that sustain addictive behavior has yet to be explored. Little is known about any of the mechanisms for maintaining memories for addictive behavior. To address the mechanisms whereby addictive behavior is maintained over time, we utilized a conditional transgenic mouse model expressing a dominant-negative version of CPEB1 that abolishes the activity in the forebrain of two of the four CPEB isoforms (CPEB1 and CPEB3). We found that, following cocaine administration, these dominant-negative (DN) CPEB mice showed a significant decrease, when compared to wild type (WT) mice, in both locomotor sensitizations and conditioned place preference (CPP), two indices of addictive behavior. Supporting these behavioral results, we also found a difference between WT and DN-CPEB1-3 mice in the cocaine-induced synaptic depression in the core of the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc). Finally, we found that (1) CPEB is reduced in transgenic mice following cocaine injections and that (2) FosB, known for its contribution to establishing the addictive phenotype, when its expression in the striatum is increased by drug administration, is a novel target of CPEBs molecules. Thus, our study highlights how CPEB1 and CPEB3 act on target mRNAs to build the neuroadaptative implicit memory responses that lead to the development of the cocaine addictive phenotypes in mammals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Increased Dendritic Branching of and Reduced δ-GABAA Receptor Expression on Parvalbumin-Positive Interneurons Increase Inhibitory Currents and Reduce Synaptic Plasticity at Puberty in Female Mouse CA1 Hippocampus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00203</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00203</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parvalbumin positive (PV+) interneurons play a pivotal role in cognition and are known to be regulated developmentally and by ovarian hormones. The onset of puberty represents the end of a period of optimal learning when impairments in synaptic plasticity are observed in the CA1 hippocampus of female mice. Therefore, we tested whether the synaptic inhibitory current generated by PV+ interneurons is increased at puberty and contributes to these deficits in synaptic plasticity. To this end, the spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic current (sIPSC) was recorded using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques from CA1 pyramidal cells in the hippocampal slice before (PND 28–32) and after the onset of puberty in female mice (~PND 35–44, assessed by vaginal opening). sIPSC frequency and amplitude were significantly increased at puberty, but these measures were reduced by 1 μM DAMGO [1 μM, (D-Ala&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, N-MePhe&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, Gly-ol)-enkephalin], which silences PV+ activity via μ-opioid receptor targets. At puberty, dendritic branching of PV+ interneurons in GAD67-GFP mice was increased, while expression of the δ subunit of the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor (GABAR) on these interneurons decreased. Both frequency and amplitude of sIPSCs were significantly increased in pre-pubertal mice with reduced δ expression, suggesting a possible mechanism. Theta burst induction of long-term potentiation (LTP), an in vitro model of learning, is impaired at puberty but was restored to optimal levels by DAMGO administration, implicating inhibition via PV+ interneurons as one cause. Administration of the neurosteroid/stress steroid THP (30 nM, 3α-OH, 5α-pregnan-20-one) had no effect on sIPSCs. These findings suggest that phasic inhibition generated by PV+ interneurons is increased at puberty when it contributes to impairments in synaptic plasticity. These results may have relevance for the changes in cognitive function reported during early adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Neuroprotective Effects of Adenosine A1 Receptor Signaling on Cognitive Impairment Induced by Chronic Intermittent Hypoxia in Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is a breathing disorder associated with cognitive impairment. However, the mechanisms leading to cognitive deficits in OSAHS remain uncertain. In this study, a mouse model of chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) exposures were applied for simulating the deoxygenation-reoxygenation events occurring in OSAHS. The conventional adenosine A1 receptor gene (A1R) knockout mice and the A1R agonist CCPA- or antagonist DPCPX-administrated mice were utilized to determine the precise function of A1R signaling in the process of OSAHS-relevant cognitive impairment. We demonstrated that CIH induced morphological changes and apoptosis in hippocampal neurons. Further, CIH blunted hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and resulted in learning/memory impairment. Disruption of adenosine A1R exacerbated morphological, cellular, and functional damage induced by CIH. In contrast, activation of adenosine A1R signaling reduced morphological changes and apoptosis of hippocampal neurons, promoted LTP, and enhanced learning and memory. A1Rs may up-regulate protein kinase C (PKC) and its subtype PKC-ζ through the activation of Gα(i) improve spatial learning and memory disorder induced by CIH in mice. Taken together, A1R signaling plays a neuroprotective role in CIH-induced cognitive dysfunction and pathological changes in the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Usher syndrome is a genetic disorder causing neurosensory hearing loss and blindness from retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Adaptive techniques such as braille, digital and optical magnifiers, mobility training, cochlear implants, or other assistive listening devices are indispensable for reducing disability. However, there is currently no treatment to reduce or arrest sensory cell degeneration. There are several classes of treatments for Usher syndrome being investigated. The present article reviews the progress this research has made towards delivering commercial options for patients with Usher syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Role of Cognitive Control in Age-Related Changes in Well-Being</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00198</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Maintaining emotional well-being in late life is crucial for achieving successful and healthy aging. While previous research from Western cultures has documented that emotional well-being improves as individuals get older, previous research provided mixed evidence on the effects of age on well-being in Eastern Asian cultures. However, previous studies in East Asia do not always take into account the effects of cognitive control—an ability which has been considered as a key to enable older adults to regulate their emotions. In the current study, we tested whether cognitive control abilities interact with age in determining individuals’ well-being in 59 Japanese females (age range: 26–79; M&lt;sub&gt;age&lt;/sub&gt; = 64.95). Participants’ mental health and mental fatigue were tracked for 5 years together with their cognitive control abilities. We found that as individuals became older, they showed improved mental health and decreased mental fatigue. In addition, we found a quadratic effect of age on mental fatigue, which was further qualified by baseline cognitive control abilities. Specifically, in those who had a lower level of cognitive control abilities, mental fatigue declined until the mid-60s, at which point it started increasing (a U-shape effect). In contrast, in those who had a higher level of cognitive control ability, mental fatigue showed a steady decrease with age even after their mid-60s. These results suggest that whether advancing age is associated with positive vs. negative changes in well-being depends on cognitive control abilities, and that preserved cognitive control is a key to maintain well-being in late life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Zonisamide Ameliorates Cognitive Impairment by Inhibiting ER Stress in a Mouse Model of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) increases the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-like dementia and pathology. Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) plays a key role in the development of cognitive impairment in T2DM. Zonisamide (ZNS) was found to suppress ERS-induced neuronal cell damage in the experimental models of Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the protective effect of Zonisamide in the treatment of diabetes-related dementia is not determined. Here, we studied whether ZNS can attenuate cognitive impairments in T2DM mice. C57BL/6J mice were fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) and received one intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) to develop T2DM. After the 9-week diet, the mice were orally gavaged with ZNS or vehicle for 16 consecutive weeks. We found that ZNS improved spatial learning and memory ability and slightly attenuated hyperglycemia. In addition, the expression levels of synaptic-related proteins, such as postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95) and synaptophysin, were increased along with the activation of the cyclic AMP response element-binding (CREB) protein and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) both in the hippocampus and cortex of T2DM mice. Meanwhile, ZNS attenuated Aβ deposition, Tau hyperphosphorylation at Ser-396/404, and also decreased the activity of Tau upstream kinases including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Moreover, ZNS also decreased the ERS hallmark protein levels. These data suggest that ZNS can efficiently prevent cognitive impairment and improve AD-like pathologies by attenuating ERS in T2DM mice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Dmytro Guzenko, Stephen K. Burley, Jose M. Duarte&lt;/p&gt;

Detection of protein structure similarity is a central challenge in structural bioinformatics. Comparisons are usually performed at the polypeptide chain level, however the functional form of a protein within the cell is often an oligomer. This fact, together with recent growth of oligomeric structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), demands more efficient approaches to oligomeric assembly alignment/retrieval. Traditional methods use atom level information, which can be complicated by the presence of topological permutations within a polypeptide chain and/or subunit rearrangements. These challenges can be overcome by comparing electron density volumes directly. But, brute force alignment of 3D data is a compute intensive search problem. We developed a 3D Zernike moment normalization procedure to orient electron density volumes and assess similarity with unprecedented speed. Similarity searching with this approach enables real-time retrieval of proteins/protein assemblies resembling a target, from PDB or user input, together with resulting alignments (http://shape.rcsb.org).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9tGqaCG0_ig&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Modeling Human‐specific Interlaminar Astrocytes in the Mouse Cerebral Cortex&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/aab978c7-321e-4818-98a5-6f107f543d32/cne24979-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We engrafted RFP‐expressing astrocytes differentiated from hiPSCs into the cortex of immunodeficient mice neonatally. Nine months post engraftment, the human astrocytes in the superficial cortex developed into interlaminar astrocytes that mimicked the interlaminar astrocytes architecture of the adult human cortex. This chimeric mouse model will enable the study of human‐specific interlaminar astrocytes in vivo.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes, a highly heterogeneous population of glial cells, serve as essential regulators of brain development and homeostasis. The heterogeneity of astrocyte populations underlies the diversity in their functions. In addition to the typical mammalian astrocyte architecture, the cerebral cortex of humans exhibits a radial distribution of interlaminar astrocytes in the supragranular layers. These primate‐specific interlaminar astrocytes are located in the superficial layer and project long processes traversing multiple layers of the cerebral cortex. However, due to the lack of accessible experimental models, their functional properties and their role in regulating neuronal circuits remain unclear. Here we modeled human interlaminar astrocytes in humanized glial chimeric mice by engrafting astrocytes differentiated from human‐induced pluripotent stem cells into the mouse cortex. This model provides a novel platform for understanding neuron‐glial interaction and its alterations in neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Quantitative Separation of Tremor and Ataxia in Essential Tremor</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25781?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25781?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study addresses an important problem in neurology, distinguishing tremor and ataxia using quantitative methods. Specifically, we aimed to quantitatively separate dysmetria, a cardinal sign of ataxia, from tremor in essential tremor (ET).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Experiment 1, we compared 19 participants diagnosed with ET undergoing thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS; ET&lt;sub&gt;DBS&lt;/sub&gt;) to 19 healthy controls (HC). We quantified tremor during postural tasks using accelerometry and dysmetria with fast, reverse‐at‐target goal‐directed movements. To ensure that endpoint accuracy was unaffected by tremor, we quantified dysmetria in selected trials manifesting a smooth trajectory to the endpoint. Finally, we manipulated tremor amplitude by switching DBS ON and OFF to examine its effect on dysmetria. In Experiment 2, we compared 10 ET participants with 10 HC to determine whether we could identify and distinguish dysmetria from tremor in non‐DBS ET.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three findings suggest that we can quantify dysmetria independently of tremor in ET. First, ET&lt;sub&gt;DBS&lt;/sub&gt; and ET exhibited greater dysmetria than HC and dysmetria did not correlate with tremor (&lt;i&gt;R &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). Second, even for trials with tremor‐free trajectories to the target, ET exhibited greater dysmetria than HC (&lt;i&gt;p &amp;lt; &lt;/i&gt; 0.01). Third, activating DBS reduced tremor (&lt;i&gt;p &amp;lt; &lt;/i&gt; 0.01) but had no effect on dysmetria (&lt;i&gt;p &amp;gt; &lt;/i&gt; 0.2).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate that dysmetria can be quantified independently of tremor using fast, reverse‐at‐target goal‐directed movements. These results have important implications for the understanding of ET and other cerebellar and tremor disorders. Future research should examine the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying each symptom and characterize their independent contribution to disability. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generating numbers has become an almost inevitable task associated studies of the morphology of the nervous system. Numbers serve a desire for clarity and objectivity in the presentation of results and are a prerequisite for the statistical evaluation of experimental outcomes. Clarity, objectivity and statistics make demands on the quality of the numbers that are not met by many methods. This review provides a refresher of problems associated with generating numbers that describe the nervous system in terms of the volumes, surfaces, lengths and numbers of its components. An important aim is to provide comprehensible descriptions of the methods that address these problems. Collectively known as design‐based stereology, these methods share two features critical to their application. First, they are firmly based in mathematics and its proofs. Second and critically underemphasized, an understanding of their mathematical background is not necessary for their informed and productive application. Understanding and applying estimators of volume, surface, length or number does not require more of an organizational mastermind than an immunohistochemical protocol. And when it comes to calculations, square roots are the gravest challenges to overcome. Sampling strategies that are combined with stereological probes are efficient and allow a rational assessment if the numbers that have been generated are “good enough”. Much may be unfamiliar, but very little is difficult. These methods can no longer be scapegoats for discrepant results but faithfully produce numbers on the material that is assessed. They also faithfully reflect problems that associated with the histological material and the anatomically informed decisions needed to generate numbers that are not only valid in theory. It is within reach to generate practically useful numbers that must integrate with qualitative knowledge to understand the function of neural systems.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Do corticosterone levels predict female depressive‐like behavior in rodents?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24686?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dysregulation of the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis is often linked to the neurobiology of depression, though the presence and type of this dysregulation is not a consistent finding. Meanwhile, significant sex differences exist regarding depression and the HPA axis. Animal models of depression simulate certain aspects of the human disease and aim to advance our knowledge regarding its neurobiology and discover new antidepressant treatments. Most animal models of depression induce a depressive‐like phenotype taking advantage of stressful experimental conditions, that also increase corticosterone, the main stress hormone in rodents. In this review we present inconsistent results in male and female rodents regarding the interaction between the depressive‐like behavioral phenotype and corticosterone. In commonly used models, the female depressive‐like phenotype in rodents seems significantly less dependent on the stress hormone corticosterone, whereas the male behavioral response is more evident and associates with variations of corticosterone. Further research and clarification of this sex‐dependent interaction will have significant ramifications on the improvement of the validity of animal models of depression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Dendritic and Spine Heterogeneity of von Economo Neurons in the Human Cingulate Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The human cingulate cortex (CC), included in the paralimbic cortex, participates in emotion, visceral responses, attention, cognition, and social behaviors. The CC has spindle-shaped/fusiform cell body neurons in its layer V, the von Economo neurons (VENs). VENs have further developed in primates, and the characterization of human VENs can benefit from the detailed descriptions of the shape of dendrites and spines. Here, we advance this issue and studied VENs in the anterior and midcingulate cortex from four neurologically normal adult subjects. We used the thionin technique and the adapted “single-section” Golgi method for light microscopy. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions were carried out for the visualization of Golgi-impregnated VENs’ cell body, ascending and descending dendrites, and collateral branches. We also looked for the presence, density, and shape of spines from proximal to distal dendrites. These neurons have a similar aspect for the soma, but features of spiny dendrites evidenced a morphological heterogeneity of CC VENs. Only for the description of this continuum of shapes, we labeled the most common feature as VEN 1, which has main dendritic shafts but few branches and sparse spines. VEN 2 shows an intermediate aspect, whereas VEN 3 displays the most profuse dendritic ramification and more spines with varied shapes from proximal to distal branches. Morphometric data exemplify the dendritic features of these cells. The heterogeneity of the dendritic architecture and spines suggests additional functional implications for the synaptic and information processing in VENs in integrated networks of normal and, possibly, neurological/psychiatric conditions involving the human CC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: What Has Neuroimaging Taught Us on the Neurobiology of Yoga? A Review</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Yoga is becoming increasingly popular worldwide, with several implicated physical and mental benefits. Here we provide a comprehensive and critical review of the research generated from the existing neuroimaging literature in studies of yoga practitioners. We reviewed 34 international peer-reviewed neuroimaging studies of yoga using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT): 11 morphological and 26 functional studies, including three studies that were classified as both morphological and functional. Consistent findings include increased gray matter volume in the insula and hippocampus, increased activation of prefrontal cortical regions, and functional connectivity changes mainly within the default mode network. There is quite some variability in the neuroimaging findings that partially reflects different yoga styles and approaches, as well as sample size limitations. Direct comparator groups such as physical activity are scarcely used so far. Finally, hypotheses on the underlying neurobiology derived from the imaging findings are discussed in the light of the potential beneficial effects of yoga.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: LRRK2 and Protein Aggregation in Parkinson’s Disease: Insights From Animal Models</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) instigate an autosomal dominant form of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Despite the neuropathological heterogeneity observed in LRRK2-PD, accumulating evidence suggests that alpha-synuclein and tau pathology are observed in a vast majority of cases. Intriguingly, the presence of protein aggregates spans both LRRK2-PD and idiopathic disease, supportive of a common pathologic mechanism. Thus, it is important to consider how LRRK2 mutations give rise to such pathology, and whether targeting LRRK2 might modify the accumulation, transmission, or toxicity of protein aggregates. Likewise, it is not clear how LRRK2 mutations drive PD pathogenesis, and whether protein aggregates are implicated in LRRK2-dependent neurodegeneration. While animal models have been instrumental in furthering our understanding of a potential interaction between LRRK2 and protein aggregation, the biology is far from clear. We aim to provide a thoughtful overview of the evidence linking LRRK2 to protein aggregation in animal models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) comprise a broad range of progressive neurological disorders with multifactorial etiology contributing to disease pathophysiology. Evidence of the microbiome involvement in the gut-brain axis urges the interest in understanding metabolic interactions between the microbiota and host physiology in NDDs. Systems Biology offers a holistic integrative approach to study the interplay between the different biologic systems as part of a whole, and may elucidate the host–microbiome interactions in NDDs. We reviewed direct and indirect pathways through which the microbiota can modulate the bidirectional communication of the gut-brain axis, and explored the evidence of microbial dysbiosis in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. As the gut microbiota being strongly affected by diet, the potential approaches to targeting the human microbiota through diet for the stimulation of neuroprotective microbial-metabolites secretion were described. We explored the potential of Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) to infer microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions and to identify the microbiome contribution to disease development or prevention. Finally, a systemic approach based on GEMs and ‘omics integration, that would allow the design of sustainable personalized anti-inflammatory diets in NDDs prevention, through the modulation of gut microbiota was described.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Down Syndrome Is a Metabolic Disease: Altered Insulin Signaling Mediates Peripheral and Brain Dysfunctions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00670</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00670</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Down syndrome (DS) is the most frequent chromosomal abnormality that causes intellectual disability, resulting from the presence of an extra complete or segment of chromosome 21 (HSA21). In addition, trisomy of HSA21 contributes to altered energy metabolism that appears to be a strong determinant in the development of pathological phenotypes associated with DS. Alterations include, among others, mitochondrial defects, increased oxidative stress levels, impaired glucose, and lipid metabolism, finally resulting in reduced energy production and cellular dysfunctions. These molecular defects seem to account for a high incidence of metabolic disorders, i.e., diabetes and/or obesity, as well as a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in DS. A dysregulation of the insulin signaling with reduced downstream pathways represents a common pathophysiological aspect in the development of both peripheral and central alterations leading to diabetes/obesity and AD. This is further strengthened by evidence showing that the molecular mechanisms responsible for such alterations appear to be similar between peripheral organs and brain. Considering that DS subjects are at high risk to develop either peripheral or brain metabolic defects, this review will discuss current knowledge about the link between trisomy of HSA21 and defects of insulin and insulin-related pathways in DS. Drawing the molecular signature underlying these processes in DS is a key challenge to identify novel drug targets and set up new prevention strategies aimed to reduce the impact of metabolic disorders and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Levodopa Changes Functional Connectivity Patterns in Subregions of the Primary Motor Cortex in Patients With Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00647</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00647</link>
	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;The primary motor cortex (M1) is a critical node in Parkinson’s disease (PD)-related motor circuitry; however, the functional roles of its subregions are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated changes in the functional connectivity patterns of M1 subregions and their relationships to improved clinical symptoms following levodopa administration.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Thirty-six PD patients and 37 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled. A formal levodopa challenge test was conducted in the PD group, and the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale motor section (UPDRS-III) was assessed before (off state) and 1 h after administration of levodopa (on state). The PD group underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in both off and on states, whereas the HC group was scanned once. We used the Human Brainnetome Atlas template to subdivide M1 into twelve regions of interest (ROIs). Functional connectivity (FC) was compared between PD on and off states [paired t-test, voxel-level p &amp;lt; 0.001, cluster-level p &amp;lt; 0.05, Gaussian random field (GRF) correction] and between patients and HC (two-sample t-test voxel-level p &amp;lt; 0.001, cluster-level p &amp;lt; 0.05). Correlations between ΔFC (differences in FC between PD off and on states) and clinical symptom improvements were examined.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;There was decreased FC between the right caudal dorsolateral area 6 and the anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC), the right upper limb region and the left medial dorsal thalamus (mdTHA), as well as increased FC between the left tongue and larynx region and the left medial frontal gyrus. ΔFC between the right caudal dorsolateral area 6 and ACC was positively correlated with improvements in UPDRS-III total scores as well as the rigidity (item 22) and bradykinesia (items 23–26 and 31) subscores. ΔFC between the right upper limb region and left thalamus was positively correlated with improvements in the left upper limb tremor (items 20c and 21b) and postural tremor (item 21b) subscores.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusions&lt;p&gt;Our results reveal novel information regarding the underlying mechanisms in the motor circuits in the M1 and a promising way to explore the internal function of the M1 in PD patients. Notably, M1 is a potential therapeutic target in PD, and the exploration of its subregions provides a basis and a source of new insights for clinical intervention and precise drug treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Is Ross Syndrome a New Type of Synucleinopathy? A Brief Research Report</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00635</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ross syndrome (RS) is a rare peripheral autonomic system disorder characterized by tonic pupil, hyporeflexia, and segmental anhidrosis. Neuropathological studies show that RS results from the selective cholinergic nerve degeneration. However, the cause and underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we show α-synuclein accumulation in the autonomic nerve terminals in the lesser curvature of stomach of patients with RS. In addition, immunohistochemical findings demonstrate that a dominant degeneration of cholinergic fibers is exhibited in patients with RS, while main degeneration of adrenergic fibers is demonstrated in patients with pure autonomic failure in their gastrointestinal and urinary system. Our study suggests that RS belongs to α-synucleinopathies. Moreover, our findings indicate that adrenergic nerves and cholinergic nerves are not equally damaged in different types of pure autonomic dysfunctions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: MVPANI: A Toolkit With Friendly Graphical User Interface for Multivariate Pattern Analysis of Neuroimaging Data</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00545</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00545</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;With the rapid development of machine learning techniques, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) is becoming increasingly popular in the field of neuroimaging data analysis. Several software packages have been developed to facilitate its application in neuroimaging studies. As most of these software packages are based on command lines, researchers are required to learn how to program, which has greatly limited the use of MVPA for researchers without programming skills. Moreover, lacking a graphical user interface (GUI) also hinders the standardization of the application of MVPA in neuroimaging studies and, consequently, the replication of previous studies or comparisons of results between different studies. Therefore, we developed a GUI-based toolkit for MVPA of neuroimaging data: MVPANI (MVPA for Neuroimaging). Compared with other existing software packages, MVPANI has several advantages. First, MVPANI has a GUI and is, thus, more friendly for non-programmers. Second, MVPANI offers a variety of machine learning algorithms with the flexibility of parameter modification so that researchers can test different algorithms and tune parameters to identify the most suitable algorithms and parameters for their own data. Third, MVPANI also offers the function of data fusion at two levels (feature level or decision level) to utilize complementary information contained in different measures obtained from multimodal neuroimaging techniques. In this paper, we introduce this toolkit and provide four examples to demonstrate its usage, including (1) classification between patients and controls, (2) identification of brain areas containing discriminating information, (3) prediction of clinical scores, and (4) multimodal data fusion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Cortical Activation During Shoulder and Finger Movements in Healthy Adults: A Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) Study</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Characterization of cortical activation patterns during movement of the upper extremity in healthy adults is helpful in understanding recovery mechanisms following neurological disorders. This study explores cortical activation patterns associated with movements of the shoulder and fingers in healthy adults using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Twelve healthy right-handed participants were recruited. Two motor tasks (shoulder abduction and finger extension) with two different trial lengths (10 s and 20 s) were performed in a sitting position at a rate of 0.5 Hz. The hemodynamic response, as indicated by oxy-hemoglobin (HbO) and deoxy-hemoglobin (HbR), over both hemispheres was acquired using a 54-channel fNIRS system. We found a generalized bilateral cortical activation during both motor tasks with greater activation in the contralateral compared to the ipsilateral primary motor cortex. Particularly in the more medial part of the contralateral hemisphere, significant higher activation was found during the shoulder compared to finger movements. Furthermore, cortical activation patterns are affected not only by motor tasks but also by trial lengths. HbO is more sensitive to detect cortical activation during finger movements in longer trials, while HbR is a better surrogate to capture active areas during shoulder movement in shorter trials. Based on these findings, reporting both HbO and HbR is strongly recommended for future fNIRS studies, and trial lengths should be taken into account when designing experiments and explaining results. Our findings demonstrating distinct cortical activation patterns associated with shoulder and finger movements in healthy adults provide a foundation for future research to study recovery mechanisms following neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The storage of temporally precise spike patterns can be realized by a single neuron. A spiking neural network (SNN) model is utilized to demonstrate the ability to precisely recall a spike pattern after presenting a single input. We show by using a simulation study that the temporal properties of input patterns can be transformed into spatial patterns of local dendritic spikes. The localization of time-points of spikes is facilitated by phase-shift of the subthreshold membrane potential oscillations (SMO) in the dendritic branches, which modifies their excitability. In reference to the points in time of the arriving input, the dendritic spikes are triggered in different branches. To store spatially distributed patterns, two unsupervised learning mechanisms are utilized. Either synaptic weights to the branches, spatial representation of the temporal input pattern, are enhanced by spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) or the oscillation power of SMOs in spiking branches is increased by dendritic spikes. For retrieval, spike bursts activate stored spatiotemporal patterns in dendritic branches, which reactivate the original somatic spike patterns. The simulation of the prototypical model demonstrates the principle, how linking time to space enables the storage of temporal features of an input. Plausibility, advantages, and some variations of the proposed model are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Case Report: Histopathology and Prion Protein Molecular Properties in Inherited Prion Disease With a De Novo Seven-Octapeptide Repeat Insertion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00150</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00150</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The insertion of additional 168 base pair containing seven octapeptide repeats in the prion protein (PrP) gene region spanning residues 51–91 is associated with inherited prion disease. In 2008, we reported the clinical features of a novel de novo seven-octapeptide repeat insertion (7-OPRI) mutation coupled with codon 129 methionine (M) homozygosity in the PrP gene of a 19-year-old man presenting with psychosis and atypical dementia, and 16-year survival. Here, we describe the histopathological and PrP molecular properties in the autopsied brain of this patient. Histopathological examination revealed widespread brain atrophy, focal spongiform degeneration (SD), cortical PrP plaques, and elongated PrP formations in the cerebellum. Overall, these histopathological features resemble those described in a Belgian pedigree with 7-OPRI mutation except for the presence of PrP plaques in our case, which are morphologically different from the multicore plaques described in some OPRI mutations and in Gerstmann–Sträussler–Scheinker (GSS) syndrome. The comparative characterization of the detergent-soluble and detergent-insoluble PrP in our patient and in sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) revealed distinct molecular signatures. Proteinase K digestion of the pathogenic, disease-associated PrP (PrP&lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt;) revealed PrP&lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt; type 1 in the cerebral cortex and mixed PrP&lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt; types 1 and 2 in the cerebellum. Altogether, the present study outlines the importance of assessing the phenotypical and PrP biochemical properties of these rare conditions, thereby widening the spectrum of the phenotypic heterogeneity of the 7-OPRI insertion mutations. Further studies are needed to determine whether distinct conformers of PrP&lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt; are associated with two major clinico-histopathological phenotypes in prion disease with 7-OPRI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Corticomotor Plasticity Predicts Clinical Efficacy of Combined Neuromodulation and Cognitive Training in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;To investigate the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) combined with cognitive training for treatment of cognitive symptoms in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). A secondary objective was to analyze associations between brain plasticity and cognitive effects of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;In this randomized, sham-controlled, multicenter clinical trial, 34 patients with AD were assigned to three experimental groups receiving 30 daily sessions of combinatory intervention. Participants in the real/real group (n = 16) received 10 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) delivered separately to each of six cortical regions, interleaved with computerized cognitive training. Participants in the sham rTMS group (n = 18) received sham rTMS combined with either real (sham/real group, n = 10) or sham (sham/sham group, n = 8) cognitive training. Effects of treatment on neuropsychological (primary outcome) and neurophysiological function were compared between the 3 treatment groups. These, as well as imaging measures of brain atrophy, were compared at baseline to 14 healthy controls (HC).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;At baseline, patients with AD had worse cognition, cerebral atrophy, and TMS measures of cortico-motor reactivity, excitability, and plasticity than HC. The real/real group showed significant cognitive improvement compared to the sham/sham, but not the real/sham group. TMS-induced plasticity at baseline was predictive of post-intervention changes in cognition, and was modified across treatment, in association with changes of cognition.&lt;/p&gt;Interpretation&lt;p&gt;Combined rTMS and cognitive training may improve the cognitive status of AD patients, with TMS-induced cortical plasticity at baseline serving as predictor of therapeutic outcome for this intervention, and potential mechanism of action.&lt;/p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration&lt;p&gt;www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT01504958.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Buckeridge, Donald Hobern, Aaron Lien, Narelle Montgomery, Svetlana Nikolaeva, Richard L. Pyle, Scott A. Thomson, Peter Paul van Dijk, Anthony Whalen, Zhi-Qiang Zhang, Kevin R. Thiele&lt;/p&gt;

Lists of species underpin many fields of human endeavour, but there are currently no universally accepted principles for deciding which biological species should be accepted when there are alternative taxonomic treatments (and, by extension, which scientific names should be applied to those species). As improvements in information technology make it easier to communicate, access, and aggregate biodiversity information, there is a need for a framework that helps taxonomists and the users of taxonomy decide which taxa and names should be used by society whilst continuing to encourage taxonomic research that leads to new species discoveries, new knowledge of species relationships, and the refinement of existing species concepts. Here, we present 10 principles that can underpin such a governance framework, namely (i) the species list must be based on science and free from nontaxonomic considerations and interference, (ii) governance of the species list must aim for community support and use, (iii) all decisions about list composition must be transparent, (iv) the governance of validated lists of species is separate from the governance of the names of taxa, (v) governance of lists of accepted species must not constrain academic freedom, (vi) the set of criteria considered sufficient to recognise species boundaries may appropriately vary between different taxonomic groups but should be consistent when possible, (vii) a global list must balance conflicting needs for currency and stability by having archived versions, (viii) contributors need appropriate recognition, (ix) list content should be traceable, and (x) a global listing process needs both to encompass global diversity and to accommodate local knowledge of that diversity. We conclude by outlining issues that must be resolved if such a system of taxonomic list governance and a unified list of accepted scientific names generated are to be universally adopted.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/GAaxDpNEoVM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Neuronal gamma oscillations and activity‐dependent potassium transients remain regular after depletion of microglia in postnatal cortex tissue</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Neuronal gamma oscillations and activity‐dependent potassium transients remain regular after depletion of microglia in postnatal cortex tissue&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/68c700b7-f1f6-446e-b26d-e1e32f38a7c4/jnr24689-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of surveying microglia (resident immune cells) during cortical information processing in the healthy brain is widely unknown. This study shows that neuronal gamma oscillations emerging from precise synaptic communication between pyramidal cells and interneurons during higher brain functions remain regular after pharmacological removal of microglia from cortex tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microglial cells (resident macrophages) feature rapid activation in CNS disease and can acquire multiple phenotypes exerting neuroprotection or neurotoxicity. The functional impact of surveying (“resting”) microglia on neural excitability and neurotransmission in physiology is widely unknown, however. We addressed this issue in male rat hippocampal slice cultures (in situ) by pharmacological microglial ablation within days and by characterizing neuronal gamma‐band oscillations (30–70 Hz) that are highly sensitive to neuromodulators and disturbances in ion and energy regulation. Gamma oscillations support action potential timing and synaptic plasticity, associate with higher brain functions like perception and memory, and require precise communication between excitatory pyramidal cells and inhibitory (GABAergic) interneurons. The slice cultures featured well‐preserved hippocampal cytoarchitecture and parvalbumin‐positive interneuron networks, microglia with ramified morphology, and low basal levels of IL‐6, TNF‐α, and nitric oxide (NO). Stimulation of slice cultures with the pro‐inflammatory cytokine IFN‐γ or bacterial LPS serving as positive controls for microglial reactivity induced MHC‐II expression and increased cytokine and NO release. Chronic exposure of slice cultures to liposome‐encapsulated clodronate reduced the microglial cell population by about 96%, whereas neuronal structures, astrocyte GFAP expression, and basal levels of cytokines and NO were unchanged. Notably, the properties of gamma oscillations reflecting frequency, number and synchronization of synapse activity were regular after microglial depletion. Also, electrical stimulus‐induced transients of the extracellular potassium concentration ([K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;) reflecting cellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; efflux, clearance and buffering were unchanged. This suggests that nonreactive microglia are dispensable for neuronal homeostasis and neuromodulation underlying network signaling and rhythm generation in cortical tissue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease (PD) is a highly prevalent neurodegenerative condition. The disease involves the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons located in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Among late‐onset, familial forms of Parkinson are cases with mutations in the PARK17 locus encoding the vacuolar protein sorting 35 (Vps35), a subunit of the retromer complex. The retromer complex is composed of a heterotrimeric protein core (Vps26‐Vps35‐Vps29). The best‐known role of retromer is the retrieval of cargoes from endosomes to the Golgi complex or the plasma membrane. However, recent literature indicates that retromer performs roles associated with lysosomal and mitochondrial functions and degradative pathways such as autophagy. A common point mutation affecting the retromer subunit Vps35 is D620N, which has been linked to the alterations in the aforementioned cellular processes as well as with neurodegeneration. Here, we review the main aspects of the malfunction of the retromer complex and its implications for PD pathology. Besides, we highlight several controversies still awaiting clarification.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Neurology Grand Rounds Complications from “Stem Cell Tourism” in Neurology</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;“Stem cell tourism,” the practice of offering unproven cellular preparations to patients as approved therapy, is rising in neurology. Currently, the experiences of patients and reported complications from these procedures are unknown in the US. We evaluate academic neurologists' experiences with stem cell tourism and assess perceived competency on discussing this topic with patients. We found a lack of neurologist preparedness to discuss stem cell therapies with patients and an alarming list of unreported complications from these unregulated procedures. We also identified an urgent need for neurologist education and the creation of a national registry for reporting patient complications resulting from experimental stem cell interventions.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Development of Binaural Sensitivity: Eye Gaze as a Measure of Real-time Processing</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00039</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Children localize sounds using binaural cues when navigating everyday auditory environments. While sensitivity to binaural cues reaches maturity by 8–10 years of age, large individual variability has been observed in the just-noticeable-difference (JND) thresholds for interaural time difference (ITD) among children in this age range. To understand the development of binaural sensitivity beyond JND thresholds, the “looking-while-listening” paradigm was adapted in this study to reveal the real-time decision-making behavior during ITD processing. Children ages 8–14 years with normal hearing (NH) and a group of young NH adults were tested. This novel paradigm combined eye gaze tracking with behavioral psychoacoustics to estimate ITD JNDs in a two-alternative forced-choice discrimination task. Results from simultaneous eye gaze recordings during ITD processing suggested that children had adult-like ITD JNDs, but they demonstrated immature decision-making strategies. While the time course of arriving at the initial fixation and final decision in providing a judgment of the ITD direction was similar, children exhibited more uncertainty than adults during decision-making. Specifically, children made more fixation changes, particularly when tested using small ITD magnitudes, between the target and non-target response options prior to finalizing a judgment. These findings suggest that, while children may exhibit adult-like sensitivity to ITDs, their eye gaze behavior reveals that the processing of this binaural cue is still developing through late childhood.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Late Positivity Does Not Meet the Criteria to be Considered a Proper Neural Correlate of Perceptual Awareness</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00036</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Contrastive analysis has been widely employed in the search for the electrophysiological neural correlates of consciousness. However, despite its clear logic, it has been argued that it may not succeed in isolating neural processes solely involved in the emergence of perceptual awareness. In fact, data from contrastive analysis would be contaminated by potential confounding factors reflecting distinct, though related, processes either preceding or following the conscious perception. At present, the ERP components representing the proper correlates of perceptual awareness still remain to be identified among those correlating with awareness (i.e., Visual Awareness Negativity, VAN and Late Positivity, LP). In order to dissociate visual awareness from post-perceptual confounds specifically related to decision making, we manipulated the response criterion, which affects how a percept is translated into a decision. In particular, while performing an orientation discrimination task, participants were asked to shift their response criterion across sessions. As a consequence, the resulting modulation should concern the ERP component(s) not exclusively reflecting mechanisms regulating the subjective conscious experience itself but rather the processes accompanying it. Electrophysiological results showed that N1 and P3 were sensitive to the response criterion adopted by participants. Additionally, the more the participants shifted their response criterion, the bigger the ERP modulation was; this was consequently indicative of the critical role of these components in the decision-making processes regardless of awareness level. When considering data independently from the response criterion, the aware vs. unaware contrast showed that both VAN and LP were significant. Crucially, the LP component was also modulated by the interaction of awareness and response criterion, while VAN results to be unaffected. In agreement with previous literature, these findings provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that VAN tracks the emergence of visual awareness by encoding the conscious percept, whereas LP reflects the contribution from post-perceptual processes related to response requirements. This excludes a direct functional role of this later component in giving rise to perceptual awareness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Experimental and Computational Study on Motor Control and Recovery After Stroke: Toward a Constructive Loop Between Experimental and Virtual Embodied Neuroscience</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Being able to replicate real experiments with computational simulations is a unique opportunity to refine and validate models with experimental data and redesign the experiments based on simulations. However, since it is technically demanding to model all components of an experiment, traditional approaches to modeling reduce the experimental setups as much as possible. In this study, our goal is to replicate all the relevant features of an experiment on motor control and motor rehabilitation after stroke. To this aim, we propose an approach that allows continuous integration of new experimental data into a computational modeling framework. First, results show that we could reproduce experimental object displacement with high accuracy via the simulated embodiment in the virtual world by feeding a spinal cord model with experimental registration of the cortical activity. Second, by using computational models of multiple granularities, our preliminary results show the possibility of simulating several features of the brain after stroke, from the local alteration in neuronal activity to long-range connectivity remodeling. Finally, strategies are proposed to merge the two pipelines. We further suggest that additional models could be integrated into the framework thanks to the versatility of the proposed approach, thus allowing many researchers to achieve continuously improved experimental design.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Serotonergic Modulation of Sensory Neuron Activity and Behavior in Apteronotus albifrons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00038</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Organisms must constantly adapt to changes in their environment to survive. It is thought that neuromodulators such as serotonin enable sensory neurons to better process input encountered during different behavioral contexts. Here, we investigated how serotonergic innervation affects neural and behavioral responses to behaviorally relevant envelope stimuli in the weakly electric fish species Apteronotus albifrons. Under baseline conditions, we found that exogenous serotonin application within the electrosensory lateral line lobe increased sensory neuron excitability, thereby promoting burst firing. We found that serotonin enhanced the responses to envelope stimuli of pyramidal cells within the lateral segment of the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) by increasing sensitivity, with the increase more pronounced for stimuli with higher temporal frequencies (i.e., &amp;gt;0.2 Hz). Such increases in neural sensitivity were due to increased burst firing. At the organismal level, bilateral serotonin application within the ELL lateral segment enhanced behavioral responses to sensory input through increases in sensitivity. Similar to what was observed for neural responses, increases in behavioral sensitivity were more pronounced for higher (i.e., &amp;gt;0.2 Hz) temporal frequencies. Surprisingly, a comparison between our results and previous ones obtained in the closely related species A. leptorhynchus revealed that, while serotonin application gave rise to similar effects on neural excitability and responses to sensory input, serotonin application also gave rise to marked differences in behavior. Specifically, behavioral responses in A. leptorhynchus were increased primarily for lower (i.e., ≤0.2 Hz) rather than for higher temporal frequencies. Thus, our results strongly suggest that there are marked differences in how sensory neural responses are processed downstream to give rise to behavior across both species. This is even though previous results have shown that the behavioral responses of both species to envelope stimuli were identical when serotonin is not applied.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Brain Metabolisms Involved in Self-Reported Quality of Mobility in Parkinson’s Disease</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Objective motor ratings and subjective motor complaints are both widely used in Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the objective basis to the self-perceived mobility quality is still not well elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;Purposes&lt;p&gt;We aimed to figure out the relevancy between the UPDRS motor scores and PDQ39 mobility sub-scores, and further explore whether physician-assessed motor dysfunctions and patients-reported mobility deficits have some shared mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;49 patients with PD who completed the PDQ39 scale were retrospectively included. The relevancy between mobility quality and UPDRS scores was assessed, as well as the related presynaptic dopaminergic binding (&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C-CFT) and glucose metabolism (&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG) in this dual-tracer PET imaging study.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Modest correlation was found between UPDRS motor score and the PDQ39 mobility sub-score (r = 0.440, p = 0.002). No correlation was found between PDQ39 mobility SI and the dopaminergic lesions in putamen; however, the strict correlation was found with the UPDRS motor scores. In terms of global PD related pattern (PDRP) scores, the two motor scores both correlated strictly. In the further regional metabolism exploration, cerebellum correlated positively with PDQ39 mobility sub-scores, and the frontal and parietal regions mainly correlated negatively with the motor quality scores.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;UPDRS motor scores and PDQ39 mobility scores were only modestly correlated. The mechanisms involved under mobility quality were beyond dopaminergic deficiency, including motor related cerebellum hyper-metabolism and non-motor related frontal hypo-metabolism. Conclusively, the self-reported mobility experience may have the neurophysiological basis related to both motor and non-motor manifestations in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In this retrospective study, we analyzed clinical information as well as non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) and computed tomography angiography (CTA) data from patients with cerebral infarction in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory acquired within 24 h from symptoms onset. Then, we aimed to develop a model based on the radiomics signature to predict the development of mMCAi in cerebral infarction patients. Patients were divided randomly into training (n = 87) and validation (n = 39) sets. A total of 396 texture features were extracted from each NCCT image from the 126 patients. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analysis was used to reduce the feature dimension and construct an accurate radiomics signature based on the remaining texture features. Subsequently, we developed a model based on the radiomics signature and Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) based on NCCT to predict mMCAi. Our prediction model showed a good predictive performance with an AUC of 0.917 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.863–0.972] and 0.913 [95% CI, 0.795–1] in the training and validation sets, respectively. Additionally, the decision curve analysis (DCA) validated the clinical efficacy of the combined risk factors of radiomics signature and ASPECTS based on NCCT in the prediction of mMCAi development in patients with acute stroke across a wide range of threshold probabilities. Our research indicates that radiomics signature can be an instrumental tool to predict the risk of mMCAi.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a complicated clinical syndrome, which is caused by several kinds of cerebrovascular disorders, with high morbidity, disability and mortality rate. In recent years, several studies have shown that early brain injury (EBI) is an important factor leading to the poor prognosis of SAH. A major cause of EBI has been attributed that hematoma components invade into the brain parenchyma, resulting in neuronal cell death. Therefore, the clearance of hematoma components is essential in the clinical outcome of patients after SAH. Here, in the review, we provide a summary of the current known hematoma components clearance mechanisms and simultaneously propose a new hypothesis for hematoma components clearance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative condition associated with significant mortality and morbidity. The central pathophysiological mechanisms by which repetitive cranial injury results in the neurodegeneration of CTE are poorly understood. Current well-established working models emphasize a central role for trauma-induced excessive phosphorylation and accumulation of insoluble tangles of Tau protein. In this review, we summarize recent data from preclinical animal models of CTE where a series of candidate treatments have been carefully evaluated, including kinase inhibitors, antibody therapy, and anti-inflammatory therapies. We discuss the overall translational potential of these approaches and provide recommendations for future bench-to-bedside treatment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: EEG Biomarkers Related With the Functional State of Stroke Patients</title>

	<description>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Recent studies explored promising new quantitative methods to analyze electroencephalography (EEG) signals. This paper analyzes the correlation of two EEG parameters, Brain Symmetry Index (BSI) and Laterality Coefficient (LC), with established functional scales for the stroke assessment.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Thirty-two healthy subjects and thirty-six stroke patients with upper extremity hemiparesis were recruited for this study. The stroke patients where subdivided in three groups according to the stroke location: Cortical, Subcortical, and Cortical + Subcortical. The participants performed assessment visits to record the EEG in the resting state and perform functional tests using rehabilitation scales. Then, stroke patients performed 25 sessions using a motor-imagery based Brain Computer Interface system (BCI). BSI was calculated with the EEG data in resting state and LC was calculated with the Event-Related Synchronization maps.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The results of this study demonstrated significant differences in the BSI between the healthy group and Subcortical group (P = 0.001), and also between the healthy and Cortical+Subcortical group (P = 0.019). No significant differences were found between the healthy group and the Cortical group (P = 0.505). Furthermore, the BSI analysis in the healthy group based on gender showed statistical differences (P = 0.027). In the stroke group, the correlation between the BSI and the functional state of the upper extremity assessed by Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) was also significant, ρ = −0.430 and P = 0.046. The correlation between the BSI and the FMA-Lower extremity was not significant (ρ = −0.063, P = 0.852). Similarly, the LC calculated in the alpha band has significative correlation with FMA of upper extremity (ρ = −0.623 and P &amp;lt; 0.001) and FMA of lower extremity (ρ = −0.509 and P = 0.026). Other important significant correlations between LC and functional scales were observed. In addition, the patients showed an improvement in the FMA-upper extremity after the BCI therapy (ΔFMA = 1 median [IQR: 0–8], P = 0.002).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The quantitative EEG tools used here may help support our understanding of stroke and how the brain changes during rehabilitation therapy. These tools can help identify changes in EEG biomarkers and parameters during therapy that might lead to improved therapy methods and functional prognoses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Second Harmonic Generation Imaging of Collagen in Chronically Implantable Electrodes in Brain Tissue</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Advances in neural engineering have brought about a number of implantable devices for improved brain stimulation and recording. Unfortunately, many of these micro-implants have not been adopted due to issues of signal loss, deterioration, and host response to the device. While glial scar characterization is critical to better understand the mechanisms that affect device functionality or tissue viability, analysis is frequently hindered by immunohistochemical tissue processing methods that result in device shattering and tissue tearing artifacts. Devices are commonly removed prior to sectioning, which can itself disturb the quality of the study. In this methods implementation study, we use the label free, optical sectioning method of second harmonic generation (SHG) to examine brain slices of various implanted intracortical electrodes and demonstrate collagen fiber distribution not found in normal brain tissue. SHG can easily be used in conjunction with multiphoton microscopy to allow direct intrinsic visualization of collagen-containing glial scars on the surface of cortically implanted electrode probes without imposing the physical strain of tissue sectioning methods required for other high resolution light microscopy modalities. Identification and future measurements of these collagen fibers may be useful in predicting host immune response and device signal fidelity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Pycabnn: Efficient and Extensible Software to Construct an Anatomical Basis for a Physiologically Realistic Neural Network Model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00031</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Physiologically detailed models of neural networks are an important tool for studying how biophysical mechanisms impact neural information processing. An important, fundamental step in constructing such a model is determining where neurons are placed and how they connect to each other, based on known anatomical properties and constraints given by experimental data. Here we present an open-source software tool, pycabnn, that is dedicated to generating an anatomical model, which serves as the basis of a full network model. In pycabnn, we implemented efficient algorithms for generating physiologically realistic cell positions and for determining connectivity based on extended geometrical structures such as axonal and dendritic morphology. We demonstrate the capabilities and performance of pycabnn by using an example, a network model of the cerebellar granular layer, which requires generating more than half a million cells and computing their mutual connectivity. We show that pycabnn is efficient enough to carry out all the required tasks on a laptop computer within reasonable runtime, although it can also run in a parallel computing environment. Written purely in Python with limited external dependencies, pycabnn is easy to use and extend, and it can be a useful tool for computational neural network studies in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Distribution of Acid Sensing Ion Channels in Axonal Growth Cones and Presynaptic Membrane of Cultured Hippocampal Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00205</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00205</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are widely expressed in the central nervous system, their distribution and roles in axonal growth cones remain unclear. In this study, we examined ASIC localization and function in the axonal growth cones of cultured immature hippocampal neurons. Our immunocytochemical data showed that native and overexpressed ASIC1a and ASIC2a are both localized in growth cones of cultured young hippocampal neurons. Calcium imaging and electrophysiological assay results were utilized to validate their function. The calcium imaging test results indicated that the ASICs (primarily ASIC1a) present in growth cones mediate calcium influx despite the addition of voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels antagonists and the depletion of intracellular calcium stores. The electrophysiological tests results suggested that a rapid decrease in extracellular pH at the growth cones of voltage-clamped neurons elicits inward currents that were blocked by bath application of the ASIC antagonist amiloride, showing that the ASICs expressed at growth cones are functional. The subsequent immuno-colocalization test results demonstrated that ASIC1a and ASIC2a are both colocalized with Neurofilament-H and Bassoon in mature hippocampal neurons. This finding demonstrated that after reaching maturity, ASIC1a and ASIC2a are both distributed in axons and the presynaptic membrane. Our data reveal the distribution of functional ASICs in growth cones of immature hippocampal neurons and the presence of ASICs in the axons and presynaptic membrane of mature hippocampal neurons, indicating a possible role for ASICs in axonal guidance, synapse formation and neurotransmitter release.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Connecting Immune Cell Infiltration to the Multitasking Microglia Response and TNF Receptor 2 Induction in the Multiple Sclerosis Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00190</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Signaling from central nervous system (CNS)-infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages is critical to activate microglia and cause tissue damage in multiple sclerosis (MS). We combined laser microdissection with high-throughput real time RT-PCR to investigate separately the CNS exogenous and endogenous inflammatory components in postmortem brain tissue of progressive MS cases. A previous analysis of immune infiltrates isolated from the white matter (WM) and the meninges revealed predominant expression of genes involved in antiviral and cytotoxic immunity, including IFNγ and TNF. Here, we assessed the expression of 71 genes linked to IFN and TNF signaling and microglia/macrophage activation in the parenchyma surrounding perivascular cuffs at different stages of WM lesion evolution and in gray matter (GM) lesions underlying meningeal infiltrates. WM and GM from non-neurological subjects were used as controls. Transcriptional changes in the WM indicate activation of a classical IFNγ-induced macrophage defense response already in the normal-appearing WM, amplification of detrimental (proinflammatory/pro-oxidant) and protective (anti-inflammatory/anti-oxidant) responses in actively demyelinating WM lesions and persistence of these dual features at the border of chronic active WM lesions. Transcriptional changes in chronic subpial GM lesions indicate skewing toward a proinflammatory microglia phenotype. TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2) mediating TNF neuroprotective functions was one of the genes upregulated in the MS WM. Using immunohistochemistry we show that TNFR2 is highly expressed in activated microglia in the normal-appearing WM, at the border of chronic active WM lesions, and in foamy macrophages in actively demyelinating WM and GM lesions. In lysolecithin-treated mouse cerebellar slices, a model of demyelination and remyelination, TNFR2 RNA and soluble protein increased immediately after toxin-induced demyelination along with transcripts for microglia/macrophage-derived pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. TNFR2 and IL10 RNA and soluble TNFR2 protein remained elevated during remyelination. Furthermore, myelin basic protein expression was increased after selective activation of TNFR2 with an agonistic antibody. This study highlights the key role of cytotoxic adaptive immunity in driving detrimental microglia activation and the concomitant healing response. It also shows that TNFR2 is an early marker of microglia activation and promotes myelin synthesis, suggesting that microglial TNFR2 activation can be exploited therapeutically to stimulate CNS repair.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Absence of Plekhg5 Results in Myelin Infoldings Corresponding to an Impaired Schwann Cell Autophagy, and a Reduced T-Cell Infiltration Into Peripheral Nerves</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00185</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Inflammation and dysregulation of the immune system are hallmarks of several neurodegenerative diseases. An activated immune response is considered to be the cause of myelin breakdown in demyelinating disorders. In the peripheral nervous system (PNS), myelin can be degraded in an autophagy-dependent manner directly by Schwann cells or by macrophages, which are modulated by T-lymphocytes. Here, we show that the NF-κB activator Pleckstrin homology containing family member 5 (Plekhg5) is involved in the regulation of both Schwann cell autophagy and recruitment of T-lymphocytes in peripheral nerves during motoneuron disease. Plekhg5-deficient mice show defective axon/Schwann cell units characterized by myelin infoldings in peripheral nerves. Even at late stages, Plekhg5-deficient mice do not show any signs of demyelination and inflammation. Using RNAseq, we identified a transcriptional signature for an impaired immune response in sciatic nerves, which manifested in a reduced number of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cells. These findings identify Plekhg5 as a promising target to impede myelin breakdown in demyelinating PNS disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
