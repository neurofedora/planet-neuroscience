	<title>eLife: latest articles: Primed Track, high-fidelity lineage tracing in mouse pre-implantation embryos using primed conversion of photoconvertible proteins</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.44491</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/44491</link>
	<description>Accurate lineage reconstruction of mammalian pre-implantation development is essential for inferring the earliest cell fate decisions. Lineage tracing using global fluorescence labeling techniques is complicated by increasing cell density and rapid embryo rotation, which hampers automatic alignment and accurate cell tracking of obtained four-dimensional imaging data sets. Here, we exploit the advantageous properties of primed convertible fluorescent proteins (pr-pcFPs) to simultaneously visualize the global green and the photoconverted red population in order to minimize tracking uncertainties over prolonged time windows. Confined primed conversion of H2B-pr-mEosFP-labeled nuclei combined with light-sheet imaging greatly facilitates segmentation, classification, and tracking of individual nuclei from the 4-cell stage up to the blastocyst. Using green and red labels as fiducial markers, we computationally correct for rotational and translational drift, reduce overall data size, and accomplish high-fidelity lineage tracing even for increased imaging time intervals – addressing major concerns in the field of volumetric embryo imaging.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Computational modeling of brainstem circuits controlling locomotor frequency and gait</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.43587</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/43587</link>
	<description>A series of recent studies identified key structures in the mesencephalic locomotor region and the caudal brainstem of mice involved in the initiation and control of slow (exploratory) and fast (escape-type) locomotion and gait. Yet, how these brainstem centers interact with each other and with the spinal locomotor circuits is poorly understood. In a previous model (Danner et al., 2017), we suggested that commissural and long propriospinal interneurons are the main targets for brainstem inputs adjusting gait. Here, by extending our previous model, we propose a connectome of the brainstem-spinal circuitry and suggest a mechanistic explanation of the operation of brainstem structures and their roles in controlling speed and gait. We suggest that brainstem control of locomotion is mediated by two pathways, one controlling locomotor speed via connections to rhythm generating circuits in the spinal cord and the other providing gait control by targeting commissural and long propriospinal interneurons.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Open Access: Reduced White Matter Fiber Density in Autism Spectrum Disorder</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy348</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy348/5298366?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Differences in brain networks and underlying white matter abnormalities have been suggested to underlie symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, robustly characterizing microstructural white matter differences has been challenging. In the present study, we applied an analytic technique that calculates structural metrics specific to differently-oriented fiber bundles within a voxel, termed “fixels”. Fixel-based analyses were used to compare diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data from 25 individuals with ASD (mean age = 16.8 years) and 27 typically developing age-matched controls (mean age = 16.9 years). Group comparisons of fiber density (FD) and bundle morphology were run on a fixel-wise, tract-wise, and global white matter (GWM) basis. We found that individuals with ASD had reduced FD, suggestive of decreased axonal count, in several major white matter tracts, including the corpus callosum (CC), bilateral inferior frontal-occipital fasciculus, right arcuate fasciculus, and right uncinate fasciculus, as well as a GWM reduction. Secondary analyses assessed associations with social impairment in participants with ASD, and showed that lower FD in the splenium of the CC was associated with greater social impairment. Our findings suggest that reduced FD could be the primary microstructural white matter abnormality in ASD.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Open Access: Plasticity in Adult Mouse Visual Cortex Following Optic Nerve Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy347</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Optic nerve (ON) injury is an established model of axonal injury which results in retrograde degeneration and death of retinal ganglion cells as well anterograde loss of transmission and Wallerian degeneration of the injured axons. While the local impact of ON crush has been extensively documented we know comparatively little about the functional changes that occur in higher visual structures such as primary visual cortex (V1). We explored the extent of adult cortical plasticity using ON crush in aged mice. V1 function of the contralateral hemisphere was assessed longitudinally by intrinsic signal imaging and 2-photon calcium imaging before and after ON crush. Functional imaging demonstrated an immediate shift in V1 ocular dominance towards the ipsilateral, intact eye, due to the expected almost complete loss of responses to contralateral eye stimulation. Surprisingly, within 2 weeks we observed a delayed increase in ipsilateral eye responses. Additionally, spontaneous activity in V1 was reduced, similar to the lesion projection zone after retinal lesions. The observed changes in V1 activity indicate that severe ON injury in adulthood evokes cortical plasticity not only cross-modally but also within the visual cortex; this plasticity may be best compared with that seen after retinal lesions.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Selective Modulation of Early Visual Cortical Activity by Movement Intention</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy345</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The primate visual system contains myriad feedback projections from higher- to lower-order cortical areas, an architecture that has been implicated in the top-down modulation of early visual areas during working memory and attention. Here we tested the hypothesis that these feedback projections also modulate early visual cortical activity during the planning of visually guided actions. We show, across three separate human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies involving object-directed movements, that information related to the motor effector to be used (i.e., limb, eye) and action goal to be performed (i.e., grasp, reach) can be selectively decoded—prior to movement—from the retinotopic representation of the target object(s) in early visual cortex. We also find that during the planning of sequential actions involving objects in two different spatial locations, that motor-related information can be decoded from both locations in retinotopic cortex. Together, these findings indicate that movement planning selectively modulates early visual cortical activity patterns in an effector-specific, target-centric, and task-dependent manner. These findings offer a neural account of how motor-relevant target features are enhanced during action planning and suggest a possible role for early visual cortex in instituting a sensorimotor estimate of the visual consequences of movement.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;A single-nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter region of the Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;MMP9&lt;/span&gt;) gene, rs3918242, has been shown to affect &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;MMP9&lt;/span&gt; expression in macrophages and was associated with schizophrenia by two independent groups. However, rs3918242's effects on &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;MMP9&lt;/span&gt; expression were not replicable in cell lines or brain tissue. Additionally, publically available data indicate that rs3918242 genotype is related not to &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;MMP9&lt;/span&gt; expression, but rather to expression of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;SLC12A5&lt;/span&gt;, a nearby gene coding for a K+/Cl- cotransporter, whose expression has also been related to schizophrenia. Here, we studied brain structure and function in healthy participants stratified by rs3918242 genotype using structural MRI (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 298), functional MRI during an N-back working memory task (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 554), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) during the same task (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 190). We found rs3918242 was associated with gray matter volume (GMV) in the insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex bilaterally, closely replicated in discovery and replication samples; and with inferior parietal lobule (IPL) GMV when the samples were meta-analytically combined. Additionally, using both fMRI and MEG, rs3918242 was associated with right IPL working memory-related activation, replicated in two cohorts and across imaging modalities. These convergent results provide further impetus for examinations of the relationship of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;SLC12A5&lt;/span&gt; with brain structure and function in neuropsychiatric disease.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Biological Characteristics of Connection-Wise Resting-State Functional Connectivity Strength</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy342</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Functional connectivity is defined as the statistical dependency of neurophysiological activity between 2 separate brain areas. To investigate the biological characteristics of resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC)—and in particular the significance of connection-wise variation in time-series correlations—rsFC was compared with strychnine-based connectivity measured in the macaque. Strychnine neuronography is a historical technique that induces activity in cortical areas through means of local administration of the substance strychnine. Strychnine causes local disinhibition through GABA suppression and leads to subsequent activation of functional pathways. Multiple resting-state fMRI recordings were acquired in 4 macaques (examining in total 299 imaging runs) from which a group-averaged rsFC matrix was constructed. rsFC was observed to be higher (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) between region-pairs with a strychnine-based connection as compared with region-pairs with no strychnine-based connection present. In particular, higher resting-state connectivity was observed in connections that were relatively stronger (weak &amp;lt; moderate &amp;lt; strong; &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) and in connections that were bidirectional (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) instead of unidirectional in strychnine-based connectivity. Our results imply that the level of correlation between brain areas as extracted from resting-state fMRI relates to the strength of underlying interregional functional pathways.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Spontaneous Brain Activity Predicts Task-Evoked Activity During Animate Versus Inanimate Touch</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy340</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy340/5298359?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The spontaneous activity of the brain is characterized by an elaborate temporal structure with scale-free properties as indexed by the power law exponent (PLE). We test the hypothesis that spontaneous brain activity modulates task-evoked activity during interactions with animate versus inanimate stimuli. For this purpose, we developed a paradigm requiring participants to actively touch either animate (real hand) or inanimate (mannequin hand) stimuli. Behaviorally, participants perceived the animate target as closer in space, temporally more synchronous with their own self, and more personally relevant, compared with the inanimate. Neuronally, we observed a modulation of task-evoked activity by animate versus inanimate interactions in posterior insula, in medial prefrontal cortex, comprising anterior cingulate cortex, and in medial superior frontal gyrus. Among these regions, an increased functional connectivity was shown between posterior insula and perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (PACC) during animate compared with inanimate interactions and during resting state. Importantly, PLE during spontaneous brain activity in PACC correlated positively with PACC task-evoked activity during animate versus inanimate stimuli. In conclusion, we demonstrate that brain spontaneous activity in PACC can be related to the distinction between animate and inanimate stimuli and thus might be specifically tuned to align our brain with its animate environment.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Neural Coding of Contact Events in Somatosensory Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy337</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy337/5298364?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Manual interactions with objects require precise and rapid feedback about contact events. These tactile signals are integrated with motor plans throughout the neuraxis to achieve dexterous object manipulation. To better understand the role of somatosensory cortex in interactions with objects, we measured, using chronically implanted arrays of electrodes, the responses of populations of somatosensory neurons to skin indentations designed to simulate the initiation, maintenance, and termination of contact with an object. First, we find that the responses of somatosensory neurons to contact onset and offset dwarf their responses to maintenance of contact. Second, we show that these responses rapidly and reliably encode features of the simulated contact events—their timing, location, and strength—and can account for the animals’ performance in an amplitude discrimination task. Third, we demonstrate that the spatiotemporal dynamics of the population response in cortex mirror those of the population response in the nerves. We conclude that the responses of populations of somatosensory neurons are well suited to encode contact transients and are consistent with a role of somatosensory cortex in signaling transitions between task subgoals.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Open Access: Thalamocortical Afferents Innervate the Cortical Subplate much Earlier in Development in Primate than in Rodent</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy327</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy327/5298367?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The current model, based on rodent data, proposes that thalamocortical afferents (TCA) innervate the subplate towards the end of cortical neurogenesis. This implies that the laminar identity of cortical neurons is specified by intrinsic instructions rather than information of thalamic origin. In order to determine whether this mechanism is conserved in the primates, we examined the growth of thalamocortical (TCA) and corticofugal afferents in early human and monkey fetal development. In the human, TCA, identified by secretagogin, calbindin, and ROBO1 immunoreactivity, were observed in the internal capsule of the ventral telencephalon as early as 7–7.5 PCW, crossing the pallial/subpallial boundary (PSB) by 8 PCW before the calretinin immunoreactive corticofugal fibers do. Furthermore, TCA were observed to be passing through the intermediate zone and innervating the presubplate of the dorsolateral cortex, and already by 10–12 PCW TCAs were occupying much of the cortex. Observations at equivalent stages in the marmoset confirmed that this pattern is conserved across primates. Therefore, our results demonstrate that in primates, TCAs innervate the cortical presubplate at earlier stages than previously demonstrated by acetylcholinesterase histochemistry, suggesting that pioneer thalamic afferents may contribute to early cortical circuitry that can participate in defining cortical neuron phenotypes.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>In nonlinear systems, converging oscillatory inputs undergo frequency mixing, resulting in additional oscillations in the system’s response. Neural recordings exhibit spectral properties predicted by this process suggesting that not all oscillations originate from synaptic inputs rhythmically active at corresponding frequencies.</description>

	<description>The spine apparatus (SA) is an endoplasmic reticulum-related organelle which is present in a subset of dendritic spines in cortical and pyramidal neurons. The synaptopodin protein localizes between the stacks of the spine apparatus and is essential for the formation of this unique organelle. Although several studies have demonstrated the significance of the SA and synaptopodin in calcium homeostasis and plasticity of dendritic spines, it is still unclear what factors contribute to its stability at the synapse and whether the SA is locally formed or it is actively delivered to the spines. In this study we show that synaptopodin clusters are stable at their locations. We found no evidence of active microtubule-based transport for synaptopodin. Instead new clusters were emerging in the spines, which we interpret as the SA being assembled on-site. Furthermore, using super-resolution microscopy we show a tight association of synaptopodin with actin filaments. We identify the actin-based motor proteins myosin V and VI as novel interaction partners of synaptopodin and demonstrate that myosin V is important for the formation and/or maintenance of the SA.</description>

	<description>It is often assumed that Hebbian synaptic plasticity forms a cell assembly, a mutually interacting group of neurons that encodes memory. However, in recurrently connected networks with pure Hebbian plasticity, cell assemblies typically diverge or fade under ongoing changes of synaptic strength. Previously assumed mechanisms that stabilize cell assemblies do not robustly reproduce the experimentally reported unimodal and long-tailed distribution of synaptic strengths. Here, we show that augmenting Hebbian plasticity with experimentally observed intrinsic spine dynamics can stabilize cell assemblies and reproduce the distribution of synaptic strengths. Moreover, we posit that strong intrinsic spine dynamics impair learning performance. Our theory explains how excessively strong spine dynamics, experimentally observed in several animal models of autism spectrum disorder, impair learning associations in the brain.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Regionally diffuse muscle pain-hypersensitivity in humans during acute muscle pain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/525832v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/525832v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: We have previously shown that an intramuscular infusion of 5% hypertonic saline (HS) produces a painful response to normally innocuous stimuli applied to overlying and adjacent skin regions. In the current study, we explored whether a similar interaction could be observed between adjacent, contralateral and remote muscles. Indeed, widespread muscle pain-hypersensitivity is a hallmark of chronic pain conditions such as fibromyalgia. Methods: 5% HS was infused into the flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) muscle to develop a stable baseline pain (n=30). In separate experiments, each of the three test locations (n=10 per site), the adjacent abductor digiti minimi (ADM), contralateral FCU and contralateral tibialis anterior (TA) (part 1-3, respectively), 50uL of 0.9% normal saline (NS) was infused (in triplicate) prior to, during and following HS-induced muscle pain. Results: Under control conditions (no background pain), the infusion of NS was imperceptible by all subjects. In the presence of HS-induced background pain (FCU), in part 1 the NS co-infusion into ADM increased overall pain by 17%. This was replicated in the contralateral FCU (part 2) with a 12% pain increase, and in the TA (part 3) with a 15% pain increase in response to the NS co-infusions. Notably, over 80% of subjects perceived the NS-induced increase in pain at the HS-infusion location (FCU) rather than the NS-infusion location (adjacent, contralateral and remote). Conclusions: Intramuscular infusion of HS results in pain-hypersensitivity to sub-perceptual stimulation of muscle afferents in a somatotopically unrestricted manner, indicating the involvement of a central (likely supra-spinal) mechanism.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Longitudinal Trajectory of Early Functional Recovery in Patients with First Episode Psychosis</title>

	<description>There is a large variability in the recovery trajectory and outcome of first episode of psychosis [FEP] patients. To date, individuals outcome trajectories at early stage of illness and potential risk factors associated with a poor outcome trajectory are largely unknown. This study aims to apply three separate predictors (positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and soft neurological signs) to identify homogeneous function outcome trajectories in patients with FEP using objective data-driven methods, and to explore the potential risk /protective factors associated with each trajectory. Methods: A total of 369 first episode patients (93% antipsychotic naive) were included in the baseline assessments and followed-up at 4-8 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year. K means cluster modelling for longitudinal data (kml3d) was used to identify distinct, homogeneous clusters of functional outcome trajectories. Patients with at least 3 assessments were included in the trajectory analyses (N=129). The Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS), and Neurological examination abnormalities (NEA) were used as predictors against Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF). Results: In each of the three predictor models, four distinct functional outcome trajectories emerged: Poor, Intermediate, Good and Catch-up. Individuals with male gender; ethnic minority status; low premorbid adjustment; low executive function/IQ, low SES, personality disorder, substance use history may be risk factors for poor recovery. Conclusions: Functioning recovery in individuals with FEP is heterogeneous, although distinct recovery profiles are apparent. Data-driven trajectory analysis can facilitate better characterization of individual longitudinal patterns of functioning recovery.</description>

	<description>The medial thalamus (MThal), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and striatum play important roles in affective-motivational pain processing and reward learning. Opioids affect both pain and reward through uncharacterized modulation of this circuitry. This study examined opioid actions on glutamate transmission between these brain regions in mouse. Mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonists potently inhibited MThal inputs without affecting ACC inputs to individual striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs). MOR activation also inhibited MThal inputs to the pyramidal neurons in the ACC. In contrast, delta-opioid receptor (DOR) agonists disinhibited ACC pyramidal neuron responses to MThal inputs by suppressing local feed-forward GABA signaling from parvalbumin-positive interneurons. As a result, DOR activation in the ACC facilitated poly-synaptic (thalamo-cortico-striatal) excitation of MSNs by MThal inputs. These results suggest that opioid effects on pain and reward may be shaped by the relative selectivity of opioid drugs to the specific circuit components.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Neuroinflammation and protein aggregation co-localize across the frontotemporal dementia spectrum.</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/525642v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>The clinical syndromes of frontotemporal dementia are clinically and neuropathologically heterogeneous, but processes such as neuroinflammation may be common across the disease spectrum. We investigated how neuroinflammation relates to the aggregation of Tau and TDP-43 in frontotemporal dementia, and to the heterogeneity of clinical disease. We used positron emission tomography in vivo with (a) [11C]PK-11195, a marker of activated microglia and a proxy index of neuroinflammation, and (b) [18F]AV-1451, a radioligand with increased binding to pathologically affected regions in tauopathies and diseases associated with TDP-43 protein aggregation, and which is used as a surrogate marker of non-{beta}-amyloid protein aggregation. We assessed 31 patients with frontotemporal dementia (10 with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, 11 with the semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia and 10 with the non-fluent variant of primary progressive aphasia), 28 of whom underwent both [18F]AV-1451 and [11C]PK-11195 PET, and matched controls (14 for [18F]AV-1451 and 15 for [11C]PK-11195). We used univariate region-of-interest analyses, and multivariate analysis of the distribution of binding that explicitly control for individual differences in ligand affinity for TDP-43 and different Tau isoforms. We found differences between patients and controls in frontotemporal regions for both neuroinflammation and protein aggregation, and a strong positive correlation between these two processes in all disease groups. Despite this regional co-localisation, the multivariate distribution of [11C]PK-11195 binding related better to clinical heterogeneity than did the distribution of [18F]AV-1451: distinct spatial modes of neuroinflammation were associated with different frontotemporal dementia syndromes and supported accurate group classification of participants. These in vivo findings indicate a close association between neuroinflammation and protein aggregation in frontotemporal dementia. The inflammatory component may be important in shaping the clinical and neuropathological patterns of the diverse clinical syndromes of frontotemporal dementia.</description>

	<description>Fetal resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has emerged as a critical new approach for characterizing brain network development before birth. Despite rapid and widespread growth of this approach, at present we lack neuroimaging analysis pipelines suited to address the unique challenges inherent in this data type. Here, we present a comprehensive fetal data processing pipeline with provision of full code, and solve the most challenging processing step, rapid and accurate isolation of the fetal brain from surrounding tissue across thousands of non-stationary 3D brain images. Leveraging our library of more than 1,000 manually traced fetal fMRI images, we trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that achieved excellent accuracy (&amp;gt;90%) across two held-out test sets from separate populations. Furthermore, we unite the auto-masking model with a full processing pipeline and report methodology, performance, and comparison to available alternatives. This work represents the first open source, automated, start-to-finish processing pipeline for fetal fMRI data.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Automated Pupillometry to Detect Command Following in Neurological Patients: A Proof-of-Concept Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/525212v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Background: Levels of consciousness in patients with acute and chronic brain injury are notoriously underestimated. Paradigms based on electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) may detect covert consciousness in unresponsive patients but are subject to logistical challenges and the need for advanced statistical analysis. Methods: To assess the feasibility of automated pupillometry for the detection of command following, we enrolled 20 healthy volunteers and 48 patients with a wide range of neurological disorders, including 7 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), who were asked to engage in mental arithmetic. Results: Fourteen of 20 (70%) healthy volunteers and 17 of 43 (39.5%) neurological patients, including 1 in the ICU, fulfilled prespecified criteria for command following by showing pupillary dilations during [≥] 4 of 5 arithmetic tasks. None of the 5 sedated and unconscious ICU patients passed this threshold. Conclusions: Automated pupillometry combined with mental arithmetic appears to be a promising paradigm for the detection of covert consciousness in people with brain injury. We plan to build on this study by focusing on non-communicating ICU patients in whom the level of consciousness is unknown. If some of these patients show reproducible pupillary dilation during mental arithmetic, this would suggest that the present paradigm can reveal conscious awareness in unresponsive patients in whom standard investigations have failed to detect signs of covert consciousness.</description>

	<description>Learning biases decision-making towards higher expected outcomes. Cognitive theories describe this through the tracking of value and outcome evaluations within striatum and prefrontal cortex. Decisions however first require processing of sensory input, and to-date, far less is known about the learning perception interplay. This fMRI study (N=43), relates visual BOLD responses to value-beliefs during choice, and, signed prediction errors after outcomes. To understand these relationships, which co-occurred in striatum, we next evaluated relevance with the prediction of future value-based choices, using a separate transfer-phase with learning already established. We decoded choice outcomes with a 69% accuracy with a machine learning algorithm that was given trial-by-trial BOLD from visual regions alongside traditional prefrontal, and striatal regions. Importantly, this decoding of value-driven choice outcomes again showed an important role for visual activity. These results raise the intriguing possibility that value learning in visual cortex is supportive for the striatal bias towards valued options.</description>

Genetic mutant analysis in the nematode &lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt; has revealed common molecular programs that control neuronal identity. Neuron type-specific combinations of transcription factors, called terminal selectors, act as master regulatory factors to initiate and maintain terminal identity programs through direct regulation of neuron type-specific effector genes. We will provide here an update on recent studies that solidify the terminal selector concept in worms, flies and chordates. We will also describe how the terminal selector concept has been expanded by recent work in &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; to explain neuronal subtype diversification and plasticity of neuronal identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate the initial termination rate of status epilepticus (SE) in a large observational study, and to explore associated variables.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data of adults treated for SE were collected prospectively in centers in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, during 4.5 years. Incident episodes of 1,049 patients were analyzed using uni‐ and multivariate statistics to determine factors predicting cessation of SE within 1 hour (for generalized convulsive SE, GCSE) and 12 hours (for non‐GCSE) of initiating treatment.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Median age at SE onset was 70 years; most frequent etiologies were remote (32%) and acute (31%). GCSE was documented in 43%. Median latency between SE onset and first treatment was 30 minutes in GCSE and 150 minutes in non‐GCSE. The first intravenous compound was a benzodiazepine in 86% in GCSE, and 73% in non‐GCSE. Bolus doses of the first treatment step were lower than recommended by current guidelines in 76% of the GCSE patients and 78% of the non‐GCSE patients. In 319 GCSE patients (70%), SE was ongoing 1 hour after initiating treatment, and in 342 non‐GCSE patients (58%) 12 hours after initiating treatment. Multivariate Cox regression demonstrated that the use of benzodiazepines as first treatment step, and a higher cumulative dose of anticonvulsants within the first period of treatment were associated with shorter time to cessation of SE for both groups.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In clinical practice, treatment guidelines were not followed in a substantial proportion of patients. This under‐dosing correlated with lack of cessation of SE. Our data suggest that sufficiently dosed benzodiazepines should be used as first treatment step.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: In vivo metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5 abnormalities localize the epileptogenic zone in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25404?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surgical specimens from patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) show abnormalities in tissue concentrations of metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5 (mGluR5). To clarify whether these abnormalities are specific to the epileptogenic zone (EZ), we characterized in vivo whole‐brain mGluR5 availability in MTLE patients using positron emission tomography (PET) and [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]ABP688, a radioligand that binds specifically to the mGluR5 allosteric site.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty‐one unilateral MTLE patients and 30 healthy controls underwent [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]ABP688 PET. We compared partial volume corrected [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]ABP688 nondisplaceable binding potentials (BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt;) between groups using region‐of‐interest and whole‐brain voxelwise analyses. [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET was acquired in 15 patients, for whom we calculated asymmetry indices of [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]ABP688 BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt; and [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG uptake to compare lateralization and localization differences.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]ABP688 BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt; was focally reduced in the epileptogenic hippocampal head and amygdala (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Patients with hippocampal atrophy showed more extensive abnormalities, including the ipsilateral temporal neocortex (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.006). [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]ABP688 BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt; showed interhemispheric differences of higher magnitude and discriminated the epileptogenic structures more accurately when compared to [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG uptake, which showed more widespread hypometabolism. Among 23 of 25 operated patients with &amp;gt;1 year of follow‐up, 13 were seizure‐free (Engel Ia) and showed significantly lower [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]ABP688 BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt; in the ipsilateral entorhinal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]ABP688 PET provides a focal biomarker for the EZ in MTLE with higher spatial accuracy compared to [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG PET. Focally reduced mGluR5 availability in the EZ might reflect receptor internalization or conformational changes in response to excessive extracellular glutamate, supporting a potential role for mGluR5 as therapeutic target in human MTLE.

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disorders of consciousness (DOC) are a common consequence of severe brain injuries, and clinical evaluation is critical to provide a correct diagnosis and prognosis. The revised Motor Behavior Tool (MBT‐r) is a clinical complementary tool aiming to identify subtle motor behaviors that might reflect residual cognition in DOC. In this prospective study including 30 DOC patients in the early stage after brain injury, we show that the revised MBT‐r has an excellent inter‐rater agreement and has the ability to identify a subgroup of patients, underestimated by the Coma Recovery Scale‐Revised, showing residual cognition and a subsequent recovery of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Defining a complete set of cell types within the cortex requires reconciling disparate results achieved through diverging methodologies. To address this correspondence problem, multiple methodologies must be applied to the same cells in multiple single-cell experiments. Here we present an approach in which spatial transcriptomics using multiplexed fluorescence in situ hybridization (mFISH) on tissue previously interrogated through two-photon optogenetic mapping of synaptic connectivity can resolve the anatomical, transcriptomic, connectomic, electrophysiological, and morphological characteristics of single cells within the mouse cortex.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Modular structure of human olfactory receptor codes reflects the bases of odor perception</title>

	<description>The circuits of olfactory signaling are reminiscent of complex computational devices. The olfactory receptor code, which represents the responses of receptors elicited by olfactory stimuli, is effectively an input code for the neural computation of odor sensing. Here, analyzing a recent dataset of the responses of human olfactory receptors (ORs) to odorants, we show that the space of human olfactory receptor codes is partitioned into a modular structure where groups of receptors are &quot;labeled&quot; for key olfactory features. The existence of such independent and sizable receptor groups implies a significant dimensional reduction in the space of human odor perception. Our data-driven statistical analysis of receptor codes leads to a valuable discovery that human olfaction works by hybridizing both the combinatorial coding and labeled line strategies, even at the early stage of signal processing.</description>

	<description>The serial-position effect in working memory is considered important for studying how a sequence of sensory information can be retained and manipulated simultaneously in neural memory circuits. Here, via a precise analysis of the primacy and recency effects in human psychophysical experiments, we propose that stable and flexible coding take distinct roles of retaining and updating information in working memory, and that their combination induces serial-position effects spontaneously. We found that stable encoding retains memory to induce the primacy effect, while flexible encoding used for learning new inputs induces the recency effect. A model simulation based on human data, confirmed that a neural network with both flexible and stable synapses could reproduce the major characteristics of serial-position effects. Our new prediction, that the control of resource allocation by flexible-stable coding balance can modulate memory performance in sequence-specific manner, was supported by pre-cued memory performance data in humans.</description>

	<description>Labeling and perturbation of specific cell types in multicellular systems has transformed our ability to understand them. The rapid pace of cell type identification by new single-cell analysis methods has not been met with efficient access to these newly discovered types. To enable access to specific neural populations in the mouse cortex, we have collected single cell chromatin accessibility data from select cell types. We clustered the single cell data and mapped them to single cell transcriptomics to identify highly specific enhancers for cell subclasses. These enhancers, when cloned into AAVs and delivered to the brain by retro-orbital injections, enable transgene expression in specific cell subclasses throughout the mouse brain. This approach will enable functional investigation of cell types in the mouse cortex and beyond.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Feeling left out or just surprised? Neural correlates of social exclusion and expectancy violations in adolescence</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/524934v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/524934v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Social belonging and affiliation are important human drives that impact decision-making and health outcomes. While neural responses to social exclusion are increasingly well-characterized, studies rarely identify whether these responses reflect the affective distress or expectancy violation associated with exclusion. The present study compares neural responses to exclusion and over-inclusion, a similarly unexpected social occurrence that violates fair play expectations, but does not involve rejection, with a focus on implications for models of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) function. In an fMRI adaptation of the Cyberball paradigm with human adolescents 11.1-17.7 years of age (N=69), we employed parametric modulators to examine scaling of neural signal with cumulative exclusion and inclusion events. The use of parametric modulators overcomes arbitrary definitions of condition onsets and offsets imposed on fluid, continuous gameplay. In support of the notion that the dACC plays a role in processing affective distress, this region exhibited greater signal with cumulative exclusion than cumulative inclusion events. However, this difference was partly driven by diminished signal accompanying cumulative inclusion, a finding that does not conform to either affective distress or expectancy violation model predictions. Additionally, we found that signal in the insula and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex scaled uniquely with social exclusion and over-inclusion, respectively, while conjunction analyses revealed that the rostromedial prefrontal cortex and left intraparietal sulcus responded similarly to both conditions. These findings shed light on which neural regions may exhibit patterns of differential sensitivity to exclusion or over-inclusion, as well as those that are more broadly engaged by both types of social interaction.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: OpenCASA: A new open-source and scalable tool for sperm quality analysis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Carlos Alquézar-Baeta, Silvia Gimeno-Martos, Sara Miguel-Jiménez, Pilar Santolaria, Jesús Yániz, Inmaculada Palacín, Adriana Casao, José Álvaro Cebrián-Pérez, Teresa Muiño-Blanco, Rosaura Pérez-Pé&lt;/p&gt;

In the field of assisted reproductive techniques (ART), computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) systems have proved their utility and potential for assessing sperm quality, improving the prediction of the fertility potential of a seminal dose. Although most laboratories and scientific centers use commercial systems, in the recent years certain free and open-source alternatives have emerged that can reduce the costs that research groups have to face. However, these open-source alternatives cannot analyze sperm kinetic responses to different stimuli, such as chemotaxis, thermotaxis or rheotaxis. In addition, the programs released to date have not usually been designed to encourage the scalability and the continuity of software development. We have developed an open-source CASA software, called OpenCASA, which allows users to study three classical sperm quality parameters: motility, morphodmetry and membrane integrity (viability) and offers the possibility of analyzing the guided movement response of spermatozoa to different stimuli (useful for chemotaxis, thermotaxis or rheotaxis studies) or different motile cells such as bacteria, using a single software. This software has been released in a Version Control System at Github. This platform will allow researchers not only to download the software but also to be involved in and contribute to further developments. Additionally, a Google group has been created to allow the research community to interact and discuss OpenCASA. For validation of the OpenCASA software, we analysed different simulated sperm populations (for chemotaxis module) and evaluated 36 ejaculates obtained from 12 fertile rams using other sperm analysis systems (for motility, membrane integrity and morphology modules). The results were compared with those obtained by Open-CASA using the Pearson’s correlation and Bland-Altman tests, obtaining a high level of correlation in all parameters and a good agreement between the different used methods and the OpenCASA. With this work, we propose an open-source project oriented to the development of a new software application for sperm quality analysis. This proposed software will use a minimally centralized infrastructure to allow the continued development of its modules by the research community.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/26i5OktndI4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A Manifold Regularized Multi-Task Learning Model for IQ Prediction from Multiple fMRI Paradigms. (arXiv:1901.05913v1 [q-bio.QM])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multi-modal brain functional connectivity (FC) data have shown great
potential for providing insights into individual variations in behavioral and
cognitive traits. The joint learning of multi-modal imaging data can utilize
the intrinsic association, and thus can boost the learning performance.
Although several multi-task based learning models have already been proposed by
viewing the feature learning on each modality as one task, most of them ignore
the geometric structure information inherent in the modalities, which may play
an important role in extracting discriminative features. In this paper, we
propose a new manifold regularized multi-task learning model by simultaneously
considering between-subject and between-modality relationships. Besides
employing a group-sparsity regularizer to jointly select a few common features
across multiple tasks (modalities), we design a novel manifold regularizer to
preserve the structure information both within and between modalities in our
model. This will make our model more adaptive for realistic data analysis. Our
model is then validated on the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort dataset,
where we regard our modalities as functional MRI (fMRI) data collected under
two paradigms. Specifically, we conduct experimental studies on fMRI based FC
network data in two task conditions for intelligence quotient (IQ) prediction.
The results demonstrate that our proposed model can not only achieve improved
prediction performance, but also yield a set of IQ-relevant biomarkers.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Early Salient Region Selection Does Not Drive Rapid Visual Categorization. (arXiv:1901.04908v1 [cs.CV] CROSS LISTED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The current dominant visual processing paradigm in both human and machine
research is the feedforward, layered hierarchy of neural-like processing
elements. Within this paradigm, visual saliency is seen by many to have a
specific role, namely that of early selection. Early selection is thought to
enable very fast visual performance by limiting processing to only the most
relevant candidate portions of an image. Though this strategy has indeed led to
improved processing time efficiency in machine algorithms, at least one set of
critical tests of this idea has never been performed with respect to the role
of early selection in human vision. How would the best of the current saliency
models perform on the stimuli used by experimentalists who first provided
evidence for this visual processing paradigm? Would the algorithms really
provide correct candidate sub-images to enable fast categorization on those
same images? Here, we report on a new series of tests of these questions whose
results suggest that it is quite unlikely that such an early selection process
has any role in human rapid visual categorization.

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Identification of a bilirubin receptor that may mediate a component of cholestatic itch</title>

	<description>Various pathologic conditions result in jaundice, a yellowing of the skin due to a buildup of bilirubin. Patients with jaundice commonly report experiencing an intense non-histaminergic itch. Despite this association, the pruritogenic capacity of bilirubin itself has not been explored, and no bilirubin receptor has been identified. Here, we demonstrate that pathophysiologic levels of bilirubin excite peripheral itch sensory neurons and elicit pruritus through MRGPRs, a family of G-protein coupled receptors expressed in primary sensory neurons. Bilirubin binds and activates two MRGPRs, mouse MRGPRA1 and human MRGPRX4. In two mouse models of pathologic hyperbilirubinemia, we show that genetic deletion of either &lt;i&gt;Mrgpra1&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Blvra&lt;/i&gt;, the gene that encodes the bilirubin-producing enzyme, attenuates itch. Similarly, plasma isolated from hyperbilirubinemic patients evoked itch in wild-type animals but not &lt;i&gt;Mrgpra1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; animals. Removing bilirubin decreased the pruritogenic capacity of patient plasma. Based on these data, targeting MRGPRs is a promising strategy for alleviating jaundice-associated itch.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: HDAC3 restrains CD8-lineage genes to maintain a bi-potential state in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes for CD4-lineage commitment</title>

	<description>CD4 and CD8 T cells are vital components of the immune system. We found that histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) is critical for the development of CD4 T cells, as HDAC3-deficient DP thymocytes generate only CD8SP thymocytes in mice. In the absence of HDAC3, MHC Class II-restricted OT-II thymocytes are redirected to the CD8 cytotoxic lineage, which occurs with accelerated kinetics. Analysis of histone acetylation and RNA-seq reveals that HDAC3-deficient DP thymocytes are biased towards the CD8 lineage prior to positive selection. Commitment to the CD4 or CD8 lineage is determined by whether persistent TCR signaling or cytokine signaling predominates, respectively. Despite elevated IL-21R/γc/STAT5 signaling in HDAC3-deficient DP thymocytes, blocking IL-21R does not restore CD4 lineage commitment. Instead, HDAC3 binds directly to CD8-lineage promoting genes. Thus, HDAC3 is required to restrain CD8-lineage genes in DP thymocytes for the generation of CD4 T cells.</description>

	<description>It is often assumed that highly-branched neuronal structures perform compartmentalized computations. Instead, the Gastric Mill (GM) neuron in the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion (STG) operates like a single electrotonic compartment, despite having thousands of branch points and total cable length &amp;gt;10 mm (Otopalik et al., 2017a, b). We now show: 1) that compact electrotonic architecture is generalizable to other STG neuron types, 2) these neurons present direction-insensitive, linear voltage integration, suggesting they pool synaptic inputs across their neuronal structures. 3) Simulations of 720 cable models spanning a broad range of geometries and passive properties show that compact electrotonus, linear integration, and directional insensitivity in STG neurons arise from their neurite geometries (diameters tapering from 10-20 µm to &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; 2 µm at their terminal tips). A broad parameter search reveals multiple morphological and biophysical solutions for achieving different degrees of passive electrotonic decrement and computational strategies in the absence of active properties.</description>

	<description>The highly organized spatial arrangement of sensory hair cells in the organ of Corti is essential for inner ear function. Here, we report a new analytical pipeline, based on optical clearing of tissue, for the construction of a single-cell resolution map of the organ of Corti. A sorbitol-based optical clearing method enabled imaging of the entire cochlea at subcellular resolution. High-fidelity detection and analysis of all hair cell positions along the entire longitudinal axis of the organ of Corti were performed automatically by machine learning–based pattern recognition. Application of this method to samples from young, adult, and noise-exposed mice extracted essential information regarding cellular pathology, including longitudinal and radial spatial characteristics of cell loss, implying that multiple mechanisms underlie clustered cell loss. Our method of cellular mapping is effective for system-level phenotyping of the organ of Corti under both physiological and pathological conditions.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/40372</link>
	<description>The meiotic chromosome axis plays key roles in meiotic chromosome organization and recombination, yet the underlying protein components of this structure are highly diverged. Here, we show that 'axis core proteins' from budding yeast (Red1), mammals (SYCP2/SYCP3), and plants (ASY3/ASY4) are evolutionarily related and play equivalent roles in chromosome axis assembly. We first identify 'closure motifs' in each complex that recruit meiotic HORMADs, the master regulators of meiotic recombination. We next find that axis core proteins form homotetrameric (Red1) or heterotetrameric (SYCP2:SYCP3 and ASY3:ASY4) coiled-coil assemblies that further oligomerize into micron-length filaments. Thus, the meiotic chromosome axis core in fungi, mammals, and plants shares a common molecular architecture, and likely also plays conserved roles in meiotic chromosome axis assembly and recombination control.</description>

	<description>Neurotransmitter release requires formation of trans-SNARE complexes between the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes, which likely underlies synaptic vesicle priming to a release-ready state. It is unknown whether Munc18-1, Munc13-1, complexin-1 and synaptotagmin-1 are important for priming because they mediate trans-SNARE complex assembly and/or because they prevent trans-SNARE complex disassembly by NSF-aSNAP, which can lead to de-priming. Here we show that trans-SNARE complex formation in the presence of NSF-aSNAP requires both Munc18-1 and Munc13-1, as proposed previously, and is facilitated by synaptotagmin-1. Our data also show that Munc18-1, Munc13-1, complexin-1 and likely synaptotagmin-1 contribute to maintaining assembled trans-SNARE complexes in the presence of NSF-aSNAP. We propose a model whereby Munc18-1 and Munc13-1 are critical not only for mediating vesicle priming but also for precluding de-priming by preventing trans-SNARE complex disassembly; in this model, complexin-1 also impairs de-priming, while synaptotagmin-1 may assist in priming and hinder de-priming.</description>

	<description>JCVI-syn3A, a robust minimal cell with a 543 kbp genome and 493 genes, provides a versatile platform to study the basics of life. Using the vast amount of experimental information available on its precursor, &lt;i&gt;Mycoplasma mycoides capri&lt;/i&gt;, we assembled a near-complete metabolic network with 98% of enzymatic reactions supported by annotation or experiment. The model agrees well with genome-scale &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; transposon mutagenesis experiments, showing a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.59. The genes in the reconstruction have a high &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; essentiality or quasi-essentiality of 92% (68% essential), compared to 79% &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; essentiality. This coherent model of the minimal metabolism in JCVI-syn3A at the same time also points toward specific open questions regarding the minimal genome of JCVI-syn3A, which still contains many genes of generic or completely unclear function. In particular, the model, its comparison to &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; essentiality and proteomics data yield specific hypotheses on gene functions and metabolic capabilities; and provide suggestions for several further gene removals. In this way, the model and its accompanying data guide future investigations of the minimal cell. Finally, the identification of 30 essential genes with unclear function will motivate the search for new biological mechanisms beyond metabolism.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Domain-specific working memory, but not dopamine-related genetic variability, shapes reward-based motor learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/524900v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>The addition of rewarding feedback to motor learning tasks has been shown to increase the retention of learning, spurring interest in the possible utility for rehabilitation. However, laboratory-based motor tasks employing rewarding feedback have repeatedly been shown to lead to great inter-individual variability in performance. Understanding the causes of such variability is vital for maximising the potential benefits of reward-based motor learning. Thus, in this pre-registered study, we assessed whether spatial (SWM), verbal (VWM) and mental rotation (RWM) working memory capacity as well as dopamine-related genetic profiles could predict performance in two reward-based motor tasks, using a large cohort of participants (N=241). The first task assessed participant's ability to follow a hidden and slowly shifting reward region based on hit/miss (binary) feedback. The second task investigated participant's capacity to preserve performance with binary feedback after adapting to the shift with full visual feedback. Our results demonstrate that SWM strongly predicts a participant's capacity to reliably reproduce a successful motor action, measured as change in reach angle following reward, while RWM predicted a participant's propensity to express an explicit strategy when required to make large adjustments in reach angle. Therefore, both SWM and RWM were reliable predictors of success during reward-based motor learning. Change in reach direction following failure was also a strong predictor of success rate, although we observed no consistent relationship with any type of working memory. Surprisingly, no dopamine-related genotypes predicted performance. Therefore, working memory capacity plays a pivotal in determining individual ability in reward-based motor learning.</description>

	<description>Over 1250 mutations in SCN1A, the voltage-gated sodium channel gene Nav1.1, are associated with seizure disorders including GEFS+ and Dravet Syndrome (DS). To evaluate how a specific mutation, independent of genetic background, causes seizure activity we generated two pairs of isogenic human iPSC lines by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. One pair is a control line from an unaffected sibling, and the mutated control carrying the GEFS+ K1270T SCN1A mutation. The second pair is a GEFS+ patient line with the K1270T mutation, and the corrected patient line. By comparing the electrophysiological properties in inhibitory and excitatory iPSC-derived neurons from these pairs, we found the K1270T mutation causes gene dosage-dependent and cell type-specific alterations in sodium current density and evoked firing, resulting in hyperactive neural networks. We also identified differences associated with genetic background and interaction between the mutation and genetic background. Dual isogenic iPSC-derived neuronal cultures provide a novel platform for developing patient-specific anti-seizure therapies.</description>

	<description>The process of myelination in the nervous system requires coordinated formation of both transient and stable supramolecular complexes. Myelin-specific proteins play key roles in these assemblies, which may link membranes to each other or connect the myelinating cell cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. The myelin protein periaxin is known to play an important role in linking the Schwann cell cytoskeleton to the basal lamina through membrane receptors, such as the dystroglycan complex. Mutations that truncate periaxin from the C terminus cause demyelinating peripheral neuropathy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4F, indicating a function for the periaxin C-terminal region in myelination. We identified the cytoplasmic domain of {beta}4 integrin as a specific high-affinity binding partner for periaxin. The C-terminal region of periaxin remains unfolded and flexible when bound to the third fibronectin type III domain of {beta}4 integrin. Our data suggest that periaxin is able to link the Schwann cell cytoplasm to the basal lamina through a two-pronged interaction via different membrane protein complexes, which bind close to the N and C terminus of this elongated, flexible molecule.</description>

	<description>White matter development continues throughout childhood and into early adulthood, but few studies have examined early childhood, and the specific trajectories and regional variation in this age range remain unclear. The aim of this study was to characterize developmental trajectories and sex differences of white matter in typically developing young children. Three hundred and ninety-six diffusion tensor imaging datasets from 120 children (57 male) aged 2-8 years were analyzed using tractography. Fractional anisotropy (FA) increased and mean diffusivity (MD) decreased in all white matter tracts by 5-15% over the 6-year period, likely reflecting increases in myelination and axonal packing. Males showed steeper slopes in a number of brain areas. Overall, early childhood is associated with substantial development of all white matter and appears to be an important period for the development of occipital and limbic connections, which showed the largest changes. This study provides a detailed characterization of age-related white matter changes in early childhood, offering baseline data that can be used to understand cognitive and behavioural development, as well as to identify deviations from normal development in children with various diseases, disorders, or brain injuries.</description>

	<description>The calcium calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a dodecameric holoenzyme important for encoding memory. Its activation, triggered by binding of calcium calmodulin, persists autonomously after calmodulin dissociation. One (receiver) kinase captures and subsequently phosphorylates the regulatory domain peptide of a donor kinase forming a chained dimer as a first stage of autonomous activation. Protein dynamics simulations examined the conformational changes triggered by dimer formation and phosphorylation, aimed to provide a molecular rationale for human mutations that result in learning disabilities. Ensembles generated from X-ray crystal structures were characterized by network centrality and community analysis. Mutual information related collective motions to local fragment dynamics encoded with a structural alphabet. Implicit solvent tCONCOORD conformational ensembles revealed the dynamic architecture of Inactive kinase do-mains was co-opted in the activated dimer but the network hub shifted from the nucleotide binding cleft to the captured peptide. Explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) showed nucleotide and substrate binding determinants formed coupled nodes in long-range signal relays between regulatory peptides in the dimer. Strain in the extended captured peptide was balanced by reduced flexibility of the receiver kinase C-lobe core. The relays were organized around a hydrophobic patch between the captured peptide and a key binding helix. The human mutations aligned along the relays. Thus, these mutations could disrupt the allosteric network alternatively, or in addition, to altered binding affinities. Non-binding protein sectors distant from the binding sites mediated the allosteric signalling; providing possible targets for inhibitor design. Phosphorylation of the peptide modulated the dielectric of its binding pocket to strengthen the patch, non-binding sectors, domain interface and temporal correlations between parallel relays. These results provide the molecular details underlying the reported positive kinase cooperativity to enrich discussion on how autonomous activation by phosphorylation leads to long-term behavioural effects.</description>

	<description>In order to further our understanding of how gene expression contributes to key functional properties of neurons, we combined publicly accessible gene expression, electrophysiology, and morphology measurements to identify cross-cell type correlations between these data modalities. Building on our previous work using a similar approach, we distinguished between correlations which were &quot;class-driven,&quot; meaning those that could be explained by differences between excitatory and inhibitory cell classes, and those that reflected graded phenotypic differences within classes. Taking cell class identity into account increased the degree to which our results replicated in an independent dataset as well as their correspondence with known modes of ion channel function based on the literature. We also found a smaller set of genes whose relationships to electrophysiological or morphological properties appear to be specific to either excitatory or inhibitory cell types. Next, using data from Patch-seq experiments, allowing simultaneous single-cell characterization of gene expression and electrophysiology, we found that some of the gene-property correlations observed across cell types were further predictive of within-cell type heterogeneity. In summary, we have identified a number of relationships between gene expression, electrophysiology, and morphology that provide testable hypotheses for future studies.</description>

Complex eukaryotic promoters normally contain multiple cis-regulatory sequences for different transcription factors (TFs). The binding patterns of the TFs to these sites, as well as the way the TFs interact with each other and with the RNA polymerase (RNAp), lead to combinatorial problems rarely understood in detail, especially under varying epigenetic conditions. The aim of this paper is to build a model describing how the main regulatory cluster of the olfactory receptor Or59b drives transcription of this gene in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. The cluster-driven expression of this gene is represented as the equilibrium probability of RNAp being bound to the promoter region, using a statistical thermodynamic approach. The RNAp equilibrium probability is computed in terms of the occupancy probabilities of the single TFs of the cluster to the corresponding binding sites, and of the interaction rules among TFs and RNAp, using experimental data of Or59b expression to tune the model parameters. The model reproduces correctly the changes in RNAp binding probability induced by various mutation of specific sites and epigenetic modifications. Some of its predictions have also been validated in novel experiments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OzMB2Hh3nOo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) typically contain multiple autophosphorylation sites in their cytoplasmic domains. Once activated, these autophosphorylation sites can recruit downstream signaling proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains, which recognize phosphotyrosine-containing short linear motifs (SLiMs). These domains and SLiMs have polyspecific or promiscuous binding activities. Thus, multiple signaling proteins may compete for binding to a common SLiM and vice versa. To investigate the effects of competition on RTK signaling, we used a rule-based modeling approach to develop and analyze models for ligand-induced recruitment of SH2/PTB domain-containing proteins to autophosphorylation sites in the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) receptor (IGF1R). Models were parameterized using published datasets reporting protein copy numbers and site-specific binding affinities. Simulations were facilitated by a novel application of model restructuration, to reduce redundancy in rule-derived equations. We compare predictions obtained via numerical simulation of the model to those obtained through simple prediction methods, such as through an analytical approximation, or ranking by copy number and/or K&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; value, and find that the simple methods are unable to recapitulate the predictions of numerical simulations. We created 45 cell line-specific models that demonstrate how early events in IGF1R signaling depend on the protein abundance profile of a cell. Simulations, facilitated by model restructuration, identified pairs of IGF1R binding partners that are recruited in anti-correlated and correlated fashions, despite no inclusion of cooperativity in our models. This work shows that the outcome of competition depends on the physicochemical parameters that characterize pairwise interactions, as well as network properties, including network connectivity and the relative abundances of competitors.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FF8MbA9TfH8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: STRFs in primary auditory cortex emerge from masking-based statistics of natural sounds</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006595</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Abdul-Saboor Sheikh, Nicol S. Harper, Jakob Drefs, Yosef Singer, Zhenwen Dai, Richard E. Turner, Jörg Lücke&lt;/p&gt;

We investigate how the neural processing in auditory cortex is shaped by the statistics of natural sounds. Hypothesising that auditory cortex (A1) represents the structural primitives out of which sounds are composed, we employ a statistical model to extract such components. The input to the model are cochleagrams which approximate the non-linear transformations a sound undergoes from the outer ear, through the cochlea to the auditory nerve. Cochleagram components do not superimpose linearly, but rather according to a rule which can be approximated using the max function. This is a consequence of the compression inherent in the cochleagram and the sparsity of natural sounds. Furthermore, cochleagrams do not have negative values. Cochleagrams are therefore not matched well by the assumptions of standard linear approaches such as sparse coding or ICA. We therefore consider a new encoding approach for natural sounds, which combines a model of early auditory processing with maximal causes analysis (MCA), a sparse coding model which captures both the non-linear combination rule and non-negativity of the data. An efficient truncated EM algorithm is used to fit the MCA model to cochleagram data. We characterize the generative fields (GFs) inferred by MCA with respect to &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; neural responses in A1 by applying reverse correlation to estimate spectro-temporal receptive fields (STRFs) implied by the learned GFs. Despite the GFs being non-negative, the STRF estimates are found to contain both positive and negative subfields, where the negative subfields can be attributed to explaining away effects as captured by the applied inference method. A direct comparison with ferret A1 shows many similar forms, and the spectral and temporal modulation tuning of both ferret and model STRFs show similar ranges over the population. In summary, our model represents an alternative to linear approaches for biological auditory encoding while it captures salient data properties and links inhibitory subfields to explaining away effects.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9z31h2VhhpY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Sequential infection experiments for quantifying innate and adaptive immunity during influenza infection</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006568</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Ada W. C. Yan, Sophie G. Zaloumis, Julie A. Simpson, James M. McCaw&lt;/p&gt;

Laboratory models are often used to understand the interaction of related pathogens via host immunity. For example, recent experiments where ferrets were exposed to two influenza strains within a short period of time have shown how the effects of cross-immunity vary with the time between exposures and the specific strains used. On the other hand, studies of the workings of different arms of the immune response, and their relative importance, typically use experiments involving a single infection. However, inferring the relative importance of different immune components from this type of data is challenging. Using simulations and mathematical modelling, here we investigate whether the sequential infection experiment design can be used not only to determine immune components contributing to cross-protection, but also to gain insight into the immune response during a single infection. We show that virological data from sequential infection experiments can be used to accurately extract the timing and extent of cross-protection. Moreover, the broad immune components responsible for such cross-protection can be determined. Such data can also be used to infer the timing and strength of some immune components in controlling a primary infection, even in the absence of serological data. By contrast, single infection data cannot be used to reliably recover this information. Hence, sequential infection data enhances our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the control and resolution of infection, and generates new insight into how previous exposure influences the time course of a subsequent infection.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/w7DAFCOVv-I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the rate of tau accumulation in healthy older adults (OA) and patients with Alzheimer disease (AD), as well as the relationship of tau accumulation to cortical atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two longitudinal flortaucipir (FTP) positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were acquired from 42 OA (21 Pittsburg compound B [PiB]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, age = 77.6 ± 4.6 years, 25 female [F]/17 male [M]) and 19 PiB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; patients with AD (age = 63.1 ± 10.3 years, 12 F/7 M) over 1 to 3 years of follow‐up. FTP change, structural MRI measures of atrophy, and cross‐modal correlations were examined on a voxelwise level. Regional annual percentage change in FTP was also calculated.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voxelwise FTP change in AD showed the greatest increases in lateral and medial frontal lobes. Atrophy over the same interval was more widespread and included posteromedial cortical areas, where tau accumulation rates were lower. In OA, FTP binding increased in bilateral temporal lobe and retrosplenial cortex, accompanied by atrophy in the same regions. There were no associations between voxelwise change in FTP and sex, PiB, or &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;. Regional FTP significantly increased at follow‐up in OA and patients with AD. Mixed effects models showed greater FTP increases in AD compared to OA, and no differences within OA based on PiB status.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings indicate that tau accumulates even in amyloid‐negative healthy OA and this process can be measured with in vivo tau‐PET. In OA, tau accumulation and atrophy share a similar topography. In AD, tau increases more rapidly and accumulation occurs in frontal regions that are not yet undergoing significant atrophy.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Amyloid‐β transmission has been described in patients both with and without iatrogenic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease; however, there is little information regarding the clinical impact of this acquired amyloid‐β pathology during life. Here, for the first time, we describe in detail the clinical and neuroimaging findings in 3 patients with early onset symptomatic amyloid‐β cerebral amyloid angiopathy following childhood exposure to cadaveric dura (by neurosurgical grafting in 2 patients and tumor embolization in a third). Our observations provide further in vivo evidence that cerebral amyloid angiopathy might be caused by transmission of amyloid‐β seeds (prions) present in cadaveric dura and have diagnostic relevance for younger patients presenting with suspected cerebral amyloid angiopathy.

Some mammalian lineages, such as primates, exhibit exceptionally large cortices relative to the amount of sensory inputs from the dorsal thalamus, and this expansion is associated with a larger number of distinct cortical areas, composing a larger proportion of the cortical sheet. We propose a link between the organization of the neocortex and its expansion relative to the size of the dorsal thalamus, based on a combination of work in comparative neuroanatomy and experimental research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) increases risk of dementia, a relationship that may be mediated by amyloid‐β (Aβ) and downstream Alzheimer disease pathology. We previously showed that OSA may impair Aβ clearance and affect the relationship between slow wave activity (SWA) and Aβ. In this study, SWA and CSF Aβ were measured in participants with OSA before and 1 to 4 months after treatment. OSA treatment increased SWA, and SWA was significantly correlated with lower Aβ after treatment. Greater improvement in OSA was associated with greater decreases in Aβ. We propose a model whereby OSA treatment may affect both Aβ release and clearance. Ann Neurol 2018&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigated the relationship between the interictal metabolic patterns, the extent of resection of &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F‐fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;FDG‐PET) hypometabolism, and seizure outcomes in patients with unilateral drug‐resistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) following anterior temporal lobe (TL) resection.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eighty‐two patients with hippocampal sclerosis or normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, concordant &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;FDG‐PET hypometabolism, and at least 2 years of postoperative follow‐up were included in this 2‐center study. The hypometabolic regions in each patient were identified with reference to 20 healthy controls (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.005). The resected TL volume and the volume of resected TL PET hypometabolism (TLH) were calculated from the pre‐ and postoperative MRI scans coregistered with interictal &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;FDG‐PET.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Striking differences in metabolic patterns were observed depending on the lateralization of the epileptogenic TL. The extent of the ipsilateral TLH was significantly greater in left MTLE patients &lt;i&gt;(p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), whereas right MTLE patients had significantly higher rates of contralateral (CTL) TLH (&lt;i&gt;p =&lt;/i&gt; 0.016). In right MTLE patients, CTL hypometabolism was the strongest predictor of an unfavorable seizure outcome, associated with a 5‐fold increase in the likelihood of seizure recurrence (odds ratio [OR] = 4.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07–22.39, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04). In left MTLE patients, greater extent of resection of ipsilateral TLH was associated with lower rates of seizure recurrence (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.004) in univariate analysis; however, its predictive value did not reach statistical significance (OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.90–1.02, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.19).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference in metabolic patterns depending on the lateralization of MTLE may represent distinct epileptic networks in patients with right versus left MTLE, and can guide preoperative counseling and surgical planning. Ann Neurol 2019; 1–10&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We investigated changes of after‐image duration in migraineurs and healthy controls (HCs) and throughout the migraine cycle to depict changes in the excitatory/inhibitory equilibrium within the visual cortex. Forty‐seven episodic (EMs) and 39 chronic migraineurs (CMs; interictal) were compared to 34 HCs for visual after‐image duration. Additionally, seven EMs were investigated every consecutive day over 20 to 32 days using the identical paradigm throughout the migraine cycle. Interictally, the after‐image duration was shorter compared to HCs, but significantly longer in the ictal compared to interictal phase. These data suggest an altered excitatory/inhibitory equilibrium in migraineurs, which oscillates over the migraine cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dysregulation of γ‐aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) transmission has been reported in lesional acquired epilepsies (gliomas, hippocampal sclerosis). We investigated its involvement in a developmental disorder, human focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), focusing on chloride regulation driving GABAergic signals.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In vitro recordings of 47 human cortical acute slices from 11 pediatric patients who received operations for FCD were performed on multielectrode arrays. GABAergic receptors and chloride regulators were pharmacologically modulated. Immunostaining for chloride cotransporter KCC2 and interneurons were performed on recorded slices to correlate electrophysiology and expression patterns.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FCD slices retain intrinsic epileptogenicity. Thirty‐six of 47 slices displayed spontaneous interictal discharges, along with a pattern specific to the histological subtypes. Ictal discharges were induced in proepileptic conditions in 6 of 8 slices in the areas generating spontaneous interictal discharges, with a transition to seizure involving the emergence of preictal discharges. Interictal discharges were sustained by GABAergic signaling, as a GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor blocker stopped them in 2 of 3 slices. Blockade of NKCC1 Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; cotransporters further controlled interictal discharges in 9 of 12 cases, revealing a Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; dysregulation affecting actions of GABA. Immunohistochemistry highlighted decreased expression and changes in KCC2 subcellular localization and a decrease in the number of GAD67‐positive interneurons in regions generating interictal discharges.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altered chloride cotransporter expression and changes in interneuron density in FCD may lead to paradoxical depolarization of pyramidal cells. Spontaneous interictal discharges are consequently mediated by GABAergic signals, and targeting chloride regulation in neurons may be considered for the development of new antiepileptic drugs.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;{\it Ellsberg thought experiments} and empirical confirmation of Ellsberg
preferences pose serious challenges to {\it subjective expected utility theory}
(SEUT). We have recently elaborated a quantum-theoretic framework for human
decisions under uncertainty which satisfactorily copes with the Ellsberg
paradox and other puzzles of SEUT. We apply here the quantum-theoretic
framework to the {\it Ellsberg two-urn example}, showing that the paradox can
be explained by assuming a state change of the conceptual entity that is the
object of the decision ({\it decision-making}, or {\it DM}, {\it entity}) and
representing subjective probabilities by quantum probabilities. We also model
the empirical data we collected in a DM test on human participants within the
theoretic framework above. The obtained results are relevant, as they provide a
line to model real life, e.g., financial and medical, decisions that show the
same empirical patterns as the two-urn experiment.

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Synapse maintenance is impacted by ATAT-2 tubulin acetyltransferase activity and the RPM-1 signaling hub</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.44040</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/44040</link>
	<description>Synapse formation is comprised of target recognition, synapse assembly, and synapse maintenance. Maintaining established synaptic connections is essential for generating functional circuitry and synapse instability is a hallmark of neurodegenerative disease. While many molecules impact synapse formation generally, we know little about molecules that affect synapse maintenance &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Using genetics and developmental time course analysis in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;, we show that the a-tubulin acetyltransferase ATAT-2 and the signaling hub RPM-1 are required presynaptically to maintain stable synapses. Importantly, the enzymatic acetyltransferase activity of ATAT-2 is required for synapse maintenance. Our analysis revealed that RPM-1 is a hub in a genetic network composed of ATAT-2, PTRN-1 and DLK-1. In this network, ATAT-2 functions independent of the DLK-1 MAPK and likely acts downstream of RPM-1. Thus, our study reveals an important role for tubulin acetyltransferase activity in presynaptic maintenance, which occurs via the RPM-1/ATAT-2 pathway.</description>

	<description>PUF (&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;PU&lt;/span&gt;milio/&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;F&lt;/span&gt;BF) RNA-binding proteins recognize distinct elements. In &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;, PUF-8 binds to an 8-nt motif and restricts proliferation in the germline. Conversely, FBF-2 recognizes a 9-nt element and promotes mitosis. To understand how motif divergence relates to biological function, we determined a crystal structure of PUF-8. Comparison of this structure to that of FBF-2 revealed a major difference in a central repeat. We devised a modified yeast 3-hybrid screen to identify mutations that confer recognition of an 8-nt element to FBF-2. We identified several such mutants and validated structurally and biochemically their binding to 8-nt RNA elements. Using genome engineering, we generated a mutant animal with a substitution in FBF-2 that confers preferential binding to the PUF-8 element. The mutant largely rescued overproliferation in animals that spontaneously generate tumors in the absence of &lt;i&gt;puf-8&lt;/i&gt;. This work highlights the critical role of motif length in the specification of biological function.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: TRIM28 promotes HIV-1 latency by SUMOylating CDK9 and inhibiting P-TEFb</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/42426</link>
	<description>Comprehensively elucidating the molecular mechanisms of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) latency is a priority to achieve a functional cure. As current 'shock' agents failed to efficiently reactivate the latent reservoir, it is important to discover new targets for developing more efficient latency-reversing agents (LRAs). Here we found that TRIM28 potently suppresses HIV-1 expression by utilizing both SUMO E3 ligase activity and epigenetic adaptor function. Through global site-specific SUMO-MS study and serial SUMOylation assays, we identified that P-TEFb catalytic subunit CDK9 is significantly SUMOylated by TRIM28 with SUMO4. The Lys44, Lys56 and Lys68 residues on CDK9 are SUMOylated by TRIM28, which inhibits CDK9 kinase activity or prevents P-TEFb assembly by directly blocking the interaction between CDK9 and Cyclin T1, subsequently inhibits viral transcription and contributes to HIV-1 latency. The manipulation of TRIM28 and its consequent SUMOylation pathway could be the target for developing LRAs.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/41296</link>
	<description>Practice makes perfect. In human olfaction, such plasticity is generally assumed to occur at the level of cortical synthetic processing that shares information from both nostrils. Here we present findings that challenge this view. In two experiments, we trained human adults unirhinally for the discrimination between odor enantiomers over a course of about 10 to 11 days. Results showed that training-induced perceptual gain was restricted to the trained nostril yet partially generalized to untrained odor enantiomers in a structure- rather than quality- based manner. In other words, learning enhanced the differentiation of chirality (molecular configuration) as opposed to overall odor quality (odor object) per se. These findings argue that, unlike earlier beliefs, one nostril does not readily know what the other learns. Moreover, the initial analytical processing of the structural features of uninarial olfactory input remains plastic in human adults.</description>

	<description>Advances in fluorescence microscopy enable monitoring larger brain areas in-vivo with finer time resolution. The resulting data rates require reproducible analysis pipelines that are reliable, fully automated, and scalable to datasets generated over the course of months. We present C&lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;I&lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;A&lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;, an open-source library for calcium imaging data analysis. C&lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;I&lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;A&lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; provides automatic and scalable methods to address problems common to pre-processing, including motion correction, neural activity identification, and registration across different sessions of data collection. It does this while requiring minimal user intervention, with good scalability on computers ranging from laptops to high-performance computing clusters. C&lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;I&lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;A&lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; is suitable for two-photon and one-photon imaging, and also enables real-time analysis on streaming data.

	<description>In the inner ear, the deflection of hair bundles, the sensory organelles of hair cells, activates mechanically-gated channels (MGCs). Hair bundles monitor orientation of the head, its angular and linear acceleration, and detect sound. Force applied to MGCs is shaped by intrinsic hair-bundle properties, by the mechanical load on the bundle, and by the filter imparted by the environment of the hair bundle. Channel gating and adaptation, the ability of the bundle to reset its operating point, contribute to hair-bundle mechanics.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Proposed Mechanism for Spontaneous Transitions between Interictal and Ictal Activity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/3/557?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/3/557?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Epileptic networks are characterized by two outputs: brief interictal spikes and rarer, more prolonged seizures. Although either output state is readily modeled &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; and induced experimentally, the transition mechanisms are unknown, in part because no models exhibit both output states spontaneously. &lt;i&gt;In silico&lt;/i&gt; small-world neural networks were built using single-compartment neurons whose physiological parameters were derived from dual whole-cell recordings of pyramidal cells in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures that were generating spontaneous seizure-like activity. &lt;i&gt;In silico&lt;/i&gt;, neurons were connected by abundant local synapses and rare long-distance synapses. Activity-dependent synaptic depression and gradual recovery delimited synchronous activity. Full synaptic recovery engendered interictal population spikes that spread via long-distance synapses. When synaptic recovery was incomplete, postsynaptic neurons required coincident activation of multiple presynaptic terminals to reach firing threshold. Only local connections were sufficiently dense to spread activity under these conditions. This coalesced network activity into traveling waves whose velocity varied with synaptic recovery. Seizures were comprised of sustained traveling waves that were similar to those recorded during experimental and human neocortical seizures. Sustained traveling waves occurred only when wave velocity, network dimensions, and the rate of synaptic recovery enabled wave reentry into previously depressed areas at precisely ictogenic levels of synaptic recovery. Wide-field, cellular-resolution GCamP7b calcium imaging demonstrated similar initial patterns of activation in the hippocampus, although the anatomical distribution of traveling waves of synaptic activation was altered by the pattern of synaptic connectivity in the organotypic hippocampal cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; When computerized distributed neural network models are required to generate both features of epileptic networks (i.e., spontaneous interictal population spikes and seizures), the network structure is substantially constrained. These constraints provide important new hypotheses regarding the nature of epileptic networks and mechanisms of seizure onset.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Animal studies demonstrate that hyperactive neurons facilitate early accumulation and spread of tau and amyloid-β proteins in the pathological cascade of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Human neuroimaging studies have linked hippocampal hyperactivity to amyloid-β accumulation, apolipoprotein 4 (APOE4) and clinical progression from prodromal AD to clinical dementia. The relationship between hippocampal hyperactivity and early AD molecular pathology (amyloid-β and tau accumulation) before clinical symptoms remains to be elucidated. Here, we studied 120 clinically normal older humans (80 females/40 males) enrolled in the Harvard Aging Brain Study. We measured functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity during successful memory encoding and amyloid-β accumulation with PiB-positron emission tomography imaging. Additionally, we measured tau accumulation using AV1451 PET imaging in a subset of 87 participants. In this subset, we found that inferior temporal tau accumulation was associated with increased fMRI activity in the hippocampus, but showed no clear association with amyloid. Together, the findings support a hypothetical model of the evolution of preclinical AD that place hippocampal hyperactivity concurrent with spread of tau pathology to neocortical regions before clinical impairment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The circumstances under which the hippocampus becomes hyperactive in preclinical stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have thus far remained elusive. Recent advances in positron emission tomography (PET) tracers now enable &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; characterization of amyloid-β and tau accumulation. Here, we combine amyloid and tau PET with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the association between Alzheimer's disease pathology and memory-related brain activity in clinically normal older adults. We found an association between increased hippocampal activity and tau accumulation in the inferior temporal cortex. These data suggest that the pathogenesis of hippocampal hyperactivity occurs concurrent with the spread of tau pathology from the entorhinal cortex to the neocortex, before the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dopamine D2/3 Binding Potential Modulates Neural Signatures of Working Memory in a Load-Dependent Fashion</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dopamine (DA) modulates corticostriatal connections. Studies in which imaging of the DA system is integrated with functional imaging during cognitive performance have yielded mixed findings. Some work has shown a link between striatal DA (measured by PET) and fMRI activations, whereas others have failed to observe such a relationship. One possible reason for these discrepant findings is differences in task demands, such that a more demanding task with greater prefrontal activations may yield a stronger association with DA. Moreover, a potential DA–BOLD association may be modulated by task performance. We studied 155 (104 normal-performing and 51 low-performing) healthy older adults (43% females) who underwent fMRI scanning while performing a working memory (WM) &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-back task along with DA D&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt; PET assessment using [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]raclopride. Using multivariate partial-least-squares analysis, we observed a significant pattern revealing positive associations of striatal as well as extrastriatal DA D&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt; receptors to BOLD response in the thalamo–striatal–cortical circuit, which supports WM functioning. Critically, the DA–BOLD association in normal-performing, but not low-performing, individuals was expressed in a load-dependent fashion, with stronger associations during 3-back than 1-/2-back conditions. Moreover, normal-performing adults expressing upregulated BOLD in response to increasing task demands showed a stronger DA–BOLD association during 3-back, whereas low-performing individuals expressed a stronger association during 2-back conditions. This pattern suggests a nonlinear DA–BOLD performance association, with the strongest link at the maximum capacity level. Together, our results suggest that DA may have a stronger impact on functional brain responses during more demanding cognitive tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Dopamine (DA) is a major neuromodulator in the CNS and plays a key role in several cognitive processes via modulating the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal. Some studies have shown a link between DA and BOLD, whereas others have failed to observe such a relationship. A possible reason for the discrepancy is differences in task demands, such that a more demanding task with greater prefrontal activations may yield a stronger association with DA. We examined the relationship of DA to BOLD response during working memory under three load conditions and found that the DA–BOLD association is expressed in a load-dependent fashion. These findings may help explain the disproportionate impairment evident in more effortful cognitive tasks in normal aging and in those suffering dopamine-dependent neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Parkinson's disease).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Electrical Stimulation Over Human Posterior Parietal Cortex Selectively Enhances the Capacity of Visual Short-Term Memory</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/3/528?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Visual short-term memory (VSTM) provides an on-line mental space for incoming sensory information to be temporally maintained to carry out complex behavioral tasks. Despite its essential functions, the capacity at which VSTM could maintain sensory information is limited (i.e., VSTM can hold only about three to four visual items at once). Moreover, the quality of sensory representation (i.e., precision) degrades as more information has to be maintained in VSTM. Correlational evidence suggests that the level and the pattern of neural activity measured in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) track both VSTM capacity and precision. However, the causal contributions of the PPC to these different VSTM operations are unclear. Here, we tested whether stimulating the PPC with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) could increase VSTM capacity or precision. We found that stimulating the PPC in male and female human participants selectively enhanced VSTM capacity when the number of memory items exceeded capacity limit, without significant effects on VSTM precision. Moreover, this enhancement of VSTM capacity is region specific as stimulating the prefrontal cortex did not change VSTM capacity or precision. Null stimulation effects in the sensory memory condition confirmed that the tDCS-induced enhancement of VSTM capacity was not simply due to changes in sensory or attentional processes. Altogether, these results provide causal evidence suggesting that the PPC has a more dominant role in supporting the storage capacity of VSTM compared with maintaining the quality of sensory representations. Furthermore, tDCS could be used as a promising noninvasive method to enhance this PPC VSTM-related function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Correlational evidence from neuroimaging and electrophysiology suggests that the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) supports the storage capacity of visual short-term memory (VSTM) and the precision of sensory representations maintained in VSTM. However, the causal contributions of the PPC to these different VSTM functions were unclear. Here, we found that electrical stimulation over the PPC selectively enhanced VSTM capacity without changing VSTM precision. Overall, our findings suggest that the PPC has a dominant and causal role in supporting the storage capacity of VSTM.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Balancing Prediction and Sensory Input in Speech Comprehension: The Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Word Recognition in Context</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/3/519?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spoken word recognition in context is remarkably fast and accurate, with recognition times of ~200 ms, typically well before the end of the word. The neurocomputational mechanisms underlying these contextual effects are still poorly understood. This study combines source-localized electroencephalographic and magnetoencephalographic (EMEG) measures of real-time brain activity with multivariate representational similarity analysis to determine directly the timing and computational content of the processes evoked as spoken words are heard in context, and to evaluate the respective roles of bottom-up and predictive processing mechanisms in the integration of sensory and contextual constraints. Male and female human participants heard simple (modifier-noun) English phrases that varied in the degree of semantic constraint that the modifier (W1) exerted on the noun (W2), as in pairs, such as &quot;yellow banana.&quot; We used gating tasks to generate estimates of the probabilistic predictions generated by these constraints as well as measures of their interaction with the bottom-up perceptual input for W2. Representation similarity analysis models of these measures were tested against electroencephalographic and magnetoencephalographic brain data across a bilateral fronto-temporo-parietal language network. Consistent with probabilistic predictive processing accounts, we found early activation of semantic constraints in frontal cortex (LBA45) as W1 was heard. The effects of these constraints (at 100 ms after W2 onset in left middle temporal gyrus and at 140 ms in left Heschl's gyrus) were only detectable, however, after the initial phonemes of W2 had been heard. Within an overall predictive processing framework, bottom-up sensory inputs are still required to achieve early and robust spoken word recognition in context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Human listeners recognize spoken words in natural speech contexts with remarkable speed and accuracy, often identifying a word well before all of it has been heard. In this study, we investigate the brain systems that support this important capacity, using neuroimaging techniques that can track real-time brain activity during speech comprehension. This makes it possible to locate the brain areas that generate predictions about upcoming words and to show how these expectations are integrated with the evidence provided by the speech being heard. We use the timing and localization of these effects to provide the most specific account to date of how the brain achieves an optimal balance between prediction and sensory input in the interpretation of spoken language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Chemogenetic Manipulations of Ventral Tegmental Area Dopamine Neurons Reveal Multifaceted Roles in Cocaine Abuse</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons perform diverse functions in motivation and cognition, but their precise roles in addiction-related behaviors are still debated. Here, we targeted VTA DA neurons for bidirectional chemogenetic modulation during specific tests of cocaine reinforcement, demand, and relapse-related behaviors in male rats, querying the roles of DA neuron inhibitory and excitatory G-protein signaling in these processes. Designer receptor stimulation of G&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; signaling, but not G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; signaling, in DA neurons enhanced cocaine seeking via functionally distinct projections to forebrain limbic regions. In contrast, engaging inhibitory G&lt;sub&gt;i/o&lt;/sub&gt; signaling in DA neurons blunted the reinforcing and priming effects of cocaine, reduced stress-potentiated reinstatement, and altered behavioral strategies for cocaine seeking and taking. Results demonstrate that DA neurons play several distinct roles in cocaine seeking, depending on behavioral context, G-protein-signaling cascades, and DA neuron efferent targets, highlighting their multifaceted roles in addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; G-protein-coupled receptors are crucial modulators of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neuron activity, but how this metabotropic signaling impacts the complex roles of dopamine in reward and addiction is poorly understood. Here, we bidirectionally modulate dopamine neuron G-protein signaling with DREADDs (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) during a variety of cocaine-seeking behaviors, revealing nuanced, pathway-specific roles in cocaine reward, effortful seeking, and relapse-like behaviors. G&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; and G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; stimulation activated dopamine neurons, but only G&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; stimulation robustly enhanced cocaine seeking. G&lt;sub&gt;i/o&lt;/sub&gt; inhibitory signaling reduced some, but not all, types of cocaine seeking. Results show that VTA dopamine neurons modulate numerous distinct aspects of cocaine addiction- and relapse-related behaviors, and point to potential new approaches for intervening in these processes to treat addiction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Ipsilateral-Dominant Control of Limb Movements in Rodent Posterior Parietal Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/3/485?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/3/485?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;It is well known that the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and frontal motor cortices in primates preferentially control voluntary movements of contralateral limbs. The PPC of rats has been defined based on patterns of thalamic and cortical connectivity. The anatomical characteristics of this area suggest that it may be homologous to the PPC of primates. However, its functional roles in voluntary forelimb movements have not been well understood, particularly in the lateralization of motor limb representation; that is, the limb-specific activity representations for right and left forelimb movements. We examined functional spike activity of the PPC and two motor cortices, the primary motor cortex (M1) and the secondary motor cortex (M2), when head-fixed male rats performed right or left unilateral movements. Unlike primates, PPC neurons in rodents were found to preferentially represent ipsilateral forelimb movements, in contrast to the contralateral preference of M1 and M2 neurons. Consistent with these observations, optogenetic activation of PPC and motor cortices, respectively, evoked ipsilaterally and contralaterally biased forelimb movements. Finally, we examined the effects of optogenetic manipulation on task performance. PPC or M1 inhibition by optogenetic GABA release shifted the behavioral limb preference contralaterally or ipsilaterally, respectively. In addition, weak optogenetic PPC activation, which was insufficient to evoke motor responses by itself, shifted the preference ipsilaterally; although similar M1 activation showed no effects on task performance. These paradoxical observations suggest that the PPC plays evolutionarily different roles in forelimb control between primates and rodents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In rodents, the primary and secondary motor cortices (M1 and M2, respectively) are involved in voluntary movements with contralateral preference. However, it remains unclear whether and how the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) participates in controlling multiple limb movements. We recorded functional activity from these areas using a behavioral task to monitor movements of the right and left forelimbs separately. PPC neurons preferentially represented ipsilateral forelimb movements and optogenetic PPC activation evoked ipsilaterally biased forelimb movements. Optogenetic PPC inhibition via GABA release shifted the behavioral limb preference contralaterally during task performance, whereas weak optogenetic PPC activation, which was insufficient to evoke motor responses by itself, shifted the preference ipsilaterally. Our findings suggest rodent PPC contributes to ipsilaterally biased motor response and/or planning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: {alpha}2A-Adrenergic Receptor Activation Decreases Parabrachial Nucleus Excitatory Drive onto BNST CRF Neurons and Reduces Their Activity In Vivo</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stress contributes to numerous psychiatric disorders. Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) signaling and CRF neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) drive negative affective behaviors, thus agents that decrease activity of these cells may be of therapeutic interest. Here, we show that acute restraint stress increases cFos expression in CRF neurons in the mouse dorsal BNST, consistent with a role for these neurons in stress-related behaviors. We find that activation of α&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;-adrenergic receptors (ARs) by the agonist guanfacine reduced cFos expression in these neurons both in stressed and unstressed conditions. Further, we find that α- and β-ARs differentially regulate excitatory drive onto these neurons. Pharmacological and channelrhodopsin-assisted mapping experiments suggest that α&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;-ARs specifically reduce excitatory drive from parabrachial nucleus (PBN) afferents onto CRF neurons. Given that the α&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;-AR is a G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;-linked GPCR, we assessed the impact of activating the G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;-coupled DREADD hM4Di in the PBN on restraint stress regulation of BNST CRF neurons. CNO activation of PBN hM4Di reduced stress-induced &lt;i&gt;Fos&lt;/i&gt; in BNST &lt;i&gt;Crh&lt;/i&gt; neurons. Further, using &lt;i&gt;Prkcd&lt;/i&gt; as an additional marker of BNST neuronal identity, we uncovered a female-specific upregulation of the coexpression of &lt;i&gt;Prkcd/Crh&lt;/i&gt; in BNST neurons following stress, which was prevented by ovariectomy. These findings show that stress activates BNST CRF neurons, and that α&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;-AR activation suppresses the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; activity of these cells, at least in part by suppressing excitatory drive from PBN inputs onto CRF neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Stress is a major variable contributing to mood disorders. Here, we show that stress increases activation of BNST CRF neurons that drive negative affective behavior. We find that the clinically well tolerated α&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;-AR agonist guanfacine reduces activity of these cells &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, and reduces excitatory PBN inputs onto these cells &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Additionally, we uncover a novel sex-dependent coexpression of &lt;i&gt;Prkcd&lt;/i&gt; with &lt;i&gt;Crh&lt;/i&gt; in female BNST neurons after stress, an effect abolished by ovariectomy. These results demonstrate input-specific interactions between norepinephrine and CRF, and point to an action by which guanfacine may reduce negative affective responses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: AGRP Neurons Project to the Medial Preoptic Area and Modulate Maternal Nest-Building</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;AGRP (agouti-related neuropeptide) expressing inhibitory neurons sense caloric needs of an animal to coordinate homeostatic feeding. Recent evidence suggests that AGRP neurons also suppress competing actions and motivations to mediate adaptive behavioral selection during starvation. Here, in adult mice of both sexes we show that AGRP neurons form inhibitory synapses onto ~30% neurons in the medial preoptic area (mPOA), a region critical for maternal care. Remarkably, optogenetically stimulating AGRP neurons decreases maternal nest-building while minimally affecting pup retrieval, partly recapitulating suppression of maternal behaviors during food restriction. In parallel, optogenetically stimulating AGRP projections to the mPOA or to the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus but not to the LHA (lateral hypothalamus area) similarly decreases maternal nest-building. Chemogenetic inhibition of mPOA neurons that express Vgat (vesicular GABA transporter), the population targeted by AGRP terminals, also decreases maternal nest-building. In comparison, chemogenetic inhibition of neurons in the LHA that express vesicular glutamate transporter 2, another hypothalamic neuronal population critical for feeding and innate drives, is ineffective. Importantly, nest-building during low temperature thermal challenge is not affected by optogenetic stimulation of AGRP-&amp;gt;mPOA projections. Finally, via optogenetic activation and inhibition we show that distinctive subsets of mPOA Vgat+ neurons likely underlie pup retrieval and maternal nest-building. Together, these results show that AGRP neurons can modulate maternal nest-building, in part through direct projections to the mPOA. This study corroborates other recent discoveries and underscores the broad functions that AGRP neurons play in antagonizing rivalry motivations to modulate behavioral outputs during hunger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In order for animals to initiate ethologically appropriate behaviors, they must typically decide between behavioral repertoires driven by multiple and often conflicting internal states. How neural pathways underlying individual behaviors interact to coherently modulate behavioral outputs, in particular to achieve a proper balance between behaviors that serve immediate individual needs versus those that benefit the propagation of the species, remains poorly understood. Here, by investigating projections from a neuronal population known to drive hunger behaviors to a brain region critical for maternal care, we show that activation of AGRP-&amp;gt;mPOA projections in females dramatically inhibits maternal nest-building while leaving mostly intact pup retrieval behavior. Our findings shed new light on neural organization of behaviors and neural mechanisms that coordinate behavioral selection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Locus Coeruleus Phasic, But Not Tonic, Activation Initiates Global Remapping in a Familiar Environment</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/3/445?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Locus coeruleus (LC) neurons, the source of hippocampal norepinephrine (NE), are activated by novelty and changes in environmental contingencies. Based on the role of monoamines in reconfiguring invertebrate networks, and data from mammalian systems, a network reset hypothesis for the effects of LC activation has been proposed. We used the cellular compartmental analysis of temporal FISH technique based on the cellular distribution of immediate early genes to examine the effect of LC activation and inactivation, on regional hippocampal maps in male rats, when LC activity was manipulated just before placement in a second familiar (A/A) and/or novel environment (A/B). We found that bilateral phasic, but not tonic, activation of LC reset hippocampal maps in the A/A condition, whereas silencing the LC with clonidine before placement in the A/B condition blocked map reset and a familiar map emerged in the dentate gyrus, proximal and distal CA1, and CA3c. However, CA3a and CA3b encoded the novel environment. These results support a role for phasic LC responses in generating novel hippocampal sequences during memory encoding and, potentially, memory updating. The silencing experiments suggest that novel environments may not be recognized as different by dentate gyrus and CA1 without LC input. The functional distinction between phasic and tonic LC activity argues that these parameters are critical for determining network changes. These data are consistent with the hippocampus activating internal network representations to encode novel experiential episodes and suggest LC input is critical for this role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Burst activation of the broadly projecting novelty signaling system of the locus coeruleus initiates new network representations throughout the hippocampus despite unchanged external environments. Tonic activation does not alter network representations in the same condition. This suggests differences in the temporal parameters of neuromodulator network activation are critical for neuromodulator function. Silencing this novelty signaling system prevented the appearance of new network representations in a novel environment. Instead, familiar representations were expressed in a subset of hippocampal areas, with another subset encoding the novel environment. This &quot;being in two places at once&quot; argues for independent functional regions within the hippocampus. These experiments strengthen the view that internal states are major determinants of the brain's construction of environmental representations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Occurrence of Hippocampal Ripples is Associated with Activity Suppression in the Mediodorsal Thalamic Nucleus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/3/434?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Forming reliable memories requires coordinated activity within distributed brain networks. At present, neural mechanisms underlying systems-level consolidation of declarative memory beyond the hippocampal–prefrontal interactions remain largely unexplored. The mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD) is reciprocally connected with the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and also receives inputs from parahippocampal regions. The MD may thus modulate functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the mPFC at different stages of information processing. Here, we characterized, in freely behaving Sprague Dawley male rats, the MD neural activity around hippocampal ripples, indicators of memory replay and hippocampal–cortical information transfer. Overall, the MD firing rate was transiently (0.76 ± 0.06 s) decreased around ripples, with the MD activity suppression preceding the ripple onset for 0.41 ± 0.04 s (range, 0.01–0.95 s). The degree of MD modulation correlated with ripple amplitude, differed across behavioral states, and also depended on the dynamics of hippocampal–cortical population activity. The MD suppression was the strongest and the most consistent during awake ripples. During non–rapid eye movement sleep, MD firing rate decreased around spindle-uncoupled ripples, but increased around spindle-coupled ripples. Our results suggest a competitive interaction between the thalamocortical and hippocampal–cortical networks supporting &quot;on-line&quot; and &quot;off-line&quot; information processing, respectively. We hypothesize that thalamic activity suppression during spindle-uncoupled ripples is favorable for memory replay, as it reduces interference from sensory relay. In turn, the thalamic input during hippocampal–cortical communication, as indicated by spindle/ripple coupling, may contribute to selectivity and reliability of information transfer. Both predictions need to be tested in future experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Systems mechanisms of declarative memory consolidation beyond the hippocampal–prefrontal interactions remain largely unexplored. The connectivity of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD) with extrahippocampal regions and with medial prefrontal cortex underlies its role in execution of diverse cognitive functions. However, little is known about the MD involvement in &quot;off-line&quot; consolidation. We found that MD neural activity was transiently suppressed around hippocampal ripples, except for ripples co-occurring with sleep spindles, when the MD activity was elevated. The thalamic activity suppression at times of spindle-uncoupled ripples may be favorable for memory replay, as it reduces interference with sensory relay. In turn, the thalamic input during hippocampal–cortical communication, as indicated by spindle/ripple coupling, may contribute to selectivity and reliability of information transfer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Histamine H1 Receptor Contributes to Vestibular Compensation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/3/420?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/3/420?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Vestibular compensation is responsible for the spontaneous recovery of postural, locomotor, and oculomotor dysfunctions in patients with peripheral vestibular lesion or posterior circulation stroke. Mechanism investigation of vestibular compensation is of great importance in both facilitating recovery of vestibular function and understanding the postlesion functional plasticity in the adult CNS. Here, we report that postsynaptic histamine H1 receptor contributes greatly to facilitating vestibular compensation. The expression of H1 receptor is restrictedly increased in the ipsilesional rather than contralesional GABAergic projection neurons in the medial vestibular nucleus (MVN), one of the most important centers for vestibular compensation, in unilateral labyrinthectomized male rats. Furthermore, H1 receptor mediates an asymmetric excitation of the commissural GABAergic but not glutamatergic neurons in the ipsilesional MVN, which may help to rebalance bilateral vestibular systems and promote vestibular compensation. Selective blockage of H1 receptor in the MVN significantly retards the recovery of both static and dynamic vestibular symptoms following unilateral labyrinthectomy, and remarkably attenuates the facilitation of betahistine, whose effect has traditionally been attributed to its antagonistic action on the presynaptic H3 receptor, on vestibular compensation. These results reveal a previously unknown role for histamine H1 receptor in vestibular compensation and amelioration of vestibular motor deficits, as well as an involvement of H1 receptor in potential therapeutic effects of betahistine. The findings provide not only a new insight into the postlesion neuronal circuit plasticity and functional recovery in the CNS, but also a novel potential therapeutic target for vestibular disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Vestibular disorders manifest postural imbalance, nystagmus, and vertigo. Vestibular compensation is critical for facilitating recovery from vestibular disorders, and of great importance in understanding the postlesion functional plasticity in the adult CNS. Here, we show that postsynaptic H1 receptor in the medial vestibular nucleus (MVN) contributes greatly to the recovery of both static and dynamic symptoms following unilateral vestibular lesion. H1 receptor selectively mediates the asymmetric activation of commissural inhibitory system in the ipsilesional MVN and actively promotes vestibular compensation. The findings provide not only a new insight into the postlesion neuronal circuit plasticity and functional recovery of CNS, but also a novel potential therapeutic target for promoting vestibular compensation and ameliorating vestibular disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dendritic Spines in Early Postnatal Fragile X Mice Are Insensitive to Novel Sensory Experience</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorders are often associated with atypical sensory processing and sensory hypersensitivity, which can lead to maladaptive behaviors, such as tactile defensiveness. Such altered sensory perception in autism spectrum disorders could arise from disruptions in experience-dependent maturation of circuits during early brain development. Here, we tested the hypothesis that synaptic structures of primary somatosensory cortex (S1) neurons in Fragile X syndrome (FXS), which is a common inherited cause of autism, are not modulated by novel sensory information during development. We used chronic &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; two-photon microscopy to image dendritic spines and axon &quot;en passant&quot; boutons of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in S1 of male and female WT and &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice, a model of FXS. We found that a brief (overnight) exposure to dramatically enhance sensory inputs in the second postnatal week led to a significant increase in spine density in WT mice, but not in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice. In contrast, axon &quot;en passant&quot; boutons dynamics were impervious to this novel sensory experience in mice of both genotypes. We surmise that the inability of &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice to modulate postsynaptic dynamics in response to increased sensory input, at a time when sensory information processing first comes online in S1 cortex, could play a role in altered sensory processing in FXS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Very few longitudinal &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; imaging studies have investigated synaptic structure and dynamics in early postnatal mice. Moreover, those studies tend to focus on the effects of sensory input deprivation, a process that rarely occurs during normal brain development. Early postnatal imaging experiments are critical because a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders, including those characterized by autism, could result from alterations in how circuits are shaped by incoming sensory inputs during critical periods of development. In this study, we focused on a mouse model of Fragile X syndrome and demonstrate how dendritic spines are insensitive to a brief period of novel sensory experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Nociceptor Translational Profiling Reveals the Ragulator-Rag GTPase Complex as a Critical Generator of Neuropathic Pain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/3/393?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nociceptors, sensory neurons in the DRG that detect damaging or potentially damaging stimuli, are key drivers of neuropathic pain. Injury to these neurons causes activation of translation regulation signaling, including the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and mitogen-activated protein kinase interacting kinase (MNK) eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E pathways. This is a mechanism driving changes in excitability of nociceptors that is critical for the generation of chronic pain states; however, the mRNAs that are translated to lead to this plasticity have not been elucidated. To address this gap in knowledge, we used translating ribosome affinity purification in male and female mice to comprehensively characterize mRNA translation in &lt;i&gt;Scn10a&lt;/i&gt;-positive nociceptors in chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain (CIPN) caused by paclitaxel treatment. This unbiased method creates a new resource for the field, confirms many findings in the CIPN literature and also find extensive evidence for new target mechanisms that may cause CIPN. We provide evidence that an underlying mechanism of CIPN is sustained mTORC1 activation driven by MNK1-eIF4E signaling. RagA, a GTPase controlling mTORC1 activity, is identified as a novel target of MNK1-eIF4E signaling. This demonstrates a novel translation regulation signaling circuit wherein MNK1-eIF4E activity drives mTORC1 via control of RagA translation. CIPN and RagA translation are strongly attenuated by genetic ablation of eIF4E phosphorylation, MNK1 elimination or treatment with the MNK inhibitor eFT508. We identify a novel translational circuit for the genesis of neuropathic pain caused by chemotherapy with important implications for therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neuropathic pain affects up to 10% of the population, but its underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood, leading to poor treatment outcomes. We used translating ribosome affinity purification technology to create a comprehensive translational profile of DRG nociceptors in naive mice and at the peak of neuropathic pain induced by paclitaxel treatment. We reveal new insight into how mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 is activated in neuropathic pain pointing to a key role of MNK1-eIF4E-mediated translation of a complex of mRNAs that control mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 signaling at the surface of the lysosome. We validate this finding using genetic and pharmacological techniques. Our work strongly suggests that MNK1-eIF4E signaling drives CIPN and that a drug in human clinical trials, eFT508, may be a new therapeutic for neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Pain is a complex process that involves both detection in the peripheral nervous system and perception in the CNS. Individual-to-individual differences in pain are well documented, but not well understood. Here we capitalized on inherited erythromelalgia (IEM), a well characterized human genetic model of chronic pain, and studied a unique family containing related IEM subjects with the same disease-causing Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 mutation, which is known to make dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons hyperexcitable, but different pain profiles (affected son with severe pain, affected mother with moderate pain, and an unaffected father). We show, first, that, at least in some cases, relative sensitivity to pain can be modeled in subject-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived sensory neurons &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;; second, that, in some cases, mechanisms operating in peripheral sensory neurons contribute to interindividual differences in pain; and third, using whole exome sequencing (WES) and dynamic clamp, we show that it is possible to pinpoint a specific variant of another gene, &lt;i&gt;KCNQ&lt;/i&gt; in this particular kindred, that modulates the excitability of iPSC-derived sensory neurons in this family. While different gene variants may modulate DRG neuron excitability and thereby contribute to interindividual differences in pain in other families, this study shows that subject-specific iPSCs can be used to model interindividual differences in pain. We further provide proof-of-principle that iPSCs, WES, and dynamic clamp can be used to investigate peripheral mechanisms and pinpoint specific gene variants that modulate pain signaling and contribute to interindividual differences in pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Individual-to-individual differences in pain are well documented, but not well understood. In this study, we show, first, that, at least in some cases, relative sensitivity to pain can be modeled in subject-specific induced pluripotent stem cell-derived sensory neurons &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;; second, that, in some cases, mechanisms operating in peripheral sensory neurons contribute to interindividual differences in pain; and third, using whole exome sequencing and dynamic clamp, we show that it is possible to pinpoint a specific gene variant that modulates pain signaling and contributes to interindividual differences in pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: The presence and absence of periplasmic rings in bacterial flagellar motors correlates with stator type</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.43487</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/43487</link>
	<description>The bacterial flagellar motor, a cell-envelope-embedded macromolecular machine that functions as a cellular propeller, exhibits significant structural variability between species. Different torque-generating stator modules allow motors to operate in different pH, salt or viscosity levels. How such diversity evolved is unknown. Here we use electron cryo-tomography to determine the &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; macromolecular structures of three Gammaproteobacteria motors: &lt;i&gt;Legionella pneumophila&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Shewanella oneidensis&lt;/i&gt;, providing the first views of intact motors with dual stator systems. Complementing our imaging with bioinformatics analysis, we find a correlation between the motor's stator system and its structural elaboration. Motors with a single H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-driven stator have only the core periplasmic P- and L-rings; those with dual H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-driven stators have an elaborated P-ring; and motors with Na&lt;sup&gt;+ &lt;/sup&gt;or&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-driven stators have both their P- and L-rings embellished. Our results suggest an evolution of structural elaboration that may have enabled pathogenic bacteria to colonize higher-viscosity environments in animal hosts.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Structural basis of Ca2+-dependent activation and lipid transport by a TMEM16 scramblase</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.43229</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/43229</link>
	<description>The lipid distribution of plasma membranes of eukaryotic cells is asymmetric and phospholipid scramblases disrupt this asymmetry by mediating the rapid, nonselective transport of lipids down their concentration gradients. As a result, phosphatidylserine is exposed to the outer leaflet of membrane, an important step in extracellular signaling networks controlling processes such as apoptosis, blood coagulation, membrane fusion and repair. Several TMEM16 family members have been identified as Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated scramblases but the mechanisms underlying their Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent gating and their effects on the surrounding lipid bilayer remain poorly understood. Here we describe three high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures of a fungal scramblase from &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus fumigatus&lt;/i&gt;, afTMEM16, reconstituted in lipid nanodiscs. These structures reveal that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent activation of the scramblase entails global rearrangement of the transmembrane and cytosolic domains. These structures, together with functional experiments, suggest that activation of the protein thins the membrane near the transport pathway to facilitate rapid transbilayer lipid movement.</description>

	<description>We have developed a method to introduce novel paratopes into the human antibody repertoire by modifying the immunoglobulin (Ig) genes of mature B cells directly using genome editing technologies. We used CRISPR-Cas9 in a homology directed repair strategy, to replace the heavy chain (HC) variable region in B cell lines with that from an HIV broadly neutralizing antibody, PG9. Our strategy is designed to function in cells that have undergone VDJ recombination using any combination of variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) genes. The modified locus expresses PG9 HC which pairs with native light chains resulting in the cell surface expression of HIV specific B cell receptors (BCRs). Endogenous activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) in engineered cells allowed for Ig class switching and generated BCR variants with improved anti-HIV neutralizing activity. Thus, BCRs engineered in this way retain the genetic flexibility normally required for affinity maturation during adaptive immune responses. Peripheral blood derived primary B cells from three different donors were edited using this strategy. Engineered cells could bind the PG9 epitope by FACS and sequenced mRNA from these cells showed PG9 HC expressed as several different isotypes after culture with CD40 ligand and IL-4.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: On identifying collective displacements in apo-proteins that reveal eventual binding pathways</title>

Binding of small molecules to proteins often involves large conformational changes in the latter, which open up pathways to the binding site. Observing and pinpointing these rare events in large scale, all-atom, computations of specific protein-ligand complexes, is expensive and to a great extent serendipitous. Further, relevant collective variables which characterise specific binding or un-binding scenarios are still difficult to identify despite the large body of work on the subject. Here, we show that possible primary and secondary binding pathways can be discovered from short simulations of the apo-protein without waiting for an actual binding event to occur. We use a projection formalism, introduced earlier to study deformation in solids, to analyse local atomic displacements into two mutually orthogonal subspaces—those which are “affine” i.e. expressible as a homogeneous deformation of the native structure, and those which are not. The susceptibility to non-affine displacements among the various residues in the apo- protein is then shown to correlate with typical binding pathways and sites crucial for allosteric modifications. We validate our observation with all-atom computations of three proteins, T4-Lysozyme, Src kinase and Cytochrome P450.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9DUt8CyJ4OU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The finite state projection based Fisher information matrix approach to estimate information and optimize single-cell experiments</title>

Modern optical imaging experiments not only measure single-cell and single-molecule dynamics with high precision, but they can also perturb the cellular environment in myriad controlled and novel settings. Techniques, such as single-molecule fluorescence in-situ hybridization, microfluidics, and optogenetics, have opened the door to a large number of potential experiments, which begs the question of how to choose the best possible experiment. The Fisher information matrix (FIM) estimates how well potential experiments will constrain model parameters and can be used to design optimal experiments. Here, we introduce the finite state projection (FSP) based FIM, which uses the formalism of the chemical master equation to derive and compute the FIM. The FSP-FIM makes no assumptions about the distribution shapes of single-cell data, and it does not require precise measurements of higher order moments of such distributions. We validate the FSP-FIM against well-known Fisher information results for the simple case of constitutive gene expression. We then use numerical simulations to demonstrate the use of the FSP-FIM to optimize the timing of single-cell experiments with more complex, non-Gaussian fluctuations. We validate optimal simulated experiments determined using the FSP-FIM with Monte-Carlo approaches and contrast these to experiment designs chosen by traditional analyses that assume Gaussian fluctuations or use the central limit theorem. By systematically designing experiments to use all of the measurable fluctuations, our method enables a key step to improve co-design of experiments and quantitative models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/quvKzmVx9vA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

To address if the sexually dimorphic AVP cell group in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is important for social communication, we deleted BNST AVP cells by viral delivery of a Cre-dependent caspase-3 cell-death construct in AVP-iCre positive mice using AVP-iCre negative littermate as controls, and assessed social, sexual, aggressive and anxiety-related behaviors. In males, lesioning BNST AVP cells reduced social investigation of other males and increased urine marking in the presence of a live female, without altering ultrasonic vocalizations, resident-intruder aggression, copulatory behavior, anxiety, or investigation of females or their odor cues. In females, which have significantly fewer AVP cells in the BNST, these injections influenced copulatory behavior but otherwise had minimal effects on social behavior and communication, indicating that these cells contribute to sex differences in social behavioral function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Despite over thirty years of indirect evidence implicating sexually-dimorphic arginine vasopressin (AVP) cells within the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in the control of social and anxiety-related behavior in mammals, the function of these cells has never been directly tested. Here, we show that deletion of these cells in male, but not female, mice reduce investigation of same-sex conspecifics and alter social communication without changing aggressive and anxiety-related behaviors. Although AVP cell deletion in the BNST did not alter male copulatory behavior, it impaired female sexual behavior. These results indicate that sexually-dimorphic AVP cells in the BNST drive specific aspects of sexually-differentiated social investigation, behavior, and communication.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: June 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 56&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Fabian Rentzsch, Celina Juliano, Brigitte Galliot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cnidarians shared a common ancestor with bilaterians more than 600 million years ago. This sister group relationship gives them an informative phylogenetic position for understanding the fascinating morphological and molecular cell type diversity of bilaterian nervous systems. Moreover, cnidarians display novel features such as endodermal neurogenesis and independently evolved centralizations, which provide a platform for understanding the evolution of nervous system innovations. In recent years, the application of modern genomic tools has significantly advanced our understanding of cnidarian nervous system structure and function. For example, transgenic reporter lines and gene knockdown experiments in several cnidarian species reveal a significant degree of conservation in the neurogenesis gene regulatory program, while single cell RNA sequencing projects are providing a much deeper understanding of cnidarian neural cell type diversity. At the level of neural function, the physiological properties of ion channels have been described and calcium imaging of the nervous system in whole animals has allowed for the identification of neural circuits underlying specific behaviours. Cnidarians have arrived in the modern era of molecular neurobiology and are primed to provide exciting new insights into the early evolution of nervous systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: How to correctly quantify neuronal phase-response curves from noisy recordings. (arXiv:1901.04399v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.04399</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.04399</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;At the level of individual neurons, various coding properties can be inferred
from the input-output relationship of a cell. For small inputs, this relation
is captured by the phase-response curve (PRC), which measures the effect of a
small perturbation on the timing of the subsequent spike. Experimentally,
however, an accurate experimental estimation of PRCs is challenging. Despite
elaborate measurement efforts, experimental PRC estimates often cannot be
related to those from modeling studies. In particular, experimental PRCs rarely
resemble the generic PRC expected close to spike initiation, which is
indicative of the underlying spike-onset bifurcation. Here, we show for
conductance-based model neurons that the correspondence between theoretical and
measured phase-response curve is lost when the stimuli used for the estimation
are too large. In this case, the derived phase-response curve is distorted
beyond recognition and takes on a generic shape that reflects the measurement
protocol, but not the real neuronal dynamics. We discuss how to identify
appropriate stimulus strengths for perturbation and noise-stimulation methods,
which permit to estimate PRCs that reliably reflect the spike-onset bifurcation
-- a task that is particularly difficult if a lower bound for the stimulus
amplitude is dictated by prominent intrinsic neuronal noise.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Optimal decoding of dynamic stimuli encoded by heterogeneous populations of spiking neurons - a closed form approximation. (arXiv:1901.04094v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.04094</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.04094</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural decoding may be formulated as dynamic state estimation (filtering)
based on point process observations, a generally intractable problem. Numerical
sampling techniques are often practically useful for the decoding of real
neural data. However, they are less useful as theoretical tools for modeling
and understanding sensory neural systems, since they lead to limited conceptual
insight about optimal encoding and decoding strategies. We consider sensory
neural populations characterized by a distribution over neuron parameters. We
develop an analytically tractable Bayesian approximation to optimal filtering
based on the observation of spiking activity, that greatly facilitates the
analysis of optimal encoding in situations deviating from common assumptions of
uniform coding. Continuous distributions are used to approximate large
populations with few parameters, resulting in a filter whose complexity does
not grow with the population size, and allowing optimization of population
parameters rather than individual tuning functions. Numerical comparison with
particle filtering demonstrates the quality of the approximation. The analytic
framework leads to insights which are difficult to obtain from numerical
algorithms, and is consistent with biological observations about the
distribution of sensory cells' preferred stimuli.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.03990</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human listeners need to permanently interact with their three-dimensional
(3-D) environment. To this end, they require efficient perceptual mechanisms to
form a sufficiently accurate 3-D auditory space. In this chapter, we discuss
the formation of the 3-D auditory space from various perspectives. The aim is
to show the link between cognition, acoustics, neurophysiology, and
psychophysics, when it comes to spatial hearing. First, we present recent
cognitive concepts for creating internal models of the complex auditory
environment. Second, we describe the acoustic signals available at our ears and
discuss the spatial information they convey. Third, we look into
neurophysiology, seeking for the neural substrates of the 3-D auditory space.
Finally, we elaborate on psychophysical spatial tasks and percepts that are
possible just because of the formation of the auditory space.

	<description>Tanimura et al. found that motor-learning deficits in a mouse model of PD were triggered by adaptations in the thalamostriatal circuitry. Cholinergic interneuron activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on thalamostriatal axons was key to the adaptation.</description>

Metabolomics is a powerful approach for discovering biomarkers and for characterizing the biochemical consequences of genetic variation. While untargeted metabolite profiling can measure thousands of signals in a single experiment, many biologically meaningful signals cannot be readily identified as known metabolites nor compared across datasets, making it difficult to infer biology and to conduct well-powered meta-analyses across studies. To overcome these challenges, we developed a suite of computational methods, PAIRUP-MS, to match metabolite signals across mass spectrometry-based profiling datasets and to generate metabolic pathway annotations for these signals. To pair up signals measured in different datasets, where retention times (RT) are often not comparable or even available, we implemented an imputation-based approach that only requires mass-to-charge ratios (m/z). As validation, we treated each shared known metabolite as an unmatched signal and showed that PAIRUP-MS correctly matched 70–88% of these metabolites from among thousands of signals, equaling or outperforming a standard m/z- and RT-based approach. We performed further validation using genetic data: the most stringent set of matched signals and shared knowns showed comparable consistency of genetic associations across datasets. Next, we developed a pathway reconstitution method to annotate unknown signals using curated metabolic pathways containing known metabolites. We performed genetic validation for the generated annotations, showing that annotated signals associated with gene variants were more likely to be enriched for pathways functionally related to the genes compared to random expectation. Finally, we applied PAIRUP-MS to study associations between metabolites and genetic variants or body mass index (BMI) across multiple datasets, identifying up to ~6 times more significant signals and many more BMI-associated pathways compared to the standard practice of only analyzing known metabolites. These results demonstrate that PAIRUP-MS enables analysis of unknown signals in a robust, biologically meaningful manner and provides a path to more comprehensive, well-powered studies of untargeted metabolomics data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HsKjvnq3E10&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The mental contents of perception and imagery are thought to be encoded in hierarchical representations in the brain, but previous attempts to visualize perceptual contents have failed to capitalize on multiple levels of the hierarchy, leaving it challenging to reconstruct internal imagery. Recent work showed that visual cortical activity measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be decoded (translated) into the hierarchical features of a pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) for the same input image, providing a way to make use of the information from hierarchical visual features. Here, we present a novel image reconstruction method, in which the pixel values of an image are optimized to make its DNN features similar to those decoded from human brain activity at multiple layers. We found that our method was able to reliably produce reconstructions that resembled the viewed natural images. A natural image prior introduced by a deep generator neural network effectively rendered semantically meaningful details to the reconstructions. Human judgment of the reconstructions supported the effectiveness of combining multiple DNN layers to enhance the visual quality of generated images. While our model was solely trained with natural images, it successfully generalized to artificial shapes, indicating that our model was not simply matching to exemplars. The same analysis applied to mental imagery demonstrated rudimentary reconstructions of the subjective content. Our results suggest that our method can effectively combine hierarchical neural representations to reconstruct perceptual and subjective images, providing a new window into the internal contents of the brain.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/egFhcN5PfJ8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Postmeal optogenetic inhibition of dorsal or ventral hippocampal pyramidal neurons increases future intake</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Memory of a recently eaten meal can serve as a powerful mechanism for controlling future eating behavior because it provides a record of intake that likely outlasts most physiological signals generated by the meal. In support, impairing the encoding of a meal in humans increases the amount ingested at the next eating episode. However, the brain regions that mediate the inhibitory effects of memory on future intake are unknown. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that dorsal (dHC) and ventral hippocampal (vHC) glutamatergic pyramidal neurons play a critical role in the inhibition of energy intake during the postprandial period by optogenetically inhibiting these neurons at specific times relative to a meal. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were given viral vectors containing CaMKIIα-eArchT3.0-eYFP or CaMKIIα-GFP and fiber optic probes into dHC of one hemisphere and vHC of the other. Compared to intake on a day in which illumination was not given, inhibition of dHC or vHC glutamatergic neurons after the end of a chow, sucrose, or saccharin meal accelerated the onset of the next meal and increased the amount consumed during that next meal when the neurons were no longer inhibited. Inhibition given during a meal did not affect the amount consumed during that meal or the next one but did hasten meal initiation. These data show that dHC and vHC glutamatergic neuronal activity during the postprandial period is critical for limiting subsequent ingestion and suggest that these neurons inhibit future intake by consolidating the memory of the preceding meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Memory of a recently eaten meal provides a lasting record of recent intake and limits subsequent ingestion; however, the neural mechanisms underlying these mnemonic effects remain unknown. Here, we show that optogenetic inhibition of dorsal or ventral hippocampal pyramidal neurons induced after the end of a sucrose, chow or saccharin meal, when the memory of the meal would be undergoing consolidation, accelerated the initiation of the next meal and, importantly, increased the amount consumed during that next meal when the neurons were no longer inhibited. These findings show that principal hippocampal neurons limit future intake and suggest that they do so by consolidating the memory of the preceding meal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The subiculum is the main target of the hippocampal region CA1 and is the principle output region of the hippocampus. The subiculum is critical to learning and memory, although it has been relatively understudied. There are two functional types of principle neurons within the subiculum: regular spiking (RS) and burst spiking (BS) neurons. To determine whether these cell types are differentially modified by learning-related experience, we performed whole-cell patch clamp recordings from male mouse brain slices following contextual fear conditioning (FC) and memory retrieval relative to a number of control behavioral paradigms. RS cells, but not BS cells, displayed a greater degree of experience-related plasticity in intrinsic excitability measures [afterhyperpolarization (AHP), input resistance (R&lt;sub&gt;input&lt;/sub&gt;), current required to elicit a spike], with fear conditioned animals having generally more excitable RS cells compared to naïve controls. Furthermore, we found that the relative proportion of RS to BS neurons is modified by the type of exposure, with the lowest proportion of BS subicular cells occurring in animals that underwent contextual FC followed by a retrieval test. These studies indicate that pyramidal neurons in the subiculum undergo experience- and learning-related plasticity in intrinsic properties in a cell-type-specific manner. As BS and RS cells are thought to convey distinct types of information, this plasticity may be particularly important in encoding, consolidating, and recalling spatial information by modulating information flow from the hippocampus to cortical regions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: PINK1 Interacts with VCP/p97 and Activates PKA to Promote NSFL1C/p47 Phosphorylation and Dendritic Arborization in Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;While PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) is well characterized for its role in mitochondrial homeostasis, much less is known concerning its ability to prevent synaptodendritic degeneration. Using unbiased proteomic methods, we identified valosin-containing protein (VCP) as a major PINK1-interacting protein. RNAi studies demonstrate that both VCP and its cofactor NSFL1C/p47 are necessary for the ability of PINK1 to increase dendritic complexity. Moreover, PINK1 regulates phosphorylation of p47, but not the VCP co-factor UFD1. Although neither VCP nor p47 interact directly with PKA, we found that PINK1 binds and phosphorylates the catalytic subunit of PKA at T197 [PKA&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;(pT197)], a site known to activate the PKA holoenzyme. PKA in turn phosphorylates p47 at a novel site (S176) to regulate dendritic complexity. Given that PINK1 physically interacts with both the PKA holoenzyme and the VCP-p47 complex to promote dendritic arborization, we propose that PINK1 scaffolds a novel PINK1-VCP-PKA-p47 signaling pathway to orchestrate dendritogenesis in neurons. These findings highlight an important mechanism by which proteins genetically implicated in Parkinson’s disease (PD; PINK1) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD; VCP) interact to support the health and maintenance of neuronal arbors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Longitudinal Changes in Semantic Concreteness in Semantic Variant Primary Progressive Aphasia (svPPA)</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;This study examines longitudinal changes in the concreteness of nouns produced by human patients with semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA). Cross-sectional studies show that patients with svPPA demonstrate severe loss of concrete noun knowledge linked to atrophy of the left ventral temporal lobe. It is unknown how disease spread and duration affect the magnitude of the concreteness impairment in svPPA. We evaluate longitudinal spoken production of concrete nouns in svPPA, and relate this to changes in longitudinal MRI measures of gray matter (GM). Noun concreteness in svPPA is compared to that of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) patients, who typically demonstrate highly concrete speech. We elicited naturalistic speech samples at two time points (time 1 and time 2) in patients with svPPA (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 11) and bvFTD (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 15) through descriptions of the Cookie Theft picture and evaluated each spoken noun for concreteness. Compared to bvFTD patients whose noun production remained highly concrete throughout the testing period, mixed-effects models revealed that noun concreteness significantly decreased as disease progressed in svPPA. We also measured longitudinal changes to GM in a subset of svPPA patients (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 7), who showed significant decline in the left and right temporal and frontal regions. Regression analyses revealed that longitudinal GM atrophy in the right fusiform and parahippocampal gyri and the left superior temporal gyrus was related to decreasing noun concreteness. These results suggest that progressive atrophy of the ventral temporal lobe in svPPA contributes to declining concrete noun production over time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: DIVE: A spatiotemporal progression model of brain pathology in neurodegenerative disorders. (arXiv:1901.03553v1 [cs.CV])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Here we present DIVE: Data-driven Inference of Vertexwise Evolution. DIVE is
an image-based disease progression model with single-vertex resolution,
designed to reconstruct long-term patterns of brain pathology from short-term
longitudinal data sets. DIVE clusters vertex-wise biomarker measurements on the
cortical surface that have similar temporal dynamics across a patient
population, and concurrently estimates an average trajectory of vertex
measurements in each cluster. DIVE uniquely outputs a parcellation of the
cortex into areas with common progression patterns, leading to a new signature
for individual diseases. DIVE further estimates the disease stage and
progression speed for every visit of every subject, potentially enhancing
stratification for clinical trials or management. On simulated data, DIVE can
recover ground truth clusters and their underlying trajectory, provided the
average trajectories are sufficiently different between clusters. We
demonstrate DIVE on data from two cohorts: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ADNI) and the Dementia Research Centre (DRC), UK, containing
patients with Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA) as well as typical Alzheimer's
disease (tAD). DIVE finds similar spatial patterns of atrophy for tAD subjects
in the two independent datasets (ADNI and DRC), and further reveals distinct
patterns of pathology in different diseases (tAD vs PCA) and for distinct types
of biomarker data: cortical thickness from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) vs
amyloid load from Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Finally, DIVE can be used
to estimate a fine-grained spatial distribution of pathology in the brain using
any kind of voxelwise or vertexwise measures including Jacobian compression
maps, fractional anisotropy (FA) maps from diffusion imaging or other PET
measures. DIVE source code is available online:

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain computer interfaces (BCI) provide a direct communication link between
the brain and a computer or other external devices. They offer an extended
degree of freedom either by strengthening or by substituting human peripheral
working capacity and have potential applications in various fields such as
rehabilitation, affective computing, robotics, gaming and artificial
intelligence. Significant research efforts on a global scale have delivered
common platforms for technology standardization and help tackle highly complex
and nonlinear brain dynamics and related feature extraction and classification
challenges. Psycho-neurophysiological phenomena and their impact on brain
signals impose another challenge for BCI researchers to transform the
technology from laboratory experiments to plug-and-play daily life. This review
summarizes progress in BCI field and highlights critical challenges.

In this issue of Nature Neuroscience, Montchal et al. describe brain activity patterns that predict how well people remember precisely when recent events occurred. Converging evidence suggests that homologous neural machinery structures temporal representations in rats and people.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/dJNHQT28zPU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Easily accessible biomarkers in Huntington disease (HD) are actively searched. We investigated telomere length and DNA double‐strand breaks (histone variant pγ‐H2AX) as predictive disease biomarkers in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 25 premanifest subjects, 58 HD patients with similar CAG expansion in the huntingtin gene (&lt;i&gt;HTT&lt;/i&gt;), and 44 healthy controls (HC). PBMC from the pre‐HD and HD groups showed shorter telomeres (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) and a significant increase of pγ‐H2AX compared to the controls (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). The levels of pγ‐H2AX correlated robustly with the presence of the mutated gene in pre‐HD and HD. The availability of a potentially reversible biomarker (pγ‐H2AX) in the premanifest stage of HD, negligible in HC, provides a novel tool to monitor premanifest subjects and find patient‐specific drugs.

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Pain-Related Fear--Dissociable Neural Sources of Different Fear Constructs</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Fear of pain demonstrates significant prognostic value regarding the development of persistent musculoskeletal pain and disability. Its assessment often relies on self-report measures of pain-related fear by a variety of questionnaires. However, based either on &quot;fear of movement/(re)injury/kinesiophobia,&quot; &quot;fear avoidance beliefs,&quot; or &quot;pain anxiety,&quot; pain-related fear constructs plausibly differ while it is unclear how specific the questionnaires are in assessing these different constructs. Furthermore, the relationship of pain-related fear to other anxiety measures such as state or trait anxiety remains ambiguous. Advances in neuroimaging such as machine learning on brain activity patterns recorded by functional magnetic resonance imaging might help to dissect commonalities or differences across pain-related fear constructs. We applied a pattern regression approach in 20 human patients with nonspecific chronic low back pain to reveal predictive relationships between fear-related neural pattern information and different pain-related fear questionnaires. More specifically, the applied multiple kernel learning approach allowed the generation of models to predict the questionnaire scores based on a hierarchical ranking of fear-related neural patterns induced by viewing videos of activities potentially harmful for the back. We sought to find evidence for or against overlapping pain-related fear constructs by comparing the questionnaire prediction models according to their predictive abilities and associated neural contributors. By demonstrating evidence of nonoverlapping neural predictors within fear-processing regions, the results underpin the diversity of pain-related fear constructs. This neuroscientific approach might ultimately help to further understand and dissect psychological pain-related fear constructs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The study of neuronal responses to random-dot motion patterns has provided some of the most valuable insights into how the activity of neurons is related to perception. In the opposite directions of motion paradigm, the motion signal strength is decreased by manipulating the coherence of random dot patterns to examine how well the activity of single neurons represents the direction of motion. To extend this paradigm to populations of neurons, studies have used modelling based on data from pairs of neurons, but several important questions require further investigation with larger neuronal datasets. We recorded neuronal populations in the middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas of anaesthetized marmosets with electrode arrays, while varying the coherence of random dot patterns in two opposite directions of motion (left and right). Using the spike rates of simultaneously recorded neurons, we decoded the direction of motion at each level of coherence with linear classifiers. We found that the presence of correlations had a detrimental effect to decoding performance, but that learning the correlation structure produced better decoding performance compared to decoders that ignored the correlation structure. We also found that reducing motion coherence increased neuronal correlations, but decoders did not need to be optimized for each coherence level. Finally, we showed that decoder weights depend of left-right selectivity at 100% coherence, rather than the preferred direction. These results have implications for understanding how the information encoded by populations of neurons is affected by correlations in spiking activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BL) is thought to support numerous emotional behaviors through specific microcircuits. These are often thought to be comprised of feedforward networks of principal cells and interneurons. Neither well-understood nor often considered are recurrent and feedback connections, which likely engender oscillatory dynamics within BL. Indeed, oscillations in the gamma frequency range (40-100 Hz) are known to occur in the BL, and yet their origin and effect on local circuits remains unknown. To address this, we constructed a biophysically and anatomically detailed model of the rat BL and its local field potential based on the physiological and anatomical literature, along with &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; data we collected on the activities of neurons within the rat BL. Remarkably, the model produced intermittent gamma oscillations (~50-70 Hz) whose properties matched those recorded &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, including their entrainment of spiking. BL gamma-band oscillations were generated by the intrinsic circuitry, depending upon reciprocal interactions between principal cells and fast-spiking interneurons, while connections within these cell types affected the rhythm’s frequency. The model allowed us to conduct experimentally impossible tests to characterize the synaptic and spatial properties of gamma. The entrainment of individual neurons to gamma depended on the number of afferent connections they received, and gamma bursts were spatially restricted in the BL. Importantly, the gamma rhythm synchronized principal cells and mediated competition between ensembles. Together, these results indicate that the recurrent connectivity of BL expands its computational and communication repertoire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significant Statement&lt;/b&gt; Using &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; data we develop the first large-scale biophysically and anatomically realistic model of the basolateral amygdala nucleus (BL), which reproduces the dynamics of the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; local field potential (LFP). Significantly, it predicts that BL intrinsically generates the transient gamma oscillations observed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. The model permitted exploration of the poorly understood synaptic mechanisms underlying gamma genesis in BL, and the model's ability to compute LFPs at arbitrary numbers of recording sites provided insights into the characteristics of the spatial properties of gamma bursts. Furthermore, we show how gamma synchronizes principal cells to overcome their low firing rates while simultaneously promoting competition, potentially impacting their afferent selectivity and efferent drive, and thus emotional behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High levels of antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) are observed in patients with different neurological disorders, but cells producing these auto‐antibodies are largely unexplored. We detect circulating GAD‐reactive B cells in peripheral blood that readily differentiate into antibody‐producing cells. These cells are highly elevated in most patients with GAD‐antibody‐associated disorders (n=15) compared to controls (n=19). They mainly produce GAD65‐antibodies of the IgG1 and IgG4 subclasses and are as abundant as B cells reactive for common recall antigens. Bone marrow cells represent an additional source of GAD‐antibodies. The identification of GAD‐antibody‐producing cells has implications for the selection of cell‐specific biologics.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: APRIL‐mediated anti‐inflammatory response of astrocytes in multiple sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25415?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the two related TNF members APRIL and BAFF are currently targeted in autoimmune diseases as B‐cell regulators. In multiple sclerosis (MS), combined APRIL/BAFF blockade led to an unexpected exacerbated inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS) of patients. Here, we investigate the role of the APRIL/BAFF axis in the CNS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;APRIL expression was analyzed in MS lesions by immunohistochemistry. The &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; role of APRIL was assessed in the murine MS model, experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE). Functional &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies were performed with human and mouse astrocytes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;APRIL was expressed in lesions from EAE. In its absence, the disease was worst. Lesions from MS patients also showed APRIL expression upon infiltration of macrophages. Notably, all the APRIL secreted by these macrophages specifically targeted astrocytes. The upregulation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) bearing sometimes chondroitin sulfate of type E sugar moieties, binding APRIL, in reactive astrocytes explained the latter selectivity. Astrocytes responded to APRIL by producing sufficient amount of IL‐10 to dampen antigen‐specific T‐cell proliferation and pathogenic cytokine secretion. Finally, an intraspinal delivery of recombinant APRIL before disease onset shortly reduced EAE symptoms. Repeated intravenous injections of recombinant APRIL before and even at disease onset had also an effect.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;our data show that APRIL mediates an anti‐inflammatory response from astrocytes in MS lesions. This protective activity is not shared with BAFF.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Brain and cord imaging features in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To validate imaging features able to discriminate neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders from multiple sclerosis with conventional MRI.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this cross‐sectional study, brain and spinal cord scans were evaluated from 116 neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders patients (98 seropositive and 18 seronegative) in chronic disease phase and 65 age‐, sex‐ and disease duration‐matched multiple sclerosis patients. To identify independent predictors of neuromyelitis optica diagnosis, after assessing the prevalence of typical/atypical findings, the original cohort was 2:1 randomized in a training sample (where a multivariate logistic regression analysis was run) and a validation sample (where the performance of the selected variables was tested and validated).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typical brain lesions occurred in 50.9% of neuromyelitis optica patients (18.1% brainstem periventricular/periaqueductal; 32.7% periependymal along lateral ventricles, 3.4% large hemispheric; 6.0% diencephalic; 4.3% cortico‐spinal tract), 72.2% had spinal cord lesions (46.3% long transverse myelitis, 36.1% short transverse myelitis) 37.1% satisfied 2010 McDonald criteria and none had cortical lesions. Fulfillment of at least 2/5 of: absence of juxtacortical/cortical lesions, absence of periventricular lesions, absence of Dawson's fingers, presence of long transverse myelitis or presence of periependymal lesions along lateral ventricles, discriminated neuromyelitis optica patients in both training (sensitivity [95% confidence interval ]=0.92 [0.84‐0.97], specificity=0.91 [0.78‐0.97]) and validation samples (sensitivity=0.82 [0.66‐0.92], specificity=0.91 [0.71‐0.99]). MRI findings and criteria performance were similar irrespective of serostatus.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although up to 50% of neuromyelitis optica patients have no typical lesions and a relatively high percentage of them satisfies multiple sclerosis criteria, several easily applicable imaging features can help to identify neuromyelitis optica from multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Amyloid‐β Immunotherapy for Alzheimer's Disease – Is It Now A Long Shot…?</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amyloid‐β (Aβ) cascade hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) holds that brain accumulation of Aβ initiates the disease process. Accordingly, drug research has targeted Aβ production, clearance or deposition as therapeutic strategies. Unfortunately, candidate drugs have failed to show clinical benefit in established, early or prodromal disease, or those with high AD risk. Currently, monoclonal antibodies specifically directed against the most neurotoxic Aβ forms are undergoing large scale trials to confirm initially encouraging results. However, recent findings on the normal physiology of Aβ suggest that accumulation may be compensatory rather than the pathological initiator. If this is true, alternative strategies will be needed to defeat this devastating disease.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Cerebellar degeneration correlates with motor symptoms in Huntington's disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25413?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by variable motor and behavioural symptoms attributed to major neuropathology of mainly the basal ganglia and cerebral cortex. The role of the cerebellum, a brain region involved in the coordination of movements, in HD neuropathology has been controversial. This study utilises post‐mortem human brain tissue to investigate whether Purkinje cell degeneration in the neocerebellum is present in HD, and how this relates to disease symptom profiles.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unbiased stereological counting methods were used to quantify the total number of Purkinje cells in 15 HD cases and 8 neurologically normal control cases. Based on their predominant symptoms, the HD cases were categorised into two groups: “motor” or “mood”.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results demonstrated a significant 43% loss of Purkinje cells in HD cases with predominantly motor symptoms, and no cell loss in cases showing a major mood phenotype. There was no significant correlation between Purkinje cell loss and striatal neuropathological grade, post‐mortem delay, CAG repeat in the IT15 gene or age at death.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study shows a compelling relationship between Purkinje cell loss in the HD neocerebellum and the HD motor symptom phenotype, which, together with our previous human brain studies on the same HD cases, provide novel perspectives interrelating and correlating the variable cerebellar, basal ganglia and neocortical neuropathology with the variability of motor/mood symptom profiles in the human HD brain.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: SLC13A3 variants cause acute reversible leukoencephalopathy and αKG accumulation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25412?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25412?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;SLC13A3&lt;/i&gt; encodes the plasma membrane Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Dicarboxylate Cotransporter 3 (NaDC3), which imports inside the cell four to six carbon dicarboxylates as well as N‐acetylaspartate (NAA). SLC13A3 is mainly expressed in kidney, in astrocytes and in the choroid plexus. We describe two unrelated patients presenting with acute, reversible (and recurrent in one) neurological deterioration during a febrile illness. Both patients exhibited a reversible leukoencephalopathy and a markedly increased and persisting over time urinary excretion of α‐ketoglutarate (αKG). In one patient, increased cerebrospinal fluid NAA and dicarboxylates (including αKG) concentrations were observed. Extensive workup was unsuccessful and a genetic cause was suspected.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed. Our teams were connected through GeneMatcher.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WES analysis revealed variants in &lt;i&gt;SLC13A3&lt;/i&gt;. A homozygous missense mutation (p.Ala254Asp) was found in the first patient. The second patient was heterozygous for another missense mutation (p.Gly548Ser) and an intronic mutation affecting splicing as demonstrated by RT‐PCR performed in muscle tissue (c.1016+3A&amp;gt;G). Mutations and segregation were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Functional studies performed on HEK293T cells transiently transfected with wild type and mutant SLC13A3 indicated that the missense mutations caused a marked reduction in the capacity to transport αKG, succinate and NAA.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SLC13A3 deficiency causes acute and reversible leukoencephalopathy with marked accumulation of αKG. Urine organic acids (especially αKG and NAA) and &lt;i&gt;SLC13A3&lt;/i&gt; mutations should be screened in patients presenting with unexplained reversible leukoencephalopathy for which SLC13A3 deficiency is a novel differential diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The P300 Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a well-established communication
channel for severely disabled people. The P300 event-related potential is
mostly characterized by its amplitude or its area, which correlate with the
spelling accuracy of the P300 speller. Here, we introduce a novel approach for
estimating the efficiency of this BCI by considering the P300 signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR), a parameter that estimates the spatial and temporal noise levels
and has a significantly stronger correlation with spelling accuracy.
Furthermore, we suggest a Gaussian noise model, which utilizes the P300
event-related potential SNR to predict spelling accuracy under various
conditions for LDA-based classification. We demonstrate the utility of this
analysis using real data and discuss its potential applications, such as
speeding up the process of electrode selection.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The brain stimulation and its widespread use is one of the most important
subjects in studies of neurophysiology. In brain electrical stimulation
methods, following the surgery and electrode implantation, electrodes send
electrical impulses to the specific targets in the brain. The use of this
stimulation method is provided therapeutic benefits for treatment chronic pain,
essential tremor, Parkinsons disease, major depression, and neurological
movement disorder syndrome (dystonia). One area in which advancements have been
recently made is in controlling the movement and navigation of animals in a
specific pathway. It is important to identify brain targets in order to
stimulate appropriate brain regions for all the applications listed above. An
animal navigation system based on brain electrical stimulation is used to
develop new behavioral models for the aim of creating a platform for
interacting with the animal nervous system in the spatial learning task. In the
context of animal navigation the electrical stimulation has been used either as
creating virtual sensation for movement guidance or virtual reward for movement
motivation. In this paper, different approaches and techniques of brain
electrical stimulation for this application has been reviewed.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02915</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;To study how mental object representations are related to behavior, we
estimated sparse, non-negative representations of objects using human
behavioral judgments on images representative of 1,854 object categories. These
representations predicted a latent similarity structure between objects, which
captured most of the explainable variance in human behavioral judgments.
Individual dimensions in the low-dimensional embedding were found to be highly
reproducible and interpretable as conveying degrees of taxonomic membership,
functionality, and perceptual attributes. We further demonstrated the
predictive power of the embeddings for explaining other forms of human
behavior, including categorization, typicality judgments, and feature ratings,
suggesting that the dimensions reflect human conceptual representations of
objects beyond the specific task.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has the worst prognosis among solid malignancies and improved therapeutic strategies are needed to improve outcomes. Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and patient-derived organoids (PDO) serve as promising tools to identify new drugs with therapeutic potential in PDAC. For these preclinical disease models to be effective, they should both recapitulate the molecular heterogeneity of PDAC and validate patient-specific therapeutic sensitivities. To date however, deep characterization of the molecular heterogeneity of PDAC PDX and PDO models and comparison with matched human tumour remains largely unaddressed at the whole genome level. We conducted a comprehensive assessment of the genetic landscape of 16 whole-genome pairs of tumours and matched PDX, from primary PDAC and liver metastasis, including a unique cohort of 5 ‘trios’ of matched primary tumour, PDX, and PDO. We developed a pipeline to score concordance between PDAC models and their paired human tumours for genomic events, including mutations, structural variations, and copy number variations. Tumour-model comparisons of mutations displayed single-gene concordance across major PDAC driver genes, but relatively poor agreement across the greater mutational load. Genome-wide and chromosome-centric analysis of structural variation (SV) events highlights previously unrecognized concordance across chromosomes that demonstrate clustered SV events. We found that polyploidy presented a major challenge when assessing copy number changes; however, ploidy-corrected copy number states suggest good agreement between donor-model pairs. Collectively, our investigations highlight that while PDXs and PDOs may serve as tractable and transplantable systems for probing the molecular properties of PDAC, these models may best serve &lt;i&gt;selective&lt;/i&gt; analyses across different levels of genomic complexity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/I_DH2nH8efs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The high failure rate of therapeutics showing promise in mouse models to translate to patients is a pressing challenge in biomedical science. Though retrospective studies have examined the fidelity of mouse models to their respective human conditions, approaches for prospective translation of insights from mouse models to patients remain relatively unexplored. Here, we develop a semi-supervised learning approach for inference of disease-associated human differentially expressed genes and pathways from mouse model experiments. We examined 36 transcriptomic case studies where comparable phenotypes were available for mouse and human inflammatory diseases and assessed multiple computational approaches for inferring human biology from mouse datasets. We found that semi-supervised training of a neural network identified significantly more true human biological associations than interpreting mouse experiments directly. Evaluating the experimental design of mouse experiments where our model was most successful revealed principles of experimental design that may improve translational performance. Our study shows that when prospectively evaluating biological associations in mouse studies, semi-supervised learning approaches, combining mouse and human data for biological inference, provide the most accurate assessment of human &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; disease processes. Finally, we proffer a delineation of four categories of model system-to-human “Translation Problems” defined by the resolution and coverage of the datasets available for molecular insight translation and suggest that the task of translating insights from model systems to human disease contexts may be better accomplished by a combination of translation-minded experimental design and computational approaches.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XOH4TEke77c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The primary sensory cortex processes competitive sensory inputs. Ablation of these competitive inputs induces neuroplastic changes in local cortical circuits. However, information concerning cortical plasticity induced by a disturbance of competitive nociceptive inputs is limited. Nociceptive information from the maxillary and mandibular molar pulps converges at the border between the ventral secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) and insular oral region (IOR), therefore S2/IOR is a suitable target for examining the cortical changes induced by a disturbance of noxious inputs, which often causes neuropathic pain and allodynia. We focused on the plastic changes in S2/IOR excitation in a model of rats subjected to inferior alveolar nerve transection (IANX). Our optical imaging using a voltage-sensitive dye revealed that the maxillary molar pulp stimulation-induced excitatory propagation was expanded 1-2 weeks after IANX at the macroscopic level. At the cellular level, based on Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging using two-photon microscopy, the amplitude of the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; responses and the number of responding neurons in S2/IOR increased in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; laser scanning photostimulation revealed that layer II/III pyramidal and GABAergic fast-spiking neurons in S2/IOR received larger excitatory inputs from layer IV in the IANX models, which supports the findings obtained by the macroscopic and microscopic optical imaging. Furthermore, the inhibitory postsynaptic inputs to the pyramidal neurons were decreased in the IANX models, suggesting suppression of inhibitory synaptic transmission onto excitatory neurons. These results suggest that IANX induces plastic changes in S2/IOR by changing the local excitatory and inhibitory circuits. (246/250 words)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; The inferior alveolar nerve (IAN), a mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve, innervates the orofacial region, including the tooth pulps. IAN transection (IANX) induces allodynia in the maxillary nerve-projecting region. This study demonstrates the facilitation of excitatory propagation in the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) and insular oral region (IOR) following maxillary molar tooth pulp stimulation in IANX rats. Both pyramidal and fast-spiking neurons in layer II/III S2/IOR of IANX rats received larger glutamatergic excitatory inputs from the deeper layers. Reduction of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-mediated IPSCs in pyramidal neurons of IANX rats may contribute to the facilitated excitation in S2/IOR. These findings suggest that GABAergic neurons in S2/IOR could be a therapeutic target for ectopic pain in the orofacial region. (118/120 words)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Pre-clinical and clinical research has shown that females are more vulnerable to the rewarding effects of stimulants, and it has been proposed that estrogens may play a role in this enhanced sensitivity; however sex differences in methamphetamine (METH)-induced neuroplasticity have not been explored. To address this gap in knowledge we recorded from the prelimbic area of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of male and females rats following long access METH self-administration (SA) and investigated the resulting long-term synaptic neuroadaptations. Males and females took similar amounts of METH during self-administration; however, female rats exhibit significant synaptic baseline differences when compared to males. Furthermore, females exhibited a significant increase in evoked excitatory currents. This increase in evoked glutamate was correlated with increases in NMDA currents and was not affected by application of a GluN2B selective blocker. We propose that METH SA selectively upregulates GluN2B-lacking NMDAR in the PFC of female rats. Our results may provide a mechanistic explanation for the sex differences reported for METH addiction in females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The rate of methamphetamine (METH) addiction is second only to heroin, and use trends are on the rise. Like other drugs of abuse, there are known sex differences in METH addiction, however if these differences result from sex differences in pharmacokinetics, neurophysiology, and/or drug-induced neuroplasticity has not been established. Here we assessed METH self-administration induced neuroadaptations in synaptic physiology using electrophysiological measures in prefrontal cortical brain slices of male and female rats. We are the first to report, to our knowledge, that cortical baseline and METH-induced synaptic responses are different between male and female rats. Our results may provide a mechanistic explanation for the sex differences reported for METH addiction in females and highlight the possibility that sex-specific treatment strategies may be required to address METH-induced neuroplasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Volatile anesthetics affect neuronal signaling by poorly understood mechanisms. Activation of central dopaminergic pathways has been implicated in emergence from general anesthesia. The volatile anesthetic isoflurane differentially inhibits glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic vesicle exocytosis by reducing presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx without affecting the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-exocytosis relationship, but its effects on dopaminergic exocytosis are unclear. We tested the hypothesis that isoflurane inhibits exocytosis in dopaminergic neurons. We used electrical stimulation or depolarization by elevated extracellular KCl to evoke exocytosis measured by quantitative live-cell fluorescence imaging in cultured rat ventral tegmental area neurons. Using trains of electrically evoked action potentials (APs), isoflurane inhibited exocytosis in dopaminergic neurons to a greater extent (30 ± 4% inhibition; p &amp;lt; 0.0001) than in non-dopaminergic neurons (15 ± 5% inhibition; p = 0.014). Isoflurane also inhibited exocytosis evoked by elevated KCl in dopaminergic neurons (35 ± 6% inhibition; p = 0.0007), but not in non-dopaminergic neurons (2 ± 4% inhibition). Pharmacological isolation of presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel subtypes showed that isoflurane inhibited KCl-evoked exocytosis mediated exclusively by either Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 (P/Q-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels) (30 ± 5% inhibition; p = 0.0002) or by Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.2 (N-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels) (35 ± 11% inhibition; p = 0.015). Additionally, isoflurane inhibited single AP-evoked Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx by 41 ± 3% and single AP-evoked exocytosis by 34 ± 6%. Comparable reductions in exocytosis and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx were produced by lowering extracellular [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]. Thus, isoflurane inhibits exocytosis from dopaminergic neurons by a mechanism distinct from that in non-dopaminergic neurons involving reduced Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry through Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 and/or Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Despite their medical importance, the mechanisms of action of general anesthetics have not been fully elucidated. Isoflurane, a widely used volatile anesthetic, inhibits voltage-gated sodium channels and differentially inhibits synaptic vesicle exocytosis depending on neurotransmitter phenotype. Here we show that in dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area isoflurane acts via a sodium channel-independent mechanism to inhibit synaptic vesicle exocytosis in proportion to reduced presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; flux mediated by Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 and/or Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.2, in contrast to its effects in non-dopaminergic neurons. These findings provide a synaptic mechanism for the observed role of reduced dopamine release in anesthetic-induced unconsciousness, and implicate presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels of dopaminergic neurons as important targets of isoflurane.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transparent and flexible materials are attractive for a wide range of emerging bioelectronic applications. These include neural interfacing devices for both recording and stimulation, where low electrochemical electrode impedance is valuable. Here the conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is used to fabricate electrodes that are small enough to allow unencumbered optical access for imaging a large cell population with two-photon (2P) microscopy, yet provide low impedance for simultaneous high quality recordings of neural activity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. To demonstrate this, pathophysiological activity was induced in the mouse cortex using 4-aminopyridine (4AP), and the resulting electrical activity was detected with the PEDOT:PSS-based probe while imaging calcium activity directly below the probe area. The induced calcium activity of the neuronal network as measured by the fluorescence change in the cells correlated well with the electrophysiological recordings from the cortical grid of PEDOT:PSS microelectrodes. Our approach provides a valuable vehicle for complementing classical high temporal resolution electrophysiological analysis with optical imaging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Nociceptin/Orphanin-FQ Inhibits Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Neurons via G-Protein-Gated Inwardly Rectifying Potassium Channels</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The pulsatile release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is a key feature of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis. Kisspeptin neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) trigger GnRH neuronal activity, but how GnRH neurons return to baseline electrical activity is unknown. Nociceptin/orphanin-FQ (OFQ) is an inhibitory neuromodulator. ARC proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons, known to receive inputs from ARC kisspeptin neurons, contact GnRH neurons and coexpress OFQ in the rat. In the present study, the effect of OFQ(1-13) on GnRH neurons was determined in the mouse. We identified transcripts for the OFQ receptor [opioid receptor like 1 (ORL1)] in GnRH neurons, and, using two-model systems (explants and slices), we found that OFQ exerted a potent inhibition on GnRH neurons, with or without excitatory inputs. We confirmed that the inhibition was mediated by ORL1 via G&lt;sub&gt;i/o&lt;/sub&gt;-protein coupling. The inhibition, occurring independently of levels of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate, was sensitive to inwardly rectifying potassium channels. The only specific blocker of G&lt;sub&gt;i/o&lt;/sub&gt;-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels, tertiapin-Q (TPNQ), was ineffective in the inhibition of OFQ. Two GIRK activators, one sharing the binding site of TPNQ and one active only on GIRK1-containing GIRK channels, failed to trigger an inhibition. In contrast, protein kinase C phosphorylation activation, known to inhibit GIRK2-mediated currents, prevented the OFQ inhibition. These results indicate a specific combination of GIRK subunits, GIRK2/3 in GnRH neurons. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt;, double-labeled OFQ/POMC fibers were found in the vicinity of GnRH neurons, and OFQ fibers apposed GnRH neurons. Together, this study brings to light a potent neuromodulator of GnRH neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: June 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 56&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Megan Crow, Jesse Gillis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent technical advances have enabled transcriptomics experiments at an unprecedented scale, and single-cell profiles from neural tissue are accumulating rapidly. There has been considerable effort to use these profiles to understand cell diversity, primarily through unsupervised clustering and differential expression analysis. However, current practices to validate these findings vary. In this review, we describe recent efforts to evaluate clusters from single-cell RNA-sequencing data, and provide a framework for considering current evidence and practices in terms of their capacity to establish principles of cell biology. Single-cell RNA-sequencing has already transformed neuroscience. By facilitating detailed comparative and genetic perturbation analyses, it may provide the tools to uncover fundamental mechanisms of neural diversity throughout the tree of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02874</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper describes duneuro, a software toolbox for forward modeling in
neuroscience. Its purpose is to provide extendible and easy-to-use interfaces
and enable a closer integration into existing analysis pipelines. It provides
implementations of fitted and unfitted finite element methods and makes use of
the Dune framework. The forward problems consist of the electroencephalography
(EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) forward problems. For the incorporation
into existing analysis pipelines, Python and Matlab interfaces are provided.
The practical use is demonstrated on a source analysis example of evoked
potentials.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Visual novelty, curiosity, and intrinsic reward in machine learning and the brain. (arXiv:1901.02478v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A strong preference for novelty emerges in infancy and is prevalent across
the animal kingdom. When incorporated into reinforcement-based machine learning
algorithms, visual novelty can act as an intrinsic reward signal that vastly
increases the efficiency of exploration and expedites learning, particularly in
situations where external rewards are difficult to obtain. Here we review
parallels between recent developments in novelty-driven machine learning
algorithms and our understanding of how visual novelty is computed and signaled
in the primate brain. We propose that in the visual system, novelty
representations are not configured with the principal goal of detecting novel
objects, but rather with the broader goal of flexibly generalizing novelty
information across different states in the service of driving novelty-based
learning.

&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; is classified as a serious threat pathogen and is a priority that guides the discovery and development of new antibiotics. Despite growing knowledge of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; metabolic capabilities, our understanding of its systems-level responses to different media types remains incomplete. Here, we develop a manually reconstructed genome-scale model (GEM-PRO) of metabolism with 3D protein structures for &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; USA300 str. JE2 containing 854 genes, 1,440 reactions, 1,327 metabolites and 673 3-dimensional protein structures. Computations were in 85% agreement with gene essentiality data from random barcode transposon site sequencing (RB-TnSeq) and 68% agreement with experimental physiological data. Comparisons of computational predictions with experimental observations highlight: 1) cases of non-essential biomass precursors; 2) metabolic genes subject to transcriptional regulation involved in Staphyloxanthin biosynthesis; 3) the essentiality of purine and amino acid biosynthesis in synthetic physiological media; and 4) a switch to aerobic fermentation upon exposure to extracellular glucose elucidated as a result of integrating time-course of quantitative exo-metabolomics data. An up-to-date GEM-PRO thus serves as a knowledge-based platform to elucidate &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus’&lt;/i&gt; metabolic response to its environment.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2DiKjhA9eEg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Advancing age is the dominant risk factor for most of the major killer diseases in developed countries. Hence, ameliorating the effects of ageing may prevent multiple diseases simultaneously. Drugs licensed for human use against specific diseases have proved to be effective in extending lifespan and healthspan in animal models, suggesting that there is scope for drug repurposing in humans. New bioinformatic methods to identify and prioritise potential anti-ageing compounds for humans are therefore of interest. In this study, we first used drug-protein interaction information, to rank 1,147 drugs by their likelihood of targeting ageing-related gene products in humans. Among 19 statistically significant drugs, 6 have already been shown to have pro-longevity properties in animal models (p &amp;lt; 0.001). Using the targets of each drug, we established their association with ageing at multiple levels of biological action including pathways, functions and protein interactions. Finally, combining all the data, we calculated a ranked list of drugs that identified tanespimycin, an inhibitor of HSP-90, as the top-ranked novel anti-ageing candidate. We experimentally validated the pro-longevity effect of tanespimycin through its HSP-90 target in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Yjtn-ZF7ak8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Electrophysiological Correlates of Absolute Pitch in a Passive Auditory Oddball Paradigm: a Direct Replication Attempt</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Humans with absolute pitch (AP) are able to effortlessly name the pitch class of a sound without an external reference. The association of labels with pitches cannot be entirely suppressed even if it interferes with task demands. This suggests a high level of automaticity of pitch labeling in AP. The automatic nature of AP was further investigated in a study by Rogenmoser et al. (2015). Using a passive auditory oddball paradigm in combination with electroencephalography, they observed electrophysiological differences between musicians with and without AP in response to piano tones. Specifically, the AP musicians showed a smaller P3a, an event-related potential (ERP) component presumably reflecting early attentional processes. In contrast, they did not find group differences in the mismatch negativity (MMN), an ERP component associated with auditory memory processes. They concluded that early cognitive processes are facilitated in AP during passive listening and are more important for AP than the preceding sensory processes. In our direct replication study on a larger sample of musicians with (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 54, 27 females, 27 males) and without (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 50, 24 females, 26 males) AP, we successfully replicated the non-significant effects of AP on the MMN. However, we could not replicate the significant effects for the P3a. Additional Bayes factor analyses revealed moderate to strong evidence (Bayes factor &amp;gt; 3) for the null hypothesis for both MMN and P3a. Therefore, the results of this replication study do not support the postulated importance of cognitive facilitation in AP during passive tone listening.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Top-down and Bottom-up Regulated Auditory Phantom Perception</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/2/364?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/2/364?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Auditory phantom percepts such as tinnitus are associated with auditory deafferentation. The idea is that auditory deafferentation limits the amount of information the brain can acquire to make sense of the world. Because of this, auditory deafferentation increases the uncertainty of the auditory environment. To minimize uncertainty, the deafferented brain will attempt to obtain or fill in the missing information. A proposed multiphase compensation model suggests two distinct types of bottom-up related tinnitus: an auditory cortex related tinnitus and a parahippocampal cortex related tinnitus. The weakness of this model is that it cannot explain why some people without hearing loss develop tinnitus, whereas conversely others with hearing loss do not develop tinnitus. In this human study, we provide evidence for a top-down type of tinnitus associated with a deficient noise-cancelling mechanism. A total of 72 participants (age: 40.96 ± 7.67 years; males: 48; females: 24) were recruited for this study. We demonstrate that top-down related tinnitus is related to a change in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex that corresponds to increased activity in the auditory cortex. This is in accordance with the idea that tinnitus can have different generators as proposed in a recent model that suggests that different compensation mechanisms at a cortical level can be linked to phantom percepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Chronic tinnitus affects 15% of the population worldwide. The term &quot;tinnitus&quot; however represents a highly heterogeneous condition, as evidenced by the fact that there are no effective treatments or even an adequate understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms. Consistent with this idea, our research shows that tinnitus indeed has different subtypes related to hearing loss. In a human study tightly controlled for hearing loss, we establish a tinnitus subtype associated with a deficient top-down noise-cancelling mechanism, which distinguishes it from bottom-up subtypes. We demonstrate that top-down related tinnitus relates to a change in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex that corresponds to increased activity in the auditory cortex, whereas bottom-up tinnitus instead relates to changes in the parahippocampal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Directing Voluntary Temporal Attention Increases Fixational Stability</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/2/353?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/2/353?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Our visual input is constantly changing, but not all moments are equally relevant. Visual temporal attention, the prioritization of visual information at specific points in time, increases perceptual sensitivity at behaviorally relevant times. The dynamic processes underlying this increase are unclear. During fixation, humans make small eye movements called microsaccades, and inhibiting microsaccades improves perception of brief stimuli. Here, we investigated whether temporal attention changes the pattern of microsaccades in anticipation of brief stimuli. Human observers (female and male) judged stimuli presented within a short sequence. Observers were given either an informative precue to attend to one of the stimuli, which was likely to be probed, or an uninformative (neutral) precue. We found strong microsaccadic inhibition before the stimulus sequence, likely due to its predictable onset. Critically, this anticipatory inhibition was stronger when the first target in the sequence (T1) was precued (task-relevant) than when the precue was uninformative. Moreover, the timing of the last microsaccade before T1 and the first microsaccade after T1 shifted such that both occurred earlier when T1 was precued than when the precue was uninformative. Finally, the timing of the nearest pre- and post-T1 microsaccades affected task performance. Directing voluntary temporal attention therefore affects microsaccades, helping to stabilize fixation at the most relevant moments over and above the effect of predictability. Just as saccading to a relevant stimulus can be an overt correlate of the allocation of spatial attention, precisely timed gaze stabilization can be an overt correlate of the allocation of temporal attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We pay attention at moments in time when a relevant event is likely to occur. Such temporal attention improves our visual perception, but how it does so is not well understood. Here, we discovered a new behavioral correlate of voluntary, or goal-directed, temporal attention. We found that the pattern of small fixational eye movements called microsaccades changes around behaviorally relevant moments in a way that stabilizes the position of the eyes. Microsaccades during a brief visual stimulus can impair perception of that stimulus. Therefore, such fixation stabilization may contribute to the improvement of visual perception at attended times. This link suggests that, in addition to cortical areas, subcortical areas mediating eye movements may be recruited with temporal attention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Neural-network simulations of memory consolidation and reconsolidation. (arXiv:1901.02270v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the mammalian brain newly acquired memories depend on the hippocampus for
maintenance and recall, but over time these functions are taken over by the
neocortex through a process called systems consolidation. However, reactivation
of a consolidated memory can induce a brief period of temporary
hippocampus-dependence, followed by return to hippocampus-independence. Here we
present a computational model that uses simulation of recently described
mechanisms of synaptic plasticity to account for findings from the systems
consolidation/reconsolidation literature and to make predictions for future
research.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Extracting impedance changes from a frequency multiplexed signal during neural activity in sciatic nerve of rat: preliminary study in-vitro. (arXiv:1901.02068v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02068</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02068</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Establish suitable frequency spacing and demodulation steps to use
when extracting impedance changes from frequency division multiplexed (FDM)
carrier signals in peripheral nerve. Approach: Experiments were performed
in-vitro on cadavers immediately following euthanasia. Neural activity was
evoked via stimulation of nerves in the hind paw, while carrier signals were
injected, and recordings obtained, with a dual ring nerve cuff implanted on the
sciatic nerve. Frequency analysis of recorded compound action potentials (CAPs)
and extracted impedance changes, with the latter obtained using established
demodulation methods, were used to determine suitable frequency spacing of
carrier signals, and bandpass filter (BPF) bandwidth and order, for a frequency
multiplexed signal. Main results: CAPs and impedance changes were dominant in
the frequency band 200 to 500 Hz and 100 to 200 Hz, respectively. A Tukey
window was introduced to remove ringing from Gibbs phenomena. A +/- 750 Hz BPF
bandwidth was selected to encompass 99.99 % of the frequency power of the
impedance change. Modelling predicted a minimum BPF order of 16 for 2 kHz
spacing, and 10 for 4 kHz spacing, were required to avoid ringing from the
neighbouring carrier signal, while FDM experiments verified BPF orders of 12
and 8, respectively, were required. With a notch filter centred on the
neighbouring signal, a BPF order of at least 6 or 4 was required for 2 and 4
kHz, respectively. Significance: The results establish drive frequency spacing
and demodulation settings for use in FDM electrical impedance tomography (EIT)
experiments, as well as a framework for their selection, and, for the first
time, demonstrates the viability of FDM-EIT of neural activity on peripheral
nerve, which will be a central aspect of future real-time neural-EIT systems
and EIT-based neural prosthetics interfaces.

	<title>eNeuro current issue: A Computational Model of Dual Competition between the Basal Ganglia and the Cortex</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;We propose a model that includes interactions between the cortex, the basal ganglia (BG), and the thalamus based on a dual competition. We hypothesize that the striatum, the subthalamic nucleus (STN), the internal globus pallidus (GPi), the thalamus, and the cortex are involved in closed feedback loops through the hyperdirect and direct pathways. These loops support a competition process that results in the ability of BG to make a cognitive decision followed by a motor one. Considering lateral cortical interactions, another competition takes place inside the cortex allowing the latter to make a cognitive and a motor decision. We show how this dual competition endows the model with two regimes. One is driven by reinforcement learning and the other by Hebbian learning. The final decision is made according to a combination of these two mechanisms with a gradual transfer from the former to the latter. We confirmed these theoretical results on primates (&lt;i&gt;Macaca mulatta&lt;/i&gt;) using a novel paradigm predicted by the model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: The systemDrive: a Multisite, Multiregion Microdrive with Independent Drive Axis Angling for Chronic Multimodal Systems Neuroscience Recordings in Freely Behaving Animals</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/6/ENEURO.0261-18.2018?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A multielectrode system that can address widely separated targets at multiple sites across multiple brain regions with independent implant angling is needed to investigate neural function and signaling in systems and circuits of small animals. Here, we present the systemDrive, a novel multisite, multiregion microdrive that is capable of moving microwire electrode bundles into targets along independent and nonparallel drive trajectories. Our design decouples the stereotaxic surgical placement of individual guide cannulas for each trajectory from the placement of a flexible drive structure. This separation enables placement of many microwire multitrodes along widely spaced and independent drive axes with user-set electrode trajectories and depths from a single microdrive body, and achieves stereotaxic precision with each. The system leverages tight tube–cannula tolerances and geometric constraints on flexible drive axes to ensure concentric alignment of electrode bundles within guide cannulas. Additionally, the headmount and microdrive both have an open-center design to allow for the placement of additional sensing modalities. This design is the first, in the context of small rodent chronic research, to provide the capability to finely position microwires through multiple widely distributed cell groups, each with stereotaxic precision, along arbitrary and nonparallel trajectories that are not restricted to emanate from a single source. We demonstrate the use of the systemDrive in male Long–Evans rats to observe simultaneous single-unit and multiunit activity from multiple widely separated sleep–wake regulatory brainstem cell groups, along with cortical and hippocampal activity, during free behavior over multiple many-day continuous recording periods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we analyze the cognitive improvements that can be achieved
through hacking the brain and using neuroplasticity. Not all cases of
neuroplasticity are useful, but exposure to gaming, for example, has proven
conducive for learning. We will discuss cortical magnification and receptive
field sizes, as well as topographic brain maps in the context of
neuroplasticity. We finally propose more studies to be performed to improve
musical talent and musical abilities.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Adaptive Internal Models: Explaining the Oculomotor System and the Cerebellum. (arXiv:1901.01309v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01309</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We propose a new model of the oculomotor system, particularly the
vestibulo-ocular reflex, the optokinetic reflex, gaze fixation, and smooth
pursuit. Our key insight is to exploit recent developments on adaptive internal
models. The outcome is a simple model that includes the interactions between
the brainstem and the cerebellum and that recovers behaviors from more than 15
oculomotor experiments. In addition, we put forward a thesis that the
cerebellum embodies internal models of all persistent, exogenous reference and
disturbance signals acting on the body and observable through the error signals
it receives. Our proposed architecture is compared to feedback error learning,
a variant of the computed torque method in robotics and currently the best
developed computational architecture for the cerebellum.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Calcium phosphate precipitation inhibits mitochondrial energy metabolism</title>

Early studies have shown that moderate levels of calcium overload can cause lower oxidative phosphorylation rates. However, the mechanistic interpretations of these findings were inadequate. And while the effect of excessive calcium overload on mitochondrial function is well appreciated, there has been little to no reports on the consequences of low to moderate calcium overload. To resolve this inadequacy, mitochondrial function from guinea pig hearts was quantified using several well-established methods including high-resolution respirometry and spectrofluorimetry and analyzed using mathematical modeling. We measured key mitochondrial variables such as respiration, mitochondrial membrane potential, buffer calcium, and substrate effects for a range of mitochondrial calcium loads from near zero to levels approaching mitochondrial permeability transition. In addition, we developed a computer model closely mimicking the experimental conditions and used this model to design experiments capable of eliminating many hypotheses generated from the data analysis. We subsequently performed those experiments and determined why mitochondrial ADP-stimulated respiration is significantly lowered during calcium overload. We found that when calcium phosphate levels, not matrix free calcium, reached sufficient levels, complex I activity is inhibited, and the rate of ATP synthesis is reduced. Our findings suggest that calcium phosphate granules form physical barriers that isolate complex I from NADH, disrupt complex I activity, or destabilize cristae and inhibit NADH-dependent respiration.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WBuKxc7t56w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The lack of a deep understanding of how proteins interact remains an important roadblock in advancing efforts to identify binding partners and uncover the corresponding regulatory mechanisms of the functions they mediate. Understanding protein-protein interactions is also essential for designing specific chemical modifications to develop new reagents and therapeutics. We explored the hypothesis of whether protein interaction sites serve as generic biding sites for non-cognate protein ligands, just as it has been observed for small-molecule-binding sites in the past. Using extensive computational docking experiments on a test set of 241 protein complexes, we found that indeed there is a strong preference for non-cognate ligands to bind to the cognate binding site of a receptor. This observation appears to be robust to variations in docking programs, types of non-cognate protein probes, sizes of binding patches, relative sizes of binding patches and full-length proteins, and the exploration of obligate and non-obligate complexes. The accuracy of the docking scoring function appears to play a role in defining the correct site. The frequency of interaction of unrelated probes recognizing the binding interface was utilized in a simple prediction algorithm that showed accuracy competitive with other state of the art methods.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xdzyIfrYTuk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Cancer development is driven by series of events involving mutations, which may become fixed in a tumor via genetic drift and selection. This process usually includes a limited number of driver (advantageous) mutations and a greater number of passenger (neutral or mildly deleterious) mutations. We focus on a real-world leukemia model evolving on the background of a germline mutation. Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) evolves to secondary myelodysplastic syndrome (sMDS) and/or secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) in 30–40%. The majority of SCN cases are due to a germline &lt;i&gt;ELANE&lt;/i&gt; mutation. Acquired mutations in &lt;i&gt;CSF3R&lt;/i&gt; occur in &amp;gt;70% sMDS/sAML associated with SCN. Hypotheses underlying our model are: an &lt;i&gt;ELANE&lt;/i&gt; mutation causes SCN; &lt;i&gt;CSF3R&lt;/i&gt; mutations occur spontaneously at a low rate; in fetal life, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells expands quickly, resulting in a high probability of several tens to several hundreds of cells with &lt;i&gt;CSF3R&lt;/i&gt; truncation mutations; therapeutic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) administration early in life exerts a strong selective pressure, providing mutants with a growth advantage. Applying population genetics theory, we propose a novel two-phase model of disease development from SCN to sMDS. In Phase 1, hematopoietic tissues expand and produce tens to hundreds of stem cells with the &lt;i&gt;CSF3R&lt;/i&gt; truncation mutation. Phase 2 occurs postnatally through adult stages with bone marrow production of granulocyte precursors and positive selection of mutants due to chronic G-CSF therapy to reverse the severe neutropenia. We predict the existence of the pool of cells with the mutated truncated receptor &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; G-CSF treatment begins. The model does not require increase in mutation rate under G-CSF treatment and agrees with age distribution of sMDS onset and clinical sequencing data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HE-IeA48wrY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Classical decision theory postulates that choices proceed from subjective values assigned to the probable outcomes of alternative actions. Some authors have argued that opposite causality should also be envisaged, with choices influencing subsequent values expressed in desirability ratings. The idea is that agents may increase their ratings of items that they have chosen in the first place, which has been typically explained by the need to reduce cognitive dissonance. However, evidence in favor of this reverse causality has been the topic of intense debates that have not reached consensus so far. Here, we take a novel approach using Bayesian techniques to compare models in which choices arise from stable (but noisy) underlying values (one-way causality) versus models in which values are in turn influenced by choices (two-way causality). Moreover, we examined whether in addition to choices, other components of previous actions, such as the effort invested and the eventual action outcome (success or failure), could also impact subsequent values. Finally, we assessed whether the putative changes in values were only expressed in explicit ratings, or whether they would also affect other value-related behaviors such as subsequent choices. Behavioral data were obtained from healthy participants in a rating-choice-rating-choice-rating paradigm, where the choice task involves deciding whether or not to exert a given physical effort to obtain a particular food item. Bayesian selection favored two-way causality models, where changes in value due to previous actions affected subsequent ratings, choices and action outcomes. Altogether, these findings may help explain how values and actions drift when several decisions are made successively, hence highlighting some shortcomings of classical decision theory.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UYQdWjzKcBg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Large normal alleles of ATXN2 decrease age‐at‐onset in TTR‐FAP Val30Met patients</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25409?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transthyretin (TTR) related familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) is an autosomal dominant neurological disease, caused most frequently by a Val30Met (now classified as Val50Met) substitution in &lt;i&gt;TTR&lt;/i&gt;. Age‐at‐onset (AO) ranges 19‐82 years and variability exists mostly between generations. Unstable oligonucleotide repeats in various genes are the mechanism behind several neurological diseases, found also to act as modifiers for other disorders. Our aim was to investigate whether large normal repeat alleles of ten genes, had a possible modifier effect in AO in Portuguese TTR‐FAP Val30Met families.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We analysed 329 Portuguese patients, from 123 families. Repeat length (at &lt;i&gt;ATXN1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ATXN2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ATXN3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ATXN7&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TBP, ATN1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;HTT&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;JPH3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;AR&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;DMPK&lt;/i&gt;) was assessed by single and multiplex PCR, using fluorescently‐labelled primers, followed by capillary electrophoresis. We used a family‐centred approach and generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to account for AO correlation between family members.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;i&gt;ATXN2&lt;/i&gt;, the presence of at least one allele longer than 22 CAGs was significantly associated with an earlier onset in TTR‐FAP Val30Met, decreasing mean AO by 6 years (95% CI: [‐8.81; ‐2.19], p=0.001). No association was found for the remaining repeat &lt;i&gt;loci&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Length of normal repeats at &lt;i&gt;ATXN2&lt;/i&gt; may modify AO in TTR‐FAP Val30Met and may function as a risk factor. This can be due to &lt;i&gt;ATXN2&lt;/i&gt; role in RNA metabolism and as a modulator of various cellular processes, including mitochondrial stress. This may have relevant implications for prognosis and the follow‐up of presymptomatic carriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agonism of protease‐activated receptor (PAR) 1 by activated protein C (APC) provides neuro‐ and vasculoprotection in experimental neuroinjury models. The pleiotropic PAR1 agonist, 3K3A‐APC, reduces neurological injury and promotes vascular integrity; 3K3A‐APC proved safe in human volunteers. We performed a randomized, controlled, blinded trial to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of 3K3A‐APC in ischemic stroke patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NeuroNEXT trial, RHAPSODY, used a novel continual reassessment method to determine the MTD using tiers of 120, 240, 360, and 540 μg/kg of 3K3A‐APC. After intravenous tissue plasminogen activator, intra‐arterial mechanical thrombectomy, or both, patients were randomized to 1 of the 4 doses or placebo. Vasculoprotection was assessed as microbleed and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) rates.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between January 2015 and July 2017, we treated 110 patients. Demographics resembled a typical stroke population. The MTD was the highest‐dose 3K3A‐APC tested, 540 μg/kg, with an estimated toxicity rate of 7%. There was no difference in prespecified ICH rates. In exploratory analyses, 3K3A‐APC reduced ICH rates compared to placebo from 86.5% to 67.4% in the combined treatment arms (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.046) and total hemorrhage volume from an average of 2.1 ± 5.8 ml in placebo to 0.8 ± 2.1 ml in the combined treatment arms (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.066).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RHAPSODY is the first trial of a neuroprotectant for acute ischemic stroke in a trial design allowing thrombectomy, thrombolysis, or both. The MTD was 540 μg/kg for the PAR1 active cytoprotectant, 3K3A‐APC. A trend toward lower hemorrhage rate in an exploratory analysis requires confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuropathological studies have demonstrated that cerebrovascular disease and Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology frequently co‐occur in older adults. The extent to which cerebrovascular disease influences the progression of AD pathology remains unclear. Leveraging newly available positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, we examined whether a well‐validated measure of systemic vascular risk and &lt;b&gt;β&lt;/b&gt;‐amyloid (A&lt;b&gt;β&lt;/b&gt;) burden have an interactive association with regional tau burden.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vascular risk was quantified at baseline in 152 clinically normal older adults (mean age = 73.5 ± 6.1 years) with the office‐based Framingham Heart Study cardiovascular disease risk algorithm (FHS‐CVD). We acquired A&lt;b&gt;β&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C‐Pittsburgh compound B) and tau (&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F‐flortaucipir) PET imaging on the same participants. A&lt;b&gt;β&lt;/b&gt; PET was performed at baseline; tau PET was acquired on average 2.98 ± 1.1 years later. Tau was measured in the entorhinal cortex (EC), an early site of tau deposition, and in the inferior temporal cortex (ITC), an early site of neocortical tau accumulation associated with AD. Linear regression models examined FHS‐CVD and A&lt;b&gt;β&lt;/b&gt; as interactive predictors of tau deposition, adjusting for age, sex, &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; ε4 status, and the time interval between baseline and the tau PET scan.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observed a significant interaction between FHS‐CVD and A&lt;b&gt;β&lt;/b&gt; burden on subsequently measured ITC tau (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), whereby combined higher FHS‐CVD and elevated A&lt;b&gt;β&lt;/b&gt; burden was associated with increased tau. The interaction was not significant for EC tau (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.16).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elevated vascular risk may influence tau burden when coupled with high A&lt;b&gt;β&lt;/b&gt; burden. These results suggest a potential link between vascular risk and tau pathology in preclinical AD. Ann Neurol 2019; 1–8&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01024</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is a disorder characterised by spontaneous, recurrent seizures. Both
local and network abnormalities have been associated with epilepsy, and the
exact processes generating seizures are thought to be heterogeneous and
patient-specific. Due to the heterogeneity, treatments such as surgery and
medication are not always effective in achieving full seizure control and
choosing the best treatment for the individual patient can be challenging.
Predictive models constrained by the patient's own data therefore offer the
potential to assist in clinical decision making. In this chapter, we describe
how personalised patient-derived networks from structural or functional
connectivity can be incorporated into predictive models. We focus specifically
on dynamical systems models which are composed of differential equations
capable of simulating brain activity over time. Here we review recent studies
which have used these models, constrained by patient data, to make personalised
patient-specific predictions about seizure features (such as propagation
patterns) or treatment outcomes (such as the success of surgical resection).
Finally, we suggest future research directions for patient-specific network
models in epilepsy, including their application to integrate information from
multiple modalities, to predict long-term disease evolution, and to account for
within-subject variability for treatment.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A Unified Theory of Early Visual Representations from Retina to Cortex through Anatomically Constrained Deep CNNs. (arXiv:1901.00945v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00945</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00945</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The visual system is hierarchically organized to process visual information
in successive stages. Neural representations vary drastically across the first
stages of visual processing: at the output of the retina, ganglion cell
receptive fields (RFs) exhibit a clear antagonistic center-surround structure,
whereas in the primary visual cortex, typical RFs are sharply tuned to a
precise orientation. There is currently no unified theory explaining these
differences in representations across layers. Here, using a deep convolutional
neural network trained on image recognition as a model of the visual system, we
show that such differences in representation can emerge as a direct consequence
of different neural resource constraints on the retinal and cortical networks,
and we find a single model from which both geometries spontaneously emerge at
the appropriate stages of visual processing. The key constraint is a reduced
number of neurons at the retinal output, consistent with the anatomy of the
optic nerve as a stringent bottleneck. Second, we find that, for simple
cortical networks, visual representations at the retinal output emerge as
nonlinear and lossy feature detectors, whereas they emerge as linear and
faithful encoders of the visual scene for more complex cortices. This result
predicts that the retinas of small vertebrates should perform sophisticated
nonlinear computations, extracting features directly relevant to behavior,
whereas retinas of large animals such as primates should mostly encode the
visual scene linearly and respond to a much broader range of stimuli. These
predictions could reconcile the two seemingly incompatible views of the retina
as either performing feature extraction or efficient coding of natural scenes,
by suggesting that all vertebrates lie on a spectrum between these two
objectives, depending on the degree of neural resources allocated to their
visual system.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Hemispheric Module-Specific Influence of the X Chromosome on White Matter Connectivity: Evidence from Girls with Turner Syndrome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy335</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy335/5280093?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Turner syndrome (TS) is caused by the congenital absence of all or part of one of the X chromosomes in females, offering a valuable human “knockout model” to study the functioning patterns of the X chromosome in the human brain. Little is known about whether and how the loss of the X chromosome influences the brain structural wiring patterns in human. We acquired a multimodal MRI dataset and cognitive assessments from 22 girls with TS and 21 age-matched control girls to address these questions. Hemispheric white matter (WM) networks and modules were derived using refined diffusion MRI tractography. Statistical comparisons revealed a reduced topological efficiency of both hemispheric networks and bilateral parietal modules in TS girls. Specifically, the efficiency of right parietal module significantly mediated the effect of the X chromosome on working memory performance, indicating that X chromosome loss impairs working memory performance by disrupting this module. Additionally, TS girls showed structural and functional connectivity decoupling across specific within- and between-modular connections, predominantly in the right hemisphere. These findings provide novel insights into the functional pathways in the brain that are regulated by the X chromosome and highlight a module-specific genetic contribution to WM connectivity in the human brain.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: I See Your Effort: Force-Related BOLD Effects in an Extended Action Execution–Observation Network Involving the Cerebellum</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Action observation (AO) is crucial for motor planning, imitation learning, and social interaction, but it is not clear whether and how an action execution–observation network (AEON) processes the effort of others engaged in performing actions. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we used a “squeeze ball” task involving different grip forces to investigate whether AEON activation showed similar patterns when executing the task or observing others performing it. Both in action execution, AE (subjects performed the visuomotor task) and action observation, AO (subjects watched a video of the task being performed by someone else), the fMRI signal was detected in cerebral and cerebellar regions. These responses showed various relationships with force mapping onto specific areas of the sensorimotor and cognitive systems. Conjunction analysis of AE and AO was repeated for the “0th” order and linear and nonlinear responses, and revealed multiple AEON nodes remapping the detection of actions, and also effort, of another person onto the observer’s own cerebrocerebellar system. This result implies that the AEON exploits the cerebellum, which is known to process sensorimotor predictions and simulations, performing an internal assessment of forces and integrating information into high-level schemes, providing a crucial substrate for action imitation.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Enhanced Population Coding for Rewarded Choices in the Medial Frontal Cortex of the Mouse</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy292</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Instrumental behavior is characterized by the selection of actions based on the degree to which they lead to a desired outcome. However, we lack a detailed understanding of how rewarded actions are reinforced and preferentially implemented. In rodents, the medial frontal cortex is hypothesized to play an important role in this process, based in part on its capacity to encode chosen actions and their outcomes. We therefore asked how neural representations of choice and outcome might interact to facilitate instrumental behavior. To investigate this question, we imaged neural ensemble activity in layer 2/3 of the secondary motor region (M2) while mice engaged in a two-choice auditory discrimination task with probabilistic outcomes. Correct choices could result in one of three reward amounts (single, double or omitted reward), which allowed us to measure neural and behavioral effects of reward magnitude, as well as its categorical presence or absence. Single-unit and population decoding analyses revealed a consistent influence of outcome on choice signals in M2. Specifically, rewarded choices were more robustly encoded relative to unrewarded choices, with little dependence on the exact magnitude of reinforcement. Our results provide insight into the integration of past choices and outcomes in the rodent brain during instrumental behavior.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>The mesolimbic hypothesis has been a central dogma of schizophrenia for decades, positing that aberrant functioning of midbrain dopamine projections to limbic regions causes psychotic symptoms. Recently, however, advances in neuroimaging techniques have led to the unanticipated finding that dopaminergic dysfunction in schizophrenia is greatest within nigrostriatal pathways, implicating the dorsal striatum in the pathophysiology and calling into question the mesolimbic theory. At the same time our knowledge of striatal anatomy and function has progressed, suggesting new mechanisms via which striatal dysfunction may contribute to the symptoms of schizophrenia.</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Activity patterns in the neuropil of striatal cholinergic interneurons in freely moving mice represent their collective spiking dynamics</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Cholinergic interneurons (CINs) are believed to form synchronous cell assemblies that modulate the striatal microcircuitry and possibly orchestrate local dopamine release. We expressed GCaMP6s, a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECIs), selectively in CINs, and used microendoscopes to visualize the putative CIN assemblies in the dorsal striatum of freely moving mice. The GECI fluorescence signal from the dorsal striatum was composed of signals from individual CIN somata that were engulfed by a widespread fluorescent neuropil. Bouts of synchronous activation of the cholinergic neuropil revealed patterns of activity that preceded the signal from individual somata. To investigate the nature of the neuropil signal and why it precedes the somatic signal, we target-patched GECI-expressing CINs in acute striatal slices in conjunction with multiphoton imaging or wide-field imaging that emulates the microendoscopes’ specifications. The ability to detect fluorescent transients associated with individual action potential was constrained by the long decay constant of GECIs (relative to common inorganic dyes) to slowly firing (&amp;lt; 2 spikes/s) CINs. The microendoscopes’ resolving power and sampling rate further diminished this ability. Additionally, we found that only back-propagating action potentials but not synchronous optogenetic activation of thalamic inputs elicited observable calcium transients in CIN dendrites. Our data suggest that only bursts of CIN activity (but not their tonic firing) are visible using endoscopic imaging, and that the neuropil patterns are a physiological measure of the collective recurrent CIN network spiking activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Cholinergic interneurons (CINs) are key modulators of the striatal microcircuitry that are necessary for assigning action value and behavioral flexibility. We present a first endoscopic imaging study of multiple molecularly identified CINs in freely moving mice. We reveal the presence of activity patterns in the CIN neuropil. We then use &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiological and imaging techniques to show that the neuropil signal is the integrated fluorescence arising from the axo-dendritic arbors of CINs dispersed throughout the striatum. We conclude that the neuropil signal acts as a mean-field readout of the striatal CIN network activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Neuron-Specific Gene 2 (NSG2) encodes an AMPA receptor interacting protein that modulates excitatory neurotransmission</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Neurons have evolved a number of unique protein-coding genes that regulate trafficking of protein complexes within small organelles throughout dendrites axons. Neuron specific gene 2 (NSG2) encodes for one of the most abundant proteins in the nervous system during perinatal development. NSG2 belongs to a family of small neuronal endosomal proteins but its function has remained uncharacterized to date. Here we show that NSG2 is found in discrete punctae restricted to the somatodendritic arbors of developing mouse and human neurons, and a significant proportion of NSG2 punctae colocalize with postsynaptic HOMER1 and surface-expressed AMPARs at excitatory synapses. Immunoprecipitation revealed that NSG2 physically interacts with both the GluA1 and GluA2 AMPAR subunits in mouse brain. Knockout of NSG2 in mouse hippocampal neurons selectively impaired the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) and caused alterations in PSD95 expression at postsynaptic densities. In contrast, NSG2 overexpression caused a significant increase in the amplitude of mEPSCs as well as GluA2 surface expression. Thus, NSG2 functions as an AMPAR-binding protein that is required for normal synapse formation and/or maintenance, and has unique functions compared with other NSG family members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Due to their morphological and functional complexity, neurons have evolved specialized proteins like those of the neuron-specific gene family (NSG1-3). Important developmental and synaptic functions have been attributed to NSG1/NEEP21 and NSG3/Calcyon while the function of NSG2/HMP19/NVTA2 has remained uncharacterized. Here we show that NSG2 localizes to a large proportion of excitatory synapses, interacts with AMPARs, and modulates their surface expression during synaptogenesis. Alterations of NSG2 expression affected both the amplitude and frequency of excitatory neurotransmission that is not compensated for by other NSG family members. Thus, NSG2 appears critical for excitatory synapse formation and/or maintenance and forced expression can promote increased synaptic efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: NMNAT proteins that limit Wallerian degeneration also regulate critical period plasticity in the visual cortex</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Many brain regions go through critical periods of development during which plasticity is enhanced. These critical periods are associated with extensive growth and retraction of thalamocortical and intracortical axons. Here, we investigated whether a signaling pathway that is central in Wallerian axon degeneration also regulates critical period plasticity in the primary visual cortex. Wallerian degeneration is characterized by rapid disintegration of axons once they are separated from the cell body. This degenerative process is initiated by reduced presence of cytoplasmic nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferases (NMNATs) and is strongly delayed in mice overexpressing cytoplasmic NMNAT proteins, such as Wld&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt; mutant mice producing a UBE4b-NMNAT1 fusion protein or NMNAT3 transgenic mice. Here we provide evidence that in Wld&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt; mice and NMNAT3-transgenic mice, ocular dominance plasticity in the developing visual cortex is reduced. This deficit is only observed during the second half of the critical period. Additionally, we detect an early increase of visual acuity in the primary visual cortex of Wld&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt; mice. We do not find evidence for Wallerian degeneration occurring during ocular dominance plasticity. Our findings suggest that NMNATs do not only regulate Wallerian degeneration during pathological conditions, but also control cellular events that mediate critical period plasticity during the physiological development of the cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Different forms of axon degeneration occur during development and neurodegenerative processes. A good understanding of the molecular and cellular events that regulate these forms of axon degeneration is essential to selectively modulate them for therapeutic purposes. This study shows that genes thought to be selectively involved in pathological axon degeneration are also involved in developmental plasticity, implying that these events are molecularly less separable than previously assumed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with impaired conditioned fear extinction learning, a ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)-dependent process. PTSD is also associated with dysregulation of vmPFC, circadian, and glucocorticoid hormone function. Rats have rhythmic clock gene expression in the vmPFC that requires appropriate diurnal circulatory patterns of corticosterone (CORT), suggesting the presence of CORT-entrained intrinsic circadian clock function within the PFC. We examined the role of vmPFC clock gene expression and its interaction with CORT profiles in regulation of auditory conditioned fear extinction learning. Extinction learning and recall were examined in male rats trained and tested either in the night (active phase) or in the day (inactive phase). Using a viral vector strategy, &lt;i&gt;Per1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Per2&lt;/i&gt; clock gene expression were selectively knocked down within the vmPFC. Circulating CORT profiles were manipulated via adrenalectomy (ADX) ± diurnal and acute CORT replacement. Rats trained and tested during the night exhibited superior conditioned fear extinction recall that was absent in rats that had knock-down of vmPFC clock gene expression. Similarly, the superior nighttime extinction recall was absent in ADX rats, but restored in ADX rats given a combination of a diurnal pattern of CORT and acute elevation of CORT during the postextinction training consolidation period. Thus, conditioned fear extinction learning is regulated in a diurnal fashion that requires normal vmPFC clock gene expression and a combination of circadian and training-associated CORT. Strategic manipulation of these factors may enhance the therapeutic outcome of conditioned fear extinction related treatments in the clinical setting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Decoding Hand Kinematics from Local Field Potentials Using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network. (arXiv:1901.00708v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Local field potential (LFP) has gained increasing interest as an alternative
input signal for brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) due to its informative
features, long-term stability, and low frequency content. However, despite
these interesting properties, LFP-based BMIs have been reported to yield low
decoding performances compared to spike-based BMIs. In this paper, we propose a
new decoder based on long short-term memory (LSTM) network which aims to
improve the decoding performance of LFP-based BMIs. We compare offline decoding
performance of the proposed LSTM decoder to a commonly used Kalman filter (KF)
decoder on hand kinematics prediction tasks from multichannel LFPs. We also
benchmark the performance of LFP-driven LSTM decoder against KF decoder driven
by two types of spike signals: single-unit activity (SUA) and multi-unit
activity (MUA). Our results show that LFP-driven LSTM decoder achieves
significantly better decoding performance than LFP-, SUA-, and MUA-driven KF
decoders. This suggests that LFPs coupled with LSTM decoder could provide high
decoding performance, robust, and low power BMIs.

	<description>Congenital heart disease (CHD) is among the most common birth defects. Children with CHD frequently display long-term intellectual and behavioral disability. Emerging evidence indicates that cardiac anomalies lead to a reduction in cerebral oxygenation, which appears to profoundly impact on the maturation of cerebral regions responsible for higher-order cognitive functions. In this review we focus on the potential mechanisms by which dysregulation of cortical neuronal development during early life may lead to the significant cognitive impairments that commonly occur in children with CHD.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Nestin Regulates Neurogenesis in Mice Through Notch Signaling From Astrocytes to Neural Stem Cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy284</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy284/5263979?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The intermediate filament (nanofilament) protein nestin is a marker of neural stem cells, but its role in neurogenesis, including adult neurogenesis, remains unclear. Here, we investigated the role of nestin in neurogenesis in adult nestin-deficient (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Nes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;–/–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) mice. We found that the proliferation of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Nes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;–/–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; neural stem cells was not altered, but neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Nes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;–/–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice was increased. Surprisingly, the proneurogenic effect of nestin deficiency was mediated by its function in the astrocyte niche. Through its role in Notch signaling from astrocytes to neural stem cells, nestin negatively regulates neuronal differentiation and survival; however, its expression in neural stem cells is not required for normal neurogenesis. In behavioral studies, nestin deficiency in mice did not affect associative learning but was associated with impaired long-term memory.&lt;/span&gt;</description>
