	<description>Publication date: February 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Zilong   Qiu&lt;br /&gt;  MECP2 is a critical gene for neural development, mutations or duplication of which led to severe neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Rett syndrome (RTT) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Extensive works during the past decade yield ample insights into the molecular and cellular functions of MeCP2 in neural development. Furthermore, genetic manipulations in Mecp2 mouse models strongly suggested that deficiency in synaptic plasticity and various behaviors of Mecp2 null or transgenic mice could be rescued in adulthood. Further studies elucidating neural circuits responsible for symptoms in MECP2-associated disorders in rodent and non-human primate models will shed light on the development of potential therapeutic interventions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: October 2017&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 46&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Scott W   Linderman, Samuel J   Gershman&lt;br /&gt; Computational neuroscience is, to first order, dominated by two approaches: the ‘bottom-up’ approach, which searches for statistical patterns in large-scale neural recordings, and the ‘top-down’ approach, which begins with a theory of computation and considers plausible neural implementations. While this division is not clear-cut, we argue that these approaches should be much more intimately linked. From a Bayesian perspective, computational theories provide constrained prior distributions on neural data—albeit highly sophisticated ones. By connecting theory to observation via a probabilistic model, we provide the link necessary to test, evaluate, and revise our theories in a data-driven and statistically rigorous fashion. This review highlights examples of this theory-driven pipeline for neural data analysis in recent literature and illustrates it with a worked example based on the temporal difference learning model of dopamine. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: December 2017&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 47&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Mary A   Logan&lt;br /&gt; Glial cells are essential for proper formation and maintenance of the nervous system. During development, glia keep neuronal cell numbers in check and ensure that mature neural circuits are appropriately sculpted by engulfing superfluous cells and projections. In the adult brain, glial cells offer metabolic sustenance and provide critical immune support in the face of acute and chronic challenges. Dysfunctional glial immune activity is believed to contribute to age-related cognitive decline, as well as neurodegenerative disease risk, but we still know surprisingly little about the specific molecular pathways that govern glia-neuron communication in the healthy or diseased brain. Drosophila offers a versatile in vivo model to explore the conserved molecular underpinnings of glial cell biology and glial cell contributions to brain function, health, and disease susceptibility. This review addresses recent findings describing how Drosophila glial cells influence neuronal activity in the adult fly brain to support optimal brain function and, importantly, highlights new insights into specific glial defects that may contribute to neuronal demise. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: December 2017&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 47&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Alicia   Hidalgo, Ann   Logan&lt;br /&gt; The regenerative response of ensheating glia to central nervous system (CNS) injury involves proliferation and differentiation, axonal re-enwrapment and some recovery of behaviour. Understanding this limited response could enable the enhancement of it. In Drosophila, the glial progenitor state is maintained by Notch, an activator of cell division and Prospero (Pros), a repressor. Injury provokes the activation of NFκB and up-regulation of Kon-tiki (Kon), driving cell proliferation. Homeostatic switch-off comes about as two negative feedback loops involving Pros terminate the response. Importantly, the functions of the kon and pros homologues NG2 and prox1, respectively, are conserved in mammalian NG2 glia. Controlling these genes is key for therapeutic manipulation of progenitors and stem cells to promote regeneration of the damaged CNS. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Critical to progressing the field is the identification of molecular underpinnings necessary for microglia to carry out these important functions within neural circuits. Here, we focus a review specifically on roles for microglial cytokine signaling within developing and mature neural circuits. We review exciting new studies demonstrating essential roles for microglial cytokine signaling in axon outgrowth, synaptogenesis and synapse maturation during development, as well as synaptic transmission and plasticity in adulthood. Together, these studies identify microglia and cytokines as critical modulators of neural circuits within the healthy brain, with implications for a broad range of neurological disorders with disruptions in synaptic structure and function. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;h3&quot;&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; height=&quot;178&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S095943881730137X-fx1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;301&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

The morphological and molecular heterogeneity of oligodendrocytes and their progenitors point to functions beyond establishing saltatory nerve conduction. Here, we review the diversity in the oligodendroglial lineage as well as the classical and new functions identified for oligodendrocytes and their progenitors. Because oligodendroglia remain highly responsive to environmental changes, they likely contribute to various neurological and psychiatric diseases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Human neuroimaging studies consistently show a hunger-dependent, selective enhancement of responses to images of food in association cortex and amygdala. More recently, cellular-resolution imaging combined with circuit mapping experiments in behaving mice have revealed underlying neuronal population dynamics and enabled tracing of pathways by which hunger circuits influence the assignment of value to visual objects in visual association cortex, insular cortex, and amygdala. These experiments begin to provide a mechanistic understanding of motivation-specific neural processing of need-relevant cues in healthy humans and in disease states such as obesity and other eating disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Since the earliest days of embryology, lineage questions have been addressed with methods of increasing specificity, capacity, and resolution. Yet, a full realization of individual cell lineages remains challenging for complex systems. A recent explosion of technical advances in genome-editing and single-cell sequencing has enabled lineage analysis in an unprecedented scale, speed, and depth across different species. In this review, we discuss the application of available as well as future genetic labeling techniques for tracking neural lineages in vivo in the mammalian nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: February 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Alexandra   Krol, Guoping   Feng&lt;br /&gt; Developmental processes disrupted in neurodevelopmental disorders occur rapidly and with temporal precision. During development, individual gene activity can dynamically engage different signaling networks; thus genetic mutations can lead to different functional changes at different times. Interpretation of phenotypes can be further complicated if initial functional changes trigger compensatory mechanisms. Examining genetic mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders reveals cellular phenotypes that change over the course of development and exist long before behavioral deficits are assessed. Correspondingly, earlier genetic interventions in these disorder models have often been more effective at improving behavioral deficits than late interventions. The restricted period of effective intervention demonstrates that identifying a target window is an essential component of treatment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: December 2017&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 47&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Ross   Nortley, David   Attwell&lt;br /&gt; Astrocytes form an anatomical bridge between the vasculature and neuronal synapses. Recent work suggests that they play a key role in regulating brain energy supply by increasing blood flow to regions where neurons are active, and setting the baseline level of blood flow. Controversy persists over whether lactate derived from astrocyte glycolysis is used to power oxidative phosphorylation in neurons, but astrocytes sustain neuronal ATP production by recycling neurotransmitter glutamate that would otherwise need to be resynthesised from glucose, and by providing a short-term energy store in the form of glycogen that can be mobilised when neurons are active. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

To achieve these precise shapes, glia and neurons exhibit coordinated morphological changes on the time scale of minutes and on size scales ranging from nanometers to hundreds of microns. Here, we review recent studies that reveal the highly dynamic, localized morphological changes of mammalian neuron–glia contacts. We then explore the power of Drosophila and C. elegans models to study coordinated changes at defined neuron–glia contacts, highlighting the use of innovative genetic and imaging tools to uncover the molecular mechanisms responsible for coordinated morphogenesis of neurons and glia. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: December 2017&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 47&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Amy F   Lloyd, Claire L   Davies, Veronique E   Miron&lt;br /&gt; Microglia are the resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS), implicated in developmental processes, homeostasis, and responses to injury. Derived from the yolk sac during development, microglia self-renew, self-regulate their numbers during homeostatic conditions, and show a robust proliferative capacity even in adulthood. Together with monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), microglia coordinate the regeneration of CNS myelin around axons, termed remyelination. Gene expression analyses and experimental modelling have identified pro-remyelination roles for microglia/MDM in clearance of myelin debris, secretion of growth factors, and remodelling of the extracellular matrix. Further investigations into the molecular mechanisms controlling these regenerative functions will reveal novel therapeutic strategies to enhance remyelination, by harnessing the beneficial effects of the innate immune response to injury. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: December 2017&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 47&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Morgane Sonia   Thion, Sonia   Garel&lt;br /&gt; Microglia, the brain-resident macrophages, play key roles in regulating synapse density and homeostasis in the postnatal and adult brain. However, microglia enter the brain during embryogenesis and recent studies have revealed additional early functions of these immune cells in prenatal and perinatal cerebral development. Such findings are of importance since prenatal inflammation and microglia dysfunction have been associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders. This review provides a selective overview of the early roles of microglia, their link with a specific spatiotemporal distribution and how they can be modulated by intrinsic factors or environmental signals. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Recently, developments in new experimental approaches have brought about several novel insights about NG2-glia and myelinating oligodendrocytes, indicating a diverse toolkit of functions in experience-dependent myelination and homeostasis in the adult CNS. In this review, we summarize some of the topical studies that highlight newly emerging findings implicating oligodendroglia-lineage cells in brain plasticity, homeostasis and pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Numerous genes in the endo-lysosomal pathways have been found to associate with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations of these genes lead to dysfunction in multiple steps of the endo-lysosomal network: autophagy, endocytic trafficking and lysosomal degradation, resulting in accumulation of pathogenic proteins. Although the exact pathogenic mechanism varies for different disease-associated genes, dysfunction of the endo-lysosomal pathways represents a converging mechanism shared by these diseases. Therefore, strategies that correct or compensate for endo-lysosomal dysfunction may be promising therapeutic approaches to treat neurodegenerative diseases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

The development of sophisticated genetic tools to manipulate its genome accelerates the discovery of the genetic basis of undiagnosed human diseases and the elucidation of molecular pathogenic events of known and novel diseases. Here, we discuss various approaches used in flies to assess the function of the fly homologues of disease-associated genes. We highlight how systematic and combinatorial approaches based on recently established methods provide us with integrated tool sets that can be applied to the study of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25087-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease mostly caused by autoantibodies against acetylcholine receptor associated with thymus abnormalities. Thymectomy has been proven to be an efficacious treatment for patients with MG, but postoperative myasthenic crisis often occurs and is a major complication. We aimed to develop and validate a simple scoring system based on clinical characteristics in the preoperative status to predict the risk of postoperative myasthenic crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25087-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We studied 393 patients with MG who underwent thymectomy at 6 tertiary centers in Japan (275 patients for derivation and 118 for validation). Clinical characteristics, such as gender, age at onset and operation, body mass index, disease duration, MG subtype, severity, symptoms, preoperative therapy, operative data, and laboratory data, were reviewed retrospectively. A multivariate logistic regression with LASSO penalties was used to determine the factors associated with postoperative myasthenic crisis, and a score was assigned. Finally, the predictive score was evaluated using bootstrapping technique in the derivation and validation groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25087-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multivariate logistic regression identified 3 clinical factors for predicting postoperative myasthenic crisis risk: (1) vital capacity &amp;lt; 80%, (2) disease duration &amp;lt; 3 months, and (3) bulbar symptoms immediately before thymectomy. The postoperative myasthenic crisis predictive score, ranging from 0 to 6 points, had areas under the curve of 0.84 (0.66–0.96) in the derivation group and 0.80 (0.62–0.95) in the validation group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25087-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A simple scoring system based on 3 preoperative clinical characteristics can predict the possibility of postoperative myasthenic crisis.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Axonal spike initiation can be maintained with low axonal Na channel density, but temporal precision of spiking is lost. (arXiv:1711.03383v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03383</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03383</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In central neurons, action potentials (APs) originate in the axon initial
segment (AIS) presumably due to its high concentration of voltage-dependent
sodium (NaV) channels. In the AIS, NaV and their cytoskeletal anchoring
proteins display a highly periodical nanoscale arrangement with unknown
functional relevance. In mouse hippocampal neurons, we examined a mutation of
the AIS-specific protein $\beta$IV-spectrin and assessed AP initiation locus,
AIS molecular organization, and the precision of in vivo-like AP encoding. In
mutants, NaV concentration was strongly reduced in AIS but not soma, while AIS
nanoscale organization was preserved. Surprisingly, APs still originated in the
axon, even if the axonal channel density was as low as in the somatic membrane.
However, the timing of those APs was less precise, therefore the neuron's
encoding bandwidth was substantially decreased. Therefore, the high NaV density
in the AIS is not required for axonal AP initiation, it is crucial for AP
timing precision.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A comparative study of the robustness of frequency--domain connectivity measures to finite data length. (arXiv:1711.03332v1 [q-bio.QM])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03332</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03332</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this work we use numerical simulation to investigate how the temporal
length of the data affects the reliability of the estimates of brain
connectivity from EEG time--series. We assume that the neural sources follow a
stable MultiVariate AutoRegressive model, and consider three connectivity
metrics: Imaginary part of Coherency (IC), generalized Partial Directed
Coherence (gPDC) and frequency--domain Granger Causality (fGC). In order to
assess the statistical significance of the estimated values, we use the
surrogate data test by generating phase--randomized and autoregressive
surrogate data. We first consider the ideal case where we know the source time
courses exactly. Here we show how, expectedly, even exact knowledge of the
source time courses is not sufficient to provide reliable estimates of the
connectivity when the number of samples gets small; however, while gPDC and fGC
tend to provide a larger number of false positives, the IC becomes less
sensitive to the presence of connectivity. Then we proceed with more realistic
simulations, where the source time courses are estimated using eLORETA, and the
EEG signal is affected by biological noise of increasing intensity. Using the
ideal case as a reference, we show that the impact of biological noise on IC
estimates is qualitatively different from the impact on gPDC and fGC.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Estimation of neural connections from partially observed neural spikes. (arXiv:1711.03303v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Plasticity is one of the most important features of the nervous systems that
enable animals to adjust their behavior to an ever-changing external world. A
major mechanism of plasticity is the changes in synaptic efficacy between
neurons, and therefore estimation of neural connections is crucial for
investigating information processing in the brain. Although many analysis
methods have been proposed to this end, most of them suffer from a mathematical
difficulty that stems from the fact that activity of only a limited number of
neurons are available. That is, many existing methods ignore effects from
unobserved neurons. To overcome this difficulty, a novel probabilistic
framework is proposed for estimating neural connections from partially observed
spikes. In this study, we estimate influence on observed neurons from
unobserved neurons based on probabilistic firing model and abstract the
connections among observed neurons. Our numerical experiment supports
usefulness of our proposed method.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Prefrontal D1 dopamine-receptor neurons and delta resonance in interval timing</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/216473v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/216473v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Considerable evidence has shown that prefrontal neurons expressing D1-type dopamine receptors (D1DRs) are critical for working memory, flexibility, and timing. This line of work predicts that frontal neurons expressing D1DRs mediate cognitive processing. During timing tasks, one form this cognitive processing might take is time-dependent ramping activity - monotonic changes in firing rate over time. Thus, we hypothesized the prefrontal D1DR+ neurons would strongly exhibited time-dependent ramping during interval timing. We tested this idea using an interval-timing task in which we used optogenetics to tag D1DR+ neurons in the mouse medial frontal cortex (MFC). While 23% of MFC D1DR+ neurons exhibited ramping, this was significantly less than untagged MFC D1DR+ neurons. By contrast, MFC D1DR+ neurons had strong delta-frequency (1-4 Hz) coherence with other MFC ramping neurons. This coherence was phase-locked to cue onset and was strongest early in the interval. To test the significance of these interactions, we optogenetically stimulated MFC D1DR+ neurons early vs. late in the interval. We found that 2-Hz stimulation early in the interval was particularly effective in rescuing timing-related behavioral performance deficits in dopamine-depleted animals. These findings provide insight into MFC networks and have relevance for disorders such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A modeling study of budding yeast colony formation and its relationship to budding pattern and aging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005843</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Yanli Wang, Wing-Cheong Lo, Ching-Shan Chou&lt;/p&gt;

Budding yeast, which undergoes polarized growth during budding and mating, has been a useful model system to study cell polarization. Bud sites are selected differently in haploid and diploid yeast cells: haploid cells bud in an axial manner, while diploid cells bud in a bipolar manner. While previous studies have been focused on the molecular details of the bud site selection and polarity establishment, not much is known about how different budding patterns give rise to different functions at the population level. In this paper, we develop a two-dimensional agent-based model to study budding yeast colonies with cell-type specific biological processes, such as budding, mating, mating type switch, consumption of nutrients, and cell death. The model demonstrates that the axial budding pattern enhances mating probability at an early stage and the bipolar budding pattern improves colony development under nutrient limitation. Our results suggest that the frequency of mating type switch might control the trade-off between diploidization and inbreeding. The effect of cellular aging is also studied through our model. Based on the simulations, colonies initiated by an aged haploid cell show declined mating probability at an early stage and recover as the rejuvenated offsprings become the majority. Colonies initiated with aged diploid cells do not show disadvantage in colony expansion possibly due to the fact that young cells contribute the most to colony expansion.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PXks6MGAEWo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Matrix-normal models for fMRI analysis. (arXiv:1711.03058v1 [stat.ML])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03058</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multivariate analysis of fMRI data has benefited substantially from advances
in machine learning. Most recently, a range of probabilistic latent variable
models applied to fMRI data have been successful in a variety of tasks,
including identifying similarity patterns in neural data (Representational
Similarity Analysis and its empirical Bayes variant, RSA and BRSA; Intersubject
Functional Connectivity, ISFC), combining multi-subject datasets (Shared
Response Mapping; SRM), and mapping between brain and behavior (Joint
Modeling). Although these methods share some underpinnings, they have been
developed as distinct methods, with distinct algorithms and software tools. We
show how the matrix-variate normal (MN) formalism can unify some of these
methods into a single framework. In doing so, we gain the ability to reuse
noise modeling assumptions, algorithms, and code across models. Our primary
theoretical contribution shows how some of these methods can be written as
instantiations of the same model, allowing us to generalize them to flexibly
modeling structured noise covariances. Our formalism permits novel model
variants and improved estimation strategies: in contrast to SRM, the number of
parameters for MN-SRM does not scale with the number of voxels or subjects; in
contrast to BRSA, the number of parameters for MN-RSA scales additively rather
than multiplicatively in the number of voxels. We empirically demonstrate
advantages of two new methods derived in the formalism: for MN-RSA, we show up
to 10x improvement in runtime, up to 6x improvement in RMSE, and more
conservative behavior under the null. For MN-SRM, our method grants a modest
improvement to out-of-sample reconstruction while relaxing the orthonormality
constraint of SRM. We also provide a software prototyping tool for MN models
that can flexibly reuse noise covariance assumptions and algorithms across
models.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Measuring functional connectivity from fMRI is important in understanding
processing in cortical networks. However, because brain's connection pattern is
complex, currently used methods are prone to produce false connections. We
introduce here a new method that uses derivative for estimating functional
connectivity. Using simulations, we benchmarked our method with other commonly
used methods. Our method achieves better results in complex network
simulations. This new method provides an alternative way to estimate functional
connectivity.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated impressive
performance on visual object classification tasks. In addition, it is a useful
model for predication of neuronal responses recorded in visual system. However,
there is still no clear understanding of what CNNs learn in terms of visual
neuronal circuits. Visualizing CNN's features to obtain possible connections to
neuronscience underpinnings is not easy due to highly complex circuits from the
retina to higher visual cortex. Here we address this issue by focusing on
single retinal ganglion cells with a simple model and electrophysiological
recordings from salamanders. By training CNNs with white noise images to
predicate neural responses, we found that convolutional filters learned in the
end are resembling to biological components of the retinal circuit. Features
represented by these filters tile the space of conventional receptive field of
retinal ganglion cells. These results suggest that CNN could be used to reveal
structure components of neuronal circuits.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Substantial evidence indicates that the brain uses principles of non-linear
dynamics in neural processes, providing inspiration for computing with
nanoelectronic devices. However, training neural networks composed of dynamical
nanodevices requires finely controlling and tuning their coupled oscillations.
In this work, we show that the outstanding tunability of spintronic
nano-oscillators can solve this challenge. We successfully train a hardware
network of four spin-torque nano-oscillators to recognize spoken vowels by
tuning their frequencies according to an automatic real-time learning rule. We
show that the high experimental recognition rates stem from the high frequency
tunability of the oscillators and their mutual coupling. Our results
demonstrate that non-trivial pattern classification tasks can be achieved with
small hardware neural networks by endowing them with non-linear dynamical
features: here, oscillations and synchronization. This demonstration is a
milestone for spintronics-based neuromorphic computing.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Muscarinic Lateral Excitation Contributes to Visual Object Segmentation during Collision Avoidance</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/216945v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/216945v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Visual neurons specialized in tracking objects on a collision course are often finely tuned to their target stimuli as this is critical for survival. The presynaptic neural networks converging on these neurons and their role in tuning them remains poorly understood. We took advantage of well-known characteristics of one such neuron to investigate the properties of its presynaptic input network. We find a structure more complex than hitherto realized. In addition to dynamic lateral inhibition used to filter out background motion, presynaptic circuits include normalizing inhibition and short-range lateral excitatory interactions mediated by muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. These interactions preferentially boost responses to coherently expanding visual stimuli generated by colliding objects, as opposed to spatially incoherent controls, helping implement object segmentation. Hence, in addition to active dendritic conductances within collision detecting neurons, multiple layers of both inhibitory and excitatory presynaptic connections are needed to finely tune neural circuits for collision detection.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Auditory Figure-Ground Segregation is Impaired by High Visual Load</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/216846v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Figure-ground segregation is fundamental to listening in complex acoustic environments. An ongoing debate pertains to whether segregation requires attention or is 'automatic' and pre-attentive. In this magnetoencephalography (MEG) study we tested a prediction derived from Load Theory of attention (1) that segregation requires attention, but can benefit from the automatic allocation of any 'leftover' capacity under low load. Complex auditory scenes were modelled with Stochastic Figure Ground stimuli (SFG; 2) which occasionally contained repeated frequency component 'figures'. Naive human subjects passively listened to these signals while performing a visual attention task of either low or high load. Whilst clear figure-related neural responses were observed under conditions of low load, high visual load essentially abolished the neural response to the figure in auditory cortex (Planum Temporale, Heschl's gyrus). We conclude that fundamental figure-ground segregation in hearing is not automatic but draws on shared resources across vision and audition.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/216796v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Accounts of hierarchical cognition suggest that extended task episodes as one task entity and not individually execute their component acts. Such hierarchical execution is frequently thought to occur by first instantiating a sequence representation in working memory that then controls the identity and sequence of component steps. In contrast, we evidence hierarchical execution of extended behavior in situations where the identity and sequence of component steps was unknown and not linked to any sequence representation. Participants executed unpredictable trials wherein, depending on the margin color, they could either choose the smaller value or the font of the two numbers. Crucially, they were biased into construing a recurring instance of three or five trials as one task episode. Behavioral signs of hierarchy, identical to those seen previously with memorized sequence execution, were seen - High trial 1 RT, higher trial 1 RT before longer task episodes, and absence of trial level switch cost specifically across episode boundaries. This showed that hierarchical task sequence representations are not a requisite for hierarchical organization of cognition. Merely construing behavior to be executed as a task episode is enough for the accompanying cognition to be hierarchically organized. Task episodes are executed through the intermediation of episode related programs that are assembled at the beginning and control and organize cognition across time.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Is whole-brain functional connectivity a neuromarker of sustained attention? Comment on Rosenberg &amp; al. (2016)</title>

	<description>Identification of neuromarkers accurately predicting cognitive characteristics from a single, standardised MRI scan could be tremendously useful in basic psychology and clinical practise. In a recent article, Rosenberg et al. (Nat Neurosci, 19, 165-171, 2016) argue that whole-brain functional network strength is a broadly applicable neuromarker of sustained attention. They claim that this marker accurately predicts performance from task related as well as resting state activity. Here, we discuss the applicability and generalizability in the context of three methodological concerns: Simulations show that the statistical methods for the 1) initial validation analyses as well as 2) internal validation using leave-one-out cross validation, are biased towards significance; 3) simple and complex models are compared suboptimally. Overall, we find that the article of Rosenberg et al. provides sufficient proof that network strength is associated with attentional capacity that it is not possible to say to which extent, and for this reason we argue that it cannot be concluded that the network is a broadly applicable neuromarker.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/216622v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Using a systematic computational and modeling framework, we provide a novel Spatio-Temporal Interference-based stiMULation focUsing Strategy (STIMULUS) for high spatial precision noninvasive neurostimulation deep inside the brain. To do so, we first replicate the results of the recently proposed temporal interference (TI) stimulation (which was only tested in-vivo) in a computational model based on a Hodgkin-Huxley model for neurons and a model of current dispersion in the head. Using this computational model, we obtain a nontrivial extension of the 2-electrode-pair TI proposed originally to multielectrode TI (&amp;gt;2 electrode pairs) that yields significantly higher spatial precision. To further improve precision, we develop STIMULUS techniques for generating spatial interference patterns in conjunction with temporal interference, and demonstrate strict and significant improvements over multielectrode TI. Finally, we utilize the adaptivity that is inherent in STIMULUS to create multisite neurostimulation patterns that can be dynamically steered over time.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Visual attention is not always spatially coupled to subsequent oculomotor program</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/216572v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The premotor theory of attention postulates that spatial attention arises from the activation of saccade areas and that the deployment of attention is the consequence of motor programming. Yet, attentional and oculomotor processes have been shown to be dissociable at the neuronal level in covert attention tasks. To investigate a potential dissociation at the behavioral level, we instructed human participants to saccade towards one of two nearby, competing saccade cues. The spatial distribution of visual attention was determined using oriented Gabor stimuli presented either at the cue locations, between them or at several other equidistant locations. Results demonstrate that accurate saccades towards one of the cues were associated with presaccadic enhancement of visual sensitivity at the respective saccade endpoint compared to the non-saccaded cue location. In contrast, averaging saccades, landing between the two cues, were not associated with attentional facilitation at the saccade endpoint, ruling out an obligatory coupling of attentional deployment to the oculomotor program. Rather, attention before averaging saccades was equally distributed to the two cued locations. Taken together, our results reveal a spatial dissociation of visual attention and saccade programming. They suggest that the oculomotor program depends on the state of attentional selection before saccade onset, and that saccade averaging arises from unresolved attentional selection.</description>

	<description>The glymphatic system is a brain-wide metabolite clearance pathway, impairment of which in post-traumatic and ischemic brain or healthy aging is proposed to contribute to intracerebral accumulation of amyloid-{beta} and tau proteins. Glymphatic perivascular influx of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) depends upon the expression and perivascular localization of the astroglial water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4). Prompted by a recent publication that failed to find an effect of Aqp4 knock- out on perivascular CSF tracer influx and interstitial fluid (ISF) tracer dispersion, four independent research groups have herein re-examined the importance of Aqp4 in glymphatic fluid transport. We concur in finding that CSF tracer influx, as well as fluorescently-tagged amyloid-{beta} efflux, are significantly faster in wild-type mice than in three different transgenic lines featuring disruption of the Aqp4 gene and one line in which AQP4 expression lacks the critical perivascular localization (Snta1 knockout). These data validate the role of AQP4 in supporting fluid and solute transport and efflux in brain in accordance with the glymphatic system model.</description>

	<description>The rise of transcranial current stimulation (tCS) techniques have sparked an increasing interest in the effects of weak extracellular electric fields on neural activity. These fields modulate ongoing neural activity through polarization of the neuronal membrane. While the somatic polarization has been investigated experimentally, the frequency-dependent polarization of the dendritic trees in the presence of alternating (AC) fields has received little attention yet. Using a biophysically detailed model with experimentally constrained active conductances, we analyze the subthreshold response of cortical pyramidal cells to weak AC fields, as induced during tCS. We observe a strong frequency resonance around 10-20 Hz in the apical dendrites sensitivity to polarize in response to electric fields but not in the basal dendrites nor the soma. To disentangle the relative roles of the cell morphology and active and passive membrane properties in this resonance, we perform a thorough analysis using simplified models, e.g. a passive pyramidal neuron model, simple passive cables and reconstructed cell model with simplified ion channels. We attribute the origin of the resonance in the apical dendrites to (i) a locally increased sensitivity due to the morphology and to (ii) the high density of h-type channels. Our systematic study provides an improved understanding of the subthreshold response of cortical cells to weak electric fields and, importantly, allows for an improved design of tCS stimuli.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Chunking sequence information by mutually predicting recurrent neural networks</title>

	<description>Interpretation and execution of complex sequences is crucial for various cognitive tasks such as language processing and motor control. The brain solves this problem arguably by dividing a sequence into discrete chunks of contiguous items. While chunking has been accounted for by predictive uncertainty, alternative mechanisms have also been suggested, and the mechanism underlying chunking is poorly understood. Here, we propose a class of unsupervised neural networks for learning and identifying repeated patterns in sequence input with various degrees of complexity. In this model, a pair of reservoir computing modules, each of which comprises a recurrent neural network and readout units, supervise each other to consistently predict others' responses to frequently recurring segments. Interestingly, this system generates neural responses similar to those formed in the basal ganglia during habit formation. Our model extends reservoir computing to higher cognitive function and demonstrates its resemblance to sequence processing by cortico-basal ganglia loops.</description>

	<description>It has become possible to observe neural activity in freely moving animals via calcium imaging using a microscope, which could not be observed previously. However, it remains difficult to extract the dynamics of nerve cells from the recorded imaging data. In this study, we greatly improved the stability, and robustness of the cell activity estimation method via non-negative matrix decomposition with shrinkage estimation of the baseline. In addition, by improving the initial state of the iterative algorithm using a newly proposed method to extract the shape of the cell via image processing, a solution could be obtained with a small number of iterations. These methods were applied to artificial and real data, and their effectiveness was confirmed.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Suppression and Contrast Normalization in Motion Processing</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sensory neurons are activated by a range of stimuli to which they are said to be tuned. Usually, they are also suppressed by another set of stimuli that have little effect when presented in isolation. The interactions between preferred and suppressive stimuli are often quite complex and vary across neurons, even within a single area, making it difficult to infer their collective effect on behavioral responses mediated by activity across populations of neurons. Here, we investigated this issue by measuring, in human subjects (three males), the suppressive effect of static masks on the ocular following responses induced by moving stimuli. We found a wide range of effects, which depend in a nonlinear and nonseparable manner on the spatial frequency, contrast, and spatial location of both stimulus and mask. Under some conditions, the presence of the mask can be seen as scaling the contrast of the driving stimulus. Under other conditions, the effect is more complex, involving also a direct scaling of the behavioral response. All of this complexity at the behavioral level can be captured by a simple model in which stimulus and mask interact nonlinearly at two stages, one monocular and one binocular. The nature of the interactions is compatible with those observed at the level of single neurons in primates, usually broadly described as divisive normalization, without having to invoke any scaling mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The response of sensory neurons to their preferred stimulus is often modulated by stimuli that are not effective when presented alone. Individual neurons can exhibit multiple modulatory effects, with considerable variability across neurons even in a single area. Such diversity has made it difficult to infer the impact of these modulatory mechanisms on behavioral responses. Here, we report the effects of a stationary mask on the reflexive eye movements induced by a moving stimulus. A model with two stages, each incorporating a divisive modulatory mechanism, reproduces our experimental results and suggests that qualitative variability of masking effects in cortical neurons might arise from differences in the extent to which such effects are inherited from earlier stages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dynamic Trial-by-Trial Recoding of Task-Set Representations in the Frontoparietal Cortex Mediates Behavioral Flexibility</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/45/11037?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive flexibility forms the core of the extraordinary ability of humans to adapt, but the precise neural mechanisms underlying our ability to nimbly shift between task sets remain poorly understood. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies employing multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) have shown that a currently relevant task set can be decoded from activity patterns in the frontoparietal cortex, but whether these regions support the dynamic transformation of task sets from trial to trial is not clear. Here, we combined a cued task-switching protocol with human (both sexes) fMRI, and harnessed representational similarity analysis (RSA) to facilitate a novel assessment of trial-by-trial changes in neural task-set representations. We first used MVPA to define task-sensitive frontoparietal and visual regions and found that neural task-set representations on switch trials are less stably encoded than on repeat trials. We then exploited RSA to show that the neural representational pattern dissimilarity across consecutive trials is greater for switch trials than for repeat trials, and that the degree of this pattern dissimilarity predicts behavior. Moreover, the overall neural pattern of representational dissimilarities followed from the assumption that repeating sets, compared with switching sets, results in stronger neural task representations. Finally, when moving from cue to target phase within a trial, pattern dissimilarities tracked the transformation from previous-trial task representations to the currently relevant set. These results provide neural evidence for the longstanding assumptions of an effortful task-set reconfiguration process hampered by task-set inertia, and they demonstrate that frontoparietal and stimulus processing regions support &quot;dynamic adaptive coding,&quot; flexibly representing changing task sets in a trial-by-trial fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Humans can fluently switch between different tasks, reflecting an ability to dynamically configure &quot;task sets,&quot; rule representations that link stimuli to appropriate responses. Recent studies show that neural signals in frontal and parietal brain regions can tell us which of two tasks a person is currently performing. However, it is not known whether these regions are also involved in dynamically reconfiguring task-set representations when switching between tasks. Here we measured human brain activity during task switching and tracked the similarity of neural task-set representations from trial to trial. We show that frontal and parietal brain regions flexibly recode changing task sets in a trial-by-trial fashion, and that task-set similarity over consecutive trials predicts behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Hebbian Learning in a Random Network Captures Selectivity Properties of the Prefrontal Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/45/11021?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Complex cognitive behaviors, such as context-switching and rule-following, are thought to be supported by the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Neural activity in the PFC must thus be specialized to specific tasks while retaining flexibility. Nonlinear &quot;mixed&quot; selectivity is an important neurophysiological trait for enabling complex and context-dependent behaviors. Here we investigate (1) the extent to which the PFC exhibits computationally relevant properties, such as mixed selectivity, and (2) how such properties could arise via circuit mechanisms. We show that PFC cells recorded from male and female rhesus macaques during a complex task show a moderate level of specialization and structure that is not replicated by a model wherein cells receive random feedforward inputs. While random connectivity can be effective at generating mixed selectivity, the data show significantly more mixed selectivity than predicted by a model with otherwise matched parameters. A simple Hebbian learning rule applied to the random connectivity, however, increases mixed selectivity and enables the model to match the data more accurately. To explain how learning achieves this, we provide analysis along with a clear geometric interpretation of the impact of learning on selectivity. After learning, the model also matches the data on measures of noise, response density, clustering, and the distribution of selectivities. Of two styles of Hebbian learning tested, the simpler and more biologically plausible option better matches the data. These modeling results provide clues about how neural properties important for cognition can arise in a circuit and make clear experimental predictions regarding how various measures of selectivity would evolve during animal training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The prefrontal cortex is a brain region believed to support the ability of animals to engage in complex behavior. How neurons in this area respond to stimuli—and in particular, to combinations of stimuli (&quot;mixed selectivity&quot;)—is a topic of interest. Even though models with random feedforward connectivity are capable of creating computationally relevant mixed selectivity, such a model does not match the levels of mixed selectivity seen in the data analyzed in this study. Adding simple Hebbian learning to the model increases mixed selectivity to the correct level and makes the model match the data on several other relevant measures. This study thus offers predictions on how mixed selectivity and other properties evolve with training.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Role of Endogenous Progesterone in Stroke Cerebroprotection Revealed by the Neural-Specific Deletion of Its Intracellular Receptors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/45/10998?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Treatment with progesterone protects the male and female brain against damage after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). However, in both sexes, the brain contains significant amounts of endogenous progesterone. It is not known whether endogenously produced progesterone enhances the resistance of the brain to ischemic insult. Here, we used steroid profiling by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) for exploring adaptive and sex-specific changes in brain levels of progesterone and its metabolites after MCAO. We show that, in the male mouse brain, progesterone is mainly metabolized via 5α-reduction leading to 5α-dihydroprogesterone (5α-DHP), also a progesterone receptor (PR) agonist ligand in neural cells, then to 3α,5α-tetrahydroprogesterone (3α,5α-THP). In the female mouse brain, levels of 5α-DHP and 3α,5α-THP are lower and levels of 20α-DHP are higher than in males. After MCAO, levels of progesterone and 5α-DHP are upregulated rapidly to pregnancy-like levels in the male but not in the female brain. To assess whether endogenous progesterone and 5α-DHP contribute to the resistance of neural cells to ischemic damage, we inactivated PR selectively in the CNS. Deletion of PR in the brain reduced its resistance to MCAO, resulting in increased infarct volumes and neurological deficits in both sexes. Importantly, endogenous PR ligands continue to protect the brain of aging mice. These results uncover the unexpected importance of endogenous progesterone and its metabolites in cerebroprotection. They also reveal that the female reproductive hormone progesterone is an endogenous cerebroprotective neurosteroid in both sexes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The brain responds to injury with protective signaling and has a remarkable capacity to protect itself. We show here that, in response to ischemic stroke, levels of progesterone and its neuroactive metabolite 5α-dihydroprogesterone are upregulated rapidly in the male mouse brain but not in the female brain. An important role of endogenous progesterone in cerebroprotection was demonstrated by the conditional inactivation of its receptor in neural cells. These results show the importance of endogenous progesterone, its metabolites, and neural progesterone receptors in acute cerebroprotection after stroke. This new concept could be exploited therapeutically by taking into account the progesterone status of patients and by supplementing and reinforcing endogenous progesterone signaling for attaining its full cerebroprotective potential.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Enhancing Spinal Plasticity Amplifies the Benefits of Rehabilitative Training and Improves Recovery from Stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/45/10983?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The limited recovery that occurs following stroke happens almost entirely in the first weeks postinjury. Moreover, the efficacy of rehabilitative training is limited beyond this narrow time frame. Sprouting of spared corticospinal tract axons in the contralesional spinal cord makes a significant contribution to sensorimotor recovery, but this structural plasticity is also limited to the first few weeks after stroke. Here, we tested the hypothesis that inducing plasticity in the spinal cord during chronic stroke could improve recovery from persistent sensorimotor impairment. We potentiated spinal plasticity during chronic stroke, weeks after the initial ischemic injury, in male Sprague-Dawley rats via intraspinal injections of chondroitinase ABC. Our data show that chondroitinase injections into the contralesional gray matter of the cervical spinal cord administered 28 d after stroke induced significant sprouting of corticospinal axons originating in the peri-infarct cortex. Chondroitinase ABC injection during chronic stroke without additional training resulted in moderate improvements of sensorimotor deficits. Importantly, this therapy dramatically potentiated the efficacy of rehabilitative training delivered during chronic stroke in a skilled forelimb reaching task. These novel data suggest that spinal therapy during chronic stroke can amplify the benefits of delayed rehabilitative training with the potential to reduce permanent disability in stroke survivors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The brain and spinal cord undergo adaptive rewiring (&quot;plasticity&quot;) following stroke. This plasticity allows for partial functional recovery from stroke induced sensorimotor impairments. However, the plasticity that underlies recovery occurs predominantly in the first weeks following stroke, and most stroke survivors are left with permanent disability even after rehabilitation. Using animal models, our data show that removal of plasticity-inhibiting signals in the spinal cord (via intraspinal injections of the enzyme chondroitinase ABC) augments rewiring of circuits connecting the brain to the spinal cord, even weeks after stroke. Moreover, this plasticity can be harnessed by rehabilitative training to significantly promote sensorimotor recovery. Thus, intraspinal therapy may augment rehabilitative training and improve recovery even in individuals living with chronic disability due to stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dendritic and Axonal L-Type Calcium Channels Cooperate to Enhance Motoneuron Firing Output during Drosophila Larval Locomotion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/45/10971?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/45/10971?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Behaviorally adequate neuronal firing patterns are critically dependent on the specific types of ion channel expressed and on their subcellular localization. This study combines &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiology with genetic and pharmacological intervention in larval &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; of both sexes to address localization and function of L-type like calcium channels in motoneurons. We demonstrate that Dmca1D (Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1 homolog) L-type like calcium channels localize to both the somatodendritic and the axonal compartment of larval crawling motoneurons. &lt;i&gt;In situ&lt;/i&gt; patch-clamp recordings in genetic mosaics reveal that Dmca1D channels increase burst duration and maximum intraburst firing frequencies during crawling-like motor patterns in semi-intact animals. Genetic and acute pharmacological manipulations suggest that prolonged burst durations are caused by dendritically localized Dmca1D channels, which activate upon cholinergic synaptic input and amplify EPSPs, thus indicating a conserved function of dendritic L-type channels from &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; to vertebrates. By contrast, maximum intraburst firing rates require axonal calcium influx through Dmca1D channels, likely to enhance sodium channel de-inactivation via a fast afterhyperpolarization through BK channel activation. Therefore, in unmyelinated &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; motoneurons different functions of axonal and dendritic L-type like calcium channels likely operate synergistically to maximize firing output during locomotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Nervous system function depends on the specific excitabilities of different types of neurons. Excitability is largely shaped by different combinations of voltage-dependent ion channels. Despite a high degree of conservation, the huge diversity of ion channel types and their differential localization pose challenges in assigning distinct functions to specific channels across species. We find a conserved role, from fruit flies to mammals, for L-type calcium channels in augmenting motoneuron excitability. As in spinal cord, dendritic L-type channels amplify excitatory synaptic input. In contrast to spinal motoneurons, axonal L-type channels enhance firing rates in unmyelinated &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; motoraxons. Therefore, enhancing motoneuron excitability by L-type channels seems an old strategy, but localization and interactions with other channels are tuned to species-specific requirements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Postinjury Induction of Activated ErbB2 Selectively Hyperactivates Denervated Schwann Cells and Promotes Robust Dorsal Root Axon Regeneration</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/45/10955?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/45/10955?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Following nerve injury, denervated Schwann cells (SCs) convert to repair SCs, which enable regeneration of peripheral axons. However, the repair capacity of SCs and the regenerative capacity of peripheral axons are limited. In the present studies we examined a potential therapeutic strategy to enhance the repair capacity of SCs, and tested its efficacy in enhancing regeneration of dorsal root (DR) axons, whose regenerative capacity is particularly weak. We used male and female mice of a doxycycline-inducible transgenic line to induce expression of constitutively active ErbB2 (caErbB2) selectively in SCs after DR crush or transection. Two weeks after injury, injured DRs of induced animals contained far more SCs and SC processes. These SCs had not redifferentiated and continued to proliferate. Injured DRs of induced animals also contained far more axons that regrew along SC processes past the transection or crush site. Remarkably, SCs and axons in uninjured DRs remained quiescent, indicating that caErbB2 enhanced regeneration of injured DRs, without aberrantly activating SCs and axons in intact nerves. We also found that intraspinally expressed glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), but not the removal of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, greatly enhanced the intraspinal migration of caErbB2-expressing SCs, enabling robust penetration of DR axons into the spinal cord. These findings indicate that SC-selective, post-injury activation of ErbB2 provides a novel strategy to powerfully enhance the repair capacity of SCs and axon regeneration, without substantial off-target damage. They also highlight that promoting directed migration of caErbB2-expressing SCs by GDNF might be useful to enable axon regrowth in a non-permissive environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Repair of injured peripheral nerves remains a critical clinical problem. We currently lack a therapy that potently enhances axon regeneration in patients with traumatic nerve injury. It is extremely challenging to substantially increase the regenerative capacity of damaged nerves without deleterious off-target effects. It was therefore of great interest to discover that caErbB2 markedly enhances regeneration of damaged dorsal roots, while evoking little change in intact roots. To our knowledge, these findings are the first demonstration that repair capacity of denervated SCs can be efficaciously enhanced without altering innervated SCs. Our study also demonstrates that oncogenic ErbB2 signaling can be activated in SCs but not impede transdifferentiation of denervated SCs to regeneration-promoting repair SCs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The VTA is necessary for reward behavior with dopamine cells critically involved in reward signaling. Dopamine cells in turn are innervated and regulated by neighboring inhibitory GABA cells. Using whole-cell electrophysiology in juvenile-adolescent GAD67-GFP male mice, we examined excitatory plasticity in fluorescent VTA GABA cells. A novel CB1-dependent LTD was induced in GABA cells that was dependent on metabotropic glutamate receptor 5, and cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1). LTD was absent in &lt;i&gt;CB1&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mice but preserved in heterozygous littermates. Bath applied &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;-tetrahydrocannabinol depressed GABA cell activity, therefore downstream dopamine cells will be disinhibited; and thus, this could potentially result in increased reward. Chronic injections of &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;-tetrahydrocannabinol occluded LTD compared with vehicle injections; however, a single exposure was insufficient to do so. As synaptic modifications by drugs of abuse are often tied to addiction, these data suggest a possible mechanism for the addictive effects of &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;-tetrahydrocannabinol in juvenile-adolescents, by potentially altering reward behavioral outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The present study identifies a novel form of glutamatergic synaptic plasticity in VTA GABA neurons, a currently understudied cell type that is critical for the brain's reward circuit, and how &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;-tetrahydrocannabinol occludes this plasticity. This study specifically addresses a potential unifying mechanism whereby marijuana could exert rewarding and addictive/withdrawal effects. Marijuana use and legalization are a pressing issue for many states in the United States. Although marijuana is the most commonly abused illicit drug, the implications of legalized, widespread, or continued usage are speculative. This study in juvenile-adolescent aged mice identifies a novel form of synaptic plasticity in VTA GABA cells, and the synaptic remodeling that can occur after &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;-tetrahydrocannabinol use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Animals can readily learn that stimuli predict the absence of specific appetitive outcomes; however, the neural substrates underlying such outcome-specific conditioned inhibition remain largely unexplored. Here, using female and male rats as subjects, we examined the involvement of the lateral habenula (LHb) and of its inputs onto the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) in inhibitory learning. In these experiments, we used backward conditioning and contingency reversal to establish outcome-specific conditioned inhibitors for two distinct appetitive outcomes. Then, using the Pavlovian-instrumental transfer paradigm, we assessed the effects of manipulations of the LHb and the LHb–RMTg pathway on that inhibitory encoding. In control animals, we found that an outcome-specific conditioned inhibitor biased choice away from actions delivering that outcome and toward actions earning other outcomes. Importantly, this bias was abolished by both electrolytic lesions of the LHb and selective ablation of LHb neurons using Cre-dependent Caspase3 expression in Cre-expressing neurons projecting to the RMTg. This deficit was specific to conditioned inhibition; an excitatory predictor of a specific outcome-biased choice toward actions delivering the same outcome to a similar degree whether the LHb or the LHb–RMTg network was intact or not. LHb lesions also disrupted the ability of animals to inhibit previously encoded stimulus–outcome contingencies after their reversal, pointing to a critical role of the LHb and of its inputs onto the RMTg in outcome-specific conditioned inhibition in appetitive settings. These findings are consistent with the developing view that the LHb promotes a negative reward prediction error in Pavlovian conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Stimuli that positively or negatively predict rewarding outcomes influence choice between actions that deliver those outcomes. Previous studies have found that a positive predictor of a specific outcome biases choice toward actions delivering that outcome. In contrast, a negative predictor of an outcome biases choice away from actions earning that outcome and toward other actions. Here we reveal that the lateral habenula is critical for negative predictors, but not positive predictors, to affect choice. Furthermore, these effects were found to require activation of lateral habenula inputs to the rostromedial tegmental nucleus. These results are consistent with the view that the lateral habenula establishes inhibitory relationships between stimuli and food outcomes and computes a negative prediction error in Pavlovian conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Foxp1 in Forebrain Pyramidal Neurons Controls Gene Expression Required for Spatial Learning and Synaptic Plasticity</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Genetic perturbations of the transcription factor &lt;i&gt;Forkhead Box P1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;FOXP1&lt;/i&gt;) are causative for severe forms of autism spectrum disorder that are often comorbid with intellectual disability. Recent work has begun to reveal an important role for FoxP1 in brain development, but the brain-region-specific contributions of Foxp1 to autism and intellectual disability phenotypes have yet to be determined fully. Here, we describe &lt;i&gt;Foxp1&lt;/i&gt; conditional knock-out (&lt;i&gt;Foxp1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;cKO&lt;/sup&gt;) male and female mice with loss of Foxp1 in the pyramidal neurons of the neocortex and the CA1/CA2 subfields of the hippocampus. &lt;i&gt;Foxp1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;cKO&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibit behavioral phenotypes that are of potential relevance to autism spectrum disorder, including hyperactivity, increased anxiety, communication impairments, and decreased sociability. In addition, &lt;i&gt;Foxp1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;cKO&lt;/sup&gt; mice have gross deficits in learning and memory tasks of relevance to intellectual disability. Using a genome-wide approach, we identified differentially expressed genes in the hippocampus of &lt;i&gt;Foxp1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;cKO&lt;/sup&gt; mice associated with synaptic function and development. Furthermore, using magnetic resonance imaging, we uncovered a significant reduction in the volumes of both the entire hippocampus as well as individual hippocampal subfields of &lt;i&gt;Foxp1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;cKO&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Finally, we observed reduced maintenance of LTP in area CA1 of the hippocampus in these mutant mice. Together, these data suggest that proper expression of Foxp1 in the pyramidal neurons of the forebrain is important for regulating gene expression pathways that contribute to specific behaviors reminiscent of those seen in autism and intellectual disability. In particular, Foxp1 regulation of gene expression appears to be crucial for normal hippocampal development, CA1 plasticity, and spatial learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Loss-of-function mutations in the transcription factor &lt;i&gt;Forkhead Box P1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;FOXP1&lt;/i&gt;) lead to autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability. Understanding the potential brain-region-specific contributions of FOXP1 to disease-relevant phenotypes could be a critical first step in the management of patients with these mutations. Here, we report that &lt;i&gt;Foxp1&lt;/i&gt; conditional knock-out (&lt;i&gt;Foxp1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;cKO&lt;/sup&gt;) mice with loss of Foxp1 in the neocortex and hippocampus display autism and intellectual-disability-relevant behaviors. We also show that these phenotypes correlate with changes in both the genomic and physiological profiles of the hippocampus in &lt;i&gt;Foxp1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;cKO&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Our work demonstrates that brain-region-specific FOXP1 expression may relate to distinct, clinically relevant phenotypes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Distinct Laterality in Forelimb-Movement Representations of Rat Primary and Secondary Motor Cortical Neurons with Intratelencephalic and Pyramidal Tract Projections</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/45/10904?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Two distinct motor areas, the primary and secondary motor cortices (M1 and M2), play crucial roles in voluntary movement in rodents. The aim of this study was to characterize the laterality in motor cortical representations of right and left forelimb movements. To achieve this goal, we developed a novel behavioral task, the Right-Left Pedal task, in which a head-restrained male rat manipulates a right or left pedal with the corresponding forelimb. This task enabled us to monitor independent movements of both forelimbs with high spatiotemporal resolution. We observed phasic movement-related neuronal activity (Go-type) and tonic hold-related activity (Hold-type) in isolated unilateral movements. In both M1 and M2, Go-type neurons exhibited bias toward contralateral preference, whereas Hold-type neurons exhibited no bias. The contralateral bias was weaker in M2 than M1. Moreover, we differentiated between intratelencephalic (IT) and pyramidal tract (PT) neurons using optogenetically evoked spike collision in rats expressing channelrhodopsin-2. Even in identified PT and IT neurons, Hold-type neurons exhibited no lateral bias. Go-type PT neurons exhibited bias toward contralateral preference, whereas IT neurons exhibited no bias. Our findings suggest a different laterality of movement representations of M1 and M2, in each of which IT neurons are involved in cooperation of bilateral movements, whereas PT neurons control contralateral movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In rodents, the primary and secondary motor cortices (M1 and M2) are involved in voluntary movements via distinct projection neurons: intratelencephalic (IT) neurons and pyramidal tract (PT) neurons. However, it remains unclear whether the two motor cortices (M1 vs M2) and the two classes of projection neurons (IT vs PT) have different laterality of movement representations. We optogenetically identified these neurons and analyzed their functional activity using a novel behavioral task to monitor movements of the right and left forelimbs separately. We found that contralateral bias was reduced in M2 relative to M1, and in IT relative to PT neurons. Our findings suggest that the motor information processing that controls forelimb movement is coordinated by a distinct cell population.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Nonhuman Primate Optogenetics: Recent Advances and Future Directions</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Optogenetics is the use of genetically coded, light-gated ion channels or pumps (opsins) for millisecond resolution control of neural activity. By targeting opsin expression to specific cell types and neuronal pathways, optogenetics can expand our understanding of the neural basis of normal and pathological behavior. To maximize the potential of optogenetics to study human cognition and behavior, optogenetics should be applied to the study of nonhuman primates (NHPs). The homology between NHPs and humans makes these animals the best experimental model for understanding human brain function and dysfunction. Moreover, for genetic tools to have translational promise, their use must be demonstrated effectively in large, wild-type animals such as Rhesus macaques. Here, we review recent advances in primate optogenetics. We highlight the technical hurdles that have been cleared, challenges that remain, and summarize how optogenetic experiments are expanding our understanding of primate brain function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Consciousness Regained: Disentangling Mechanisms, Brain Systems, and Behavioral Responses</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;How consciousness (experience) arises from and relates to material brain processes (the &quot;mind-body problem&quot;) has been pondered by thinkers for centuries, and is regarded as among the deepest unsolved problems in science, with wide-ranging theoretical, clinical, and ethical implications. Until the last few decades, this was largely seen as a philosophical topic, but not widely accepted in mainstream neuroscience. Since the 1980s, however, novel methods and theoretical advances have yielded remarkable results, opening up the field for scientific and clinical progress. Since a seminal paper by Crick and Koch (1998) claimed that a science of consciousness should first search for its neural correlates (NCC), a variety of correlates have been suggested, including both content-specific NCCs, determining particular phenomenal components within an experience, and the full NCC, the neural substrates supporting entire conscious experiences. In this review, we present recent progress on theoretical, experimental, and clinical issues. Specifically, we (1) review methodological advances that are important for dissociating conscious experience from related enabling and executive functions, (2) suggest how critically reconsidering the role of the frontal cortex may further delineate NCCs, (3) advocate the need for general, objective, brain-based measures of the capacity for consciousness that are independent of sensory processing and executive functions, and (4) show how animal studies can reveal population and network phenomena of relevance for understanding mechanisms of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: New Breakthroughs in Understanding the Role of Functional Interactions between the Neocortex and the Claustrum</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Almost all areas of the neocortex are connected with the claustrum, a nucleus located between the neocortex and the striatum, yet the functions of corticoclaustral and claustrocortical connections remain largely obscure. As major efforts to model the neocortex are currently underway, it has become increasingly important to incorporate the corticoclaustral system into theories of cortical function. This Mini-Symposium was motivated by a series of recent studies which have sparked new hypotheses regarding the function of claustral circuits. Anatomical, ultrastructural, and functional studies indicate that the claustrum is most highly interconnected with prefrontal cortex, suggesting important roles in higher cognitive processing, and that the organization of the corticoclaustral system is distinct from the driver/modulator framework often used to describe the corticothalamic system. Recent findings supporting roles in detecting novel sensory stimuli, directing attention and setting behavioral states, were the subject of the Mini-Symposium at the 2017 Society for Neuroscience Annual Meeting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;High rates of relapse to drug use during abstinence is a defining feature of human drug addiction. This clinical scenario has been studied at the preclinical level using different animal models in which relapse to drug seeking is assessed after cessation of operant drug self-administration in rodents and monkeys. In our Society for Neuroscience (SFN) session entitled &quot;Circuit and Synaptic Plasticity Mechanisms of Drug Relapse,&quot; we will discuss new developments of our understanding of circuits and synaptic plasticity mechanisms of drug relapse from studies combining established and novel animal models with state-of-the-art cellular, electrophysiology, anatomical, chemogenetic, and optogenetic methods. We will also discuss the translational implications of these new developments. In the mini-review that introduces our SFN session, we summarize results from our laboratories on behavioral, cellular, and circuit mechanisms of drug relapse within the context of our session.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Adolescence and Reward: Making Sense of Neural and Behavioral Changes Amid the Chaos</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Adolescence is a time of significant neural and behavioral change with remarkable development in social, emotional, and cognitive skills. It is also a time of increased exploration and risk-taking (e.g., drug use). Many of these changes are thought to be the result of increased reward-value coupled with an underdeveloped inhibitory control, and thus a hypersensitivity to reward. Perturbations during adolescence can alter the developmental trajectory of the brain, resulting in long-term alterations in reward-associated behaviors. This review highlights recent developments in our understanding of how neural circuits, pubertal hormones, and environmental factors contribute to adolescent-typical reward-associated behaviors with a particular focus on sex differences, the medial prefrontal cortex, social reward, social isolation, and drug use. We then introduce a new approach that makes use of natural adaptations of seasonally breeding species to investigate the role of pubertal hormones in adolescent development. This research has only begun to parse out contributions of the many neural, endocrine, and environmental changes to the heightened reward sensitivity and increased vulnerability to mental health disorders that characterize this life stage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The brain processes information from the periphery and regulates visceral and immune activity to maintain internal homeostasis, optimally respond to a dynamic external environment, and integrate these functions with ongoing behavior. In addition to its relevance for survival, this integration underlies pathology as evidenced by diseases exhibiting comorbid visceral and psychiatric symptoms. Advances in neuroanatomical mapping, genetically specific neuronal manipulation, and neural network recording are overcoming the challenges of dissecting complex circuits that underlie this integration and deciphering their function. Here we focus on reciprocal communication between the brain and urological, gastrointestinal, and immune systems. These studies are revealing how autonomic activity becomes integrated into behavior as part of a social strategy, how the brain regulates innate immunity in response to stress, and how drugs impact emotion and gastrointestinal function. These examples highlight the power of the functional organization of circuits at the interface of the brain and periphery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Volition and Action in the Human Brain: Processes, Pathologies, and Reasons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Humans seem to decide for themselves what to do, and when to do it. This distinctive capacity may emerge from an ability, shared with other animals, to make decisions for action that are related to future goals, or at least free from the constraints of immediate environmental inputs. Studying such volitional acts proves a major challenge for neuroscience. This review highlights key mechanisms in the generation of voluntary, as opposed to stimulus-driven actions, and highlights three issues. The first part focuses on the apparent spontaneity of voluntary action. The second part focuses on one of the most distinctive, but elusive, features of volition, namely, its link to conscious experience, and reviews stimulation and patient studies of the cortical basis of conscious volition down to the single-neuron level. Finally, we consider the goal-directedness of voluntary action, and discuss how internal generation of action can be linked to goals and reasons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Clinical disability scores, viral markers, and immunological parameters were obtained for patients and correlated with representative spinal cord cross-sectional area regions at the C2 to C3, C4 to C5, and T4 to T9 levels.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Neural system identification for large populations separating &quot;what&quot; and &quot;where&quot;. (arXiv:1711.02653v1 [stat.ML])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists classify neurons into different types that perform similar
computations at different locations in the visual field. Traditional methods
for neural system identification do not capitalize on this separation of 'what'
and 'where'. Learning deep convolutional feature spaces that are shared among
many neurons provides an exciting path forward, but the architectural design
needs to account for data limitations: While new experimental techniques enable
recordings from thousands of neurons, experimental time is limited so that one
can sample only a small fraction of each neuron's response space. Here, we show
that a major bottleneck for fitting convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to
neural data is the estimation of the individual receptive field locations, a
problem that has been scratched only at the surface thus far. We propose a CNN
architecture with a sparse readout layer factorizing the spatial (where) and
feature (what) dimensions. Our network scales well to thousands of neurons and
short recordings and can be trained end-to-end. We evaluate this architecture
on ground-truth data to explore the challenges and limitations of CNN-based
system identification. Moreover, we show that our network model outperforms
current state-of-the art system identification models of mouse primary visual
cortex.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cortical circuits exhibit intricate recurrent architectures that are
remarkably similar across different brain areas. Such stereotyped structure
suggests the existence of common computational principles. However, such
principles have remained largely elusive. Inspired by gated-memory networks,
namely long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), we introduce a recurrent neural
network in which information is gated through inhibitory cells that are
subtractive (subLSTM). We propose a natural mapping of subLSTMs onto known
canonical excitatory-inhibitory cortical microcircuits. Our empirical
evaluation across sequential image classification and language modelling tasks
shows that subLSTM units can achieve similar performance to LSTM units. These
results suggest that cortical circuits can be optimised to solve complex
contextual problems and proposes a novel view on their computational function.
Overall our work provides a step towards unifying recurrent networks as used in
machine learning with their biological counterparts.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Optogenetics has emerged as an exciting tool for manipulating neural
activity, which in turn, can modulate behavior in live organisms. However,
detecting the response to the optical stimulation requires electrophysiology
with physical contact or fluorescent imaging at target locations, which is
often limited by photobleaching and phototoxicity. In this paper, we show that
phase imaging can report the intracellular transport induced by optogenetic
stimulation. We developed a multimodal instrument that can both stimulate cells
with high spatial resolution and detect optical pathlength changes with
nanometer scale sensitivity. We found that optical pathlength fluctuations
following stimulation are consistent with active organelle transport.
Furthermore, the results indicate a broadening in the transport velocity
distribution, which is significantly higher in stimulated cells compared to
optogenetically inactive cells. It is likely that this label-free, contactless
measurement of optogenetic response will provide an enabling approach to
neuroscience.

	<description>Several experimental procedures are currently used to investigate the impact of the environment on brain plasticity under physiological and pathological conditions. The available methodologies are aimed at obtaining global or specific reductions or intensifications of the stimuli, with initial standardization in animal models being paralleled by translational applications to humans. More procedures can be combined together or applied in series to obtain powerful experimental paradigms, and the choice of a given setting should take into account the specific genetic background, age, and phenotypic vulnerabilities of the target subjects.</description>

	<description>Drugs that act on the brain oxytocin (OXT) system may provide a much-needed treatment breakthrough for substance-use disorders. Targeting the brain OXT system has the potential to treat addiction to all major classes of addictive substance and to intervene across all stages of the addiction cycle. Emerging evidence suggests that OXT is able to interfere with such a wide range of addictive behaviours for such a wide range of addictive substances by rebalancing core neural systems that become dysregulated over the course of addiction.</description>

	<description>Activation of the innate immune system, mediated by the complement and the contact systems, induces inflammation. The inhibition of these pathways by C1 inhibitor (C1INH) has been shown to decrease pro-inflammatory response and mediate vascular permeability in the periphery. However, the role of peripheral C1INH has not been associated with brain function. Using an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) to deplete circulating liver-derived C1INH in wildtype (WT) mice, we induced the activation of the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS), which produced bradykinin in the plasma, resulting in hypotension. Interestingly, the complement system was quiescent. Depletion of liver-derived C1INH increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, increased expression of bradykinin 2 receptor, activated resident glial cells to secrete pro-inflammatory mediators such as Il-1beta, Il-6, TNF-alpha and iNOS, and induced cognitive decline. The results of this study emphasize the important role of circulating C1INH in mediating brain function through the activation of the KKS. Thus, manipulation of C1INH in neuro-vascular disorders might be therapeutically beneficial.</description>

	<description>Procedural learning is a fundamental cognitive function that facilitates efficient processing of and automatic responses to complex environmental stimuli. Here, we examined training-dependent and off-line changes of two sub-processes of procedural learning: namely, sequence learning and statistical learning. Whereas sequence learning requires the acquisition of order-based relationship between the elements of a sequence, statistical learning is based on the acquisition of probabilistic associations between elements. Seventy-eight healthy young adults (58 females and 20 males) completed the modified version of the Alternating Serial Reaction Time task that was designed to measure Sequence and Statistical Learning simultaneously. After training, participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: active wakefulness, quiet rest, or daytime sleep. We examined early off-line changes in Sequence and Statistical Learning as well as further improvements after extended practice. Performance in Sequence Learning increased in a gradual manner during training, while Statistical Learning plateaued relatively rapidly. After the off-line period, both the acquired sequence and statistical knowledge was preserved, irrespective of the vigilance state. Sequence Learning further improved during extended practice, while Statistical Learning did not. Although, on a behavioral level, Sequence and Statistical Learning were similar across groups after the off-line period, cortical oscillations were associated with individual differences in performance changes within the sleep group only. Moreover, sleep spindle parameters showed differential associations with Sequence and Statistical Learning. Our findings can contribute to a deeper understanding of the dynamic changes of multiple parallel learning and consolidation processes that occur during procedural memory formation.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Visual working memory is independent of the cortical spacing between memoranda</title>

	<description>The sensory recruitment hypothesis states that visual short term memory is maintained in the same visual cortical areas that initially encode a stimulus' features. Although it is well established that the distance between features in visual cortex determines their visibility, a limitation known as crowding, it is unknown whether short term memory is similarly constrained by the cortical spacing of memory items. Here we investigated whether the cortical spacing between sequentially presented memoranda affects the fidelity of human observers' memory. In a first experiment, we varied cortical spacing by taking advantage of the log-scaling of visual cortex with eccentricity, sequentially presenting memoranda in peripheral vision along either the radial or tangential visual axis with respect to the fovea. In a second experiment, we sequentially presented memoranda either within or beyond the critical spacing of visual crowding, a distance within which visual features cannot be perceptually distinguished due to their nearby cortical representations. In both experiments and across multiple measures, we found strong evidence that the ability to maintain visual features in memory is unaffected by cortical spacing. These results indicate that the neural architecture underpinning working memory has properties inconsistent with the known behaviour of sensory neurons in visual cortex. Instead, the dissociation between perceptual and memory representations supports a role of higher cortical areas, such as posterior parietal or prefrontal regions, or may involve an as yet unspecified mechanism in visual cortex in which stimulus features are bound to their temporal order.</description>

	<description>Collision avoidance is critical for survival, including in humans, and many species possess visual neurons exquisitely sensitive to objects approaching on a collision course. The most studied such collision-detecting neuron within the optic lobe of grasshoppers has long served as a model for understanding collision avoidance behaviors and their underlying neural computations. Here, we demonstrate that this neuron detects the spatial coherence of a simulated impending object, thereby carrying out a computation akin to object segmentation critical for proper escape behavior. At the cellular level, object segmentation relies on a precise selection of the spatiotemporal pattern of synaptic inputs by dendritic membrane potential-activated channels. One channel type linked to dendritic computations in many neural systems, the hyperpolarization-activated cation channel, HCN, plays a central role in this computation as its pharmacological block abolishes the neuron's spatial selectivity and impairs the generation of visually guided escape behaviors, making it directly relevant to survival. Our results elucidate how active dendritic channels produce neuronal and behavioral object specificity by discriminating between complex spatiotemporal synaptic activation patterns.</description>

	<description>Quality of memory and sleep decline with age, but the mechanistic interactions underlying the memory function of sleep in older adults are still unknown. It is widely assumed that the beneficial effect of sleep on memory relies on reactivation during Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and targeting these reactivations by cue re-exposure reliably improves memory in younger participants. Here we tested whether the reactivation mechanism during sleep is still functional in old age by applying targeted memory reactivation (TMR) during NREM sleep in healthy adults over 60 years. In contrast to previous studies in young participants, older adults' memories do not generally benefit from TMR during NREM sleep. On an individual level, a subgroup of older adults still profited from cueing during sleep. These improvers tended to have a better sleep efficiency than non-improvers. In addition, the oscillatory results resembled those obtained in younger participants, involving increases in theta (~6 Hz) and spindle (~13 Hz) power for remembered and gained words in a later time windows. In contrast, non-improvers showed no increases in theta activity and even strongly reduced spindle power for later gained vs. lost words. Our results suggest that reactivations during sleep might lose their functionality for memory in some older adults, while this mechanism is still intact in a subgroup of participants. Further studies need to examine more closely the determinants of preserving the memory function of sleep during healthy aging.</description>

	<description>Olfactory bulb circuits transform a spatially organized olfactory sensory input into a temporal output code in mitral and tufted cells. Various GABAergic interneurons modulate this early processing. However, little is known about the GABAergic circuits that regulate the activity of olfactory bulb interneurons. We examined this question using patch-clamp recording and optogenetics in olfactory bulb slices. We found that long-range centrifugal projections from the basal forebrain provide a prominent GABAergic synaptic input on most subtypes of periglomerular (PG) cells, deep short axon cells and granule cells. We also demonstrate that basal forebrain inputs have specific properties and distinct functional impacts depending on the postsynaptic PG cell subtype. Thus, centrifugal GABAergic afferents may excite, inhibit or sequentially inhibit and excite distinct PG cells using co-transmission of acetylcholine. Together, these results reinforce the idea that basal forebrain projections have multiple, complex and so far overlooked implications on olfactory bulb processing.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Divergent effects of healthy ageing on semantic knowledge and control: Evidence from novel comparisons with semantically-impaired patients</title>

	<description>Effective use of semantic knowledge requires a set of conceptual representations as well as control processes which ensure that currently-relevant aspects of this knowledge are retrieved and selected. It is well-established that levels of semantic knowledge increase across the lifespan. However, the effects of ageing on semantic control processes have not been assessed. I addressed this issue by comparing the performance profiles of young and older people on a verbal comprehension test. Two sets of variables were used to predict accuracy and RT in each age group: (a) the psycholinguistic properties of words being probed, (b) the scores of two sets of semantically-impaired neuropsychological patients who had completed the test previously. Young people demonstrated poor performance for low frequency and abstract words, suggesting that they had difficulty processing words with intrinsically weak semantic representations. Indeed, performance in this group was strongly predicted by the scores of patients with semantic dementia, who suffer from degradation of semantic knowledge. In contrast, older adults performed poorly on trials where the target semantic relationship was weak and distractor relationships strong - conditions which require high levels of controlled processing. Their performance was better predicted by the scores of patients with semantic control deficits. These findings indicate that the effects of ageing on semantic cognition are more complex than has previously been assumed. While older people have larger stores of knowledge than young people, they are less skilled at exercising control over the activation of this knowledge.</description>

	<description>Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has been proposed as a tool to draw causal inferences on the role of oscillatory activity in cognitive functioning and has the potential to induce long-term changes in cerebral networks. However, the mechanisms of action of tACS are not yet clear, though previous modeling works have suggested that variability may be mediated by local and network-level brain states. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to record brain activity from 17 healthy participants as they kept their eyes open (EO) or closed (EC) while being stimulated either with sham, weak, or strong alpha-tACS using a montage commonly assumed to target occipital areas. We reconstructed the activity of sources in all stimulation conditions by means of beamforming. The analysis of resting-state data revealed an interaction of the external stimulation with the endogenous alpha power difference between EO and EC in the posterior cingulate. This region is remote from occipital cortex, which showed strongest EC vs. EO alpha modulation, thus suggesting state-dependency long-range effects of tACS. In a follow-up analysis of this online-tACS effect, we find evidence that this dependency effect could be mediated by functional network changes: connection strength from the precuneus, a region adjusting for a measure of network integration in the two states (EC vs. EO during no-tACS), was significantly correlated with the state-dependency effect in the posterior cingulate (during tACS). No analogous correlation could be found for alpha power modulations in occipital cortex. Altogether, this is the first strong evidence to illustrate how functional network architectures can shape tACS effects.</description>

	<description>Fast synaptic inhibition in the nervous system depends on the transmembrane flux of Cl- ions based on the neuronal Cl- driving force. Established theories regarding the determinants of Cl- driving force have recently been questioned. Here we present biophysical models of Cl- homeostasis using the pump-leak model. Using novel numerical and analytic solutions, we demonstrate that the Na+/K+ ATPase, ion conductances, impermeant anions, electrodiffusion, water fluxes and cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs) play roles in setting the Cl- driving force. We show that impermeant anions have a negligible effect on the driving force for Cl- either locally or cell-wide. While impermeant anions can contribute to setting the intracellular Cl- concentration in neurons, they can only affect Cl- driving force by modifying the activity of active transport mechanisms (i.e. the Na+/K+ ATPase). In contrast, we demonstrate that CCCs are well-suited for modulating Cl- driving force and hence inhibitory signaling in neurons.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Tetsuhiro S. Hatakeyama, Chikara Furusawa&lt;/p&gt;

To uncover the processes and mechanisms of cellular physiology, it first necessary to gain an understanding of the underlying metabolic dynamics. Recent studies using a constraint-based approach succeeded in predicting the steady states of cellular metabolic systems by utilizing conserved quantities in the metabolic networks such as carriers such as ATP/ADP as an energy carrier or NADH/NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; as a hydrogen carrier. Although such conservation quantities restrict not only the steady state but also the dynamics themselves, the latter aspect has not yet been completely understood. Here, to study the dynamics of metabolic systems, we propose adopting a carrier cycling cascade (CCC), which includes the dynamics of both substrates and carriers, a commonly observed motif in metabolic systems such as the glycolytic and fermentation pathways. We demonstrate that the conservation laws lead to the jamming of the flux and feedback. The CCC can show slow relaxation, with a longer timescale than that of elementary reactions, and is accompanied by both robustness against small environmental fluctuations and responsiveness against large environmental changes. Moreover, the CCC demonstrates robustness against internal fluctuations due to the feedback based on the moiety conservation. We identified the key parameters underlying the robustness of this model against external and internal fluctuations and estimated it in several metabolic systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LDEILmhSyzM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Theory of Mind (ToM), i.e. the ability to understand others' mental states, endows humans with highly adaptive social skills such as teaching or deceiving. Candidate evolutionary explanations have been proposed for the unique sophistication of human ToM among primates. For example, the &lt;i&gt;Machiavellian intelligence hypothesis&lt;/i&gt; states that the increasing complexity of social networks may have induced a demand for sophisticated ToM. This type of scenario ignores neurocognitive constraints that may eventually be crucial limiting factors for ToM evolution. In contradistinction, the &lt;i&gt;cognitive scaffolding hypothesis&lt;/i&gt; asserts that a species' opportunity to develop sophisticated ToM is mostly determined by its general cognitive capacity (on which ToM is scaffolded). However, the actual relationships between ToM sophistication and either brain volume (a proxy for general cognitive capacity) or social group size (a proxy for social network complexity) are unclear. Here, we let 39 individuals sampled from seven non-human primate species (lemurs, macaques, mangabeys, orangutans, gorillas and chimpanzees) engage in simple dyadic games against artificial ToM players (&lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; a familiar human caregiver). Using computational analyses of primates' choice sequences, we found that the probability of exhibiting a ToM-compatible learning style is mainly driven by species' brain volume (rather than by social group size). Moreover, primates' social cognitive sophistication culminates in a precursor form of ToM, which still falls short of human fully-developed ToM abilities.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OruXehLZRCo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Functionally different chromatin domains display distinct chemical marks. Constitutive heterochromatin is commonly associated with trimethylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9me3), hypoacetylated histones, and DNA methylation, but the contributions of and interplay among these features are not fully understood. To dissect the establishment of heterochromatin, we investigated the relationships...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/NWBrhVYIJJY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Fast amortized inference of neural activity from calcium imaging data with variational autoencoders. (arXiv:1711.01846v1 [stat.ML])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01846</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Calcium imaging permits optical measurement of neural activity. Since
intracellular calcium concentration is an indirect measurement of neural
activity, computational tools are necessary to infer the true underlying
spiking activity from fluorescence measurements. Bayesian model inversion can
be used to solve this problem, but typically requires either computationally
expensive MCMC sampling, or faster but approximate maximum-a-posteriori
optimization. Here, we introduce a flexible algorithmic framework for fast,
efficient and accurate extraction of neural spikes from imaging data. Using the
framework of variational autoencoders, we propose to amortize inference by
training a deep neural network to perform model inversion efficiently. The
recognition network is trained to produce samples from the posterior
distribution over spike trains. Once trained, performing inference amounts to a
fast single forward pass through the network, without the need for iterative
optimization or sampling. We show that amortization can be applied flexibly to
a wide range of nonlinear generative models and significantly improves upon the
state of the art in computation time, while achieving competitive accuracy. Our
framework is also able to represent posterior distributions over spike-trains.
We demonstrate the generality of our method by proposing the first
probabilistic approach for separating backpropagating action potentials from
putative synaptic inputs in calcium imaging of dendritic spines.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding mind-brain-environment relations is one of the key topics in
psychology. Kurt Lewin, inspired by theoretical physics, tried to establish
topological and vector psychology analyzing patterns of interaction between the
individual and her/his environment. The time is ripe to reformulate his
ambitious goals, searching for ways to interpret objectively measured brain
processes in terms of suitable psychological constructs. Connecting cognitive
and social psychology constructs to neurophenomics, as it is done now in
psychiatry, should ground them in physical reality.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Mutual Information in Frequency and its Application to Measure Cross-Frequency Coupling in Epilepsy. (arXiv:1711.01629v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01629</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01629</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We define a novel metric, mutual information in frequency (MI-in-frequency),
to detect and quantify the statistical dependence between different frequency
components in the data and apply it to electrophysiological recordings from the
brain to infer cross-frequency coupling. The current metrics used to quantify
the cross-frequency coupling in neuroscience cannot detect statistical
independence in frequency between nonlinear recordings. Our MI-in-frequency
metric, based on Shannon's mutual information between the Cram\'{e}r's
representation of stochastic processes, overcomes this shortcoming. We describe
two data-driven estimators of MI-in-frequency: one based on kernel density
estimation and the other based on the nearest neighbor algorithm and validate
their performance on linear and nonlinear models. We then use MI-in-frequency
to estimate mutual information between two data streams that are dependent
across time, without making parametric model assumptions. Finally, we use the
MI-in-frequency metric to investigate the cross-frequency coupling in seizure
onset zone from electrocorticographic recordings during seizures. The inferred
cross-frequency coupling characteristics are essential to optimize the spatial
and spectral parameters of electrical stimulation based treatments of epilepsy.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper introduces a class of stochastic models of interacting neurons
with emergent dynamics similar to those seen in local cortical populations, and
compares them to very simple reduced models driven by the same mean excitatory
and inhibitory currents. Discrepancies in firing rates between network and
reduced models were investigated, and mechanisms leading to these discrepancies
were identified. Chief among them is correlations in spiking, or partial
synchronization, working in concert with &quot;nonlinearities&quot; in the time evolution
of membrane potentials. Additionally, simple random walk models and their first
passage times were shown to reproduce well fluctuations in neuronal membrane
potentials and interspike times.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: What can neuronal populations tell us about cognition?. (arXiv:1711.01423v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, it is possible to record the activity of hundreds of cells at the
same time in behaving animals. However, these data are often treated and
analyzed as if they consisted of many independently recorded neurons. How can
neuronal populations be uniquely used to learn about cognition? We describe
recent work that shows that populations of simultaneously recorded neurons are
fundamental to understand the basis of decision-making, including processes
such as ongoing deliberations and decision confidence, which generally fall
outside the reach of single-cell analysis. Thus, neuronal population data allow
addressing novel questions, but they also come with so far unsolved challenges.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Multiplicative and additive modulation of neuronal tuning with population activity affects encoded information. (arXiv:1711.01421v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Numerous studies have shown that neuronal responses are modulated by stimulus
properties, and also by the state of the local network. However, little is
known about how activity fluctuations of neuronal populations modulate the
sensory tuning of cells and affect their encoded information. We found that
fluctuations in ongoing and stimulus-evoked population activity in primate
visual cortex modulate the tuning of neurons in a multiplicative and additive
manner. While distributed on a continuum, neurons with stronger multiplicative
effects tended to have less additive modulation, and vice versa. The
information encoded by multiplicatively-modulated neurons increased with
greater population activity, while that of additively-modulated neurons
decreased. These effects offset each other, so that population activity had
little effect on total information. Our results thus suggest that intrinsic
activity fluctuations may act as a &quot;traffic light&quot; that determines which subset
of neurons are most informative.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Base pair probability estimates improve the prediction accuracy of RNA non-canonical base pairs</title>

Prediction of RNA tertiary structure from sequence is an important problem, but generating accurate structure models for even short sequences remains difficult. Predictions of RNA tertiary structure tend to be least accurate in loop regions, where non-canonical pairs are important for determining the details of structure. Non-canonical pairs can be predicted using a knowledge-based model of structure that scores nucleotide cyclic motifs, or NCMs. In this work, a partition function algorithm is introduced that allows the estimation of base pairing probabilities for both canonical and non-canonical interactions. Pairs that are predicted to be probable are more likely to be found in the true structure than pairs of lower probability. Pair probability estimates can be further improved by predicting the structure conserved across multiple homologous sequences using the TurboFold algorithm. These pairing probabilities, used in concert with prior knowledge of the canonical secondary structure, allow accurate inference of non-canonical pairs, an important step towards accurate prediction of the full tertiary structure. Software to predict non-canonical base pairs and pairing probabilities is now provided as part of the RNAstructure software package.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/J5YsnnWYYZg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Allosteric modulation of cardiac myosin dynamics by omecamtiv mecarbil</title>

New promising avenues for the pharmacological treatment of skeletal and heart muscle diseases rely on direct sarcomeric modulators, which are molecules that can directly bind to sarcomeric proteins and either inhibit or enhance their activity. A recent breakthrough has been the discovery of the myosin activator omecamtiv mecarbil (OM), which has been shown to increase the power output of the cardiac muscle and is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of heart failure. While the overall effect of OM on the mechano-chemical cycle of myosin is to increase the fraction of myosin molecules in the sarcomere that are strongly bound to actin, the molecular basis of its action is still not completely clear. We present here a Molecular Dynamics study of the motor domain of human cardiac myosin bound to OM, where the effects of the drug on the dynamical properties of the protein are investigated for the first time with atomistic resolution. We found that OM has a double effect on myosin dynamics, inducing a) an increased coupling of the motions of the converter and lever arm subdomains to the rest of the protein and b) a rewiring of the network of dynamic correlations, which produces preferential communication pathways between the OM binding site and distant functional regions. The location of the residues responsible for these effects suggests possible strategies for the future development of improved drugs and the targeting of specific cardiomyopathy-related mutations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9Z_oilE7eOc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Insight into glucocorticoid receptor signalling through interactome model analysis</title>

Glucocorticoid hormones (GCs) are used to treat a variety of diseases because of their potent anti-inflammatory effect and their ability to induce apoptosis in lymphoid malignancies through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Despite ongoing research, high glucocorticoid efficacy and widespread usage in medicine, resistance, disease relapse and toxicity remain factors that need addressing. Understanding the mechanisms of glucocorticoid signalling and how resistance may arise is highly important towards improving therapy. To gain insight into this we undertook a systems biology approach, aiming to generate a Boolean model of the glucocorticoid receptor protein interaction network that encapsulates functional relationships between the GR, its target genes or genes that target GR, and the interactions between the genes that interact with the GR. This model named GEB052 consists of 52 nodes representing genes or proteins, the model input (GC) and model outputs (cell death and inflammation), connected by 241 logical interactions of activation or inhibition. 323 changes in the relationships between model constituents following &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; knockouts were uncovered, and steady-state analysis followed by cell-based microarray genome-wide model validation led to an average of 57% correct predictions, which was taken further by assessment of model predictions against patient microarray data. Lastly, semi-quantitative model analysis via microarray data superimposed onto the model with a score flow algorithm has also been performed, which demonstrated significantly higher correct prediction ratios (average of 80%), and the model has been assessed as a predictive clinical tool using published patient microarray data. In summary we present an &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; simulation of the glucocorticoid receptor interaction network, linked to downstream biological processes that can be analysed to uncover relationships between GR and its interactants. Ultimately the model provides a platform for future development both by directing laboratory research and allowing for incorporation of further components, encapsulating more interactions/genes involved in glucocorticoid receptor signalling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OQTHoGXLIUY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

A number of neurological disorders arise from perturbations in biochemical signaling and protein complex formation within neurons. Normally, proteins form networks that when activated produce persistent changes in a synapse’s molecular composition. In hippocampal neurons, calcium ion (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) flux through N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors activates Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin signal transduction networks that either increase or decrease the strength of the neuronal synapse, phenomena known as long-term potentiation (LTP) or long-term depression (LTD), respectively. The calcium-sensor calmodulin (CaM) acts as a common activator of the networks responsible for both LTP and LTD. This is possible, in part, because CaM binding proteins are “tuned” to different Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; flux signals by their unique binding and activation dynamics. Computational modeling is used to describe the binding and activation dynamics of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/CaM signal transduction and can be used to guide focused experimental studies. Although CaM binds over 100 proteins, practical limitations cause many models to include only one or two CaM-activated proteins. In this work, we view Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/CaM as a limiting resource in the signal transduction pathway owing to its low abundance relative to its binding partners. With this view, we investigate the effect of competitive binding on the dynamics of CaM binding partner activation. Using an explicit model of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, CaM, and seven highly-expressed hippocampal CaM binding proteins, we find that competition for CaM binding serves as a tuning mechanism: the presence of competitors shifts and sharpens the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; frequency-dependence of CaM binding proteins. Notably, we find that simulated competition may be sufficient to recreate the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; frequency dependence of the CaM-dependent phosphatase calcineurin. Additionally, competition alone (without feedback mechanisms or spatial parameters) could replicate counter-intuitive experimental observations of decreased activation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/CaM-dependent protein kinase II in knockout models of neurogranin. We conclude that competitive tuning could be an important dynamic process underlying synaptic plasticity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/faxjg4QPtgI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Individual versus superensemble forecasts of seasonal influenza outbreaks in the United States</title>

Recent research has produced a number of methods for forecasting seasonal influenza outbreaks. However, differences among the predicted outcomes of competing forecast methods can limit their use in decision-making. Here, we present a method for reconciling these differences using Bayesian model averaging. We generated retrospective forecasts of peak timing, peak incidence, and total incidence for seasonal influenza outbreaks in 48 states and 95 cities using 21 distinct forecast methods, and combined these individual forecasts to create weighted-average superensemble forecasts. We compared the relative performance of these individual and superensemble forecast methods by geographic location, timing of forecast, and influenza season. We find that, overall, the superensemble forecasts are more accurate than any individual forecast method and less prone to producing a poor forecast. Furthermore, we find that these advantages increase when the superensemble weights are stratified according to the characteristics of the forecast or geographic location. These findings indicate that different competing influenza prediction systems can be combined into a single more accurate forecast product for operational delivery in real time.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/18cFjFSdHnk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Conversely, there is increasing evidence that brain ischemia can cause cardiac dysfunction. The mechanisms underlying this neurogenic heart disease are incompletely understood. Although it is established that ischemic stroke is associated with cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial damage, elevated cardiac enzymes, and plasma catecholamines in the acute phase, nothing is known about the delayed consequences of ischemic stroke on cardiovascular function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Finally, animals were treated with metoprolol to evaluate a pharmacologic treatment option to prevent the development of heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Metoprolol treatment prevented the development of chronic cardiac dysfunction by decelerating extracellular cardiac remodeling and inhibiting sympathetic signaling relevant to chronic autonomic dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

If these results can be confirmed in a clinical setting, treating physicians should be attentive to clinical signs of heart failure in every patient after ischemic stroke. Therapeutically, the successful β-blockade with metoprolol in mice could also have future clinical implications. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Physiological Tremor Increases when Skeletal Muscle is Shortened: Implications for Fusimotor Control. (arXiv:1711.00928v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00928</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The involuntary force fluctuations associated with physiological (as distinct
from pathological) tremor are an unavoidable component of human motor control.
While the origins of the physiological tremor are known to depend on muscle
afferentation, it is possible that the mechanical properties of muscle-tendon
systems also affect its generation, amplification and maintenance. In this
paper, we investigated the dependence of physiological tremor during tonic,
isometric plantarflextion torque at 30% of maximum at three ankle angles. The
amplitude of physiological tremor increased as calf muscles shortened in
contrast to the stretch reflex whose amplitude decreases as muscle shortens. We
used a closed-loop simulation model of afferented muscle to explore the
mechanisms responsible for this behavior. We demonstrate that changing muscle
lengths does not suffice to explain our experimental findings. Rather, the
model consistently required the modulation of gamme-static fusimotor drive to
produce increases in physiological tremor with muscle shortening--while
successfully replicating the concomitant reduction in stretch reflex amplitude.
This need to control gamma-static fusimotor drive explicitly as a function of
muscle length has important implication. First, it permits the amplitudes of
physiological tremor and stretch reflex to be decoupled. Second, it postulates
neuromechanical interaction that require length-dependent gamma drive
modulation to be independent from alpha drive to the parent muscle. Lastly, it
suggests that physiological tremor can be used as a simple, non-invasive
measure of the afferent mechanisms underlying healthy motor function, and their
disruption in neurological conditions.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: mixOmics: An R package for ‘omics feature selection and multiple data integration</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005752</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Florian Rohart, Benoît Gautier, Amrit Singh, Kim-Anh Lê Cao&lt;/p&gt;

The advent of high throughput technologies has led to a wealth of publicly available ‘omics data coming from different sources, such as transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics. Combining such large-scale biological data sets can lead to the discovery of important biological insights, provided that relevant information can be extracted in a holistic manner. Current statistical approaches have been focusing on identifying small subsets of molecules (a ‘molecular signature’) to explain or predict biological conditions, but mainly for a single type of ‘omics. In addition, commonly used methods are univariate and consider each biological feature independently. We introduce mixOmics, an R package dedicated to the multivariate analysis of biological data sets with a specific focus on data exploration, dimension reduction and visualisation. By adopting a systems biology approach, the toolkit provides a wide range of methods that statistically integrate several data sets at once to probe relationships between heterogeneous ‘omics data sets. Our recent methods extend Projection to Latent Structure (PLS) models for discriminant analysis, for data integration across multiple ‘omics data or across independent studies, and for the identification of molecular signatures. We illustrate our latest mixOmics integrative frameworks for the multivariate analyses of ‘omics data available from the package.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IQCjHil1Mn0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This study examined the effect of passengers' active head-tilt and
eyes-open/closed conditions on the severity of motion sickness in the lateral
acceleration environment of cars. In the centrifugal head-tilt condition,
participants intentionally tilted their heads towards the centrifugal force,
whereas in the centripetal head-tilt condition, the participants tilted their
heads against the centrifugal acceleration. The eyes-open and eyes-closed cases
were investigated for each head-tilt condition. In the experimental runs, the
sickness rating in the centripetal head-tilt condition was significantly lower
than that in the centrifugal head-tilt condition. Moreover, the sickness rating
in the eyes-open condition was significantly lower than that in the eyes-closed
condition. The results suggest that an active head-tilt motion against the
centrifugal acceleration reduces the severity of motion sickness both in the
eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. They also demonstrate that the eyes-open
condition significantly reduces the motion sickness even when the head-tilt
strategy is used.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;It is known that car drivers tilt their head toward the center of a curve. In
addition, drivers are generally less susceptible to carsickness than are the
passengers. This paper uses a mathematical model to investigate the effect of
the head-tilt strategy on motion sickness. It is shown that tilting the head in
the centripetal direction reduces the estimated motion sickness incidence
(MSI), defined as the percentage of subjects who vomited. In addition, the head
movements of both drivers and passengers were measured in a real car. It is
also shown that the estimated MSI of the drivers is smaller than that of the
passengers. Experimental results presented in previous studies demonstrated
that the severity of motion sickness was reduced when passengers imitated the
head tilt of the driver. These results strongly suggest that the driver's head
tilt reduces motion sickness, and this can be understood as a subjective
vertical conflict.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Adaptive coordination of working-memory and reinforcement learning in non-human primates performing a trial-and-error problem solving task. (arXiv:1711.00698v1 [cs.AI])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Accumulating evidence suggest that human behavior in trial-and-error learning
tasks based on decisions between discrete actions may involve a combination of
reinforcement learning (RL) and working-memory (WM). While the understanding of
brain activity at stake in this type of tasks often involve the comparison with
non-human primate neurophysiological results, it is not clear whether monkeys
use similar combined RL and WM processes to solve these tasks. Here we analyzed
the behavior of five monkeys with computational models combining RL and WM. Our
model-based analysis approach enables to not only fit trial-by-trial choices
but also transient slowdowns in reaction times, indicative of WM use. We found
that the behavior of the five monkeys was better explained in terms of a
combination of RL and WM despite inter-individual differences. The same
coordination dynamics we used in a previous study in humans best explained the
behavior of some monkeys while the behavior of others showed the opposite
pattern, revealing a possible different dynamics of WM process. We further
analyzed different variants of the tested models to open a discussion on how
the long pretraining in these tasks may have favored particular coordination
dynamics between RL and WM. This points towards either inter-species
differences or protocol differences which could be further tested in humans.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A Rescorla-Wagner drift-diffusion model of conditioning and timing</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005796</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/jNQVNxYySUM/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by André Luzardo, Eduardo Alonso, Esther Mondragón&lt;/p&gt;

Computational models of classical conditioning have made significant contributions to the theoretic understanding of associative learning, yet they still struggle when the temporal aspects of conditioning are taken into account. Interval timing models have contributed a rich variety of time representations and provided accurate predictions for the timing of responses, but they usually have little to say about associative learning. In this article we present a unified model of conditioning and timing that is based on the influential Rescorla-Wagner conditioning model and the more recently developed Timing Drift-Diffusion model. We test the model by simulating 10 experimental phenomena and show that it can provide an adequate account for 8, and a partial account for the other 2. We argue that the model can account for more phenomena in the chosen set than these other similar in scope models: CSC-TD, MS-TD, Learning to Time and Modular Theory. A comparison and analysis of the mechanisms in these models is provided, with a focus on the types of time representation and associative learning rule used.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jNQVNxYySUM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25067-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increased tau was associated with poor outcome at 6 months after cardiac arrest (median = 38.5, interquartile range [IQR] = 5.7–245ng/l in poor vs median = 1.5, IQR = 0.7–2.4ng/l in good outcome, for tau at 72 hours, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). Tau improved prediction of poor outcome compared to using clinical information (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). Tau cutoffs had low false-positive rates (FPRs) for good outcome while retaining high sensitivity for poor outcome. For example, tau at 72 hours had FPR = 2% (95% CI = 1–4%) with sensitivity = 66% (95% CI = 61–70%). Tau had higher accuracy than serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE; the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.91 for tau vs 0.86 for NSE at 72 hours, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.00024). During follow-up (up to 956 days), tau was significantly associated with overall survival. The accuracy in predicting outcome by serum tau was equally high for patients randomized to 33 °C and 36 °C targeted temperature after cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25067-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serum tau is a promising novel biomarker for prediction of neurological outcome in patients with cardiac arrest. It may be significantly better than serum NSE, which is recommended in guidelines and currently used in clinical practice in several countries to predict outcome after cardiac arrest.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This paper examines the serious shortcomings that characterize the current taxonomy of post-comatose disorders of consciousness (DoC), and it provides guidelines for how an improved DoC taxonomy might be developed. In particular, it is argued that behavioural criteria for the application of DoC categories should be supplemented with brain-based criteria (e.g., information derived from EEG and fMRI), and that the categorical framework that currently characterizes DoC should be replaced by a more complex framework that better captures the performance of patients across a range of cognitive and behavioural tasks.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Effect of sensory and motor connectivity on hand function in pediatric hemiplegia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25080</guid>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25080-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tested the hypothesis that somatosensory system injury would more strongly affect movement than motor system injury in children with unilateral cerebral palsy (USCP). This hypothesis was based on how somatosensory and corticospinal circuits adapt to injury during development; whereas the motor system can maintain connections to the impaired hand from the uninjured hemisphere, this does not occur in the somatosensory system. As a corollary, cortical injury strongly impairs sensory function, so we hypothesized that cortical lesions would impair hand function more than subcortical lesions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25080-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-four children with unilateral cerebral palsy had physiological and anatomical measures of the motor and somatosensory systems and lesion classification. Motor physiology was performed with transcranial magnetic stimulation and somatosensory physiology with vibration-evoked electroencephalographic potentials. Tractography of the corticospinal tract and the medial lemniscus was performed with diffusion tensor imaging, and lesions were classified by magnetic resonance imaging. Anatomical and physiological results were correlated with measures of hand function using 2 independent statistical methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25080-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children with disruptions in the somatosensory connectivity and cortical lesions had the most severe upper extremity impairments, particularly somatosensory function. Motor system connectivity was significantly correlated with bimanual function, but not unimanual function or somatosensory function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25080-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both sensory and motor connectivity impact hand function in children with USCP. Somatosensory connectivity could be an important target for recovery of hand function in children with USCP. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>The striking diversity of cells in the nervous system has long inspired scientists to ask how the various cell types of the nervous system are generated, wired, and respond to each other to allow for the diverse and dynamic behaviors generated by the brain. Neuronal cell biology has been a cornerstone of Neuron since its inception in 1988 and was the focus of a previous special issue in 2003. Just as systems and cognitive neuroscience is flourishing with new technologies to manipulate and visualize neural circuits, molecular and cellular neuroscience is in a time of growth and rapid discovery.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Does smoking impact dopamine neuronal loss in de novo Parkinson disease?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25082</guid>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study analyzed data from dopamine transporter (DAT) positron emission tomographic scans of 282 male patients with de novo Parkinson disease to investigate whether smoking impacts striatal dopamine neuronal degeneration. Mean DAT activity in the posterior (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.016) and ventral putamen (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.028) was higher in 44 current smokers in comparison to 105 ex-smokers and 133 never-smokers. The severity of baseline motor deficits and the longitudinal increases in levodopa-equivalent doses during follow-up were similar among the 3 groups. These results suggest that current smoking, but not past smoking, protects dopamine neuronal degeneration in the sensorimotor striatum with no additional clinical benefits.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25079-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oral anticoagulation treatment (OAT) resumption is a therapeutic dilemma in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) care, particularly for lobar hemorrhages related to amyloid angiopathy. We sought to determine whether OAT resumption after ICH is associated with long-term outcome, accounting for ICH location (ie, lobar vs nonlobar).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25079-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We meta-analyzed individual patient data from: (1) the multicenter RETRACE study (n = 542), (2) a U.S.-based single-center ICH study (n = 261), and (3) the Ethnic/Racial Variations of Intracerebral Hemorrhage study (n = 209). We determined whether, within 1 year from ICH, OAT resumption was associated with: (1) mortality, (2) favorable functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale = 0–3), and (3) stroke incidence. We separately analyzed nonlobar and lobar ICH cases using propensity score matching and Cox regression models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25079-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We included 1,012 OAT-related ICH survivors (633 nonlobar and 379 lobar). Among nonlobar ICH survivors, 178/633 (28%) resumed OAT, whereas 86/379 (23%) lobar ICH survivors did. In multivariate analyses, OAT resumption after nonlobar ICH was associated with decreased mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.14–0.44, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) and improved functional outcome (HR = 4.22, 95% CI = 2.57–6.94, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). OAT resumption after lobar ICH was also associated with decreased mortality (HR = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.17–0.45, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) and favorable functional outcome (HR = 4.08, 95% CI = 2.48–6.72, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). Furthermore, OAT resumption was associated with decreased all-cause stroke incidence in both lobar and nonlobar ICH (both &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25079-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results suggest novel evidence of an association between OAT resumption and outcome following ICH, regardless of hematoma location. These findings support conducting randomized trials to explore risks and benefits of OAT resumption after ICH. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Traumatic brain injury in the prodromal period of Parkinson's disease: A large epidemiological study using medicare data</title>

We aimed to examine the time-to-TBI in PD patients in their prodromal period compared to population-based controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25074-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified 89,790 incident PD cases and 118,095 comparable controls aged &amp;gt; 65 years in 2009 using Medicare claims data. Using data from the preceding 5 years, we compared time-to-TBI in PD patients in their prodromal period to controls. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for TBI in a Cox regression, while adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, modified Charlson comorbidity index, smoking, and alcohol use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25074-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk of TBI was greater in PD patients in their prodromal period across all age and sex groups, with HRs consistently increasing with proximity to PD diagnosis. HRs ranged from 1.64 (95% CI, 1.52, 1.77) 5 years preceding diagnosis to 3.93 (95% CI, 3.74, 4.13) in the year before. The interaction between PD, TBI, and time was primarily observed for TBI attributed to falls. Motor dysfunction and cognitive impairment, suggested by corresponding International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes, partially mediated the PD-TBI association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25074-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a strong association between PD and a recent TBI in the prodromal period of PD. This association strengthens as PD diagnosis approaches and may be a result of undetected nonmotor and motor symptoms, but confirmation will be required.

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25070-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical and radiological data of 42 Italian patients with PML were analyzed. Patient's data are available until 12 months after PML diagnosis. PLEX and steroids treatment as time-dependent covariates were entered in: (1) a Cox model to investigate their impact on full-blown PML-IRIS latency; (2) an analysis of variance ANOVA to investigate their impact on IRIS duration; and (3) a linear mixed model to assess their impact on the longitudinal clinical course (measured by means of Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS]).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25070-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment with PLEX was not associated to PML-IRIS latency (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.05; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.92), but once IRIS emerged, its duration was significantly longer in patients who underwent PLEX (101 vs 54 days in PLEX&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and PLEX&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; patients; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.028). Receiving proST versus therST was not associated to IRIS latency (HR = 0.67; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.39) or duration (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.95). Patients who underwent proST had a significantly higher EDSS increase during PML (0.09 EDSS points per month; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.04) as compared to those who had therST.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25070-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study highlights that: (1) caution on the use of PLEX should be considered as the current data do not support a beneficial effect of PLEX and (2) caution on the early use of steroids is suggested because their prophylactic use to prevent full-blown PML-IRIS seems to negatively impact on the longitudinal disability course.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Maximum entropy methods for extracting the learned features of deep neural networks</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Alex Finnegan, Jun S. Song&lt;/p&gt;

New architectures of multilayer artificial neural networks and new methods for training them are rapidly revolutionizing the application of machine learning in diverse fields, including business, social science, physical sciences, and biology. Interpreting deep neural networks, however, currently remains elusive, and a critical challenge lies in understanding which meaningful features a network is actually learning. We present a general method for interpreting deep neural networks and extracting network-learned features from input data. We describe our algorithm in the context of biological sequence analysis. Our approach, based on ideas from statistical physics, samples from the maximum entropy distribution over possible sequences, anchored at an input sequence and subject to constraints implied by the empirical function learned by a network. Using our framework, we demonstrate that local transcription factor binding motifs can be identified from a network trained on ChIP-seq data and that nucleosome positioning signals are indeed learned by a network trained on chemical cleavage nucleosome maps. Imposing a further constraint on the maximum entropy distribution also allows us to probe whether a network is learning global sequence features, such as the high GC content in nucleosome-rich regions. This work thus provides valuable mathematical tools for interpreting and extracting learned features from feed-forward neural networks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MhCI5bHA8f8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Concerted regulation of npc2 binding to endosomal/lysosomal membranes by bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate and sphingomyelin</title>

Niemann-Pick Protein C2 (npc2) is a small soluble protein critical for cholesterol transport within and from the lysosome and the late endosome. Intriguingly, npc2-mediated cholesterol transport has been shown to be modulated by lipids, yet the molecular mechanism of npc2-membrane interactions has remained elusive. Here, based on an extensive set of atomistic simulations and free energy calculations, we clarify the mechanism and energetics of npc2-membrane binding and characterize the roles of physiologically relevant key lipids associated with the binding process. Our results capture in atomistic detail two competitively favorable membrane binding orientations of npc2 with a low interconversion barrier. The first binding mode (&lt;i&gt;Prone&lt;/i&gt;) places the cholesterol binding pocket in direct contact with the membrane and is characterized by membrane insertion of a loop (V59-M60-G61-I62-P63-V64-P65). This mode is associated with cholesterol uptake and release. On the other hand, the second mode (&lt;i&gt;Supine&lt;/i&gt;) places the cholesterol binding pocket away from the membrane surface, but has overall higher membrane binding affinity. We determined that bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (bmp) is specifically required for strong membrane binding in &lt;i&gt;Prone mode&lt;/i&gt;, and that it cannot be substituted by other anionic lipids. Meanwhile, sphingomyelin counteracts bmp by hindering &lt;i&gt;Prone mode&lt;/i&gt; without affecting &lt;i&gt;Supine mode&lt;/i&gt;. Our results provide concrete evidence that lipids modulate npc2-mediated cholesterol transport either by favoring or disfavoring &lt;i&gt;Prone mode&lt;/i&gt; and that they impose this by modulating the accessibility of bmp for interacting with npc2. Overall, we provide a mechanism by which npc2-mediated cholesterol transport is controlled by the membrane composition and how npc2-lipid interactions can regulate the transport rate.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TGPq0WeeVRQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Blood flow and mechanical forces in the ventricle are implicated in cardiac development and trabeculation. However, the mechanisms of mechanotransduction remain elusive. This is due in part to the challenges associated with accurately quantifying mechanical forces in the developing heart. We present a novel computational framework to simulate cardiac hemodynamics in developing zebrafish embryos by coupling 4-D light sheet imaging with a stabilized finite element flow solver, and extract time-dependent mechanical stimuli data. We employ deformable image registration methods to segment the motion of the ventricle from high resolution 4-D light sheet image data. This results in a robust and efficient workflow, as segmentation need only be performed at one cardiac phase, while wall position in the other cardiac phases is found by image registration. Ventricular hemodynamics are then quantified by numerically solving the Navier-Stokes equations in the moving wall domain with our validated flow solver. We demonstrate the applicability of the workflow in wild type zebrafish and three treated fish types that disrupt trabeculation: (a) chemical treatment using AG1478, an &lt;i&gt;ErbB2&lt;/i&gt; signaling inhibitor that inhibits proliferation and differentiation of cardiac trabeculation; (b) injection of &lt;i&gt;gata1a morpholino oligomer&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;gata1aMO&lt;/i&gt;) suppressing hematopoiesis and resulting in attenuated trabeculation; (c) &lt;i&gt;weak-atrium&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;m58&lt;/sup&gt; mutant (&lt;i&gt;wea&lt;/i&gt;) with inhibited atrial contraction leading to a highly undeveloped ventricle and poor cardiac function. Our simulations reveal elevated wall shear stress (WSS) in wild type and AG1478 compared to &lt;i&gt;gata1aMO&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;wea&lt;/i&gt;. High oscillatory shear index (OSI) in the grooves between trabeculae, compared to lower values on the ridges, in the wild type suggest oscillatory forces as a possible regulatory mechanism of cardiac trabeculation development. The framework has broad applicability for future cardiac developmental studies focused on quantitatively investigating the role of hemodynamic forces and mechanotransduction during morphogenesis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/s3JXVOr7ED4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A mechanistic spatio-temporal framework for modelling individual-to-individual transmission—With an application to the 2014-2015 West Africa Ebola outbreak</title>

In recent years there has been growing availability of individual-level spatio-temporal disease data, particularly due to the use of modern communicating devices with GPS tracking functionality. These detailed data have been proven useful for inferring disease transmission to a more refined level than previously. However, there remains a lack of statistically sound frameworks to model the underlying transmission dynamic in a mechanistic manner. Such a development is particularly crucial for enabling a general epidemic predictive framework at the individual level. In this paper we propose a new statistical framework for mechanistically modelling individual-to-individual disease transmission in a landscape with heterogeneous population density. Our methodology is first tested using simulated datasets, validating our inferential machinery. The methodology is subsequently applied to data that describes a regional Ebola outbreak in Western Africa (2014-2015). Our results show that the methods are able to obtain estimates of key epidemiological parameters that are broadly consistent with the literature, while revealing a significantly shorter distance of transmission. More importantly, in contrast to existing approaches, we are able to perform a more general model prediction that takes into account the susceptible population. Finally, our results show that, given reasonable scenarios, the framework can be an effective surrogate for susceptible-explicit individual models which are often computationally challenging.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/379_g33xDYY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>The brain has the ability to sense, coordinate, and respond to environmental changes through biological processes involving activity-dependent gene expression. cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB)-regulated transcription coactivators (CRTCs) have recently emerged as novel transcriptional regulators of essential biological functions, while their deregulation is linked to age-related human diseases. In the brain, CRTCs are unique signaling factors that act as sensors and integrators of hormonal, metabolic, and neural signals contributing to brain plasticity and brain–body communication.</description>

Orientation preference maps (OPMs) are present in carnivores (such as cats and ferrets) and primates but are absent in rodents. In this study we investigate the possible link between astrocyte arbors and presence of OPMs. We simulate the development of orientation maps with varying hypercolumn widths using a variant of the Laterally Interconnected Synergetically Self-Organizing Map (LISSOM) model, the Gain Control Adaptive Laterally connected (GCAL) model, with an additional layer simulating astrocytic activation. The synaptic activity of V1 neurons is given as input to the astrocyte layer. The activity of this astrocyte layer is now used to modulate bidirectional plasticity of lateral excitatory connections in the V1 layer. By simply varying the radius of the astrocytes, the extent of lateral excitatory neuronal connections can be manipulated. An increase in the radius of lateral excitatory connections subsequently increases the size of a single hypercolumn in the OPM. When these lateral excitatory connections become small enough the OPM disappears and a salt-and-pepper organization emerges.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Qa6CliFsDxQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Noise is a prevalent and sometimes even dominant aspect of many biological processes. While many natural systems have adapted to attenuate or even usefully integrate noise, the variability it introduces often still delimits the achievable precision across biological functions. This is particularly so for visual phototransduction, the process responsible for converting photons of light into usable electrical signals (quantum bumps). Here, randomness of both the photon inputs (regarded as extrinsic noise) and the conversion process (intrinsic noise) are seen as two distinct, independent and significant limitations on visual reliability. Past research has attempted to quantify the relative effects of these noise sources by using approximate methods that do not fully account for the discrete, point process and time ordered nature of the problem. As a result the conclusions drawn from these different approaches have led to inconsistent expositions of phototransduction noise performance.
This paper provides a fresh and complete analysis of the relative impact of intrinsic and extrinsic noise in invertebrate phototransduction using minimum mean squared error reconstruction techniques based on Bayesian point process (Snyder) filters. An integrate-fire based algorithm is developed to reliably estimate photon times from quantum bumps and Snyder filters are then used to causally estimate random light intensities both at the front and back end of the phototransduction cascade. Comparison of these estimates reveals that the dominant noise source transitions from extrinsic to intrinsic as light intensity increases. By extending the filtering techniques to account for delays, it is further found that among the intrinsic noise components, which include bump latency (mean delay and jitter) and shape (amplitude and width) variance, it is the mean delay that is critical to noise performance. As the timeliness of visual information is important for real-time action, this delay could potentially limit the speed at which invertebrates can respond to stimuli. Consequently, if one wants to increase visual fidelity, reducing the photoconversion lag is much more important than improving the regularity of the electrical signal.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ArMoUPqphhA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Unified thalamic model generates multiple distinct oscillations with state-dependent entrainment by stimulation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Guoshi Li, Craig S. Henriquez, Flavio Fröhlich&lt;/p&gt;

The thalamus plays a critical role in the genesis of thalamocortical oscillations, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. To understand whether the isolated thalamus can generate multiple distinct oscillations, we developed a biophysical thalamic model to test the hypothesis that generation of and transition between distinct thalamic oscillations can be explained as a function of neuromodulation by acetylcholine (ACh) and norepinephrine (NE) and afferent synaptic excitation. Indeed, the model exhibited four distinct thalamic rhythms (delta, sleep spindle, alpha and gamma oscillations) that span the physiological states corresponding to different arousal levels from deep sleep to focused attention. Our simulation results indicate that generation of these distinct thalamic oscillations is a result of both intrinsic oscillatory cellular properties and specific network connectivity patterns. We then systematically varied the ACh/NE and input levels to generate a complete map of the different oscillatory states and their transitions. Lastly, we applied periodic stimulation to the thalamic network and found that entrainment of thalamic oscillations is highly state-dependent. Our results support the hypothesis that ACh/NE modulation and afferent excitation define thalamic oscillatory states and their response to brain stimulation. Our model proposes a broader and more central role of the thalamus in the genesis of multiple distinct thalamo-cortical rhythms than previously assumed.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jkr-v4uEYyk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Sleep loss causes profound cognitive impairments and increases the concentrations of adenosine and adenosine A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in specific regions of the brain. Time courses for performance impairment and recovery differ between acute and chronic sleep loss, but the physiological basis for these time courses is unknown. Adenosine has been implicated in pathways that generate sleepiness and cognitive impairments, but existing mathematical models of sleep and cognitive performance do not explicitly include adenosine. Here, we developed a novel receptor-ligand model of the adenosine system to test the hypothesis that changes in both adenosine and A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor concentrations can capture changes in cognitive performance during acute sleep deprivation (one prolonged wake episode), chronic sleep restriction (multiple nights with insufficient sleep), and subsequent recovery. Parameter values were estimated using biochemical data and reaction time performance on the psychomotor vigilance test (PVT). The model closely fit group-average PVT data during acute sleep deprivation, chronic sleep restriction, and recovery. We tested the model’s ability to reproduce timing and duration of sleep in a separate experiment where individuals were permitted to sleep for up to 14 hours per day for 28 days. The model accurately reproduced these data, and also correctly predicted the possible emergence of a split sleep pattern (two distinct sleep episodes) under these experimental conditions. Our findings provide a physiologically plausible explanation for observed changes in cognitive performance and sleep during sleep loss and recovery, as well as a new approach for predicting sleep and cognitive performance under planned schedules.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MU1tBjfUi9Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease driving inflammatory and degenerative processes that damage the central nervous system (CNS). However, it is not well understood how these events interact and evolve to evoke such a highly dynamic and heterogeneous disease. We established a hypothesis whereby the variability in the course of MS is driven by the very same pathogenic mechanisms responsible for the disease, the autoimmune attack on the CNS that leads to chronic inflammation, neuroaxonal degeneration and remyelination. We propose that each of these processes acts more or less severely and at different times in each of the clinical subgroups. To test this hypothesis, we developed a mathematical model that was constrained by experimental data (the expanded disability status scale [EDSS] time series) obtained from a retrospective longitudinal cohort of 66 MS patients with a long-term follow-up (up to 20 years). Moreover, we validated this model in a second prospective cohort of 120 MS patients with a three-year follow-up, for which EDSS data and brain volume time series were available. The clinical heterogeneity in the datasets was reduced by grouping the EDSS time series using an unsupervised clustering analysis. We found that by adjusting certain parameters, albeit within their biological range, the mathematical model reproduced the different disease courses, supporting the dynamic CNS damage hypothesis to explain MS heterogeneity. Our analysis suggests that the irreversible axon degeneration produced in the early stages of progressive MS is mainly due to the higher rate of myelinated axon degeneration, coupled to the lower capacity for remyelination. However, and in agreement with recent pathological studies, degeneration of chronically demyelinated axons is not a key feature that distinguishes this phenotype. Moreover, the model reveals that lower rates of axon degeneration and more rapid remyelination make relapsing MS more resilient than the progressive subtype. Therefore, our results support the hypothesis of a common pathogenesis for the different MS subtypes, even in the presence of genetic and environmental heterogeneity. Hence, MS can be considered as a single disease in which specific dynamics can provoke a variety of clinical outcomes in different patient groups. These results have important implications for the design of therapeutic interventions for MS at different stages of the disease.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Lq5z41rWIc4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25069-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA or Sanfilippo disease type A is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder presenting in early childhood, caused by an inherited deficiency of the lysosomal hydrolase sulfamidase. New missense mutations, for which genotype–phenotype correlations are currently unknown, are frequently reported, hampering early prediction of phenotypic severity and efficacy assessment of new disease-modifying treatments. We aimed to design a method to determine phenotypic severity early in the disease course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25069-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty-three patients were included for whom skin fibroblasts and data on disease course and mutation analysis were available. Patients were phenotypically characterized on clinical data as rapidly progressing or slowly progressing. Sulfamidase activity was measured in fibroblasts cultured at 37 °C and at 30 °C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25069-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sulfamidase activity in fibroblasts from patients homozygous or compound heterozygous for a combination of known severe mutations remained below the limit of quantification under both culture conditions. In contrast, sulfamidase activity in fibroblasts from patients homozygous or compound heterozygous for a known mild mutation increased above the limit of quantification when cultured at 30 °C. With division on the basis of the patients' phenotype, fibroblasts from slowly progressing patients could be separated from rapidly progressing patients by increase in sulfamidase activity when cultured at 30 °C (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001, sensitivity = 96%, specificity = 93%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25069-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phenotypic severity strongly correlates with the potential to increase sulfamidase activity in fibroblasts cultured at 30 °C, allowing reliable distinction between patients with rapidly progressing or slowly progressing phenotypes. This method may provide an essential tool for assessment of treatment effects and for health care and life planning decisions. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25068-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty-six patients diagnosed with MS based on the 2010 McDonald criteria (34 with the relapsing–remitting form, 2 with clinically isolated syndrome) with and without disease-modifying treatment were compared to 35 healthy age-/sex-matched volunteers. All patients underwent detailed neurological and electrophysiological examinations. Three Tesla MRN with large anatomical coverage of both legs and the lumbosacral plexus was performed by using 2-dimensional (2D) fat-saturated, T2-weighted (T2w) and dual echo turbo spin echo sequences as well as a 3D T2-weighted, fat-saturated SPACE sequence. Besides qualitative visual nerve assessment, a T2w signal quantification was performed by calculation of proton spin density and T2 relaxation time. Nerve diameter was measured as a morphometric criterion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25068-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;T2w hyperintense nerve lesions were detectable in all MS patients, with a mean lesion number at thigh level of 151.5 ± 5.7 versus 19.1 ± 2.4 in controls (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). Nerve proton spin density was higher in MS (tibial/peroneal: 371.8 ± 7.7/368.9 ± 8.2) versus controls (tibial/peroneal: 266.0 ± 11.0/276.8 ± 9.7, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). In contrast, T2 relaxation time was significantly higher in controls (tibial/peroneal: 82.0 ± 2.1/78.3 ± 1.7) versus MS (tibial/peroneal: 64.3 ± 1.0/61.2 ± 0.9, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). Proximal tibial and peroneal nerve caliber was higher in MS (tibial: 52.4 ± 2.1mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, peroneal: 25.4 ± 1.3mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) versus controls (tibial: 45.2 ± 1.4mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0015; peroneal: 21.3 ± 0.7mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.0049).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25068-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peripheral nerve lesions could be visualized and quantified in MS in vivo by high-resolution MRN. Lesions are defined by an increase of proton spin density and a decrease of T2 relaxation time, indicating changes in the microstructural organization of the extracellular matrix in peripheral nerve tissue in MS. By showing involvement of the peripheral nervous system in MS, this proof-of-concept study may offer new insights into the pathophysiology and treatment of MS.

A subset of 329 individuals had fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET. We ascertained presently existing cardiovascular and metabolic conditions (CMC) from health care records and used the summation of presence/absence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and stroke as a surrogate for vascular health. We used global amyloid from Pittsburgh compound B PET, entorhinal cortex tau uptake (ERC-tau) from tau-PET, and neurodegeneration in AD signature regions from MRI and FDG-PET as surrogates for AD pathophysiology. We dichotomized participants into CMC = 0 (CMC&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) versus CMC &amp;gt; 0 (CMC&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and tested for age-adjusted group differences in AD biomarkers. Using structural equation models (SEMs), we assessed the impact of vascular health on AD biomarker cascade (amyloid leads to tau leads to neurodegeneration) after considering the direct and indirect age, sex, and apolipoprotein E effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25071-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;CMC&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; participants had significantly greater neurodegeneration than CMC&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; participants but did not differ by amyloid or ERC-tau. The SEMs showed that (1) vascular health had a significant direct and indirect impact on neurodegeneration but not on amyloid; and (2) vascular health, specifically the presence of hyperlipidemia, had a significant direct impact on ERC-tau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Longitudinal studies are warranted to clarify the relationship between tau deposition and vascular health. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Previous studies have reported an association between human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-&lt;em&gt;DRB1&lt;/em&gt; and the risk of PD. There has also been growing interest in investigating whether inflammation-related genes interact with environmental factors such as smoking to influence PD risk. We performed a pooled analysis of the interaction between &lt;em&gt;HLA-DRB1&lt;/em&gt; and smoking in PD in 3 population-based case–control studies from Denmark and France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25065-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We included 2,056 cases and 2,723 controls from 3 PD studies (Denmark, France) that obtained information on smoking through interviews. Genotyping of the rs660895 polymorphism in the &lt;em&gt;HLA-DRB1&lt;/em&gt; region was based on saliva or blood DNA samples. To assess interactions, we used logistic regression with product terms between rs660895 and smoking. We performed random-effects meta-analysis of marginal associations and interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25065-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both carrying rs660895-G (AG vs AA: odds ratio [OR] = 0.81; GG vs AA: OR = 0.56; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-trend = 0.003) and ever smoking (OR = 0.56, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) were inversely associated with PD. A multiplicative interaction was observed between rs660895 and smoking using codominant, additive (interaction parameter = 1.37, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.005), and dominant (interaction parameter = 1.54, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001) genetic models without any heterogeneity (&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;² = 0.0%); the inverse association of rs660895-(AG+GG) with PD seen in never smokers (OR = 0.64, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) disappeared among ever smokers (OR = 1.00, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.99). Similar interactions were observed when we investigated light and heavy smokers separately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25065-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study provides the first evidence that smoking modifies the previously reported inverse association of rs660895-G with PD, and suggests that smoking and &lt;em&gt;HLA-DRB1&lt;/em&gt; are involved in common pathways, possibly related to neuroinflammation.

Similar neural mechanisms might be used to form ‘maps’ of nonphysical spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/OAUPMVGkuwg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Neuron: Entrainment of Arteriole Vasomotor Fluctuations by Neural Activity Is a Basis of Blood-Oxygenation-Level-Dependent “Resting-State” Connectivity</title>

	<description>In resting-state BOLD imaging, synchronous ultra-slow (∼0.1 Hz) oscillations in blood oxygenation between brain areas are interpreted as “functional” neuronal connections. Mateo et al. reveals a basis for this inference: neuronal activity entrains arteriole dilation that in turn drives oxygenation.</description>

	<description>Li et al. report a hierarchical process mediated by Neuroligin 2 and Slitrk3 for GABAergic synapse development. Neuroligin 2 also interacts with Slitrk3 to regulate GABAergic synaptogenesis. Selective perturbation of this interaction decreases GABAergic synaptic transmission and impairs hippocampal network activities.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Microglial dysfunction as a key pathologic change in adrenomyeloneuropathy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25085</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25085</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Mutations in ABCD1 cause the neurodegenerative disease adrenoleukodystrophy, which manifests as the spinal cord axonopathy adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) in nearly all males surviving into adulthood. Microglial dysfunction has long been implicated in pathogenesis of brain disease but its role in the spinal cord is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We assessed spinal cord microglia in humans and mice with AMN and investigated the role of ABCD1 in microglial activity toward neuronal phagocytosis in cell culture. As mutations in ABCD1 lead to incorporation of very long chain fatty acids into phospholipids, we separately examined the effects of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) upon microglia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Within the spinal cord of humans and mice with AMN, upregulation of several phagocytosis-related markers such as MFGE8 and TREM2 precedes complement activation and synapse loss. Unexpectedly, this occurs in the absence of overt inflammation. LPC C26:0 added to ABCD1-deficient microglia in culture further enhances MFGE8 expression, aggravates phagocytosis and leads to neuronal injury. Furthermore, exposure to a MFGE8 blocking antibody reduces phagocytic activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Spinal cord microglia lacking ABCD1 are primed for phagocytosis, affecting neurons within an altered metabolic milieu. Blocking phagocytosis or specific phagocytic receptors may alleviate synapse loss and axonal degeneration. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Stimulation of the mesencephalic locomotor region for gait recovery after stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25086</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: One-third of all stroke survivors are unable to walk, even after intensive physiotherapy. Thus, other concepts to restore walking are needed. Since electrical stimulation of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) is known to elicit gait movements, this area might be a promising target for restorative neurostimulation in stroke patients with gait disability. The present study aims to delineate the effect of high-frequency stimulation of the MLR (MLR-HFS) on gait impairment in a rodent stroke model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Male Wistar rats underwent photothrombotic stroke of the right sensorimotor cortex and chronic implantation of a stimulating electrode into the right MLR. Gait was assessed using clinical scoring of the beam walking test and videokinematic analysis (CatWalk™) at baseline and on days 3 and 4 after experimental stroke with and without MLR-HFS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Kinematic analysis revealed significant changes in several dynamic and static gait parameters resulting in overall reduced gait velocity. All rats exhibited major coordination deficits during the beam walking challenge and were unable to cross the beam. Simultaneous to the onset of MLR-HFS, a significantly higher walking speed and improvements in several dynamic gait parameters were detected by the Catwalk™-system. Rats regained the ability to cross the beam unassisted showing a reduced number of paw slips and misses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: MLR-HFS can improve disordered locomotor function in a rodent stroke model. It may act by shielding brainstem and spinal locomotor centers from abnormal cortical input after stroke, thus allowing for compensatory and independent action of these circuits.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Stereo-electroencephalography and surgical outcome in polymicrogyria-related epilepsy: A multi-centric study</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective&lt;/em&gt;: We aimed to 1) assess the concordance between various PMG types and the associated epileptogenic zone (EZ), as defined by stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG), and 2) determine the postsurgical seizure outcome in PMG-related drug-resistant epilepsy. &lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;: We retrospectively analyzed 58 cases: 49 had SEEG and 39 corticectomy or hemispherotomy. &lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;: Mean age at SEEG or surgery was 28.3 years (range 2-50). PMG was bilateral in 9 (16%) patients and unilateral in 49, including 17 (29%) unilobar, 12 (21%) multilobar, 15 (26%) perisylvian, and only 5 (9%) hemispheric. Twenty-eight (48%) patients additionally had schizencephaly, heterotopia or focal cortical dysplasia. The SEEG-determined EZ was fully concordant with the PMG in only 8 (16%) cases, partially concordant in 74% and discordant in 10%. The EZ included remote cortical areas in 21 (43%) cases and was primarily localized in those in 5 (10%), all related to the mesial temporal structures. All but one PMG patients with corticectomy or hemispherotomy had a unilateral PMG. At last follow-up (mean 4.6 years, range 1-16), 28 (72%) patients remained seizure free. Shorter epilepsy duration to surgery was an independent predictor of seizure freedom. &lt;em&gt;Interpretation&lt;/em&gt;: PMG-related drug-resistant epilepsy warrants a comprehensive presurgical evaluation, including SEEG investigations in most cases, since the EZ may only partially overlap with the PMG or include solely remote cortical areas. Seizure freedom is feasible in a large proportion of patients. PMG extent should not deter from exploring the possibility of epilepsy surgery. Our data support the early consideration of epilepsy surgery in this patient group. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>The brain changes as we age and these changes are associated with functional deterioration and neurodegenerative disease. It is vital that we better understand individual differences in the brain ageing process; hence, techniques for making individualised predictions of brain ageing have been developed. We present evidence supporting the use of neuroimaging-based ‘brain age’ as a biomarker of an individual’s brain health. Increasingly, research is showing how brain disease or poor physical health negatively impacts brain age.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Activation of planarian TRPA1 by reactive oxygen species reveals a conserved mechanism for animal nociception&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature Neuroscience, Published online: 16 October 2017; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-017-0005-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-017-0005-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animals must detect noxious stimuli to initiate protective behavior, but the evolutionary origin of nociceptive systems is poorly understood. The authors reveal a core function for TRPA1 in noxious heat transduction based on sensing H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ROS and demonstrate its conservation from planarians to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/ElW5YkvsSA0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Nature Neuroscience - Issue - nature.com science feeds: Thalamic inhibition regulates critical-period plasticity in visual cortex and thalamus</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thalamic inhibition regulates critical-period plasticity in visual cortex and thalamus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature Neuroscience, Published online: 16 October 2017; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-017-0002-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-017-0002-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The critical period of ocular dominance (OD) plasticity in the visual cortex is initiated by maturation of inhibition. The authors show that thalamic relay neurons in mouse dorsolateral geniculate nucleus also undergo OD plasticity. This process depends on thalamic inhibition and is required for consolidating the OD shift in visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/sWotsWoliwo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>
