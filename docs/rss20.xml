	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A model of cortical cognitive function using hierarchical interactions of gating matrices in internal agents coding relational representations. (arXiv:1809.08203v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08203</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08203</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Flexible cognition requires the ability to rapidly detect systematic
functions of variables and guide future behavior based on predictions. The
model described here proposes a potential framework for patterns of neural
activity to detect systematic functions and relations between components of
sensory input and apply them in a predictive manner. This model includes
multiple internal gating agents that operate within the state space of neural
activity, in analogy to external agents behaving in the external environment.
The multiple internal gating agents represent patterns of neural activity that
detect and gate patterns of matrix connectivity representing the relations
between different neural populations. The patterns of gating matrix
connectivity represent functions that can be used to predict future components
of a series of sensory inputs or the relationship between different features of
a static sensory stimulus. The model is applied to the prediction of dynamical
trajectories, the internal relationship between features of different sensory
stimuli and to the prediction of affine transformations that could be useful
for solving cognitive tasks such as the Ravens progressive matrices task.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Stochasticity from function - why the Bayesian brain may need no noise. (arXiv:1809.08045v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08045</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08045</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;An increasing body of evidence suggests that the trial-to-trial variability
of spiking activity in the brain is not mere noise, but rather the reflection
of a sampling-based encoding scheme for probabilistic computing. Since the
precise statistical properties of neural activity are important in this
context, many models assume an ad-hoc source of well-behaved, explicit noise,
either on the input or on the output side of single neuron dynamics, most often
assuming an independent Poisson process in either case. However, these
assumptions are somewhat problematic: neighboring neurons tend to share
receptive fields, rendering both their input and their output correlated; at
the same time, neurons are known to behave largely deterministically, as a
function of their membrane potential and conductance. We suggest that spiking
neural networks may, in fact, have no need for noise to perform sampling-based
Bayesian inference. We study analytically the effect of auto- and
cross-correlations in functionally Bayesian spiking networks and demonstrate
how their effect translates to synaptic interaction strengths, rendering them
controllable through synaptic plasticity. This allows even small ensembles of
interconnected deterministic spiking networks to simultaneously and
co-dependently shape their output activity through learning, enabling them to
perform complex Bayesian computation without any need for noise, which we
demonstrate in silico, both in classical simulation and in neuromorphic
emulation. These results close a gap between the abstract models and the
biology of functionally Bayesian spiking networks, effectively reducing the
architectural constraints imposed on physical neural substrates required to
perform probabilistic computing, be they biological or artificial.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Expression of Transcripts Selective for GABA Neuron Subpopulations across the Cortical Visuospatial Working Memory Network in the Healthy State and Schizophrenia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy227</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Visuospatial working memory (WM), which is impaired in schizophrenia, depends on a distributed network including visual, posterior parietal, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortical regions. Within each region, information processing is differentially regulated by subsets of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons that express parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SST), or vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). In schizophrenia, WM impairments have been associated with alterations of PV and SST neurons in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Here, we quantified transcripts selectively expressed in GABA neuron subsets across four cortical regions in the WM network from comparison and schizophrenia subjects. In comparison subjects, PV mRNA levels declined and SST mRNA levels increased from posterior to anterior regions, whereas VIP mRNA levels were comparable across regions except for the primary visual cortex (V1). In schizophrenia subjects, each transcript in PV and SST neurons exhibited similar alterations across all regions, whereas transcripts in VIP neurons were unaltered in any region except for V1. These findings suggest that the contribution of each GABA neuron subset to inhibitory regulation of local circuitry normally differs across cortical regions of the visuospatial WM network and that in schizophrenia alterations of PV and SST neurons are a shared feature across these regions, whereas VIP neurons are affected only in V1.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Endoglycan plays a role in axon guidance and neuronal migration by negatively regulating cell-cell adhesion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/425207v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/425207v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Cell migration and axon guidance are important steps in the formation of neural circuits. Both steps depend on the interactions between cell surface receptors and molecules on cells along the pathway. In addition to cell-cell adhesion, these molecular interactions provide guidance information. The fine-tuning of cell-cell adhesion is as an important aspect of cell migration, axon guidance, and synapse formation. Here, we show that Endoglycan, a sialomucin, plays a role in axon guidance and cell migration in the central nervous system. In the absence of Endoglycan, commissural axons failed to cross the midline of the spinal cord. In the developing cerebellum, a lack of Endoglycan prevented migration of Purkinje cells and resulted in a stunted growth of the cerebellar lobes. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that Endoglycan acts as a negative regulator of cell-cell adhesion in both commissural axon guidance and Purkinje cell migration.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Dynamics of contrast decrement and increment responses in human visual cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/425173v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/425173v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The goal of the present experiments was to determine whether electrophysiological response properties of the ON and OFF visual pathways observed in animal experimental models can be observed in human. Visual Evoked Potentials (VEPs) were recorded in response to equivalent magnitude contrast increments and decrements presented using sawtooth temporal waveforms at a temporal frequency of 2.73 Hz. VEP response waveforms and response spectra for incremental and decremental stimuli were analyzed as a function of stimulus size and visual field location in 68 healthy adult participants. VEP response were larger in amplitude and shorter in latency for contrast decrements than for contrast increments. The spatial tuning was narrower for contrast decrements than for contrast increments and responses were larger for displays that were scaled for cortical magnification. VEPs recorded at the scalp differ between contrast decrements and increments of equal Weber contrast in a fashion that parallels results from the early visual system of cats and monkeys. Because our assay allows differential detection of ON and OFF pathway activity in human, the approach may be useful in future work on disease detection and treatment monitoring.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Covariate Assisted Principal Regression for Covariance Matrix Outcomes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/425033v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/425033v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Modeling variances in data has been an important topic in many fields, including in financial and neuroimaging analysis. We consider the problem of regressing covariance matrices on a vector covariates, collected from each observational unit. The main aim is to uncover the variation in the covariance matrices across units that are explained by the covariates. This paper introduces Covariate Assisted Principal (CAP) regression, an optimization-based method for identifying the components predicted by (generalized) linear models of the covariates. We develop computationally efficient algorithms to jointly search the projection directions and regression coefficients, and we establish the asymptotic properties. Using extensive simulation studies, our method shows higher accuracy and robustness in coefficient estimation than competing methods. Applied to a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study, our approach identifies the human brain network changes associated with age and sex.</description>

	<description>One of the paramount challenges in neuroscience is to understand the dynamics of individual neurons and how they give rise to network dynamics when interconnected. Historically, researchers have resorted to graph theory, statistics, and statistical mechanics to describe the spatiotemporal structure of such network dynamics. Our novel approach employs tools from algebraic topology to characterize the global properties of network structure and dynamics. We propose a method based on persistent homology to automatically classify network dynamics using topological features of spaces built from various spike-train distances. We investigate the efficacy of our method by simulating activity in three small artificial neural networks with different sets of parameters, giving rise to dynamics that can be classified into four regimes. We then compute three measures of spike train similarity and use persistent homology to extract topological features that are fundamentally different from those used in traditional methods. Our results show that a machine learning classifier trained on these features can accurately predict the regime of the network it was trained on and also generalize to other networks that were not presented during training. Moreover, we demonstrate that using features extracted from multiple spike-train distances systematically improves the performance of our method.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Optimization of Energy State Transition Trajectory Supports the Development of Executive Function During Youth</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/424929v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Executive function develops rapidly during adolescence, and failures of executive function are associated with both risk-taking behaviors and psychopathology. However, it remains relatively unknown how structural brain networks mature during this critical period to facilitate energetically demanding transitions to activate the frontoparietal system, which is critical for executive function. In a sample of 946 human youths (ages 8-23 yr) who completed diffusion imaging as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopment Cohort, we capitalized upon recent advances in network control theory in order to calculate the control energy necessary to activate the frontoparietal system given the existing structural network topology. We found that the control energy required to activate the frontoparietal system declined with development. Moreover, we found that this control energy pattern contains sufficient information to make accurate predictions about individuals' brain maturity. Finally, the control energy costs of the cingulate cortex were negatively correlated with executive performance, and partially mediated the development of executive performance with age. These results could not be explained by changes in general network control properties or in network modularity. Taken together, our results reveal a mechanism by which structural networks develop during adolescence to facilitate the instantiation of activation states necessary for executive function.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: An Amyloid beta-derived Septapeptide has hMCP-1 Chemokine Activity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/424838v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/424838v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Septapeptides (&quot;septas&quot;), previously identified as meningitis-specific antigens, defined by a rubella virus (RV) monoclonal antibody, were found in human Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein (hMCP-1) and on the surface of meningitis-causing bacteria, viruses and spirochetes. Some bacterial septas were tested for Ca+2 mobilization through receptor-associated heterotrimeric G-protein binding on THP-1 cells, progenitor cells of circulating peripheral macrophages. Certain of the free septas acted on their own as mild agonist of Ca+2 mobilization. Their signal transduction activity may be mediated through a single, or a single class, of receptor, but the data do not link this with the MCP-1 receptor on THP-1 cells. These data support the proposals that (1) the septas represent muteins of the MCP-1 active site for stem cell activation to macrophages and (2) infectious organisms may conserve and employ these sequences in order to facilitate their transport through the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) to infect the Central Nervous System (CNS). Other MCP muteins have since been identified in the Alzheimer's Disease (AD)-associated agents, amyloid beta (Abeta) and prions, as well as in viruses like HIV, known to establish chronic infections in the CNS. Rat glial progenitor cells in tissue culture were used to test for hMCP-1 activity in septas derived from amyloid beta. Nanomolar concentrations of the amyloid beta septa 13HHQKLVF19 were found to transform more than 60% of the progenitor cells into microglia in tissue culture. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that amyloid beta may accumulate to increase the number of microglia available to combat chronic infection in the CNS. A new paradigm for neurodegenerative disease is presented.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A Sparse Unreliable Distributed Code Underlies the Limits of Behavioral Discrimination</title>

	<description>The cortical code that underlies perception must enable subjects to perceive the world at timescales relevant for behavior. We find that mice can integrate visual stimuli very quickly (&amp;lt;100 ms) to reach plateau performance in an orientation discrimination task. To define features of cortical activity that underlie performance at these timescales, we measured single unit responses in the mouse visual cortex at timescales relevant to this task. In contrast to high contrast stimuli of longer duration, which elicit reliable activity in individual neurons, stimuli at the threshold of perception elicit extremely sparse and unreliable responses in V1 such that the activity of individual neurons do not reliably report orientation. Integrating information across neurons, however, quickly improves performance. Using a linear decoding model, we estimate that integrating information over 50-100 neurons is sufficient to account for behavioral performance. Thus, at the limits of perception the visual system is able to integrate information across a relatively small number of highly unreliable single units to generate reliable behavior.</description>

	<description>Visual prostheses aim to restore vision to people blinded from degenerative photoreceptor diseases by electrically stimulating surviving neurons in the retina. However, a major challenge with epiretinal prostheses is that they may accidentally activate passing axon fibers, causing severe perceptual distortions. To investigate the effect of axonal stimulation on the retinal response, we developed a computational model of a small population of morphologically and biophysically detailed retinal ganglion cells, and simulated their response to epiretinal electrical stimulation. We found that activation thresholds of ganglion cell somas and axons varied systematically with both stimulus pulse duration and electrode-retina distance. These findings have important implications for the improvement of stimulus encoding methods for epiretinal prostheses.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Atypically larger variability of resource allocation accounts for visual working memory deficits in schizophrenia</title>

	<description>Atypical performance of people with schizophrenia (PSZ) in visual working memory (VWM) has long been attributed to decreased capacity compared with healthy control subjects (HCS). This notion, however, largely ignores the effects of other VWM components, such as precision, on behavioral performance. Here, we measured the performance of 60 PSZ and 61 HCS in a classical delay-estimation task and disentangled the contribution of various VWM components by thoroughly comparing several influential computational models of VWM. Surprisingly, none of the models suggest group differences in memory capacity and in memory resources across set size levels, two diagnostic features of VWM. Notably, we find that the model assuming variable precision (VP) across items and trials is the best model to explain the performance of both groups, indicating the two groups employ the qualitatively same internal process in VWM. According to the VP model, PSZ only exhibit abnormally larger variability of allocating memory resources rather than resources per se. These results directly challenge the widely accepted decreased-capacity theory and establish the first time to our knowledge that the elevated resource allocation variability is the major determinant of the atypical VWM behavior in schizophrenia. Finally, we show that individual differences in the resource allocation variability predict variation of symptom severity in PSZ, highlighting its functional relevance to schizophrenic pathology. Taken together, our findings provide a novel account for the VWM deficits in schizophrenia and shed a new light on the utility of generative computational models to characterize mechanisms of mental deficits in clinical neuroscience.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Stability of working memory in continuous attractor networks under the control of short-term plasticity</title>

	<description>Continuous attractor models of working-memory store continuous-valued information in continuous state-spaces, but are sensitive to noise processes that degrade memory retention. Short-term synaptic plasticity of recurrent synapses has previously been shown to affect continuous attractor systems: short-term facilitation can stabilize memory retention, while short-term depression possibly increases continuous attractor volatility. However, it currently remains unclear to which degree these two short-term plasticity mechanisms interact, what their combined quantitative effect on working memory stability is, and whether these effects persist in neuronal networks with spike-based transmission. Here, we present a comprehensive description of the effects of short-term plasticity on noise-induced memory degradation in one-dimensional continuous attractor models. Our theoretical description, applicable to spiking and rate-based models alike, accurately describes the slow dynamics of stored memory positions in separate processes of diffusion due to spiking variability and drift due to sparse connectivity and neuronal heterogeneity. We find that facilitation decreases both diffusion and directed drifts, while short-term depression tends to increase both. Using mutual information, we evaluate the combined impact of short-term facilitation and depression on the ability of networks to retain stable working memory. Finally, our theory establishes links to experiments: we are able to predict the sensitivity of continuous working memory to distractor inputs and place constraints on network and synapse properties necessary to implement stable working memory.</description>

	<description>Magnetic brain stimulation is a promising treatment in neurology and psychiatry, but clinical outcomes are variable. Unfortunately, mechanisms underlying magnetic stimulation effects are ill-defined, which impedes the development of stimulation protocols appropriate for different neurological conditions. Here we show, in vivo and ex vivo, that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation at low-intensity (LI-rTMS) induces axon outgrowth and synaptogenesis to repair a neural circuit. This repair depends on stimulation pattern, with complex patterns being particularly effective, and its mechanism requires the presence of cryptochrome (Cry), a putative magneto-receptor. Effective LI-rTMS patterns altered expression of Cry target genes known to promote neuronal repair. Because LI-rTMS generates electric fields too weak to depolarise neurons, these findings indicate that the magnetic field itself induces the repair. Our data open a new framework for magnetic stimulation - cryptochrome-mediated molecular and structural neuroplasticity. This information suggests new routes to treatments specific for each neurological disease.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Functional specialization is independent of microstructural variation in cerebellum but not in cerebral cortex</title>

	<description>The human brain is understood to follow fundamental principles linking form (such as microstructure and anatomical connectivity) to function (perceptual, motor, cognitive, emotional, and other processes). Most of this understanding is based on knowledge of the cerebral cortex, where functional specialization is thought to be closely linked to microstructural variation as well as anatomical connectivity. The Universal Cerebellar Transform (UCT) theory has posited that the cerebellum has a different form-function organization in which microstructure is uniform, and in which functional specialization is determined solely by anatomical connectivity with extracerebellar structures. All cerebellar functions may thus be subserved by a common microstructural - and hence computational - substrate. Here we tested this hypothesis by measuring microstructural variation and functional specialization as indexed by magnetic resonance imaging in 1003 healthy humans. Cerebral cortex exhibited the expected pattern of microstructure-function correlation, but functional specialization was independent of microstructural variation in the cerebellum. These findings support the idea that cerebellar functional specialization is not determined by microstructure, and hence that cerebellar functions may be computationally constant across domains.</description>

	<description>Achievements of near human-level performances in object recognition by deep neural networks (DNNs) have triggered a flood of comparative studies between the brain and DNNs. Using a DNN as a proxy for hierarchical visual representations, our recent study found that human brain activity patterns measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be decoded (translated) into DNN feature values given the same inputs. However, not all DNN features are equally decoded, indicating a gap between the DNN and human vision. Here, we present a dataset derived through the DNN feature decoding analyses including fMRI signals of five human subjects during image viewing, decoded feature values of DNNs (AlexNet and VGG19), and decoding accuracies of individual DNN features with their rankings. The decoding accuracies of individual features were highly correlated between subjects, suggesting the systematic differences between the brain and DNNs. We hope the present dataset will contribute to reveal the gap between the brain and DNNs and provide an opportunity to make use of the decoded features for further applications.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Novel regression methods for metacognition</title>

	<description>Metacognition is an important component in basic science and clinical psychology, often studied through complex, cognitive experiments. While Signal Detection Theory (SDT) provides a popular and pervasive framework for modelling responses from such experiments, a shortfall remains that it cannot in a straightforward manner account for the often complex designs. Additionally, SDT does not provide direct estimates of metacognitive ability. This latter shortcoming has recently been sought remedied by introduction of a measure for metacognitive sensitivity dubbed meta-d'. The need for a flexible regression model framework remains, however, which should also incorporate the new sensitivity measure. In the present paper, we argue that a straightforward extension of SDT is obtained by identifying the model with the proportional odds model, a widely implemented, ordinal regression technique. We go on to develop a formal statistical framework for metacognitive sensitivity by defining a model that combines standard SDT with meta-d' in a latent variable model. We show how this agrees with the literature on meta-d' and constitutes a practical framework for extending the model. We supply several teoretical considerations on the model, including closed-form approximate estimates of meta-d' and optimal weighing of response-specific meta-sensitivities. We discuss regression analysis as an application of the obtained model and illustrate our points through simulations. Lastly, we present R-software that implements the model. Our methods and their implementation extend the computational possibilities of SDT and meta-d' and are useful for theoretical and practical researchers of metacognition.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Modeling neuronal avalanches and long-range temporal correlations at the emergence of collective oscillations: continuously varying exponents mimic M/EEG results</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/423921v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/423921v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>We revisit the CROS (&quot;CRitical OScillations&quot;) model which was recently proposed as an attempt to reproduce both scale-invariant neuronal avalanches and long-range time correlations. With excitatory and inhibitory stochastic neurons locally connected in a two-dimensional disordered network, the model exhibits a transition from an active to an oscillating state. Precisely at the transition, the fluctuations of the network activity have detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) exponents close to one, and avalanches (defined as supra-threshold activity) have power law distributions of size and duration. By simulating larger system sizes, we show that, differently from previous results, the exponents governing the distributions of avalanche size and duration are not necessarily those of the mean-field directed percolation universality class (3/2 and 2, respectively). Instead, exponents obtained via a maximum-likelihood estimator vary continuously in a narrow region of parameter space. Around that critical region, moreover, the values of avalanche and DFA exponents display a spread with negative correlations, in qualitative agreement with the interindividual variability that was experimentally observed in M/EEG data.</description>

	<description>Understanding how populations of neurons represent and compute internal or external variables requires precise and objective metrics for tracing the individual spikes that belong to a given neuron. Despite recent progress in the development of accurate and fast spike sorting tools, the scarcity of ground truth data makes it difficult to settle on the best performing spike sorting algorithm. Besides, the use of different configurations of electrodes and ways to acquire signal (e.g. anesthetized, head fixed, freely behaving animal recordings, tetrode vs. silicone probes, etc.) makes it even harder to develop a universal spike sorting tool that will perform well without human intervention. Some of the prevalent problems in spike sorting are: units separating due to drift, clustering bursting cells, and dealing with nonstationarity in background noise. The last is particularly problematic in freely behaving animals where the noises from the electrophysiological activity of hundreds or thousands of neurons are intermixed with noise arising from movement artifacts. We address these problems by developing a new spike sorting tool that is based on a template matching algorithm. The spike waveform templates are used to perform normalized cross correlation (NCC) with an acquired signal for spike detection. The normalization addresses problems with drift, bursting, and nonstationarity of noise and provides normative scoring to compare different units in terms of cluster quality. Our spike sorting algorithm, D.sort, runs on the graphic processing unit (GPU) to accelerate computations. D.sort is a freely available software package (https://github.com/1804MB/Kvistiani-lab_Dsort).</description>

	<description>Vision starts with image formation at the retina, which contains diverse neuronal cell types that extract, process, and relay visual information to higher order processing centers in the brain. Though there has been steady progress in defining retinal cell types, very little is known about retinal development in humans, which starts well before birth. In this study, we performed transcriptomic profiling of developing human fetal retina from gestational weeks 12 to 27 using single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and used pseudotime analysis to reconstruct the developmental trajectories of retinogenesis. Our analysis reveals transcriptional programs driving differentiation down four different cell types and suggests that Muller glia (MG) can serve as embryonic progenitors in early retinal development. In addition, we also show that transcriptional differences separate retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) into distinct subtypes and use this information to reconstruct RPC developmental trajectories and cell fate. Our results support a hierarchical program of differentiation governing cell-type diversity in the developing human retina. In summary, our work details comprehensive molecular classification of retinal cells, reconstructs their relationships, and paves the way for future mechanistic studies on the impact of gene regulation upon human retinogenesis.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Effects of individuation and grouping on face representations in the visual cortex</title>

	<description>Top-down signals can influence our visual perception by providing guidance on information processing. Especially, top-down control between two basic frameworks, Individuation and grouping, is critical for information processing during face perception. Individuation of faces supports identity recognition while grouping subserves higher category level face perception such as race or gender. However, it still remains elusive how top-down dependent control between individuation and grouping affects cortical representations during face perception. Here we performed an fMRI experiment to investigate whether representations across early and high-level visual areas can be altered by top-down control between individuation and grouping process during face perception. Focusing on neural response patterns across the early visual cortex (EVC) and the face-selective area (the fusiform face area (FFA)), we found that the discriminability of individual faces from the response patterns was strong in the FFA but weak in the EVC during the individuation task whereas the EVC but not the FFA showed significant face discrimination during the grouping tasks. Thus, these findings suggest that the representation of face information across the early and high-level visual cortex is flexible depending on the top-down control of the perceptual framework between individuation and grouping.</description>

	<description>It is difficulty to estimate the mutual information between spike trains because established methods require more data than is usually available.Kozachenko-Leonenko estimators promise to solve this problem, but include a smoothing parameter which must be set. It is proposed here that the smoothing parameter can be selected by maximizing the estimated unbiased mutual information. This is tested on fictive data and shown to work very well.</description>

	<description>Alterations in the balance between prior expectations and sensory evidence may account for faulty perceptions and inferences leading to psychosis. However, uncertainties remain about the nature of altered prior expectations and the degree to which they vary with the emergence of psychosis. We explored how expectations arising at two different levels, cognitive and perceptual, influenced processing of sensory information and whether relative influences of higher and lower level priors differed across people with prodromal symptoms and those with psychotic illness. In two complementary auditory perception experiments, 91 participants (30 with first episode psychosis, 29 at clinical risk for psychosis, and 32 controls) were required to decipher a phoneme within ambiguous auditory input. Expectations were generated in two ways: an accompanying visual input of lip movements observed during auditory presentation, or through written presentation of a phoneme provided prior to auditory presentation. We determined how these different types of information shaped auditory perceptual experience, how this was altered across the prodromal and established phases of psychosis, and how this relates to cingulate glutamate levels assessed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The psychosis group relied more on high level cognitive priors compared to both healthy controls and those at clinical risk for psychosis, and more on low level perceptual priors than the clinical risk group. The risk group were marginally less reliant on low level perceptual priors than controls. The results are consistent with previous theory that influences of prior expectations in psychosis in perception differ according to level of prior and illness phase.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Condition-adaptive fused graphical lasso (CFGL): An adaptive procedure for inferring condition-specific gene co-expression network</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Yafei Lyu, Lingzhou Xue, Feipeng Zhang, Hillary Koch, Laura Saba, Katerina Kechris, Qunhua Li&lt;/p&gt;

Co-expression network analysis provides useful information for studying gene regulation in biological processes. Examining condition-specific patterns of co-expression can provide insights into the underlying cellular processes activated in a particular condition. One challenge in this type of analysis is that the sample sizes in each condition are usually small, making the statistical inference of co-expression patterns highly underpowered. A joint network construction that borrows information from related structures across conditions has the potential to improve the power of the analysis. One possible approach to constructing the co-expression network is to use the Gaussian graphical model. Though several methods are available for joint estimation of multiple graphical models, they do not fully account for the heterogeneity between samples and between co-expression patterns introduced by condition specificity. Here we develop the condition-adaptive fused graphical lasso (CFGL), a data-driven approach to incorporate condition specificity in the estimation of co-expression networks. We show that this method improves the accuracy with which networks are learned. The application of this method on a rat multi-tissue dataset and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer dataset provides interesting biological insights. In both analyses, we identify numerous modules enriched for Gene Ontology functions and observe that the modules that are upregulated in a particular condition are often involved in condition-specific activities. Interestingly, we observe that the genes strongly associated with survival time in the TCGA dataset are less likely to be network hubs, suggesting that genes associated with cancer progression are likely to govern specific functions or execute final biological functions in pathways, rather than regulating a large number of biological processes. Additionally, we observed that the tumor-specific hub genes tend to have few shared edges with normal tissue, revealing tumor-specific regulatory mechanism.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sYsvXJw3a1s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Cocaine Exposure Modulates Perineuronal Nets and Synaptic Excitability of Fast-spiking Interneurons in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;We previously reported that perineuronal nets (PNNs) are required for cocaine-associated memories. Perineuronal nets are extracellular matrix that primarily surrounds parvalbumin (PV)-containing, GABAergic fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Here we measured the impact of acute (1 day) or repeated (5 days) cocaine exposure on PNNs and PV cells within the prelimbic and infralimbic regions of the mPFC. Adult rats were exposed to 1 day or 5 days of cocaine and stained for PNNs (using &lt;i&gt;Wisteria floribunda&lt;/i&gt; agglutinin, WFA) and PV intensity 2 h or 24 h later. In the prelimbic and infralimbic PFC, PNN staining intensity decreased 2 hr after 1 day of cocaine but increased after 5 days of cocaine. Cocaine also produced changes in PV intensity, which generally lagged behind that of PNNs. In the prelimbic PFC, both 1 and 5 days of cocaine increased GAD65/67 puncta near PNN-surrounded PV cells, with an increase in the ratio of GAD65/67:VGluT1 puncta after 5 days of cocaine exposure. In the prelimbic PFC, slice electrophysiology studies in FSIs surrounded by PNNs revealed that both 1 and 5 days of cocaine reduced the number of action potentials 2 h later. Synaptic changes demonstrated that 5 d cocaine increased inhibition of FSIs, potentially reducing the inhibition of pyramidal neurons and contributing to their hyperexcitability during relapse behavior. These early and rapid responses to cocaine may alter network stability of PV FSIs that partially mediate the persistent and chronic nature of drug addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Parvalbumin-containing, FSIs control the inhibitory:excitatory balance in the adult CNS, and the majority of these are surrounded by PNNs. The mPFC is critical to relapse in cocaine addiction, yet few studies have focused on the impact of cocaine exposure on PV interneurons that profoundly control output of the mPFC. Our studies highlight the impact of cocaine on PV and PNN levels and intrinsic and synaptic properties of PNN-surrounded FSIs in the mPFC. These findings point to a key upstream mechanism by which FSIs may contribute to the consistently observed increase in mPFC excitatory output of pyramidal neurons that contribute to cocaine reinstatement, and they have broader implications for understanding how PNN-surrounded neurons may control aberrant learning processes involved in addiction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Systematic analysis of transmitter co-expression reveals organizing principles of local interneuron heterogeneity</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Broad neuronal classes are surprisingly heterogeneous across many parameters and sub-classes often exhibit partially overlapping traits including transmitter co-expression. However, the extent to which transmitter co-expression occurs in predictable, consistent patterns is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that pairwise co-expression of GABA and multiple neuropeptide families by olfactory local interneurons (LNs) of the moth &lt;i&gt;Manduca sexta&lt;/i&gt; is highly heterogeneous, with a single LN capable of expressing neuropeptides from at least four peptide families and few instances in which neuropeptides are consistently co-expressed. Using computational modeling, we demonstrate that observed co-expression patterns cannot be explained by independent probabilities of expression of each neuropeptide. Our analyses point to three organizing principles that once taken into consideration allow replication of overall co-expression structure: 1- peptidergic neurons are highly likely to -co-express GABA; 2- expression probability of Allatotropin depends upon Myoinhibitory peptide expression; 3- the all-or-none co-expression patterns of Tachykinin neurons with several other neuropeptides. For other peptide pairs, the presence of one peptide was not predictive of the presence of the other and co-expression probability could be replicated by independent probabilities. The stochastic nature of these co-expression patterns highlights the heterogeneity of transmitter content among LNs and argues against clear-cut definition of subpopulation types based on the presence of &lt;i&gt;single&lt;/i&gt; neuropeptides. Furthermore, the receptors for all neuropeptides and GABA were expressed within each population of principal neuron type in the AL. Thus, activation of any given LN results in a dynamic cocktail of modulators that have the potential to influence every level of olfactory processing within the AL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Understanding the functional roles of individual local interneurons (LNs) is complex because traits, like transmitter co-expression, are often partially overlapping across the population. Here, we find that single olfactory LNs co-express neuropeptides from at least four individual peptide families, and that GABA and neuropeptides are partially and heterogeneously co-expressed across the entire population. The stochastic nature of many observed co-expression patterns argues against clear-cut and exclusive definition of subpopulations based on the expression of &lt;i&gt;single&lt;/i&gt; neuropeptides. Overall, our results suggest that activation of any given LN causes the release of a variable combination of neuropeptides and GABA that, based on receptor expression, target the input, output and local processing stages of the olfactory coding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The unreasonable effectiveness of small neural ensembles in high-dimensional brain. (arXiv:1809.07656v1 [cs.AI])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07656</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07656</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite the widely-spread consensus on the brain complexity, sprouts of the
single neuron revolution emerged in neuroscience in the 1970s. They brought
many unexpected discoveries, including grandmother or concept cells and sparse
coding of information in the brain.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In machine learning for a long time, the famous curse of dimensionality
seemed to be an unsolvable problem. Nevertheless, the idea of the blessing of
dimensionality becomes gradually more and more popular. Ensembles of
non-interacting or weakly interacting simple units prove to be an effective
tool for solving essentially multidimensional problems. This approach is
especially useful for one-shot (non-iterative) correction of errors in large
legacy artificial intelligence systems.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These simplicity revolutions in the era of complexity have deep fundamental
reasons grounded in geometry of multidimensional data spaces. To explore and
understand these reasons we revisit the background ideas of statistical
physics. In the course of the 20th century they were developed into the
concentration of measure theory. New stochastic separation theorems reveal the
fine structure of the data clouds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We review and analyse biological, physical, and mathematical problems at the
core of the fundamental question: how can high-dimensional brain organise
reliable and fast learning in high-dimensional world of data by simple tools?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two critical applications are reviewed to exemplify the approach: one-shot
correction of errors in intellectual systems and emergence of static and
associative memories in ensembles of single neurons.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Dynamic Adaptive Computation: Tuning network states to task requirements. (arXiv:1809.07550v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07550</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07550</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural circuits are able to perform computations under very diverse
conditions and requirements. The required computations impose clear constraints
on their fine-tuning: a rapid and maximally informative response to stimuli in
general requires decorrelated baseline neural activity. Such network dynamics
is known as asynchronous-irregular. In contrast, spatio-temporal integration of
information requires maintenance and transfer of stimulus information over
extended time periods. This can be realized at criticality, a phase transition
where correlations, sensitivity and integration time diverge. Being able to
flexibly switch, or even combine the above properties in a task-dependent
manner would present a clear functional advantage. We propose that cortex
operates in a &quot;reverberating regime&quot; because it is particularly favorable for
ready adaptation of computational properties to context and task. This
reverberating regime enables cortical networks to interpolate between the
asynchronous-irregular and the critical state by small changes in effective
synaptic strength or excitation-inhibition ratio. These changes directly adapt
computational properties, including sensitivity, amplification, integration
time and correlation length within the local network. We review recent
converging evidence that cortex in vivo operates in the reverberating regime,
and that various cortical areas have adapted their integration times to
processing requirements. In addition, we propose that neuromodulation enables a
fine-tuning of the network, so that local circuits can either decorrelate or
integrate, and quench or maintain their input depending on task. We argue that
this task-dependent tuning, which we call &quot;dynamic adaptive computation&quot;,
presents a central organization principle of cortical networks and discuss
first experimental evidence.

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Concerted IL-25R and IL-4Rα signaling drive innate type 2 effector immunity for optimal helminth expulsion</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38269</link>
	<description>Interleukin 25 (IL-25) is a major 'alarmin' cytokine, capable of initiating and amplifying the type 2 immune response to helminth parasites. However its role in the later effector phase of clearing chronic infection remains unclear. The helminth &lt;i&gt;Heligmosomoides polygyrus&lt;/i&gt; establishes long-term infections in susceptible C57BL/6 mice, but is slowly expelled in BALB/c mice from day 14 onwards. We noted that IL-25R (&lt;i&gt;Il17rb&lt;/i&gt;)-deficient BALB/c mice were unable to expel parasites despite type 2 immune activation comparable to the wild-type. We then established that in C57BL/6 mice, IL-25 adminstered late in infection (days 14-17) drove immunity. Moreover when IL-25 and IL-4 were delivered to &lt;i&gt;Rag1&lt;/i&gt;-deficient mice, the combination resulted in near complete expulsion of the parasite, even following administration of an anti-CD90 antibody to deplete innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). Hence, effective anti-helminth immunity during chronic infection requires an innate effector cell population that is synergistically activated by the combination of IL-4Rα and IL-25R signaling.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/35316</link>
	<description>Hypoxia and ischemia are linked to oxidative stress, which can activate the oxidant-sensitive transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) channel in cerebral artery endothelial cells, leading to vasodilation. We hypothesized that TRPA1 channels in endothelial cells are activated by hypoxia-derived reactive oxygen species, leading to cerebral artery dilation and reduced ischemic damage. Using isolated cerebral arteries expressing a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; biosensor in endothelial cells, we show that 4-hydroxynonenal and hypoxia increased TRPA1 activity, detected as TRPA1 sparklets. TRPA1 activity during hypoxia was blocked by antioxidants and by TRPA1 antagonism. Hypoxia caused dilation of cerebral arteries, which was disrupted by antioxidants, TRPA1 blockade and by endothelial cell-specific &lt;i&gt;Trpa1&lt;/i&gt; deletion (&lt;i&gt;Trpa1 &lt;/i&gt;ecKO mice). Loss of TRPA1 channels in endothelial cells increased cerebral infarcts, whereas TRPA1 activation with cinnamaldehyde reduced infarct in wildtype, but not &lt;i&gt;Trpa1 &lt;/i&gt;ecKO, mice. These data suggest that endothelial TRPA1 channels are sensors of hypoxia leading to vasodilation, thereby reducing ischemic damage.</description>

One of the marvels of biology is the phenotypic plasticity of microorganisms. It allows them to maintain high growth rates across conditions. Studies suggest that cells can express metabolic enzymes at tuned concentrations through adjustment of gene expression. The associated transcription factors are often regulated by intracellular metabolites. Here we study metabolite-mediated regulation of metabolic-gene expression that maximises metabolic fluxes across conditions. We developed an adaptive control theory, &lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt;ORAC (for ‘Specific Flux (q) Optimization by Robust Adaptive Control’), and illustrate it with several examples of metabolic pathways. The key feature of the theory is that it does not require knowledge of the regulatory network, only of the metabolic part. We derive that maximal metabolic flux can be maintained in the face of varying &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; environmental parameters only if the number of transcription-factor binding metabolites is at least equal to &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. The controlling circuits appear to require simple biochemical kinetics. We conclude that microorganisms likely can achieve maximal rates in metabolic pathways, in the face of environmental changes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xhqkoxj5QT8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Models describing the process of stem-cell differentiation are plentiful, and may offer insights into the underlying mechanisms and experimentally observed behaviour. Waddington’s epigenetic landscape has been providing a conceptual framework for differentiation processes since its inception. It also allows, however, for detailed mathematical and quantitative analyses, as the landscape can, at least in principle, be related to mathematical models of dynamical systems. Here we focus on a set of dynamical systems features that are intimately linked to cell differentiation, by considering exemplar dynamical models that capture important aspects of stem cell differentiation dynamics. These models allow us to map the paths that cells take through gene expression space as they move from one fate to another, e.g. from a stem-cell to a more specialized cell type. Our analysis highlights the role of the transition state (TS) that separates distinct cell fates, and how the nature of the TS changes as the underlying landscape changes—change that can be induced by e.g. cellular signaling. We demonstrate that models for stem cell differentiation may be interpreted in terms of either a static or transitory landscape. For the static case the TS represents a particular transcriptional profile that all cells approach during differentiation. Alternatively, the TS may refer to the commonly observed period of heterogeneity as cells undergo stochastic transitions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/US819jwYZK0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Testing Selective Influence Directly Using Trackball Movement Tasks. (arXiv:1809.06899v1 [stat.AP])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Systems factorial technology (SFT; Townsend &amp;amp; Nozawa, 1995) is regarded as a
useful tool to diagnose if features (or dimensions) of the investigated
stimulus are processed in a parallel or serial fashion. In order to use SFT,
one has to assume the speed to process each feature is influenced by that
feature only, termed as selective influence (Sternberg, 1969). This assumption
is usually untestable as the processing time for a stimulus feature is not
observable. Stochastic dominance is traditionally used as an indirect evidence
for selective influence (e.g., Townsend &amp;amp; Fifi\'c, 2004). However, one should
keep in mind that selective influence may be violated even when stochastic
dominance holds. The current study proposes a trackball movement paradigm for a
direct test of selective influence. The participants were shown a reference
stimulus and a test stimulus simultaneously on a computer screen. They were
asked to use the trackball to adjust the test stimulus until it appeared to
match the position or shape of the reference stimulus. We recorded the reaction
time, the parameters defined the reference stimulus (denoted as \alpha and
\beta ), and the parameters defined the test stimulus (denoted as A and B). We
tested selective influence of \alpha and \beta on the amount of time to adjust
A and B through testing selective influence of \alpha and \beta on the values
of A and B using the linear feasibility test (Dzhafarov &amp;amp; Kujala, 2010). We
found that when the test was passed and stochastic dominance held, the inferred
architecture was as expected, which was further confirmed by the trajectory of
A and B observed in each trial. However, with stochastic dominance only SFT can
suggest a prohibited architecture. Our results indicate the proposed method is
more reliable for testing selective influence on the processing speed than
examining stochastic dominance only.

	<title>eLife: latest articles: UBE2G1 governs the destruction of cereblon neomorphic substrates</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.40958</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/40958</link>
	<description>The cereblon modulating agents (CMs) including lenalidomide, pomalidomide and CC-220 repurpose the Cul4-RBX1-DDB1-CRBN (CRL4&lt;sup&gt;CRBN&lt;/sup&gt;) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex to induce the degradation of specific neomorphic substrates via polyubiquitination in conjunction with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, which have until now remained elusive. Here we show that the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes UBE2G1 and UBE2D3 cooperatively promote the K48-linked polyubiquitination of CRL4&lt;sup&gt;CRBN&lt;/sup&gt; neomorphic substrates via a sequential ubiquitination mechanism. Blockade of UBE2G1 diminishes the ubiquitination and degradation of neomorphic substrates, and consequent antitumor activities elicited by all tested CMs. For example, UBE2G1 inactivation significantly attenuated the degradation of myeloma survival factors IKZF1 and IKZF3 induced by lenalidomide and pomalidomide, hence conferring drug resistance. UBE2G1-deficient myeloma cells, however, remained sensitive to a more potent IKZF1/3 degrader CC-220. Collectively, it will be of fundamental interest to explore if loss of UBE2G1 activity is linked to clinical resistance to drugs that hijack the CRL4&lt;sup&gt;CRBN&lt;/sup&gt; to eliminate disease-driving proteins.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Persistent coding of outcome-predictive cue features in the rat nucleus accumbens</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.37275</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37275</link>
	<description>The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is important for learning from feedback, and for biasing and invigorating behavior in response to cues that predict motivationally relevant outcomes. NAc encodes outcome-related cue features such as the magnitude and identity of reward. However, little is known about how features of cues themselves are encoded. We designed a decision making task where rats learned multiple sets of outcome-predictive cues, and recorded single-unit activity in the NAc during performance. We found that coding of cue identity and location occurred alongside coding of expected outcome. Furthermore, this coding persisted both during a delay period, after the rat made a decision and was waiting for an outcome, and after the outcome was revealed. Encoding of cue features in the NAc may enable contextual modulation of ongoing behavior, and provide an eligibility trace of outcome-predictive stimuli for updating stimulus-outcome associations to inform future behavior.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Ezrin enrichment on curved membranes requires a specific conformation or interaction with a curvature-sensitive partner</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.37262</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37262</link>
	<description>One challenge in cell biology is to decipher the biophysical mechanisms governing protein enrichment on curved membranes and the resulting membrane deformation. The ERM protein ezrin is abundant and associated with cellular membranes that are flat, positively or negatively curved. Using &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and cell biology approaches, we assess mechanisms of ezrin's enrichment on curved membranes. We evidence that wild-type ezrin (ezrinWT) and its phosphomimetic mutant T567D (ezrinTD) do not deform membranes but self-assemble anti-parallelly, zipping adjacent membranes. EzrinTD's specific conformation reduces intermolecular interactions, allows binding to actin filaments, which reduces membrane tethering, and promotes ezrin binding to positively-curved membranes. While neither ezrinTD nor ezrinWT senses negative curvature alone, we demonstrate that interacting with curvature-sensing I-BAR-domain proteins facilitates ezrin enrichment in negatively-curved membrane protrusions. Overall, our work demonstrates that ezrin can tether membranes, or be targeted to curved membranes, depending on conformations and interactions with actin and curvature-sensing binding partners.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37124</link>
	<description>Spiking activity of neurons engaged in learning and performing a task show complex spatiotemporal dynamics. While the output of recurrent network models can learn to perform various tasks, the possible range of recurrent dynamics that emerge after learning remains unknown. Here we show that modifying the recurrent connectivity with a recursive least squares algorithm provides sufficient flexibility for synaptic and spiking rate dynamics of spiking networks to produce a wide range of spatiotemporal activity. We apply the training method to learn arbitrary firing patterns, stabilize irregular spiking activity in a network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons respecting Dale's law, and reproduce the heterogeneous spiking rate patterns of cortical neurons engaged in motor planning and movement. We identify sufficient conditions for successful learning, characterize two types of learning errors, and assess the network capacity. Our findings show that synaptically-coupled recurrent spiking networks possess a vast computational capability that can support the diverse activity patterns in the brain.</description>

	<description>The earliest developmental origins of dysmorphologies are poorly understood in many congenital diseases. They often remain elusive because the first signs of genetic misregulation may initiate as subtle changes in gene expression, which are hard to detect and can be obscured later in development by secondary effects. Here, we develop a method to trace the origins of phenotypic abnormalities by accurately quantifying the 3D spatial distribution of gene expression domains in developing organs. By applying geometric morphometrics to 3D gene expression data obtained by Optical Projection Tomography, we determined that our approach is sensitive enough to find regulatory abnormalities that have never been detected previously. We identified subtle but significant differences in the gene expression of a downstream target of the &lt;i&gt;Fgfr2&lt;/i&gt; mutation that were associated with Apert syndrome, demonstrating that these mouse models can further our understanding of limb defects in the human condition. Our method can be applied to different organ systems and models to investigate the etiology of malformations.</description>

	<description>Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) can progress to malignant metastatic cancer, including an aggressive subtype known as spindle cell carcinoma (spSCC). spSCC formation involves epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), yet the molecular basis of this event remains unknown. The transcriptional co-activator YAP undergoes recurrent amplification in human SCC and overexpression of YAP drives SCC formation in mice. Here, we show that human spSCC tumours also feature strong nuclear localisation of YAP and overexpression of activated YAP (NLS-YAP-5SA) with Keratin-5 (K5-CreERt) is sufficient to induce rapid formation of both SCC and spSCC in mice. spSCC tumours arise at sites of epithelial scratch wounding, where tumour-initiating epithelial cells undergo EMT to generate spSCC. Expression of the EMT transcription factor ZEB1 arises upon wounding and is a defining characteristic of spSCC in mice and humans. Thus, the wound healing response synergises with YAP to drive metaplastic transformation of SCC to spSCC.</description>

The attenuation of either maintenance or plasticity leads to impaired circuit function and ultimately to neurodegenerative disorders. Over the last few years, significant discoveries of molecular mechanisms were made that mediate the formation and maintenance of axons. Here, we highlight intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms that ensure the health and survival of axons. We also briefly discuss examples of mutations associated with impaired axonal maintenance identified in specific neurological conditions. A better understanding of these mechanisms will therefore help to define targets for therapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Distinctive Structural and Molecular Features of Myelinated Inhibitory Axons in Human Neocortex</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Numerous types of inhibitory neurons sculpt the performance of human neocortical circuits, with each type exhibiting a constellation of subcellular phenotypic features in support of its specialized functions. Axonal myelination has been absent among the characteristics used to distinguish inhibitory neuron types; in fact, very little is known about myelinated inhibitory axons in human neocortex. Here, using array tomography to analyze samples of neurosurgically excised human neocortex, we show that inhibitory myelinated axons originate predominantly from parvalbumin-containing interneurons. Compared to myelinated excitatory axons, they have higher neurofilament and lower microtubule content, shorter nodes of Ranvier, and more myelin basic protein in their myelin sheath. Furthermore, these inhibitory axons have more mitochondria, likely to sustain the high energy demands of parvalbumin interneurons, as well as more 2’,3’-cyclic nucleotide 3’-phosphodiesterase, a protein enriched in the myelin cytoplasmic channels that are thought to facilitate the delivery of nutrients from ensheathing oligodendrocytes. Our results demonstrate that myelinated axons of parvalbumin inhibitory interneurons exhibit distinctive features that may support the specialized functions of this neuron type in human neocortical circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Numerous myelinated axons traverse the human neocortex, enabling fast and efficient signal transmission. Myelinated axons originate from both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, but their properties have rarely been studied in relation to parent neuron type. Here, we show that axons of inhibitory neurons have distinctive structural and molecular features that contrast with those of the majority of excitatory myelinated axons in human neocortex. These differences are likely to have important implications for neurological disorders that involve pathologies of myelinated axons. For example, the distinct molecular and structural organization of inhibitory and excitatory myelinated axons may underlie differences in their vulnerability in neurological disorders or to injuries, and may require different strategies for prevention and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Sniffing fast: paradoxical effects on odor concentration discrimination at the levels of olfactory bulb output and behavior</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;In awake mice, sniffing behavior is subject to complex contextual modulation. It has been hypothesized that variance in inhalation dynamics alters odor concentration profiles in the naris despite a constant environmental concentration. Using whole cell recordings in the olfactory bulb of awake mice, we directly demonstrate that rapid sniffing mimics the effect of odor concentration increase at the level of both mitral and tufted cell (MTC) firing rate responses and temporal responses. Paradoxically, we find that mice are capable of discriminating fine concentration differences within short timescales despite highly variable sniffing behavior. One way that the olfactory system could differentiate between a change in sniffing and a change in concentration would be to receive information about the inhalation parameters in parallel with information about the odor. We find that the sniff-driven activity of MTCs without odor input is informative of the kind of inhalation that just occurred, allowing rapid detection of a change in inhalation. Thus, a possible reason for sniff modulation of the early olfactory system may be to directly inform downstream centres of nasal flow dynamics, so that an inference can be made about environmental concentration independent of sniff variance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; One of the fundamental tasks of the brain is to represent the features of the environment in a stable way. In the olfactory system, it has been hypothesized that changing the way you sniff will alter the concentration of odor coming into the nasal passage, even though the environmental concentration has not changed. Here we show that indeed, the effect of faster sniffing on olfactory bulb responses is very similar to increasing odor concentration. Despite this, mice can easily tell the difference between a change in sniffing and a change in concentration in an olfactory task. To resolve this apparent discrepancy, we suggest and give evidence for ways in which olfactory bulb information about sniffing parameters may be utilised.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Morphological and Biophysical Determinants of the Intracellular and Extracellular Waveforms in Nigral Dopaminergic Neurons: A Computational Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/38/8295?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/38/8295?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Action potentials (APs) in nigral dopaminergic neurons often exhibit two separate components: the first reflecting spike initiation in the dendritically located axon initial segment (AIS) and the second the subsequent dendro-somatic spike. These components are separated by a &lt;i&gt;notch&lt;/i&gt; in the ascending phase of the somatic extracellular waveform and in the temporal derivative of the somatic intracellular waveform. Still, considerable variability exists in the presence and magnitude of the &lt;i&gt;notch&lt;/i&gt; across neurons. To systematically address the contribution of AIS, dendritic and somatic compartments to shaping the two-component APs, we modeled APs of previously &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiologically characterized and 3D-reconstructed male mouse and rat dopaminergic neurons. A parsimonious two-domain model, with high (AIS) and lower (dendro-somatic) Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductance, reproduced the notch in the temporal derivatives, but not in the extracellular APs, regardless of morphology. The notch was only revealed when somatic active currents were reduced, constraining the model to three domains. Thus, an initial AIS spike is followed by an actively generated spike by the axon-bearing dendrite (ABD), in turn followed mostly passively by the soma. The transition from being a source compartment for the AIS spike to a source compartment for the ABD spike satisfactorily explains the extracellular somatic notch. Larger AISs and thinner ABD (but not soma-to-AIS distance) accentuate the AIS component. We conclude that variability in AIS size and ABD caliber explains variability in AP extracellular waveform and separation of AIS and dendro-somatic components, given the presence of at least three functional domains with distinct excitability characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Midbrain dopamine neurons make an important contribution to circuits mediating motivation and movement. Understanding the basic rules that govern the electrical activity of single dopaminergic neurons is therefore essential to reveal how they ultimately contribute to movement and motivation as well as what goes wrong in associated disorders. Our computational study focuses on the generation and propagation of action potentials and shows that different morphologies and excitability characteristics of the cell body, dendrites and proximal axon can explain the diversity of action potentials shapes in this population. These compartments likely make differential contributions both to normal dopaminergic signaling and could potentially underlie pathological dopaminergic signaling implicated in addiction, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and other disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: {alpha}-Neurexins Together with {alpha}2{delta}-1 Auxiliary Subunits Regulate Ca2+ Influx through Cav2.1 Channels</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Action potential-evoked neurotransmitter release is impaired in knock-out neurons lacking synaptic cell-adhesion molecules α-neurexins (αNrxns), the extracellularly longer variants of the three vertebrate &lt;i&gt;Nrxn&lt;/i&gt; genes. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx through presynaptic high-voltage gated calcium channels like the ubiquitous P/Q-type (Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1) triggers release of fusion-ready vesicles at many boutons. α2 Auxiliary subunits regulate trafficking and kinetic properties of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 pore-forming subunits but it has remained unclear if this involves αNrxns. Using live cell imaging with Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; indicators, we report here that the total presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx in primary hippocampal neurons of αNrxn triple knock-out mice of both sexes is reduced and involved lower Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1-mediated transients. This defect is accompanied by lower vesicle release, reduced synaptic abundance of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 pore-forming subunits, and elevated surface mobility of α2-1 on axons. Overexpression of Nrxn1α in αNrxn triple knock-out neurons is sufficient to restore normal presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx and synaptic vesicle release. Moreover, coexpression of Nrxn1α together with α2-1 subunits facilitates Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx further but causes little augmentation together with a different subunit, α2-3, suggesting remarkable specificity. Expression of defined recombinant Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 channels in heterologous cells validates and extends the findings from neurons. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings show that Nrxn1α in combination with α2-1, but not with α2-3, facilitates Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; currents of recombinant Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 without altering channel kinetics. These results suggest that presynaptic Nrxn1α acts as a positive regulator of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx through Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 channels containing α2-1 subunits. We propose that this regulation represents an important way for neurons to adjust synaptic strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Synaptic transmission between neurons depends on the fusion of neurotransmitter-filled vesicles with the presynaptic membrane, which subsequently activates postsynaptic receptors. Influx of calcium ions into the presynaptic terminal is the key step to trigger vesicle release and involves different subtypes of voltage-gated calcium channels. We study the regulation of calcium channels by neurexins, a family of synaptic cell-adhesion molecules that are essential for many synapse properties. Using optical measurements of calcium influx in cultured neurons and electrophysiological recordings of calcium currents from recombinant channels, we show that a major neurexin variant facilitates calcium influx through P/Q-type channels by interacting with their α2-1 auxiliary subunits. These results propose a novel way how neurons can modulate the strength of distinct synapses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Ultrafast Cortical Gain Adaptation in the Human Brain by Trial-To-Trial Changes of Associative Strength in Fear Learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/38/8262?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/38/8262?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In fear conditioning, more efficient sensory processing of a stimulus (the conditioned stimulus, CS) that has acquired motivational relevance by being paired with an aversive event (the unconditioned stimulus, US) has been associated with increased cortical gain in early sensory brain areas (Miskovic and Keil, 2012). Further, this sensory gain modulation related to short-term plasticity changes occurs independently of aware cognitive anticipation of the aversive US, pointing toward implicit learning mechanisms (Moratti and Keil, 2009). However, it is unknown how quickly the implicit learning of CS–US associations results in the adaptation of cortical gain. Here, using steady-state visually evoked fields derived from human Magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings in two experiments (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 33, 17 females and 16 males), we show that stimulus-driven neuromagnetic oscillatory activity increases and decreases quickly as a function of associative strength within three or four trials, as predicted by a computationally implemented Rescorla–Wagner model with the highest learning rate. These ultrafast cortical gain adaptations are restricted to early visual cortex using a delay fear conditioning procedure. Short interval (500 ms) trace conditioning resulted in the same ultrafast activity modulations by associative strength, but in a complex occipito-parieto-temporo-frontal network. Granger causal analysis revealed that reverberating top-down and bottom-up influences between anterior and posterior brain regions during trace conditioning characterized this network. Critically, in both delay and trace conditioning, ultrafast cortical gain modulations as a function of associative strength occurred independently of conscious US anticipation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In ever-changing environments, learned associations between a cue and an aversive consequence must change under new stimulus–consequence contingencies to be adaptive. What predicts potential dangers now might be meaningless in the next situation. Predictive cues are prioritized, as reflected by increased sensory cortex activity for these cues. However, this modulation also must adapt to altered stimulus–consequence contingencies. Here, we show that human visual cortex activity can be modulated quickly according to ultrafast contingency changes within a few learning trials. This finding extends to frontal brain regions when the cue and the aversive event are separated in time. Critically, this ultrafast updating process occurs orthogonally to aware aversive outcome anticipation and therefore relies on unconscious implicit learning mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Impaired Recent, but Preserved Remote, Autobiographical Memory in Pediatric Brain Tumor Patients</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Medulloblastomas, the most common malignant brain tumor in children, are typically treated with radiotherapy. Refinement of this treatment has greatly improved survival rates in this patient population. However, radiotherapy also profoundly affects the developing brain and is associated with reduced hippocampal volume and blunted hippocampal neurogenesis. Such hippocampal (as well as extrahippocampal) abnormalities likely contribute to cognitive impairments in this population. While several aspects of memory have been examined in this population, the impact of radiotherapy on autobiographical memory has not previously been evaluated. Here we evaluated autobiographical memory in male and female patients who received radiotherapy for posterior fossa tumors (PFTs), including medulloblastoma, during childhood. Using the Children's Autobiographical Interview, we retrospectively assessed episodic and nonepisodic details for events that either preceded (i.e., remote) or followed (i.e., recent) treatment. For post-treatment events, PFT patients reported fewer episodic details compared with control subjects. For pretreatment events, PFT patients reported equivalent episodic details compared with control subjects. In a range of conditions associated with reduced hippocampal volume (including medial temporal lobe amnesia, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, temporal lobe epilepsy, transient epileptic amnesia, frontal temporal dementia, traumatic brain injury, encephalitis, and aging), loss of episodic details (even in remote memories) accompanies hippocampal volume loss. It is therefore surprising that pretreatment episodic memories in PFT patients with reduced hippocampal volume are retained. We discuss these findings in light of the anterograde and retrograde impact on memory of experimentally suppressing hippocampal neurogenesis in rodents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Pediatric medulloblastoma survivors develop cognitive dysfunction following cranial radiotherapy treatment. We report that radiotherapy treatment impairs the ability to form new autobiographical memories, but spares preoperatively acquired autobiographical memories. Reductions in hippocampal volume and cortical volume in regions of the recollection network appear to contribute to this pattern of preserved preoperative, but impaired postoperative, memory. These findings have significant implications for understanding disrupted mnemonic processing in the medial temporal lobe memory system and in the broader recollection network, which are inadvertently affected by standard treatment methods for medulloblastoma tumors in children.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Motion Extrapolation for Eye Movements Predicts Perceived Motion-Induced Position Shifts</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transmission delays in the nervous system pose challenges for the accurate localization of moving objects as the brain must rely on outdated information to determine their position in space. Acting effectively in the present requires that the brain compensates not only for the time lost in the transmission and processing of sensory information, but also for the expected time that will be spent preparing and executing motor programs. Failure to account for these delays will result in the mislocalization and mistargeting of moving objects. In the visuomotor system, where sensory and motor processes are tightly coupled, this predicts that the perceived position of an object should be related to the latency of saccadic eye movements aimed at it. Here we use the flash-grab effect, a mislocalization of briefly flashed stimuli in the direction of a reversing moving background, to induce shifts of perceived visual position in human observers (male and female). We find a linear relationship between saccade latency and perceived position shift, challenging the classic dissociation between &quot;vision for action&quot; and &quot;vision for perception&quot; for tasks of this kind and showing that oculomotor position representations are either shared with or tightly coupled to perceptual position representations. Altogether, we show that the visual system uses both the spatial and temporal characteristics of an upcoming saccade to localize visual objects for both action and perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Accurately localizing moving objects is a computational challenge for the brain due to the inevitable delays that result from neural transmission. To solve this, the brain might implement motion extrapolation, predicting where an object ought to be at the present moment. Here, we use the flash-grab effect to induce perceptual position shifts and show that the latency of imminent saccades predicts the perceived position of the objects they target. This counterintuitive finding is important because it not only shows that motion extrapolation mechanisms indeed work to reduce the behavioral impact of neural transmission delays in the human brain, but also that these mechanisms are closely matched in the perceptual and oculomotor systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mitochondrial fission and fusion impact numerous cellular functions and neurons are particularly sensitive to perturbations in mitochondrial dynamics. Here we describe that male mice lacking the mitochondrial A-kinase anchoring protein 1 (AKAP1) exhibit increased sensitivity in the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model of focal ischemia. At the ultrastructural level, AKAP1&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice have smaller mitochondria and increased contacts between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum in the brain. Mechanistically, deletion of AKAP1 dysregulates complex II of the electron transport chain, increases superoxide production, and impairs Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis in neurons subjected to excitotoxic glutamate. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; deregulation in neurons lacking AKAP1 can be attributed to loss of inhibitory phosphorylation of the mitochondrial fission enzyme dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) at the protein kinase A (PKA) site Ser637. Our results indicate that inhibition of Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission by the outer mitochondrial AKAP1/PKA complex protects neurons from ischemic stroke by maintaining respiratory chain activity, inhibiting superoxide production, and delaying Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; deregulation. They also provide the first genetic evidence that Drp1 inhibition may be of therapeutic relevance for the treatment of stroke and neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Previous work suggests that activation of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) and mitochondrial fission contribute to ischemic injury in the brain. However, the specificity and efficacy of the pharmacological Drp1 inhibitor mdivi-1 that was used has now been discredited by several high-profile studies. Our report is timely and highly impactful because it provides the first evidence that genetic disinhibition of Drp1 via knock-out of the mitochondrial protein kinase A (PKA) scaffold AKAP1 exacerbates stroke injury in mice. Mechanistically, we show that electron transport deficiency, increased superoxide production, and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; overload result from genetic disinhibition of Drp1. In summary, our work settles current controversies regarding the role of mitochondrial fission in neuronal injury, provides mechanisms, and suggests that fission inhibitors hold promise as future therapeutic agents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: 14-3-3 Proteins Reduce Cell-to-Cell Transfer and Propagation of Pathogenic {alpha}-Synuclein</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;α-Synuclein (αsyn) is the key protein that forms neuronal aggregates in the neurodegenerative disorders Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies. Recent evidence points to the prion-like spread of αsyn from one brain region to another. Propagation of αsyn is likely dependent on release, uptake, and misfolding. Under normal circumstances, this highly expressed brain protein functions normally without promoting pathology, yet the underlying endogenous mechanisms that prevent αsyn spread are not understood. 14-3-3 proteins are highly expressed brain proteins that have chaperone function and regulate protein trafficking. In this study, we investigated the potential role of the 14-3-3 proteins in the regulation of αsyn spread using two models of αsyn spread. In a paracrine αsyn model, 14-3-3 promoted release of αsyn complexed with 14-3-3. Despite higher amounts of released αsyn, extracellular αsyn showed reduced oligomerization and seeding capability, reduced internalization, and reduced toxicity in primary mixed-gender mouse neurons. 14-3-3 inhibition reduced the amount of αsyn released, yet released αsyn was more toxic and demonstrated increased oligomerization, seeding capability, and internalization. In the preformed fibril model, 14-3-3  reduced αsyn aggregation and neuronal death, whereas 14-3-3 inhibition enhanced αsyn aggregation and neuronal death in primary mouse neurons. 14-3-3s blocked αsyn spread to distal chamber neurons not exposed directly to fibrils in multichamber, microfluidic devices. These findings point to 14-3-3s as a direct regulator of αsyn propagation, and suggest that dysfunction of 14-3-3 function may promote αsyn pathology in PD and related synucleinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Transfer of misfolded aggregates of α-synuclein from one brain region to another is implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies. This process is dependent on active release, internalization, and misfolding of α-synuclein. 14-3-3 proteins are highly expressed chaperone proteins that interact with α-synuclein and regulate protein trafficking. We used two different models in which toxicity is associated with cell-to-cell transfer of α-synuclein to test whether 14-3-3s impact α-synuclein toxicity. We demonstrate that 14-3-3 reduces α-synuclein transfer and toxicity by inhibiting oligomerization, seeding capability, and internalization of α-synuclein, whereas 14-3-3 inhibition accelerates the transfer and toxicity of α-synuclein in these models. Dysfunction of 14-3-3 function may be a critical mechanism by which α-synuclein propagation occurs in disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Novel Alternative Splicing Mechanism That Enhances Human 5-HT1A Receptor RNA Stability Is Altered in Major Depression</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/38/8200?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The serotonin-1A (5-HT1A) receptor is a key regulator of serotonergic activity and is implicated in mood and emotion. However, its post-transcriptional regulation has never been studied in humans. In the present study, we show that the &quot;intronless&quot; human 5-HT1A gene (&lt;i&gt;HTR1A&lt;/i&gt;) is alternatively spliced in its 3'-UTR, yielding two novel splice variants. These variants lack a ~1.6 kb intron, which contains an microRNA-135 (miR135) target site. Unlike the human &lt;i&gt;HTR1A&lt;/i&gt;, the mouse &lt;i&gt;HTR1A&lt;/i&gt; lacks the splice donor/accepter sites. Thus, in the mouse &lt;i&gt;HTR1A&lt;/i&gt;, splicing was not detected. The two spliced mRNAs are extremely stable, are resistant to miR135-induced downregulation, and have greater translational output than the unspliced variant. Moreover, alternative &lt;i&gt;HTR1A&lt;/i&gt; RNA splicing is oppositely regulated by the splice factors PTBP1 and nSR100, which inhibit or enhance its splicing, respectively. In postmortem human brain tissue from both sexes, &lt;i&gt;HTR1A&lt;/i&gt; mRNA splicing was prevalent and region-specific. Unspliced &lt;i&gt;HTR1A&lt;/i&gt; was expressed more strongly in the hippocampus and midbrain versus the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and correlated with reduced levels of nSR100. Importantly, &lt;i&gt;HTR1A&lt;/i&gt; RNA splicing and nSR100 levels were reduced in the PFC of individuals with major depression compared with controls. Our unexpected findings uncover a novel mechanism to regulate &lt;i&gt;HTR1A&lt;/i&gt; gene expression through alternative splicing of microRNA sites. Altered levels of splice factors could contribute to changes in regional and depression-related gene expression through alternative splicing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Alternative splicing, which is prevalent in brain tissue, increases gene diversity. The serotonin-1A receptor gene (&lt;i&gt;HTR1A&lt;/i&gt;) is a regulator of serotonin, which is implicated in mood and emotion. Here we show that human &lt;i&gt;HTR1A&lt;/i&gt; RNA is alternately spliced. Splicing removes a microRNA site to generate ultrastable RNA and increase &lt;i&gt;HTR1A&lt;/i&gt; expression. This splicing varies in different brain regions and is reduced in major depression. We also identify specific splice factors for &lt;i&gt;HTR1A&lt;/i&gt; RNA, showing they are also reduced in depression. Thus, we describe a novel mechanism to regulate gene expression through splicing. Altered levels of splice factors could contribute to depression by changing gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neurotransmitter- and Release-Mode-Specific Modulation of Inhibitory Transmission by Group I Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors in Central Auditory Neurons of the Mouse</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/38/8187?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuromodulation mediated by metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) regulates many brain functions. However, the functions of mGluRs in the auditory system under normal and diseased states are not well understood. The medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) is a critical nucleus in the auditory brainstem nuclei involved in sound localization. In addition to the classical calyx excitatory inputs, MNTB neurons also receive synaptic inhibition and it remains entirely unknown how this inhibition is regulated. Here, using whole-cell voltage clamp in brain slices, we investigated group I mGluR (mGluR I)-mediated modulation of the glycinergic and GABAergic inputs to MNTB neurons in both WT mice and a fragile X syndrome (FXS) mouse model (both sexes) in which the fragile X mental retardation gene 1 is knocked out (&lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO), causing exaggerated activity of mGluR I and behavioral phenotypes. Activation of mGluR I by (RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (3,5-DHPG) increased the frequency and amplitude of glycinergic spontaneous IPSCs (sIPSCs) in both WT and &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO neurons in a voltage-gated sodium channel-dependent fashion, but did not modulate glycinergic evoked IPSCs (eIPSCs). In contrast, 3,5-DHPG did not affect GABAergic sIPSCs, but did suppress eIPSCs in WT neurons via endocannabinoid signaling. In the KO, the effect of 3,5-DHPG on GABAergic eIPSCs was highly variable, which supports the notion of impaired GABAergic signaling in the FXS model. The differential modulation of sIPSC and eIPSC and differential modulation of glycinergic and GABAergic transmission suggest distinct mechanisms responsible for spontaneous and evoked release of inhibitory transmitters and their modulation through the mGluR I signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neurons communicate with each other through the release of neurotransmitters, which assumes two basic modes, spontaneous and evoked release. These two release modes are believed to function using the same vesicle pool and machinery. Recent works have challenged this dogma, pointing to distinct vesicle release mechanisms underlying the two release modes. Here, we provide the first evidence in the central auditory system supporting this novel concept. We discovered neural-transmitter- and release-mode-specific neuromodulation of inhibitory transmission by metabotropic glutamate receptors and revealed part of the signaling pathways underlying this differential modulation. The results establish the foundation for a multitude of directions to study physiological significance of different release modes in auditory processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dissociation of LFP Power and Tuning in the Frontal Cortex during Memory</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Working memory, the ability to maintain and manipulate information in the brain, is critical for cognition. During the memory period of spatial memory tasks, neurons in the prefrontal cortex code for memorized locations via persistent, spatially tuned increases in activity. Local field potentials (LFPs) are understood to reflect summed synaptic activity of local neuron populations and may offer a window into network-level processing. We recorded LFPs from areas 8A and 9/46 while two male cynomolgus macaques (&lt;i&gt;Macaca fascicularis&lt;/i&gt;) performed a long duration (5.1–15.6 s) memory-guided saccade task. Greater than ~16 Hz, LFP power was contralaterally tuned throughout the memory period. Yet power for both contralateral and ipsilateral targets fell gradually after the first second of the memory period, dropping below baseline after a few seconds. Our results dissociate absolute LFP power from mnemonic tuning and are consistent with modeling work that suggests that decreasing synchronization within a network may improve the stability of memory coding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The frontal cortex is an important site for working memory. There, individual neurons reflect memorized information with selective increases in activity, but how collections of neurons work together to achieve memory is not well understood. In this work, we examined rhythmic electrical activity surrounding these neurons, which may reflect the operation of recurrent circuitry that could underlie memory. This rhythmic activity was spatially tuned with respect to memorized locations as long as memory was tested (~7.5 s). Surprisingly, however, the overall magnitude of rhythmic activity decreased steadily over this period, dropping below baseline levels after a few seconds. These findings suggest that collections of neurons may actively desynchronize to promote stability in memory circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sphingosine Kinase Regulates Neuropeptide Secretion During the Oxidative Stress-Response Through Intertissue Signaling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/38/8160?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Nrf2 antioxidant transcription factor promotes redox homeostasis in part through reciprocal signaling between neurons and neighboring cells, but the signals involved in intertissue signaling in response to Nrf2 activation are not well defined. In &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, activation of SKN-1/Nrf2 in the intestine negatively regulates neuropeptide secretion from motor neurons. Here, we show that sphingosine kinase (SPHK-1) functions downstream of SKN-1/Nrf2 in the intestine to regulate neuropeptide secretion from motor neurons during the oxidative stress response in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; hermaphrodites. SPHK-1 localizes to mitochondria in the intestine and SPHK-1 mitochondrial localization and kinase activity are essential for its function in regulating motor neuron function. SPHK-1 is recruited to mitochondria from cytosolic pools and its mitochondrial abundance is negatively regulated by acute or chronic SKN-1 activation. Finally, the regulation of motor function by SKN-1 requires the activation of the p38 MAPK cascade in the intestine and occurs through controlling the biogenesis or maturation of dense core vesicles in motor neurons. These findings show that the inhibition of SPHK-1 in the intestine by SKN-1 negatively regulates neuropeptide secretion from motor neurons, revealing a new mechanism by which SPHK-1 signaling mediates its effects on neuronal function in response to oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neurons are highly susceptible to damage by oxidative stress, yet have limited capacity to activate the SKN-1/Nrf2 oxidative stress response, relying instead on astrocytes to provide redox homeostasis. In &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, intertissue signaling from the intestine plays a key role in regulating neuronal function during the oxidative stress response. Here, through a combination of genetic, behavioral, and fluorescent imaging approaches, we found that sphingosine kinase functions in the SKN-1/Nrf2 pathway in the intestine to regulate neuropeptide biogenesis and secretion in motor neurons. These results implicate sphingolipid signaling as a new component of the oxidative stress response and suggest that &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; may be a genetically tractable model to study non-cell-autonomous oxidative stress signaling to neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Differentiable Processing of Objects, Associations, and Scenes within the Hippocampus</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus is known to be important for a range of cognitive functions, including episodic memory, spatial navigation, and thinking about the future. However, researchers have found it difficult to agree on the exact nature of this brain structure's contribution to cognition. Some theories emphasize the role of the hippocampus in associative processes. Another theory proposes that scene construction is its primary role. To directly compare these accounts of hippocampal function in human males and females, we devised a novel mental imagery paradigm where different tasks were closely matched for associative processing and mental construction, but either did or did not evoke scene representations, and we combined this with high-resolution functional MRI. The results were striking in showing that different parts of the hippocampus, along with distinct cortical regions, were recruited for scene construction or nonscene-evoking associative processing. The contrasting patterns of neural engagement could not be accounted for by differences in eye movements, mnemonic processing, or the phenomenology of mental imagery. These results inform conceptual debates in the field by showing that the hippocampus does not seem to favor one type of process over another; it is not a story of exclusivity. Rather, there may be different circuits within the hippocampus, each associated with different cortical inputs, which become engaged depending on the nature of the stimuli and the task at hand. Overall, our findings emphasize the importance of considering the hippocampus as a heterogeneous structure, and that a focus on characterizing how specific portions of the hippocampus interact with other brain regions may promote a better understanding of its role in cognition.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Chemogenetic Isolation Reveals Synaptic Contribution of {delta} GABAA Receptors in Mouse Dentate Granule Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Two major GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor classes mediate ionotropic GABA signaling, those containing a  subunit and those with a 2 subunit. The classical viewpoint equates 2-containing receptors with IPSCs and -containing receptors with tonic inhibition because of differences in receptor localization, but significant questions remain because the populations cannot be pharmacologically separated. We removed this barrier using gene editing to confer a point mutation on the  subunit in mice, rendering receptors containing the subunit picrotoxin resistant. By pharmacologically isolating -containing receptors, our results demonstrate their contribution to IPSCs in dentate granule neurons and weaker contributions to thalamocortical IPSCs. Despite documented extrasynaptic localization, we found that receptor localization does not preclude participation in isolated IPSCs, including mIPSCs. Further, phasic inhibition from  subunit-containing receptors strongly inhibited summation of EPSPs, whereas tonic activity had little impact. In addition to any role that -containing receptors may play in canonical tonic inhibition, our results highlight a previously underestimated contribution of -containing receptors to phasic inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors play key roles in transient and tonic inhibition. The prevailing view suggests that synaptic 2-containing GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors drive phasic inhibition, whereas extrasynaptic -containing receptors mediate tonic inhibition. To re-evaluate the impact of  receptors, we took a chemogenetic approach that offers a sensitive method to probe the synaptic contribution of -containing receptors. Our results reveal that localization does not strongly limit the contribution of  receptors to IPSCs and that  receptors make an unanticipated robust contribution to phasic inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Intrinsic Mechanisms of Frequency Selectivity in the Proximal Dendrites of CA1 Pyramidal Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Gamma oscillations are thought to play a role in learning and memory. Two distinct bands, slow (25–50 Hz) and fast (65–100 Hz) gamma, have been identified in area CA1 of the rodent hippocampus. Slow gamma is phase locked to activity in area CA3 and presumably driven by the Schaffer collaterals (SCs). We used a combination of computational modeling and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiology in hippocampal slices of male rats to test whether CA1 neurons responded to SC stimulation selectively at slow gamma frequencies and to identify the mechanisms involved. Both approaches demonstrated that, in response to temporally precise input at SCs, CA1 pyramidal neurons fire preferentially in the slow gamma range regardless of whether the input is at fast or slow gamma frequencies, suggesting frequency selectivity in CA1 output with respect to CA3 input. In addition, phase locking, assessed by the vector strength, was more precise for slow gamma than fast gamma input. This frequency selectivity was greatly attenuated when the slow Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (SK) current was removed from the model or blocked &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; with apamin. Perfusion of slices with BaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to block A-type K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels tightened this frequency selectivity. Both the broad-spectrum cholinergic agonist carbachol and the muscarinic agonist oxotremorine-M greatly attenuated the selectivity. The more precise firing at slower frequencies persisted throughout all of the pharmacological manipulations conducted. We propose that these intrinsic mechanisms provide a means by which CA1 phase locks to CA3 at different gamma frequencies preferentially &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; as physiological conditions change with behavioral demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Gamma frequency activity, one of multiple bands of synchronous activity, has been suggested to underlie various aspects of hippocampal function. Multisite recordings within the rat hippocampal formation indicate that different behavioral tasks are associated with synchronized activity between areas CA3 and CA1 at two different gamma bands: slow and fast gamma. In this study, we examine the intrinsic mechanisms that may allow CA1 to selectively &quot;listen&quot; to CA3 at slow compared with fast gamma and suggest mechanisms that gate this selectivity. Identifying the intrinsic mechanisms underlying differential gamma preference may help to explain the distinct types of CA3–CA1 synchronization observed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; under different behavioral conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: EEG-based Subjects Identification based on Biometrics of Imagined Speech using EMD. (arXiv:1809.06697v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06697</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06697</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;When brain activity is translated into commands for real applications, the
potential for human capacities augmentation is promising. In this paper, EMD is
used to decompose EEG signals during Imagined Speech in order to use it as a
biometric marker for creating a Biometric Recognition System. For each EEG
channel, the most relevant Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) are decided based on
the Minkowski distance, and for each IMF 4 features are computed: Instantaneous
and Teager energy distribution and Higuchi and Petrosian Fractal Dimension. To
test the proposed method, a dataset with 20 subjects who imagined 30
repetitions of 5 words in Spanish, is used. Four classifiers are used for this
task - random forest, SVM, naive Bayes, and k-NN - and their performances are
compared. The accuracy obtained (up to 0.92 using Linear SVM) after 10-folds
cross-validation suggest that the proposed method based on EMD can be valuable
for creating EEG-based biometrics of imagined speech for Subjects
identification.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Cross-Domain Influences on Creative Processes and Products. (arXiv:1809.06521v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06521</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06521</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;According to the honing theory of creativity, the iterative process
culminating in a creative work is made possible by the self-organizing nature
of a conceptual network, or worldview, and its innate holistic tendency to
minimize inconsistency. As such, the creative process is not limited to the
problem domain, and influences on creativity from domains other than that of
the final product are predicted to be widespread. We conducted a study in which
participants with varying levels of creative experience listed their creative
outputs, as well as influences (sources of inspiration) on these outputs. Of
the 758 creative influences, 13% were within-domain narrow, 13% within-domain
broad, 67% cross-domain, and 6% unclear. These findings support the hypothesis
that to trace the inspirational sources or 'conceptual parents' of a creative
output, and thus track its cultural lineage, one must look beyond the problem
domain to the creators' self-organizing, inconsistency-minimizing worldview at
large.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The physics of brain network structure, function, and control. (arXiv:1809.06441v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06441</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The brain is a complex organ characterized by heterogeneous patterns of
structural connections supporting unparalleled feats of cognition and a wide
range of behaviors. New noninvasive imaging techniques now allow these patterns
to be carefully and comprehensively mapped in individual humans and animals.
Yet, it remains a fundamental challenge to understand how the brain's
structural wiring supports cognitive processes, with major implications for the
personalized treatment of mental health disorders. Here, we review recent
efforts to meet this challenge that draw on intuitions, models, and theories
from physics, spanning the domains of statistical mechanics, information
theory, and dynamical systems and control. We begin by considering the
organizing principles of brain network architecture instantiated in structural
wiring under constraints of symmetry, spatial embedding, and energy
minimization. We next consider models of brain network function that stipulate
how neural activity propagates along these structural connections, producing
the long-range interactions and collective dynamics that support a rich
repertoire of system functions. Finally, we consider perturbative experiments
and models for brain network control, which leverage the physics of signal
transmission along structural wires to infer intrinsic control processes that
support goal-directed behavior and to inform stimulation-based therapies for
neurological disease and psychiatric disorders. Throughout, we highlight
several open questions in the physics of brain network structure, function, and
control that will require creative efforts from physicists willing to brave the
complexities of living matter.

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Humidity response depends on the small soluble protein Obp59a in Drosophila</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/39249</link>
	<description>Hygrosensation is an essential sensory modality that is used to find sources of moisture. Hygroreception allows animals to avoid desiccation, an existential threat that is increasing with climate change. Humidity response, however, remains poorly understood. Here we find that humidity-detecting sensilla in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; antenna express and rely on a small protein, Obp59a. Mutants lacking this protein are defective in three hygrosensory behaviors, one operating over seconds, one over minutes, and one over hours. Remarkably, loss of Obp59a and humidity response leads to an increase in desiccation resistance. Obp59a is an exceptionally well-conserved, highly localized, and abundantly expressed member of a large family of secreted proteins. Antennal Obps have long been believed to transport hydrophobic odorants, and a role in hygroreception was unexpected. The results enhance our understanding of hygroreception, Obp function, and desiccation resistance, a process that is critical to insect survival.</description>

	<description>Hypothalamic neurons respond to nutritional cues by altering gene expression and neuronal excitability. The mechanisms that control such adaptive processes remain unclear. Here we define populations of POMC neurons in mice that are activated or inhibited by insulin and thereby repress or inhibit hepatic glucose production (HGP). The proportion of POMC neurons activated by insulin was dependent on the regulation of insulin receptor signaling by the phosphatase TCPTP, which is increased by fasting, degraded after feeding and elevated in diet-induced obesity. TCPTP-deficiency enhanced insulin signaling and the proportion of POMC neurons activated by insulin to repress HGP. Elevated TCPTP in POMC neurons in obesity and/or after fasting repressed insulin signaling, the activation of POMC neurons by insulin and the insulin-induced and POMC-mediated repression of HGP. Our findings define a molecular mechanism for integrating POMC neural responses with feeding to control glucose metabolism.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Condensin controls cellular RNA levels through the accurate segregation of chromosomes instead of directly regulating transcription</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38517</link>
	<description>Condensins are genome organisers that shape chromosomes and promote their accurate transmission. Several studies have also implicated condensins in gene expression, although any mechanisms have remained enigmatic. Here, we report on the role of condensin in gene expression in fission and budding yeasts. In contrast to previous studies, we provide compelling evidence that condensin plays no direct role in the maintenance of the transcriptome, neither during interphase nor during mitosis. We further show that the changes in gene expression in post-mitotic fission yeast cells that result from condensin inactivation are largely a consequence of chromosome missegregation during anaphase, which notably depletes the RNA-exosome from daughter cells. Crucially, preventing karyotype abnormalities in daughter cells restores a normal transcriptome despite condensin inactivation. Thus, chromosome instability, rather than a direct role of condensin in the transcription process, changes gene expression. This knowledge challenges the concept of gene regulation by canonical condensin complexes.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Hyuntae Na, Guang Song&lt;/p&gt;

Dynamics of biomolecular assemblies offer invaluable insights into their functional mechanisms. For extremely large biomolecular systems, such as HIV-1 capsid that has nearly 5 millions atoms, obtaining its normal mode dynamics using even coarse-grained models can be a challenging task. In this work, we have successfully carried out a normal mode analysis of an entire HIV-1 capsid in full all-atom details. This is made possible through our newly developed BOSE (Block of Selected Elasticity) model that is founded on the principle of resonance discovered in our recent work. The resonance principle makes it possible to most efficiently compute the vibrations of a whole capsid at any given frequency by projecting the motions of component capsomeres into a narrow subspace. We have conducted also assessments of the quality of the BOSE modes by comparing them with benchmark modes obtained directly from the original Hessian matrix. Our all-atom normal mode dynamics study of the HIV-1 capsid reveals the dynamic role of the pentamers in stabilizing the capsid structure and is in agreement with experimental findings that suggest capsid disassembly and uncoating start when the pentamers become destabilized. Our results on the dynamics of hexamer pores suggest that nucleotide transport should take place mostly at hexamers near pentamers, especially at the larger hemispherical end.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6rrbmtVPD1U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrey Babichev, Dmitriy Morozov, Yuri Dabaghian&lt;/p&gt;

The spiking activity of principal cells in mammalian hippocampus encodes an internalized neuronal representation of the ambient space—a cognitive map. Once learned, such a map enables the animal to navigate a given environment for a long period. However, the neuronal substrate that produces this map is transient: the synaptic connections in the hippocampus and in the downstream neuronal networks never cease to form and to deteriorate at a rapid rate. How can the brain maintain a robust, reliable representation of space using a network that constantly changes its architecture? We address this question using a computational framework that allows evaluating the effect produced by the decaying connections between simulated hippocampal neurons on the properties of the cognitive map. Using novel Algebraic Topology techniques, we demonstrate that emergence of stable cognitive maps produced by networks with transient architectures is a generic phenomenon. The model also points out that deterioration of the cognitive map caused by weakening or lost connections between neurons may be compensated by simulating the neuronal activity. Lastly, the model explicates the importance of the complementary learning systems for processing spatial information at different levels of spatiotemporal granularity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gbbOgT7E6ek&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Advances in calcium imaging have made it possible to record from an increasingly larger number of neurons simultaneously. Neuroscientists can now routinely image hundreds to thousands of individual neurons. An emerging technical challenge that parallels the advancement in imaging a large number of individual neurons is the processing of correspondingly large datasets. One important step is the identification of individual neurons. Traditional methods rely mainly on manual or semimanual inspection, which cannot be scaled for processing large datasets. To address this challenge, we focused on developing an automated segmentation method, which we refer to as automated cell segmentation by adaptive thresholding (ACSAT). ACSAT works with a time-collapsed image and includes an iterative procedure that automatically calculates global and local threshold values during successive iterations based on the distribution of image pixel intensities. Thus, the algorithm is capable of handling variations in morphological details and in fluorescence intensities in different calcium imaging datasets. In this paper, we demonstrate the utility of ACSAT by testing it on 500 simulated datasets, two wide-field hippocampus datasets, a wide-field striatum dataset, a wide-field cell culture dataset, and a two-photon hippocampus dataset. For the simulated datasets with truth, ACSAT achieved &amp;gt;80% recall and precision when the signal-to-noise ratio was no less than ~24 dB.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This review provides a dynamical systems perspective on psychiatric symptoms
and disease, and discusses its potential implications for diagnosis, prognosis,
and treatment. After a brief introduction into the theory of dynamical systems,
we will focus on the idea that cognitive and emotional functions are
implemented in terms of dynamical systems phenomena in the brain, a common
assumption in theoretical and computational neuroscience. Specific
computational models, anchored in biophysics, for generating different types of
network dynamics, and with a relation to psychiatric symptoms, will be briefly
reviewed, as well as methodological approaches for reconstructing the system
dynamics from observed time series (like fMRI or EEG recordings). We then
attempt to outline how psychiatric phenomena, associated with schizophrenia,
depression, PTSD, ADHD, phantom pain, and others, could be understood in
dynamical systems terms. Most importantly, we will try to convey that the
dynamical systems level may provide a central, hub-like level of convergence
which unifies and links multiple biophysical and behavioral phenomena, in the
sense that diverse biophysical changes can give rise to the same dynamical
phenomena and, vice versa, similar changes in dynamics may yield different
behavioral symptoms depending on the brain area where these changes manifest.
If this assessment is correct, it may have profound implications for the
diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of psychiatric conditions, as it puts the
focus on dynamics. We therefore argue that consideration of dynamics should
play an important role in the choice and target of interventions.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: LSTM knowledge transfer for HRV-based sleep staging. (arXiv:1809.06221v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06221</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06221</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Automated sleep stage classification using heart-rate variability is an
active field of research. In this work limitations of the current
state-of-the-art are addressed through the use of deep learning techniques and
their efficacy is demonstrated. First, a temporal model is proposed for the
inference of sleep stages from electrocardiography using a deep long- and
short-term (LSTM) classifier and it is shown that this model outperforms
previous approaches which were often limited to non-temporal or Markovian
classifiers on a comprehensive benchmark data set (292 participants, 541214
samples) comprising a wide range of ages and pathological profiles, achieving a
Cohen's $\kappa$ of $0.61\pm0.16$ and accuracy of $76.30\pm10.17$ annotated
according to the Rechtschaffen &amp;amp; Kales annotation standard.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, it is demonstrated how knowledge learned on this large
benchmark data set can be re-used through transfer learning for the
classification of photoplethysmography (PPG) data. This is done using a smaller
data set (60 participants, 91479 samples) that is annotated with the more
recent American Association of Sleep Medicine annotation standard, achieving a
Cohen's $\kappa$ of $0.63\pm0.13$ and accuracy of $74.65\pm8.63$ for
wrist-mounted PPG-based sleep stage classification, higher than any previously
reported performance using this sensor modality. This demonstrates the
feasibility of knowledge transfer in sleep staging to adapt models for new
sensor modalities as well as different annotation strategies.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;$\textbf{Objective}$: To assess the validity of an automatic EEG arousal
detection algorithm using large patient samples and different heterogeneous
databases
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$\textbf{Methods}$: Automatic scorings were confronted with results from
human expert scorers on a total of 2768 full-night PSG recordings obtained from
two different databases. 472 recordings were obtained during clinical routine
at our sleep center and were subdivided into two subgroups of 220 (HMC-S) and
252 (HMC-M) recordings each, attending to the procedure followed by the
clinical expert during the visual review (semi-automatic or purely manual,
respectively). In addition, 2296 recordings from the public SHHS-2 database
were evaluated against the respective manual expert scorings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$\textbf{Results}$: Event-by-event epoch-based validation resulted in an
overall Cohen kappa agreement K = 0.600 (HMC-S), 0.559 (HMC-M), and 0.573
(SHHS2). Estimated inter-scorer variability on the datasets was, respectively,
K = 0.594, 0.561 and 0.543. Analyses of the corresponding Arousal Index scores
showed associated automatic-human repeatability indices ranging in 0.693-0.771
(HMC-S), 0.646-0.791 (HMC-M), and 0.759-0.791 (SHHS2).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$\textbf{Conclusions}$: Large-scale validation of our automatic EEG arousal
detector on different databases has shown robust performance and good
generalization results comparable to the expected levels of human agreement.
Special emphasis has been put on allowing reproducibility of the results and
implementation of our method has been made accessible online as open source
code

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Conventional anesthesia methods such as injective anesthetic agents may cause
various side effects such as injuries, allergies, and infections. We aim to
investigate a noninvasive scheme of an electromagnetic radiator system to block
action potential (AP) in neuron fibers. We achieved a high-gradient and
unipolar tangential electric field by designing circular geometric coils on an
electric rectifier filter layer. An asymmetric sawtooth pulse shape supplied
the coils in order to create an effective blockage. The entire setup was placed
5 cm above 50 motor and sensory neurons of the spinal cord. A validated
time-domain full-wave analysis code Based on cable model of the neurons and the
electric and magnetic potentials is used to simulate and investigate the
proposed scheme. We observed action potential blockage on both motor and
sensory neurons. In addition, the introduced approach shows promising potential
for AP manipulation in the spinal cord.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Simultaneous EEG/fMRI acquisition allows to measure brain activity at high
spatial-temporal resolution. The localisation of EEG sources depends on several
parameters including the position of the electrodes on the scalp. The position
of the MR electrodes during its acquisitions is obtained with the use of the
UTE sequence allowing their visualisation. The retrieval of the electrodes
consists in obtaining the volume where the electrodes are located by applying a
sphere detection algorithm. We detect around 90% of electrodes for each
subject, and our UTE-based electrode detection showed an average position error
of 3.7mm for all subjects.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The impact of developmental and aging processes on brain connectivity and the
connectome has been widely studied. Network theoretical measures and certain
topological principles are computed from the entire brain, however there is a
need to separate and understand the underlying subnetworks which contribute
towards these observed holistic connectomic alterations. One organizational
principle is the rich-club - a core subnetwork of brain regions that are
strongly connected, forming a high-cost, high-capacity backbone that is
critical for effective communication in the network. Investigations primarily
focus on its alterations with disease and age. Here, we present a systematic
analysis of not only the rich-club, but also other subnetworks derived from
this backbone - namely feeder and seeder subnetworks. Our analysis is applied
to structural connectomes in a normal cohort from a large, publicly available
lifespan study. We demonstrate changes in rich-club membership with age
alongside a shift in importance from 'peripheral' seeder to feeder subnetworks.
Our results show a refinement within the rich-club structure (increase in
transitivity and betweenness centrality), as well as increased efficiency in
the feeder subnetwork and decreased measures of network integration and
segregation in the seeder subnetwork. These results demonstrate the different
developmental patterns when analyzing the connectome stratified according to
its rich-club and the potential of utilizing this subnetwork analysis to reveal
the evolution of brain architectural alterations across the life-span.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Inhibition is considered to shape neural activity, and broaden its pattern
repertoire. In the sensory organs, where the anatomy of neural circuits is
highly structured, lateral inhibition sharpens contrast among stimulus
properties. The impact of inhibition on stimulus processing and the involvement
of lateral inhibition is less clear when activity propagates to the
less-structured relay stations. Here we take a synthetic approach to
disentangle the impacts of inhibition from that of specialized anatomy on the
repertoire of evoked activity patterns, and as a result, the network capacity
to uniquely represent different stimuli. To this aim, we blocked inhibition in
randomly rewired networks of cortical neurons in-vitro, and quantified response
variability and stimulus discrimination among stimuli provided at different
spatial loci, before and after the blockade. We show that blocking inhibition
quenches variability of responses evoked by repeated stimuli through any
spatial source; for all tested response features. Despite the sharpening role
of inhibition in the highly structured sensory organs, in these random networks
we find that blocking inhibition enhances stimulus discrimination between
spatial sources of stimulation, when based on response features that emphasize
the relation among spike times recorded through different electrodes. We
further show that under intact inhibition, responses to a given stimulus are a
noisy version of those revealed by blocking inhibition; such that intact
inhibition disrupts an otherwise coherent, wave propagation of activity.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Identification of temporal transition of functional states using recurrent neural networks from functional MRI. (arXiv:1809.05560v1 [cs.CV])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dynamic functional connectivity analysis provides valuable information for
understanding brain functional activity underlying different cognitive
processes. Besides sliding window based approaches, a variety of methods have
been developed to automatically split the entire functional MRI scan into
segments by detecting change points of functional signals to facilitate better
characterization of temporally dynamic functional connectivity patterns.
However, these methods are based on certain assumptions for the functional
signals, such as Gaussian distribution, which are not necessarily suitable for
the fMRI data. In this study, we develop a deep learning based framework for
adaptively detecting temporally dynamic functional state transitions in a
data-driven way without any explicit modeling assumptions, by leveraging recent
advances in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequence modeling.
Particularly, we solve this problem in an anomaly detection framework with an
assumption that the functional profile of one single time point could be
reliably predicted based on its preceding profiles within stable functional
state, while large prediction errors would occur around change points of
functional states. We evaluate the proposed method using both task and
resting-state fMRI data obtained from the human connectome project and
experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed change point detection
method could effectively identify change points between different task events
and split the resting-state fMRI into segments with distinct functional
connectivity patterns.

	<description>Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by debilitating heterotopic ossification (HO). The retinoic acid receptor gamma agonist, palovarotene, and antibody-mediated activin A blockade have entered human clinical trials, but how these therapeutic modalities affect the behavior of pathogenic fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) is unclear. Using live-animal luminescence imaging, we show that transplanted pathogenic FAPs undergo rapid initial expansion, with peak number strongly correlating with HO severity. Palovarotene significantly reduced expansion of pathogenic FAPs, but was less effective than activin A inhibition, which restored wild-type population growth dynamics to FAPs. Palovarotene pretreatment did not reduce FAPs’ skeletogenic potential, indicating that efficacy requires chronic administration. Although palovarotene inhibited chondrogenic differentiation in vitro and reduced HO in juvenile FOP mice, daily dosing resulted in aggressive synovial joint overgrowth and long bone growth plate ablation. These results highlight the challenge of inhibiting pathological bone formation prior to skeletal maturation.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/39742</link>
	<description>Neuropeptides are evolutionarily ancient peptide hormones of the nervous and neuroendocrine systems, and are thought to have regulated metamorphosis in early animal ancestors. In particular, the deeply conserved Wamide family of neuropeptides—shared across Bilateria (e.g. insects and worms) and its sister group Cnidaria (e.g. jellyfishes and corals)—has been implicated in mediating life-cycle transitions, yet their endogenous roles remain poorly understood. By using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated reverse genetics, we show that cnidarian Wamide—referred to as GLWamide—regulates the timing of life cycle transition in the sea anemone cnidarian &lt;i&gt;Nematostella vectensis&lt;/i&gt;. We find that mutant planula larvae lacking GLWamides transform into morphologically normal polyps at a rate slower than that of the wildtype control larvae. Treatment of GLWamide null mutant larvae with synthetic GLWamide peptides is sufficient to restore a normal rate of metamorphosis. These results demonstrate that GLWamide plays a dispensable, modulatory role in accelerating metamorphosis in a sea anemone.</description>

	<description>Fast directional growth is a necessity for the young seedling; after germination, it needs to quickly penetrate the soil to begin its autotrophic life. In most dicot plants, this rapid escape is due to the anisotropic elongation of the hypocotyl, the columnar organ between the root and the shoot meristems. Anisotropic growth is common in plant organs and is canonically attributed to cell wall anisotropy produced by oriented cellulose fibers. Recently, a mechanism based on asymmetric pectin-based cell wall elasticity has been proposed. Here we present a harmonizing model for anisotropic growth control in the dark-grown &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; hypocotyl: basic anisotropic information is provided by cellulose orientation) and additive anisotropic information is provided by pectin-based elastic asymmetry in the epidermis. We quantitatively show that hypocotyl elongation is anisotropic starting at germination. We present experimental evidence for pectin biochemical differences and wall mechanics providing important growth regulation in the hypocotyl. Lastly, our in silico modelling experiments indicate an additive collaboration between pectin biochemistry and cellulose orientation in promoting anisotropic growth.</description>

	<description>Uterine leiomyomas (ULs) are benign tumors that are a major burden to women's health. A genome-wide association study on 15,453 UL cases and 392,628 controls was performed, followed by replication of the genomic risk in six cohorts. Effects of the risk alleles were evaluated in view of molecular and clinical characteristics. 22 loci displayed a genome-wide significant association. The likely predisposition genes could be grouped to two biological processes. Genes involved in genome stability were represented by &lt;i&gt;TERT, TERC, OBFC1&lt;/i&gt; - highlighting the role of telomere maintenance - &lt;i&gt;TP53&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ATM&lt;/i&gt;. Genes involved in genitourinary development, &lt;i&gt;WNT4, WT1, SALL1, MED12, ESR1, GREB1, FOXO1, DMRT1 &lt;/i&gt;and uterine stem cell marker antigen &lt;i&gt;CD44, &lt;/i&gt;formed another strong subgroup. The combined risk contributed by the 22 loci was associated with &lt;i&gt;MED12&lt;/i&gt; mutation-positive tumors. The findings link genes for uterine development and genetic stability to leiomyomagenesis, and in part explain the more frequent occurrence of UL in women of African origin.</description>

	<description>The factors that govern assembly of the gut microbiota are insufficiently understood. Here, we test the hypothesis that inter-individual microbiota variation can arise solely from differences in the order and timing by which the gut is colonized early in life. Experiments in which mice were inoculated in sequence either with two complex seed communities or a cocktail of four bacterial strains and a seed community revealed that colonization order influenced both the outcome of community assembly and the ecological success of individual colonizers. Historical contingency and priority effects also occurred in &lt;i&gt;Rag1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice, suggesting that the adaptive immune system is not a major contributor to these processes. In conclusion, this study established a measurable effect of colonization history on gut microbiota assembly in a model in which host and environmental factors were strictly controlled, illuminating a potential cause for the high levels of unexplained individuality in host-associated microbial communities.</description>

	<description>Cognitive and social capacities require postnatal experience, yet the pathways by which experience guides development are unknown. Here we show that the normal development of motor and nonmotor capacities requires cerebellar activity. Using chemogenetic perturbation of molecular layer interneurons to attenuate cerebellar output in mice, we found that activity of posterior regions in juvenile life modulates adult expression of eyeblink conditioning (paravermal lobule VI, crus I), reversal learning (lobule VI), persistive behavior and novelty-seeking (lobule VII), and social preference (crus I/II). Perturbation in adult life altered only a subset of phenotypes. Both adult and juvenile disruption left gait metrics largely unaffected. Contributions to phenotypes increased with the amount of lobule inactivated. Using an anterograde transsynaptic tracer, we found that posterior cerebellum made strong connections with prelimbic, orbitofrontal, and anterior cingulate cortex. These findings provide anatomical substrates for the clinical observation that cerebellar injury increases the risk of autism.</description>

The capacity to learn abstract concepts such as ‘sameness’ and ‘difference’ is considered a higher-order cognitive function, typically thought to be dependent on top-down neocortical processing. It is therefore surprising that honey bees apparantly have this capacity. Here we report a model of the structures of the honey bee brain that can learn sameness and difference, as well as a range of complex and simple associative learning tasks. Our model is constrained by the known connections and properties of the mushroom body, including the protocerebral tract, and provides a good fit to the learning rates and performances of real bees in all tasks, including learning sameness and difference. The model proposes a novel mechanism for learning the abstract concepts of ‘sameness’ and ‘difference’ that is compatible with the insect brain, and is not dependent on top-down or executive control processing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HFdx2Lid-Jk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Variation of an inherited trait across a population cannot be explained by additive contributions of relevant genes, due to epigenetic effects and biochemical interactions (epistasis). Detecting epistasis in genomic data still represents a significant challenge that requires a better understanding of epistasis from the mechanistic point of view. Using a standard Wright-Fisher model of bi-allelic asexual population, we study how compensatory epistasis affects the process of adaptation. The main result is a universal relationship between four haplotype frequencies of a single site pair in a genome, which depends only on the epistasis strength of the pair defined regarding Darwinian fitness. We demonstrate the existence, at any time point, of a quasi-equilibrium between epistasis and disorder (entropy) caused by random genetic drift and mutation. We verify the accuracy of these analytic results by Monte-Carlo simulation over a broad range of parameters, including the topology of the interacting network. Thus, epistasis assists the evolutionary transit through evolutionary hurdles leaving marks at the level of haplotype disequilibrium. The method allows determining selection coefficient for each site and the epistasis strength of each pair from a sequence set. The resulting ability to detect clusters of deleterious mutation close to full compensation is essential for biomedical applications. These findings help to understand the role of epistasis in multiple compensatory mutations in viral resistance to antivirals and immune response.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Uu1bJnHITJI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Every neuron is part of a network, exerting its function by transforming multiple spatiotemporal synaptic input patterns into a single spiking output. This function is specified by the particular shape and passive electrical properties of the neuronal membrane, and the composition and spatial distribution of ion channels across its processes. For a variety of physiological or pathological reasons, the intrinsic input/output function may change during a neuron’s lifetime. This process results in high variability in the peak specific conductance of ion channels in individual neurons. The mechanisms responsible for this variability are not well understood, although there are clear indications from experiment and modeling that degeneracy and correlation among multiple channels may be involved. Here, we studied this issue in biophysical models of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons and interneurons. Using a unified data-driven simulation workflow and starting from a set of experimental recordings and morphological reconstructions obtained from rats, we built and analyzed several ensembles of morphologically and biophysically accurate single cell models with intrinsic electrophysiological properties consistent with experimental findings. The results suggest that the set of conductances expressed in any given hippocampal neuron may be considered as belonging to two groups: one subset is responsible for the major characteristics of the firing behavior in each population and the other responsible for a robust degeneracy. Analysis of the model neurons suggests several experimentally testable predictions related to the combination and relative proportion of the different conductances that should be expressed on the membrane of different types of neurons for them to fulfill their role in the hippocampus circuitry.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mPhNfP2JTzg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Filamentous actin (F-actin) and non-muscle myosin II motors drive cell motility and cell shape changes that guide large scale tissue movements during embryonic morphogenesis. To gain a better understanding of the role of actomyosin &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, we have developed a two-dimensional (2D) computational model to study emergent phenomena of dynamic unbranched actomyosin arrays in the cell cortex. These phenomena include actomyosin punctuated contractions, or &quot;actin asters&quot; that form within quiescent F-actin networks. Punctuated contractions involve both formation of high intensity aster-like structures and disassembly of those same structures. Our 2D model allows us to explore the kinematics of filament polarity sorting, segregation of motors, and morphology of F-actin arrays that emerge as the model structure and biophysical properties are varied. Our model demonstrates the complex, emergent feedback between filament reorganization and motor transport that generate as well as disassemble actin asters. Since intracellular actomyosin dynamics are thought to be controlled by localization of scaffold proteins that bind F-actin or their myosin motors we also apply our 2D model to recapitulate &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies that have revealed complex patterns of actomyosin that assemble from patterning filaments and motor complexes with microcontact printing. Although we use a minimal representation of filament, motor, and cross-linker biophysics, our model establishes a framework for investigating the role of other actin binding proteins, how they might alter actomyosin dynamics, and makes predictions that can be tested experimentally within live cells as well as within &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dg13yks3NAs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

While the neurobiology of simple and habitual choices is relatively well known, our current understanding of goal-directed choices and planning in the brain is still limited. Theoretical work suggests that goal-directed computations can be productively associated to model-based (reinforcement learning) computations, yet a detailed mapping between computational processes and neuronal circuits remains to be fully established. Here we report a computational analysis that aligns Bayesian nonparametrics and model-based reinforcement learning (MB-RL) to the functioning of the hippocampus (HC) and the ventral striatum (vStr)–a neuronal circuit that increasingly recognized to be an appropriate model system to understand goal-directed (spatial) decisions and planning mechanisms in the brain. We test the MB-RL agent in a contextual conditioning task that depends on intact hippocampus and ventral striatal (shell) function and show that it solves the task while showing key behavioral and neuronal signatures of the HC—vStr circuit. Our simulations also explore the benefits of biological forms of look-ahead prediction (forward sweeps) during both learning and control. This article thus contributes to fill the gap between our current understanding of computational algorithms and biological realizations of (model-based) reinforcement learning.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/g0hrusts6EA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Electrophysiological Signature Reveals Laminar Structure of the Porcine Hippocampus</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus is integral to working and episodic memory, and is a central region of interest in diseases affecting these processes. Pig models are widely used in translational research, and may provide an excellent bridge between rodents and non-human primates for CNS disease models due to their gyrencephalic neuroanatomy and significant white matter composition. However, the laminar structure of the pig hippocampus has not been well characterized. Therefore, we histologically characterized the dorsal hippocampus of Yucatan miniature pigs and quantified the cytoarchitecture of the hippocampal layers. We then utilized stereotaxis combined with single unit electrophysiological mapping to precisely place multichannel laminar silicon probes into the dorsal hippocampus without the need for image guidance. We used &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiological recordings of simultaneous laminar field potentials and single unit activity in multiple layers of the dorsal hippocampus to physiologically identify and quantify these layers under anesthesia. Consistent with previous reports, we found the porcine hippocampus to have the expected archicortical laminar structure with some anatomical and histological features comparable to the rodent and others to the primate hippocampus. Importantly, we found these distinct features to be reflected in the laminar electrophysiology. This characterization, as well as our electrophysiology-based methodology targeting the porcine hippocampal lamina combined with high channel count silicon probes will allow for analysis of spike-field interactions during normal and disease states in both anesthetized and future awake behaving neurophysiology in this large animal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The hippocampus is central to working and episodic memory and is critically affected by diverse disease processes. In order to investigate hippocampal electrophysiology in translational large animal models, we developed an imaging-free stereotaxis and intraoperative electrophysiology methodology with custom silicon probes to precisely localize probe placement within the hippocampal laminar structure. We report for the first time the profile of single units and local field potentials in the pig dorsal hippocampus and relate them to a histological description. This characterization forms the basis for accessible translational pig models to study diseases of the central nervous system affecting hippocampal circuitry in the large animal gyrencephalic brain, as well as the groundwork for potential awake behaving neurophysiology of the porcine hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Dynamic and Sex-Specific Changes in Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Neuron Activity and Excitability in a Mouse Model of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Reproductive endocrine disorders are prominent co-morbidities of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in both men and women. The neural mechanisms underlying these co-morbidities remain unclear, but hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons may be involved. Here we report the first direct demonstrations of aberrant GnRH neuron function in an animal model of epilepsy. Recordings of GnRH neuron firing and excitability were made in acute mouse brain slices prepared 2 months after intrahippocampal injection of kainate (KA) or control saline, a well-established TLE model in which most females develop co-morbid estrous cycle disruption. GnRH neurons from control females showed elevated firing and excitability on estrus compared with diestrus. By contrast, cells from KA-injected females that developed prolonged, disrupted estrous cycles (KA-long) showed the reverse pattern. Firing rates of cells from KA-injected females that maintained regular cycles (KA-regular) were not different from controls on diestrus, but were reduced on estrus. In KA-injected males, only GnRH neurons in the medial septum displayed elevated firing. In contrast to the diestrus-vs.-estrus and sex-specific changes in firing, GnRH neuron intrinsic excitability was elevated in all KA-injected groups, indicating a role for afferent synaptic and neuromodulatory inputs in shaping overall changes in firing activity. Furthermore, KA-injected females showed cycle-stage-specific changes in circulating sex steroids on diestrus and estrus that also differed between KA-long and KA-regular groups. Together, these findings reveal that the effects of epilepsy on the neural control of reproduction are dynamic across the estrous cycle, distinct in association with co-morbid estrous cycle disruption severity, and sex-specific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; People with epilepsy are at higher risk of reproductive endocrine disorders compared with the general population, but the neural mechanisms linking epilepsy and these co-morbidities are unknown. Here we report changes in the function of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, which control fertility, in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. GnRH neurons from epileptic female mice showed changes in activity dependent on estrous cycle stage and associated with severity of cycle disruption. The impacts of epilepsy on GnRH neurons in males were less severe. These findings provide novel evidence for impacts of epilepsy on GnRH neuron function, and will thus be of clinical relevance in developing new strategies to ameliorate reproductive co-morbidities and to treat the underlying seizures and epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;A brain clock, constituted of ~20,000 peptidergically heterogeneous neurons, is located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). While many peptidergic cell types have been identified, little is known about the connections among these neurons in mice. We first sought to identify contacts among major peptidergic cell types in the SCN using triple-label fluorescent immunocytochemistry. To this end, contacts among vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), and calretinin (CALR) cells of the core, and arginine vasopressin (AVP) and met-enkephalin (ENK) cells of the shell were analyzed. Some core-to-shell and shell-to-core communications are specialized. We found that in wild-type mice, AVP fibers make extremely sparse contacts onto VIP neurons but contacts in the reverse direction are numerous. In contrast, AVP fibers make more contacts onto GRP neurons than conversely. For the other cell types tested, largely reciprocal connections are made. These results point to peptidergic cell type specific communications between core and shell SCN neurons. To further understand the impact of VIP-to-AVP communication, we next explored the SCN in VIP deficient mice (VIP-KO). In these animals, AVP expression is markedly reduced in the SCN, but it is not altered in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei. Surprisingly, in VIP-KO mice, the number of AVP appositions onto other peptidergic cell types is not different from controls. Colchicine administration, which blocks AVP transport, restored numbers of AVP neurons to that of wild-type littermates. The results indicate that VIP has an important role in modulating AVP expression levels in the SCN in this mouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement:&lt;/b&gt; The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) brain clock bears ~20,000 neurons of many peptidergic types. Numerous studies have focused broadly on the core- (VIP-rich) to shell (AVP-rich) areas, leaving aside questions of interconnections among specific peptidergic neuron types. Here we describe contacts between AVP, GRP, VIP, ENK, and CALR SCN peptidergic phenotypes in wild-type mice, and examine changes to these connections consequent to loss of the key core peptide, VIP. Thus, in the absence of VIP, expression of the shell peptide AVP was reduced. The work delineates interrelationships among specific SCN neurons and highlights a complexity in interpreting the consequences of single gene knockouts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Strategic and dynamic temporal weighting for perceptual decisions in humans and macaques</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0169-18.2018v3?rss=1</guid>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Perceptual decision-making is often modeled as the accumulation of sensory evidence over time. Recent studies using psychophysical reverse correlation have shown that even though the sensory evidence is stationary over time, subjects may exhibit a time-varying weighting strategy, weighting some stimulus epochs more heavily than others. While previous work has explained time-varying weighting as a consequence of static decision mechanisms (e.g., decision bound or leak), here we show that time-varying weighting can reflect strategic adaptation to stimulus statistics, and thus can readily take a number of forms. We characterized the temporal weighting strategies of humans and macaques performing a motion discrimination task in which the amount of information carried by motion stimulus was manipulated over time. Both species could adapt their temporal weighting strategy to match the time-varying statistics of the sensory stimulus. When early stimulus epochs had higher mean motion strength than late, subjects adopted a pronounced early weighting strategy, where early information was weighted more heavily in guiding perceptual decisions. When the mean motion strength was greater in later stimulus epochs, in contrast, subjects shifted to a marked late-weighting strategy. These results demonstrate that perceptual decisions involve a temporally flexible weighting process in both humans and monkeys, and introduce a paradigm with which to manipulate sensory stimuli in decision-making tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; During decision-making, the weight assigned by subjects to sensory information over time is not necessarily constant. Such time-varying weighting is often interpreted as a signature of a particular decision-making model (e.g., higher weighting of early stimulus information is consistent with a bounded accumulation process). Temporal weighting may also result, however, from a strategic reweighting of the stimulus evidence itself that takes place before and/or independent of a decision-making mechanism. Here we use a psychophysical reverse correlation paradigm to both measure and manipulate temporal weighting behavior. We demonstrate that both humans and macaques adopt weighting strategies that are flexible, consistent with dynamic reweighing of the sensory stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Characterizing functional brain networks and emotional centers based on Rasa theory of Indian aesthetics. (arXiv:1809.05336v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05336</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05336</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In Indian history of arts, Rasas are the aesthetics associated with any
auditory, visual, literary or musical piece of art that evokes highly
orchestrated emotional states. In this work, we study the functional response
of the brain to movie clippings meant to evoke the Rasas through network
analysis. We extract functional brain networks using coherence measures on EEG
recordings of film clips from popular Indian Bollywood movies representing nine
Rasas in the Indian Natyasastra. Structural and functional network measures
were computed for these brain networks, averaging over a range of significant
edge weights, in different brainwave frequency bands. We identify segregation
of neuronal wiring in the brain into modules using a community detection
algorithm. Further, using mutual information measure, we compare and contrast
the modular organizations of brain network corresponding to different Rasas.
Hubs identified using centrality measure reveal the network nodes that are
central to information propagation across all Rasas. We also observe that the
functional connectivity is suppressed when high-frequency waves such as beta
and gamma are dominant in the brain. The significant links causing differences
between the Rasa pairs are extracted statistically.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Extended temporal association memory by inhibitory Hebbian learning. (arXiv:1809.05254v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05254</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hebbian learning of excitatory synapses plays a central role in storing
activity patterns in associative memory models. Furthermore, interstimulus
Hebbian learning associates multiple items in the brain by converting temporal
correlation to spatial correlation between attractors. However, growing
experimental evidence suggests that learning of inhibitory synapses creates
&quot;inhibitory engrams&quot;, which presumably balance with the patterns encoded in the
excitatory network. Controlling inhibitory engrams may modify the behavior of
associative memory in neural networks, but the consequence of such control has
not been theoretically understood. Noting that Hebbian learning of inhibitory
synapses yields an anti-Hebbian effect, we show that the combination of Hebbian
and anti-Hebbian learning can increase the span of temporal association between
the correlated attractors. The balance of targetted and global inhibition
regulates this span of association in the network. Our results suggest a
nontrivial role of anti-Hebbian learning and inhibitory engrams in associative
memory.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05196</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;For the Research Topic Data Assimilation and Control: Theory and Applications
in Life Sciences we first review the formulation of statistical data
assimilation (SDA) and discuss algorithms for exploring variational
approximations to the conditional expected values of biophysical aspects of
functional neural circuits. Then we report on the application of SDA to (1) the
exploration of properties of individual neurons in the HVC nucleus of the avian
song system, and (2) characterizing individual neurons formulated as very large
scale integration (VLSI) analog circuits with a goal of building functional,
biophysically realistic, VLSI representations of functional nervous systems.
Networks of neurons pose a substantially greater challenge, and we comment on
formulating experiments to probe the properties, especially the functional
connectivity, in song command circuits within HVC.

	<title>eLife: latest articles: The microtubule polymerase Stu2 promotes oligomerization of the γ-TuSC for cytoplasmic microtubule nucleation</title>

	<description>Stu2/XMAP215/ZYG-9/Dis1/Alp14/Msps/ch-TOG family members nucleate microtubules together with γ-tubulin complexes. However, we know little about the interplay of these nucleation factors. Here, we show that the budding yeast Stu2 in complex with the γ-tubulin receptor Spc72 nucleates microtubules &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; without the small γ-tubulin complex (γ-TuSC). Upon γ-TuSC addition, Stu2 facilitates Spc72-γ-TuSC interaction by binding to Spc72 and γ-TuSC. Stu2 together with Spc72-γ-TuSC increases microtubule nucleation depended on the TOG domains of Stu2. Importantly, these activities are also important for microtubule nucleation &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Stu2 stabilizes Spc72-γ-TuSC at the minus end of cytoplasmic microtubules (cMTs) and an &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; assay indicates that cMT nucleation requires the TOG domains of Stu2. Upon γ-tubulin depletion, we observed efficient cMT nucleation away from the SPB, which was dependent on Stu2. Thus, γ-TuSC restricts cMT assembly to the SPB while Stu2 nucleates cMTs together with γ-TuSC and stabilizes γ-TuSC at the cMT minus end.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Patient-specific pulse wave propagation model identifies cardiovascular risk characteristics in hemodialysis patients</title>

Risk of cardiovascular associated death in dialysis patients is the highest among all other co-morbidities. Improving the identification of patients with the highest cardiovascular risk to design an adequate treatment is, therefore, of utmost importance. There are several non-invasive cardiovascular state biomarkers based on the pulse (pressure) wave propagation properties, but their major determinants are not fully understood. In the current study we aimed to provide a framework to precisely dissect the information available in non-invasively recorded pulse wave in hemodialysis patients. Radial pressure wave profiles were recorded before, during and after two independent hemodialysis sessions in 35 anuric prevalent hemodialysis patients and once in a group of 32 healthy volunteers. Each recording was used to estimate six subject-specific parameters of pulse wave propagation model. Pressure profiles were also analyzed using SphygmoCor software (AtCor Medical, Australia) to derive values of already established biomarkers, i.e. augmentation index and sub-endocardial viability ratio (SEVR). Data preprocessing using propensity score matching allowed to compare hemodialysis and healthy groups. Augmentation index remained on average stable at 142 ± 28% during dialysis and had similar values in both considered groups. SEVR, whose pre-dialytic value was on average lower by 12% compared to healthy participants, was improved by hemodialysis, with post-dialytic values indistinguishable from those in healthy population (p-value &amp;gt; 0.2). The model, however, identified that the patients on hemodialysis had significantly increased stiffness of both large and small arteries compared to healthy counterparts (&amp;gt; 60% before dialysis with p-value &amp;lt; 0.05 or borderline) and that it was only transiently decreased during hemodialysis session. Additionally, correlation-based clustering revealed that augmentation index reflects the shape of heart ejection profile and SEVR is associated with stiffness of larger arteries. Patient-specific pulse wave propagation modeling coupled with radial pressure profile recording correctly identified increased arterial stiffness in hemodialysis patients, while regular pulse wave analysis based biomarkers failed to show significant differences. Further model testing in larger populations and investigating other biomarkers are needed to confirm these findings.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VcZwPiWd-zE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Computational models predicting symptomatic progression at the individual level can be highly beneficial for early intervention and treatment planning for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Individual prognosis is complicated by many factors including the definition of the prediction objective itself. In this work, we present a computational framework comprising machine-learning techniques for 1) modeling symptom trajectories and 2) prediction of symptom trajectories using multimodal and longitudinal data. We perform primary analyses on three cohorts from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and a replication analysis using subjects from Australian Imaging, Biomarker &amp;amp; Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL). We model the prototypical symptom trajectory classes using clinical assessment scores from mini-mental state exam (MMSE) and Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-13) at nine timepoints spanned over six years based on a hierarchical clustering approach. Subsequently we predict these trajectory classes for a given subject using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, genetic, and clinical variables from two timepoints (baseline + follow-up). For prediction, we present a longitudinal Siamese neural-network (LSN) with novel architectural modules for combining multimodal data from two timepoints. The trajectory modeling yields two (stable and decline) and three (stable, slow-decline, fast-decline) trajectory classes for MMSE and ADAS-13 assessments, respectively. For the predictive tasks, LSN offers highly accurate performance with 0.900 accuracy and 0.968 AUC for binary MMSE task and 0.760 accuracy for 3-way ADAS-13 task on ADNI datasets, as well as, 0.724 accuracy and 0.883 AUC for binary MMSE task on replication AIBL dataset.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RcadvnqgjYY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Porf-2 = Arhgap39 = Vilse: A Pivotal Role in Neurodevelopment, Learning and Memory</title>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Small GTP converting enzymes, GTPases, are essential for the efficient completion of many physiological and developmental processes. They are regulated by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). &lt;i&gt;Arhgap39&lt;/i&gt;, also known as preoptic regulatory factor-2 (Porf-2) or Vilse, a member of the Rho GAP group, was first identified in 1990 in the rat CNS. It has since been shown to regulate apoptosis, cell migration, neurogenesis and cerebral and hippocampal dendritic spine morphology. It plays a pivotal role in neurodevelopment and learning and memory. Homologous or orthologous genes are found in over 280 vertebrate and invertebrate species suggesting preservation through evolution. Not surprisingly, loss of the &lt;i&gt;Arhgap39/Porf-2&lt;/i&gt; gene in mice manifests as an embryonic lethal condition. Although &lt;i&gt;Arhgap39/Porf-2&lt;/i&gt; is highly expressed in the brain, it is also widely distributed throughout the body, with potential additional roles in oncogenesis and morphogenesis. This review summarizes, for the first time, the known information about this gene under its various names, in addition to considering its transcripts and proteins. The majority of findings described have been made in rats, mice, humans and fruit flies. This work surveys the known functions, functional mediators, variables modifying expression and upstream regulators of expression, and potential physiological and pathological roles of &lt;i&gt;Arhgap39/Porf-2&lt;/i&gt; in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This review comprehensively includes what is currently known about &lt;i&gt;Arhgap39/Porf-2&lt;/i&gt; under its multiple names. Arhgap39 is a critically required molecule for neurodevelopment, learning and memory that is expressed throughout the lifespan. It also has definitive roles in stem cell fate and cell migration, apoptosis and proliferation, in both neural and non-neural sites. Homologous or orthologous genes have been conserved for millennia through evolution with a wide phylogenetic distribution from invertebrates to mammals. Its expression is exquisitely regulated by age, sex, location and hormones. The consequences of dysregulation of &lt;i&gt;Arhgap39&lt;/i&gt; are currently under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Promoter-based genetic recombination (via, e.g., Cre-lox) is most useful when all cells of interest express a particular gene. The discovery that the actin-binding protein advillin is expressed in all somatic sensory neurons has been exploited repeatedly to drive DNA recombination therein, yet specificity of expression has not been well demonstrated. Here, we characterize advillin expression amongst sensory neurons and in several other neural and non-neural tissues. We first validate an advillin antibody against advillin knock-out tissue, advillin promoter-driven EGFP, and advillin mRNA expression. In the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), advillin is enriched in non-peptidergic nociceptors. We also show that advillin expression, and advillin promotor-driven EGFP and Cre-recombinase expression, occurs in multiple tissues including the dorsal habenula of the epithalamus, endocrine cells of the gut, Merkel cells in the skin, and most strikingly, throughout the autonomic nervous system (sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric neurons) in mice, rats, and non-human primates. In the mouse pelvic ganglion, advillin immunoreactivity is most intense in pairs of small neurons, and concentrated in spine-like structures on the axon initial segment contacted by sympathetic preganglionic axons. In autonomic targets (iris and blood vessels), advillin is distributed along cholinergic parasympathetic axons and in sympathetic varicosities. Developmentally, advillin expression is absent from sympathetics at postnatal day 4 but begins to emerge by day 7, accounting for previous reports (based on embryonic expression) of advillin’s specificity to sensory neurons. These results indicate that caution is warranted in interpreting previous studies in which advillin-driven genomic editing is either constitutive or performed after postnatal day 4.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Pharmacoresistant epilepsy is a common neurological disorder in which increased neuronal intrinsic excitability and synaptic excitation lead to pathologically synchronous behavior in the brain. In the majority of experimental and theoretical epilepsy models, epilepsy is associated with reduced inhibition in the pathological neural circuits, yet effects of intrinsic excitability are usually not explicitly analyzed. Here we present a novel neural mass model that includes intrinsic excitability in the form of spike-frequency adaptation in the excitatory population. We validated our model using local field potential data recorded from human hippocampal/subicular slices. We found that synaptic conductances and slow adaptation in the excitatory population both play essential roles for generating seizures and pre-ictal oscillations. Using bifurcation analysis, we found that transitions towards seizure and back to the resting state take place via Andronov-Hopf bifurcations. These simulations therefore suggest that single neuron adaptation as well as synaptic inhibition are responsible for orchestrating seizure dynamics and transition towards the epileptic state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Epileptic seizures are commonly thought to arise from a pathology of inhibition in the brain circuits. Theoretical models aiming to explain epileptic oscillations usually describe the neural activity solely in terms of inhibition and excitation. Single neuron adaptation properties are usually assumed to have only a limited contribution to seizure dynamics. To explore this issue, we developed a novel neural mass model with adaption in the excitatory population. By including adaptation together with inhibition in this model, we were able to account for several experimentally observed properties of seizures, resting state dynamics, and pre-ictal oscillations, leading to improved understanding of epileptic seizures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Foraging as an evidence accumulation process. (arXiv:1809.05023v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05023</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05023</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A canonical foraging task is the patch-leaving problem, in which a forager
must decide to leave a current resource in search for another. Theoretical work
has derived optimal strategies for when to leave a patch, and experiments have
tested for conditions where animals do or do not follow an optimal strategy.
Nevertheless, models of patch-leaving decisions do not consider the imperfect
and noisy sampling process through which an animal gathers information, and how
this process is constrained by neurobiological mechanisms. In this theoretical
study, we formulate an evidence accumulation model of patch-leaving decisions
where the animal averages over noisy measurements to estimate the state of the
current patch and the overall environment. Evidence accumulation models belong
to the class of drift diffusion processes and have been used to model decision
making in different contexts. We solve the model for conditions where foraging
decisions are optimal and equivalent to the marginal value theorem, and perform
simulations to analyze deviations from optimal when these conditions are not
met. By adjusting the drift rate and decision threshold, the model can
represent different strategies, for example an increment-decrement or counting
strategy. These strategies yield identical decisions in the limiting case but
differ in how patch residence times adapt when the foraging environment is
uncertain. To account for sub-optimal decisions, we introduce an
energy-dependent utility function that predicts longer than optimal patch
residence times when food is plentiful. Our model provides a quantitative
connection between ecological models of foraging behavior and evidence
accumulation models of decision making. Moreover, it provides a theoretical
framework for potential experiments which seek to identify neural circuits
underlying patch leaving decisions.

In Bangladesh, the poultry industry is an economically and socially important sector, but it is persistently threatened by the effects of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza. Thus, identifying the optimal control policy in response to an emerging disease outbreak is a key challenge for policy-makers. To inform this aim, a common approach is to carry out simulation studies comparing plausible strategies, while accounting for known capacity restrictions. In this study we perform simulations of a previously developed H5N1 influenza transmission model framework, fitted to two separate historical outbreaks, to assess specific control objectives related to the burden or duration of H5N1 outbreaks among poultry farms in the Dhaka division of Bangladesh. In particular, we explore the optimal implementation of ring culling, ring vaccination and active surveillance measures when presuming disease transmission predominately occurs from premises-to-premises, versus a setting requiring the inclusion of external factors. Additionally, we determine the sensitivity of the management actions under consideration to differing levels of capacity constraints and outbreaks with disparate transmission dynamics. While we find that reactive culling and vaccination policies should pay close attention to these factors to ensure intervention targeting is optimised, across multiple settings the top performing control action amongst those under consideration were targeted proactive surveillance schemes. Our findings may advise the type of control measure, plus its intensity, that could potentially be applied in the event of a developing outbreak of H5N1 amongst originally H5N1 virus-free commercially-reared poultry in the Dhaka division of Bangladesh.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZiihqPruFqU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Integrated Information Theory (IIT) has become nowadays the most sensible general theory of consciousness. In addition to very important statements, it opens the door for an abstract (mathematical) formulation of the theory. Given a mechanism in a particular state, IIT identifies a conscious experience with a conceptual structure, an informational object which exists, is composed of identified parts, is informative, integrated and maximally irreducible. This paper introduces a space-time continuous version of the concept of integrated information. To this aim, a graph and a dynamical systems treatment is used to define, for a given mechanism in a state for which a dynamics is settled, an &lt;i&gt;Informational Structure&lt;/i&gt;, which is associated to the global attractor at each time of the system. By definition, the informational structure determines all the past and future behavior of the system, possesses an informational nature and, moreover, enriches all the points of the phase space with cause-effect power by means of its associated Informational Field. A detailed description of its inner structure by invariants and connections between them allows to associate a transition probability matrix to each informational structure and to develop a measure for the level of integrated information of the system.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dzzK7PEMzuo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Cell cryopreservation improves reproducibility and enables flexibility in experimental design. Although conventional freezing methodologies have been used to preserve primary neurons, poor cell viability and reduced survival severely limited their utility. We screened several high-performance freezing media, and found that CryoStor®10 (CS10) provided superior cryoprotection to primary mouse embryonic cortical neurons compared to other commercially-available or traditional reagents, permitting the recovery of 68.8% of cells relative to a fresh dissection. We characterized developmental, morphometric and functional indicators of neuron maturation, and found that, without exception, neurons recovered from cryostorage in CS10 media faithfully recapitulate &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; neurodevelopment in-step with neurons obtained by fresh dissection. Our method establishes cryopreserved neurons as a reliable, efficient, and equivalent model to fresh neuron cultures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement:&lt;/b&gt; In this study, we have optimized and validated a methodology for the efficient cryopreservation of primary embryonic rodent neurons, yielding cells which are developmentally and functionally similar to fresh neurons. This approach serves as an effective alternative to regularly obtaining neurons by fresh dissection, and thus frees researchers from substantial labor and animal husbandry costs, enables flexibility in experimental timelines, and conserves animals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: A functionally defined in vivo astrocyte population identified by c-Fos activation in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis modulated by S1P signaling: immediate-early astrocytes (ieAstrocytes)</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes have prominent roles in central nervous system (CNS) function and disease, with subpopulations defined primarily by morphologies and molecular markers often determined in cell culture. Here, we identify an &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; astrocyte subpopulation termed &quot;&lt;i&gt;ieAstrocytes&lt;/i&gt; (immediate-early astrocytes)&quot; that is defined by &lt;i&gt;functional&lt;/i&gt; c-Fos activation during CNS disease development. An unbiased screen for CNS cells showing c-Fos activation during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model for multiple sclerosis (MS), was developed by using inducible, TetTag c-Fos reporter mice that label activated cells with a temporally stable, nuclear green fluorescent protein (GFP). Four-dimensional (3-D over time) c-Fos activation maps in the spinal cord were produced by combining tissue clearing (iDISCO) and confocal microscopy that identified onset and expansion of GFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cell populations during EAE. Over 95% of the GFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells showed glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity – in contrast to absent or rare labeling of neurons, microglia, and infiltrating immune cells – which constituted &lt;i&gt;ieAstrocytes&lt;/i&gt; that linearly increased in number with progression of EAE. &lt;i&gt;ieAstrocyte&lt;/i&gt; formation was reduced by either astrocyte-specific genetic removal of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) or pharmacological inhibition by fingolimod (FTY720), an FDA-approved MS medicine that can functionally antagonize S1P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ieAstrocyte&lt;/i&gt;s thus represent a &lt;i&gt;functionally&lt;/i&gt; defined subset of disease-linked astrocytes that are the first and predominant CNS cell population activated during EAE, and that track with disease severity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Their reduction by a disease-modifying agent supports their therapeutic relevance to MS and potentially other neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significant Statement&lt;/b&gt; A new, &lt;i&gt;functionally&lt;/i&gt; defined &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; subpopulation of astrocytes termed &quot;&lt;i&gt;ieAstrocyte&lt;/i&gt;s (immediate-early astrocytes)&quot; was identified as the first and predominant CNS cell type showing c-Fos activation, in an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). &lt;i&gt;ieAstrocyte&lt;/i&gt;s track with disease severity. The approved MS drug, fingolimod (FTY720, an S1P receptor modulator) reduced &lt;i&gt;ieAstrocyte&lt;/i&gt; formation as well as clinical disease. Agents that prevent or reduce &lt;i&gt;ieAstrocytes&lt;/i&gt; could represent a new strategic target for treating MS and other neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Adaptation and inhibition control pathological synchronizawtion in a model of focal epileptic seizure</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Pharmacoresistant epilepsy is a common neurological disorder in which increased neuronal intrinsic excitability and synaptic excitation lead to pathologically synchronous behavior in the brain. In the majority of experimental and theoretical epilepsy models, epilepsy is associated with reduced inhibition in the pathological neural circuits, yet effects of intrinsic excitability are usually not explicitly analyzed. Here we present a novel neural mass model that includes intrinsic excitability in the form of spike-frequency adaptation in the excitatory population. We validated our model using local field potential data recorded from human hippocampal/subicular slices. We found that synaptic conductances and slow adaptation in the excitatory population both play essential roles for generating seizures and pre-ictal oscillations. Using bifurcation analysis, we found that transitions towards seizure and back to the resting state take place via Andronov-Hopf bifurcations. These simulations therefore suggest that single neuron adaptation as well as synaptic inhibition are responsible for orchestrating seizure dynamics and transition towards the epileptic state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Epileptic seizures are commonly thought to arise from a pathology of inhibition in the brain circuits. Theoretical models aiming to explain epileptic oscillations usually describe the neural activity solely in terms of inhibition and excitation. Single neuron adaptation properties are usually assumed to have only a limited contribution to seizure dynamics. To explore this issue, we developed a novel neural mass model with adaption in the excitatory population. By including adaptation together with inhibition in this model, we were able to account for several experimentally observed properties of seizures, resting state dynamics, and pre-ictal oscillations, leading to improved understanding of epileptic seizures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Mechanisms underlying astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation in depression remain unclear. Menin regulates NF-κB activity in astrocytes to promote neuroinflammation. Clinically, a MEN1 SNP is associated with the onset of depression. This study reveals a distinct role for menin in neuroinflammation and depression.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Selective ion permeation involves complexation with carboxylates and lysine in a model human sodium channel</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Emelie Flood, Céline Boiteux, Toby W. Allen&lt;/p&gt;

Bacterial and human voltage-gated sodium channels (Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;s) exhibit similar cation selectivity, despite their distinct EEEE and DEKA selectivity filter signature sequences. Recent high-resolution structures for bacterial Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;s have allowed us to learn about ion conduction mechanisms in these simpler homo-tetrameric channels, but our understanding of the function of their mammalian counterparts remains limited. To probe these conduction mechanisms, a model of the human Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 channel has been constructed by grafting residues of its selectivity filter and external vestibular region onto the bacterial Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;Rh channel with atomic-resolution structure. Multi-μs fully atomistic simulations capture long time-scale ion and protein movements associated with the permeation of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, and their differences. We observe a Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion knock-on conduction mechanism facilitated by low energy multi-carboxylate/multi-Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; complexes, akin to the bacterial channels. These complexes involve both the DEKA and vestibular EEDD rings, acting to draw multiple Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; into the selectivity filter and promote permeation. When the DEKA ring lysine is protonated, we observe that its ammonium group is actively participating in Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; permeation, presuming the role of another ion. It participates in the formation of a stable complex involving carboxylates that collectively bind both Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and the Lys ammonium group in a high-field strength site, permitting pass-by translocation of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. In contrast, multiple K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion complexes with the DEKA and EEDD rings are disfavored by up to 8.3 kcal/mol, with the K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-lysine-carboxylate complex non-existent. As a result, lysine acts as an electrostatic plug that partially blocks the flow of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, which must instead wait for isomerization of lysine downward to clear the path for K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; passage. These distinct mechanisms give us insight into the nature of ion conduction and selectivity in human Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; channels, while uncovering high field strength carboxylate binding complexes that define the more general phenomenon of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-selective ion transport in nature.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/67OG9qpOaY0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Dynamic and Sex-Specific Changes in Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Neuron Activity and Excitability in a Mouse Model of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Reproductive endocrine disorders are prominent co-morbidities of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in both men and women. The neural mechanisms underlying these co-morbidities remain unclear, but hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons may be involved. Here we report the first direct demonstrations of aberrant GnRH neuron function in an animal model of epilepsy. Recordings of GnRH neuron firing and excitability were made in acute mouse brain slices prepared 2 months after intrahippocampal injection of kainate (KA) or control saline, a well-established TLE model in which most females develop co-morbid estrous cycle disruption. GnRH neurons from control females showed elevated firing and excitability on estrus compared with diestrus. By contrast, cells from KA-injected females that developed prolonged, disrupted estrous cycles (KA-long) showed the reverse pattern. Firing rates of cells from KA-injected females that maintained regular cycles (KA-regular) were not different from controls on diestrus, but were reduced on estrus. In KA-injected males, only GnRH neurons in the medial septum displayed elevated firing. In contrast to the diestrus-vs.-estrus and sex-specific changes in firing, GnRH neuron intrinsic excitability was elevated in all KA-injected groups, indicating a role for afferent synaptic and neuromodulatory inputs in shaping overall changes in firing activity. Furthermore, KA-injected females showed cycle-stage-specific changes in circulating sex steroids on diestrus and estrus that also differed between KA-long and KA-regular groups. Together, these findings reveal that the effects of epilepsy on the neural control of reproduction are dynamic across the estrous cycle, distinct in association with co-morbid estrous cycle disruption severity, and sex-specific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; People with epilepsy are at higher risk of reproductive endocrine disorders compared with the general population, but the neural mechanisms linking epilepsy and these co-morbidities are unknown. Here we report changes in the function of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, which control fertility, in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. GnRH neurons from epileptic female mice showed changes in activity dependent on estrous cycle stage and associated with severity of cycle disruption. The impacts of epilepsy on GnRH neurons in males were less severe. These findings provide novel evidence for impacts of epilepsy on GnRH neuron function, and will thus be of clinical relevance in developing new strategies to ameliorate reproductive co-morbidities and to treat the underlying seizures and epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Strategic and dynamic temporal weighting for perceptual decisions in humans and macaques</title>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Perceptual decision-making is often modeled as the accumulation of sensory evidence over time. Recent studies using psychophysical reverse correlation have shown that even though the sensory evidence is stationary over time, subjects may exhibit a time-varying weighting strategy, weighting some stimulus epochs more heavily than others. While previous work has explained time-varying weighting as a consequence of static decision mechanisms (e.g., decision bound or leak), here we show that time-varying weighting can reflect strategic adaptation to stimulus statistics, and thus can readily take a number of forms. We characterized the temporal weighting strategies of humans and macaques performing a motion discrimination task in which the amount of information carried by motion stimulus was manipulated over time. Both species could adapt their temporal weighting strategy to match the time-varying statistics of the sensory stimulus. When early stimulus epochs had higher mean motion strength than late, subjects adopted a pronounced early weighting strategy, where early information was weighted more heavily in guiding perceptual decisions. When the mean motion strength was greater in later stimulus epochs, in contrast, subjects shifted to a marked late-weighting strategy. These results demonstrate that perceptual decisions involve a temporally flexible weighting process in both humans and monkeys, and introduce a paradigm with which to manipulate sensory stimuli in decision-making tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; During decision-making, the weight assigned by subjects to sensory information over time is not necessarily constant. Such time-varying weighting is often interpreted as a signature of a particular decision-making model (e.g., higher weighting of early stimulus information is consistent with a bounded accumulation process). Temporal weighting may also result, however, from a strategic reweighting of the stimulus evidence itself that takes place before and/or independent of a decision-making mechanism. Here we use a psychophysical reverse correlation paradigm to both measure and manipulate temporal weighting behavior. We demonstrate that both humans and macaques adopt weighting strategies that are flexible, consistent with dynamic reweighing of the sensory stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Autophosphorylated CaMKII Facilitates Spike Propagation in Rat Optic Nerve</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Repeated spike firing can transmit information at synapses and modulate spike timing, shape, and conduction velocity. These latter effects have been found to result from voltage-induced changes in ion currents and could alter the signals carried by axons. Here, we test whether Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) regulates spike propagation in adult rat optic nerve. We find that small-, medium-, and large-diameter axons bind anti-Thr286-phosphorylated CaMKII (pT286) antibodies and that, in isolated optic nerves, electrical stimulation reduces pT286 levels, spike propagation is hastened by CaMKII autophosphorylation and slowed by CaMKII dephosphorylation, single and multiple spikes slow propagation of subsequently activated spikes, and more frequent stimulation produces greater slowing. Likewise, exposing freely moving animals to flickering illumination reduces pT286 levels in optic nerves and electrically eliciting spikes &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in either the optic nerve or optic chiasm slows subsequent spike propagation in the optic nerve. By increasing the time that elapses between successive spikes as they propagate, pT286 dephosphorylation and activity-induced spike slowing reduce the frequency of propagated spikes below the frequency at which they were elicited and would thus limit the frequency at which axons synaptically drive target neurons. Consistent with this, the ability of retinal ganglion cells to drive at least some lateral geniculate neurons has been found to increase when presented with light flashes at low and moderate temporal frequencies but less so at high frequencies. Activity-induced decreases in spike frequency may also reduce the energy required to maintain normal intracellular Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; By propagating along axons at constant velocities, spikes could drive synapses as frequently as they are initiated. However, the onset of spiking has been found to alter the conduction velocity of subsequent (&quot;follower&quot;) spikes in various preparations. Here, we find that spikes reduce spike frequency in rat optic nerve by slowing follower spike propagation and that electrically stimulated spiking &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; and spike-generating flickering illumination &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; produce net decreases in axonal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) autophosphorylation. Consistent with these effects, propagation speed increases and decreases, respectively, with CaMKII autophosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Lowering spike frequency by CaMKII dephosphorylation is a novel consequence of axonal spiking and light adaptation that could decrease synaptic gain as stimulus frequency increases and may also reduce energy use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Drosophila Exo70 Is Essential for Neurite Extension and Survival under Thermal Stress</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/37/8071?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The octomeric exocyst complex governs the final step of exocytosis in both plants and animals. Its roles, however, extend beyond exocytosis and include organelle biogenesis, ciliogenesis, cell migration, and cell growth. Exo70 is a conserved component of the exocyst whose function in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; is unclear. In this study, we characterized two mutant alleles of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila exo70. exo70&lt;/i&gt; mutants exhibit reduced synaptic growth, locomotor activity, glutamate receptor density, and mEPSP amplitude. We found that presynaptic Exo70 is necessary for normal synaptic growth at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). At the neuromuscular junction, &lt;i&gt;exo70&lt;/i&gt; genetically interacts with the small GTPase &lt;i&gt;ralA&lt;/i&gt; to regulate synaptic growth. Loss of Exo70 leads to the blockage of JNK signaling-, activity-, and temperature-induced synaptic outgrowths. We showed that this phenotype is associated with an impairment of integral membrane protein transport to the cell surface at synaptic terminals. In octopaminergic motor neurons, Exo70 is detected in synaptic varicosities, as well as the regions of membrane extensions in response to activity stimulation. Strikingly, mild thermal stress causes severe neurite outgrowth defects and pharate adult lethality in &lt;i&gt;exo70&lt;/i&gt; mutants. &lt;i&gt;exo70&lt;/i&gt; mutants also display defective locomotor activity in response to starvation stress. These results demonstrated that Exo70 is an important regulator of induced synaptic growth and is crucial for an organism's adaptation to environmental changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The exocyst complex is a conserved protein complex directing secretory vesicles to the site of membrane fusion during exocytosis, which is essential for transporting proteins and membranes to the cell surface. Exo70 is a subunit of the exocyst complex whose roles in neurons remain elusive, and its function in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; is unclear. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, Exo70 is expressed in both glutamatergic and octopaminergic neurons, and presynaptic Exo70 regulates synaptic outgrowth. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;exo70&lt;/i&gt; mutants have impaired integral membrane transport to the cell surface at synaptic terminals and block several kinds of induced synaptic growth. Remarkably, elevated temperature causes severe arborization defects and lethality in &lt;i&gt;exo70&lt;/i&gt; mutants, thus underpinning the importance of Exo70 functions in development and adaptation to the environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Inhibitory Neuron Activity Contributions to Hemodynamic Responses and Metabolic Load Examined Using an Inhibitory Optogenetic Mouse Model</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Hemodynamic signals are routinely used to noninvasively assess brain function in humans and animals. This work examined the contribution of inhibitory neuron activity on hemodynamic responses captured by changes in blood flow, volume and oxygenation in the cortex of lightly anesthetized mice. Because cortical activity is not commonly initiated by inhibitory neurons, experiments were conducted to examine the neuronal activity properties elicited by photo-stimulation. We observed comparable increases in neuronal activity evoked by forelimb and photo-stimulation; however, significantly larger increases in blood flow and volume were produced by photo-stimulation of inhibitory neurons compared with forelimb stimulation. Following blockade of glutamate and GABA-A receptors to reduce postsynaptic activity contributions, neuronal activity was reliably modulated and hemodynamic changes persisted, though slightly reduced. More importantly, photo-stimulation-evoked changes in blood flow and volume were suppressed by 75–80% with the administration of a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, suggesting that inhibitory neurons regulate blood flow mostly via nitric oxide. Lastly, forelimb and photo-stimulation of excitatory neurons produced local decreases in blood oxygenation, while large increases were generated by photo-stimulation of inhibitory neurons. Estimates of oxygen metabolism suggest that inhibitory neuron activity has a small impact on tissue metabolic load, indicating a mismatch between the metabolic demand and blood flow regulation properties of inhibitory and excitatory neurons.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Dentate Granule Neurons Generated During Perinatal Life Display Distinct Morphological Features Compared With Later-Born Neurons in the Mouse Hippocampus</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;In nonhuman mammals and in particular in rodents, most granule neurons of the dentate gyrus (DG) are generated during development and yet little is known about their properties compared with adult-born neurons. Although it is generally admitted that these populations are morphologically indistinguishable once mature, a detailed analysis of developmentally born neurons is lacking. Here, we used in vivo electroporation to label dentate granule cells (DGCs) generated in mouse embryos (E14.5) or in neonates (P0) and followed their morphological development up to 6 months after birth. By comparison with mature retrovirus-labeled DGCs born at weaning (P21) or young adult (P84) stages, we provide the evidence that perinatally born neurons, especially embryonically born cells, are morphologically distinct from later-born neurons and are thus easily distinguishable. In addition, our data indicate that semilunar and hilar GCs, 2 populations in ectopic location, are generated during the embryonic and the neonatal periods, respectively. Thus, our findings provide new insights into the development of the different populations of GCs in the DG and open new questions regarding their function in the brain.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Priority Switches in Visual Working Memory are Supported by Frontal Delta and Posterior Alpha Interactions</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Visual working memory (VWM) distinguishes between representations relevant for imminent versus future perceptual goals. We investigated how the brain sequentially prioritizes visual working memory representations that serve consecutive tasks. Observers remembered two targets for a sequence of two visual search tasks, thus making one target currently relevant, and the other prospectively relevant. We show that during the retention interval prior to the first search, lateralized parieto-occipital EEG alpha (8–14 Hz) suppression is stronger for current compared with prospective search targets. Crucially, between the first and second search task, this difference in posterior alpha lateralization reverses, reflecting the change in priority states of the two target representations. Connectivity analyses indicate that this switch in posterior alpha lateralization is driven by frontal delta/low-theta (2–6 Hz) activity. Moreover, this frontal low-frequency signal also predicts task performance after the switch. We thus obtained evidence for large-scale network interactions underlying the flexible shifting between the priority states of multiple memory representations in VWM.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Frontoparietal Networks Mediate the Behavioral Impact of Alpha Inhibition in Visual Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Alpha oscillations are known to play a central role in the functional inhibition of visual cortices, but the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. One noninvasive method for modulating alpha activity experimentally is through the use of flickering visual stimuli that “entrain” visual cortices. Such alpha entrainment has been found to compromise visual perception and affect widespread cortical regions, but it remains unclear how the interference occurs and whether the widespread activity induced by alpha entrainment reflects a compensatory mechanism to mitigate the entrainment, or alternatively, a propagated interference signal that translates to impaired visual processing. Herein, we attempt to address these questions by integrating alpha entrainment into a modified Posner cueing paradigm, while measuring the underlying dynamics using magnetoencephalography. Our findings indicated that alpha entrainment is negatively related to task performance, such that as neural entrainment increases on the attended side (relative to the unattended side) accuracy decreases. Further, this attentional biasing is found to covary robustly with activity in the frontoparietal attention network. Critically, the observed negative entrainment effect on task accuracy was also fully mediated by activity in frontoparietal regions, signifying a propagation of the interfering alpha entrainment signal from bottom-up sensory to top-down regulatory networks.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;People who score higher on intelligence tests tend to have larger brains. Twin studies suggest the same genetic factors influence both brain size and intelligence. This has led to the hypothesis that genetics influence intelligence partly by contributing to the development of larger brains. We tested this hypothesis using four large imaging genetics studies (combined &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 7965) with polygenic scores derived from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of educational attainment, a correlate of intelligence. We conducted meta-analysis to test associations among participants’ genetics, total brain volume (i.e., brain size), and cognitive test performance. Consistent with previous findings, participants with higher polygenic scores achieved higher scores on cognitive tests, as did participants with larger brains. Participants with higher polygenic scores also had larger brains. We found some evidence that brain size partly mediated associations between participants’ education polygenic scores and their cognitive test performance. Effect sizes were larger in the population-based samples than in the convenience-based samples. Recruitment and retention of population-representative samples should be a priority for neuroscience research. Findings suggest promise for studies integrating GWAS discoveries with brain imaging to understand neurobiology linking genetics with cognitive performance.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Sergi Elizalde, Ashley M. Laughney, Samuel F. Bakhoum&lt;/p&gt;

Cancer cells frequently undergo chromosome missegregation events during mitosis, whereby the copies of a given chromosome are not distributed evenly among the two daughter cells, thus creating cells with heterogeneous karyotypes. A stochastic model tracing cellular karyotypes derived from clonal populations over hundreds of generations was recently developed and experimentally validated, and it was capable of predicting favorable karyotypes frequently observed in cancer. Here, we construct and study a Markov chain that precisely describes karyotypic evolution during clonally expanding cancer cell populations. The Markov chain allows us to directly predict the distribution of karyotypes and the expected size of the tumor after many cell divisions without resorting to computationally expensive simulations. We determine the limiting karyotype distribution of an evolving tumor population, and quantify its dependency on several key parameters including the initial karyotype of the founder cell, the rate of whole chromosome missegregation, and chromosome-specific cell viability. Using this model, we confirm the existence of an optimal rate of chromosome missegregation probabilities that maximizes karyotypic heterogeneity, while minimizing the occurrence of nullisomy. Interestingly, karyotypic heterogeneity is significantly more dependent on chromosome missegregation probabilities rather than the number of cell divisions, so that maximal heterogeneity can be reached rapidly (within a few hundred generations of cell division) at chromosome missegregation rates commonly observed in cancer cell lines. Conversely, at low missegregation rates, heterogeneity is constrained even after thousands of cell division events. This leads us to conclude that chromosome copy number heterogeneity is primarily constrained by chromosome missegregation rates and the risk for nullisomy and less so by the age of the tumor. This model enables direct integration of karyotype information into existing models of tumor evolution based on somatic mutations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Wd2yu28uKWQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Dynamic and Sex-Specific Changes in Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Neuron Activity and Excitability in a Mouse Model of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Reproductive endocrine disorders are prominent co-morbidities of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in both men and women. The neural mechanisms underlying these co-morbidities remain unclear, but hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons may be involved. Here we report the first direct demonstrations of aberrant GnRH neuron function in an animal model of epilepsy. Recordings of GnRH neuron firing and excitability were made in acute mouse brain slices prepared 2 months after intrahippocampal injection of kainate (KA) or control saline, a well-established TLE model in which most females develop co-morbid estrous cycle disruption. GnRH neurons from control females showed elevated firing and excitability on estrus compared with diestrus. By contrast, cells from KA-injected females that developed prolonged, disrupted estrous cycles (KA-long) showed the reverse pattern. Firing rates of cells from KA-injected females that maintained regular cycles (KA-regular) were not different from controls on diestrus, but were reduced on estrus. In KA-injected males, only GnRH neurons in the medial septum displayed elevated firing. In contrast to the diestrus-vs.-estrus and sex-specific changes in firing, GnRH neuron intrinsic excitability was elevated in all KA-injected groups, indicating a role for afferent synaptic and neuromodulatory inputs in shaping overall changes in firing activity. Furthermore, KA-injected females showed cycle-stage-specific changes in circulating sex steroids on diestrus and estrus that also differed between KA-long and KA-regular groups. Together, these findings reveal that the effects of epilepsy on the neural control of reproduction are dynamic across the estrous cycle, distinct in association with co-morbid estrous cycle disruption severity, and sex-specific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; People with epilepsy are at higher risk of reproductive endocrine disorders compared with the general population, but the neural mechanisms linking epilepsy and these co-morbidities are unknown. Here we report changes in the function of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, which control fertility, in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. GnRH neurons from epileptic female mice showed changes in activity dependent on estrous cycle stage and associated with severity of cycle disruption. The impacts of epilepsy on GnRH neurons in males were less severe. These findings provide novel evidence for impacts of epilepsy on GnRH neuron function, and will thus be of clinical relevance in developing new strategies to ameliorate reproductive co-morbidities and to treat the underlying seizures and epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Strategic and dynamic temporal weighting for perceptual decisions in humans and macaques</title>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Perceptual decision-making is often modeled as the accumulation of sensory evidence over time. Recent studies using psychophysical reverse correlation have shown that even though the sensory evidence is stationary over time, subjects may exhibit a time-varying weighting strategy, weighting some stimulus epochs more heavily than others. While previous work has explained time-varying weighting as a consequence of static decision mechanisms (e.g., decision bound or leak), here we show that time-varying weighting can reflect strategic adaptation to stimulus statistics, and thus can readily take a number of forms. We characterized the temporal weighting strategies of humans and macaques performing a motion discrimination task in which the amount of information carried by motion stimulus was manipulated over time. Both species could adapt their temporal weighting strategy to match the time-varying statistics of the sensory stimulus. When early stimulus epochs had higher mean motion strength than late, subjects adopted a pronounced early weighting strategy, where early information was weighted more heavily in guiding perceptual decisions. When the mean motion strength was greater in later stimulus epochs, in contrast, subjects shifted to a marked late-weighting strategy. These results demonstrate that perceptual decisions involve a temporally flexible weighting process in both humans and monkeys, and introduce a paradigm with which to manipulate sensory stimuli in decision-making tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; During decision-making, the weight assigned by subjects to sensory information over time is not necessarily constant. Such time-varying weighting is often interpreted as a signature of a particular decision-making model (e.g., higher weighting of early stimulus information is consistent with a bounded accumulation process). Temporal weighting may also result, however, from a strategic reweighting of the stimulus evidence itself that takes place before and/or independent of a decision-making mechanism. Here we use a psychophysical reverse correlation paradigm to both measure and manipulate temporal weighting behavior. We demonstrate that both humans and macaques adopt weighting strategies that are flexible, consistent with dynamic reweighing of the sensory stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Loss of Mecp2 causes atypical synaptic and molecular plasticity of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons reflecting rett syndrome-like sensorimotor defects</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Rett syndrome (RTT) is caused in most cases by loss-of-function mutations in the X-linked gene encoding methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (&lt;i&gt;MECP2&lt;/i&gt;). Understanding the pathological processes impacting sensory-motor control represents a major challenge for clinical management of individuals affected by RTT, but the underlying molecular and neuronal modifications remain unclear. We find that symptomatic male &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; knockout (KO) mice show atypically elevated parvalbumin (PV) expression in both somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortices together with excessive excitatory inputs converging onto PV-expressing interneurons (INs). In accordance, high-speed voltage-sensitive dye imaging shows reduced amplitude and spatial spread of synaptically induced neuronal depolarizations in S1 of &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; KO mice. Moreover, motor learning-dependent changes of PV expression and structural synaptic plasticity typically occurring on PV+ INs in M1 are impaired in symptomatic &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; KO mice. Finally, we find similar abnormalities of PV networks plasticity in symptomatic female &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mice. These results indicate that in &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; mutant mice the configuration of PV+ INs network is shifted toward an atypical plasticity state in relevant cortical areas compatible with the sensory-motor dysfunctions characteristics of RTT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Understanding the pathological processes impacting somatosensory processing and motor control represents a major challenge for clinical management of individuals affected by Rett syndrome. We found that &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; is important, starting from young age, for the correct molecular and synaptic organization of parvalbumin-positive interneurons in cortical areas responsible for sensory-motor skills. Intriguingly, even partial &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; loss produces an atypical upregulation of parvalbumin expression in these cells that correlates with the severity of motor behavioral impairments and is associated with defective cortical activity in KO mice. Because in behaviorally impaired &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; KO mice excessive activity-dependent excitatory connectivity is established with these interneurons, our study suggests that partial inhibition of parvalbumin-positive cells would be beneficial for motor impairments in Rett syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Assessment of mutation probabilities of KRAS G12 missense mutants and their long-timescale dynamics by atomistic molecular simulations and Markov state modeling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006458</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Tatu Pantsar, Sami Rissanen, Daniel Dauch, Tuomo Laitinen, Ilpo Vattulainen, Antti Poso&lt;/p&gt;

A mutated KRAS protein is frequently observed in human cancers. Traditionally, the oncogenic properties of KRAS missense mutants at position 12 (G12X) have been considered as equal. Here, by assessing the probabilities of occurrence of all &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt; G12X mutations and KRAS dynamics we show that this assumption does not hold true. Instead, our findings revealed an outstanding mutational bias. We conducted a thorough mutational analysis of &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt; G12X mutations and assessed to what extent the observed mutation frequencies follow a random distribution. Unique tissue-specific frequencies are displayed with specific mutations, especially with G12R, which cannot be explained by random probabilities. To clarify the underlying causes for the nonrandom probabilities, we conducted extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulations (170 μs) to study the differences of G12X mutations on a molecular level. The simulations revealed an allosteric hydrophobic signaling network in KRAS, and that protein dynamics is altered among the G12X mutants and as such differs from the wild-type and is mutation-specific. The shift in long-timescale conformational dynamics was confirmed with Markov state modeling. A G12X mutation was found to modify KRAS dynamics in an allosteric way, which is especially manifested in the switch regions that are responsible for the effector protein binding. The findings provide a basis to understand better the oncogenic properties of KRAS G12X mutants and the consequences of the observed nonrandom frequencies of specific G12X mutations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wdtS34DOZ6k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Fridolin Gross, Paolo Bonaiuti, Silke Hauf, Andrea Ciliberto&lt;/p&gt;

The mitotic checkpoint (also called spindle assembly checkpoint) is a signaling pathway that ensures faithful chromosome segregation. Mitotic checkpoint proteins inhibit the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) and its activator Cdc20 to prevent precocious anaphase. Checkpoint signaling leads to a complex of APC/C, Cdc20, and checkpoint proteins, in which the APC/C is inactive. In principle, this final product of the mitotic checkpoint can be obtained via different pathways, whose relevance still needs to be fully ascertained experimentally. Here, we use mathematical models to compare the implications on checkpoint response of the possible pathways leading to APC/C inhibition. We identify a previously unrecognized funneling effect for Cdc20, which favors Cdc20 incorporation into the inhibitory complex and therefore promotes checkpoint activity. Furthermore, we find that the presence or absence of one specific assembly reaction determines whether the checkpoint remains functional at elevated levels of Cdc20, which can occur in cancer cells. Our results reveal the inhibitory logics behind checkpoint activity, predict checkpoint efficiency in perturbed situations, and could inform molecular strategies to treat malignancies that exhibit Cdc20 overexpression.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/u46AEAiwxjk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Comparing two classes of biological distribution systems using network analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006428</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Lia Papadopoulos, Pablo Blinder, Henrik Ronellenfitsch, Florian Klimm, Eleni Katifori, David Kleinfeld, Danielle S. Bassett&lt;/p&gt;

Distribution networks—from vasculature to urban transportation pathways—are spatially embedded networks that must route resources efficiently in the face of pressures induced by the costs of building and maintaining network infrastructure. Such requirements are thought to constrain the topological and spatial organization of these systems, but at the same time, different kinds of distribution networks may exhibit variable architectural features within those general constraints. In this study, we use methods from network science to compare and contrast two classes of biological transport networks: mycelial fungi and vasculature from the surface of rodent brains. These systems differ in terms of their growth and transport mechanisms, as well as the environments in which they typically exist. Though both types of networks have been studied independently, the goal of this study is to quantify similarities and differences in their network designs. We begin by characterizing the structural backbone of these systems with a collection of measures that assess various kinds of network organization across topological and spatial scales, ranging from measures of loop density, to those that quantify connected pathways between different network regions, and hierarchical organization. Most importantly, we next carry out a network analysis that directly considers the spatial embedding and properties especially relevant to the function of distribution systems. We find that although both the vasculature and mycelia are highly constrained planar networks, there are clear distinctions in how they balance tradeoffs in network measures of wiring length, efficiency, and robustness. While the vasculature appears well organized for low cost, but relatively high efficiency, the mycelia tend to form more expensive but in turn more robust networks. As a whole, this work demonstrates the utility of network-based methods to identify both common features and variations in the network structure of different classes of biological transport systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7ImdF3ExyLk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Precisely wired neuronal circuits process sensory information in a learning- and context-dependent manner in order to govern behavior. Simple sensory decision-making tasks in rodents are now beginning to reveal the contributions of distinct cell types and brain regions participating in the conversion of sensory information into learned goal-directed motor output. Task learning is accompanied by target-specific routing of sensory information to specific downstream cortical regions, with higher-order cortical regions such as the posterior parietal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus appearing to play important roles in learning- and context-dependent processing of sensory input.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: GSK3β Inhibition Restores Impaired Neurogenesis in Preterm Neonates With Intraventricular Hemorrhage</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy217</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy217/5091396?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a common complication of prematurity in infants born at 23–28 weeks of gestation. Survivors exhibit impaired growth of the cerebral cortex and neurodevelopmental sequeale, but the underlying mechanism(s) are obscure. Previously, we have shown that neocortical neurogenesis continues until at least 28 gestational weeks. This renders the prematurely born infants vulnerable to impaired neurogenesis. Here, we hypothesized that neurogenesis is impaired by IVH, and that signaling through GSK3β, a critical intracellular kinase regulated by Wnt and other pathways, mediates this effect. These hypotheses were tested observationally in autopsy specimens from premature infants, and experimentally in a premature rabbit IVH model. Significantly, in premature infants with IVH, the number of neurogenic cortical progenitor cells was reduced compared with infants without IVH, indicating acutely decreased neurogenesis. This finding was corroborated in the rabbit IVH model, which further demonstrated reduction of upper layer cortical neurons after longer survival. Both the acute reduction of neurogenic progenitors, and the subsequent decrease of upper layer neurons, were rescued by treatment with AR-A014418, a specific inhibitor of GSK3β. Together, these results indicate that IVH impairs late stages of cortical neurogenesis, and suggest that treatment with GSK3β inhibitors may enhance neurodevelopment in premature infants with IVH.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Cooperation Makes a Group be More Creative</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy215</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy215/5091390?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;This study investigated how cooperative and competitive interaction modes affect the group creative performance. The participants were recruited as dyads to solve 2 problems either demanding divergent thinking (alternative uses task, AUT) or not (object characteristic task, OCT). The dyads solved 1 of the 2 problems in the cooperative mode and the other in the competitive mode. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based hyperscanning was used to record their neural activities in the prefrontal and right temporal–parietal junction (r-TPJ) regions. Results revealed the dyads showed higher AUT fluency, AUT originality, OCT fluency, and cooperation level in the cooperative mode than in the competitive mode. The fNIRS data revealed increased (task-baseline) interpersonal brain synchronization (IBS) in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (r-DLPFC) and r-TPJ, only for dyads in the AUT/cooperation condition. In both r-DLPFC and r-TPJ, the IBS of dyads in the AUT/cooperation condition was stronger than in the AUT/competition and OCT/cooperation. Moreover, a stronger IBS was evoked between the regions in prefrontal and posterior temporal regions in the AUT/cooperation condition, as compared with the competition mode. These findings suggest that enhanced IBS may underlie the positive effects of cooperation as compared with the competition in terms of group creativity.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Anticholinergic Amnesia is Mediated by Alterations in Human Network Connectivity Architecture</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy214</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy214/5091393?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Disrupted cholinergic neurotransmission plays a central role in Alzheimer’s disease, medication-induced memory impairment, and delirium. At the systems level, this suggests anticholinergic drugs may alter the activity and interplay of anatomically distributed neural networks critical for memory function. Using a network-sensitive imaging technique (functional connectivity MRI) and a double-blind, crossover design, we examined the consequences of anticholinergic drug administration on episodic memory and functional network architecture in a group of clinically normal elderly. We observed that low-dose scopolamine (0.2 mg IV) decreased episodic memory performance and selectively decreased connectivity strength in 3 of 7 cortical networks. Both memory and connectivity effects were independent of β-amyloid burden. Drug-induced connectivity changes within the Default and Salience networks, as well as reductions in the strength of anticorrelation between these 2 networks, were sufficient to fully statistically mediate the effects of scopolamine on memory performance. These results provide experimental support for the importance of the Default and Salience networks to memory performance and suggest scopolamine-induced amnesia is underpinned by disrupted connectivity within and between these 2 networks. More broadly, these results support the potential utility of fcMRI as tool examine the systems-level pharmacology of psychoactive drugs.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: It’s All in the Details: Relations Between Young Children’s Developing Pattern Separation Abilities and Hippocampal Subfield Volumes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy211</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy211/5091386?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The ability to keep similar experiences separate in memory is critical for forming unique and lasting memories, as many events share overlapping features (e.g., birthday parties, holidays). Research on memory in young children suggests their memories often lack high-resolution details, i.e., show impoverished pattern separation (PS). Recently developed assessments of PS suitable for children allow us to relate the formation of distinct, detailed memories for the development of the hippocampus, a neural structure critical for this ability in adults. The hippocampus displays a protracted developmental profile and underlies the ability to form detailed memories. This study examined age-related differences in hippocampal subfield volumes in 4- to 8-year-old children and relations with performance on a mnemonic similarity task (MST) designed to index memory specificity. Results revealed age-moderated associations between MST performance and cornu ammonis 2-4/dentate gyrus subfields. Specifically, age-related differences in the ability to form detailed memories tracked with normative patterns of volume increases followed by reductions over this age range. That is, greater volume correlated with better performance in younger children, whereas smaller volume correlated with better performance in older children. These findings support the hypothesis that developmental differences in hippocampal circuitry contribute to age-related improvements in detailed memory formation during this period.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: In Vivo Femtosecond Laser Subsurface Cortical Microtransections Attenuate Acute Rat Focal Seizures</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy210</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy210/5091391?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Recent evidence shows that seizures propagate primarily through supragranular cortical layers. To selectively modify these circuits, we developed a new technique using tightly focused, femtosecond infrared laser pulses to make as small as ~100 µm-wide subsurface cortical incisions surrounding an epileptic focus. We use this “laser scalpel” to produce subsurface cortical incisions selectively to supragranular layers surrounding an epileptic focus in an acute rodent seizure model. Compared with sham animals, these microtransections completely blocked seizure initiation and propagation in 1/3 of all animals. In the remaining animals, seizure frequency was reduced by 2/3 and seizure propagation reduced by 1/3. In those seizures that still propagated, it was delayed and reduced in amplitude. When the recording electrode was inside the partially isolated cube and the seizure focus was on the outside, the results were even more striking. In spite of these microtransections, somatosensory responses to tail stimulation were maintained but with reduced amplitude. Our data show that just a single enclosing wall of laser cuts limited to supragranular layers led to a significant reduction in seizure initiation and propagation with preserved cortical function. Modification of this concept may be a useful treatment for human epilepsy.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>Active intracellular transport of organelles relies on the coordinated activities of cytoplasmic dynein and kinesin, ATP-dependent microtubule motor proteins. While axonemal dynein was discovered during the mid-1960s, it was not until the mid-1980s that kinesin was discovered by Ron Vale and colleagues, as reported in 1985. Their research demonstrated that the newly identified protein, isolated from both squid axoplasm and bovine brain, was independently capable of driving microtubule gliding or organelle movement.</description>

	<description>Using new methods to functionally dissect circuits, two papers from 2015 found enhanced synaptic properties of the inputs and outputs of hippocampal adult-born neurons specifically during a critical period of their development. These studies provided a circuit-level view of unique roles for new neurons and how they cope with the ever-changing environment.</description>

	<description>The ability of central synapses to undergo long-term potentiation (LTP) still captures the imagination of scientists and has become one of the most fascinating and deeply studied questions in modern neuroscience. By the mid-1990s, however, the field was deeply ensnarled in trying to answer a passionately dichotomous question: is LTP expressed by a pre- or a postsynaptic mechanism? Experimental results that could only be seen by many as being incontrovertibly contradictory presented a perplexing conundrum.</description>

	<description>Is an amygdala necessary to experience and perceive fear? Intriguing evidence comes from patient S.M. who lost her left and right amygdalae to disease. Initial testing suggested that S.M.’s most defining symptom was an inability to recognize fear in other people’s facial expressions. A fascinating paper by Adolphs and colleagues in 2005 examined one potential mechanism for this impairment: a failure to spontaneously attend to widened eyes, the most distinctive physical feature portrayed in symbolic fear expressions.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Neuronal Encoding of Oral Fat by the Coefficient of Sliding Friction in the Cerebral Cortex and Amygdala</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy213</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy213/5088305?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Fat in the diet contributes to the pleasant mouthfeel of many foods, but overconsumption may contribute to obesity. Here we analyze what properties of fat in the mouth are sensed, by analyzing the responses of neurons in the macaque insular taste cortex, and two areas to which it projects the orbitofrontal cortex where the pleasantness of fat is represented, and the amygdala. We discovered that the firing rate responses of these fat-responsive neurons are correlated with the coefficient of sliding friction (CSF) and not with viscosity which reflects food thickness. Other, not fat-sensitive, neurons encoded viscosity and not the CSF. Neuronal population analyses confirmed that fat-responsive neurons conveyed information about the CSF but not about viscosity. Conversely the viscosity-sensitive neuronal population conveyed information about viscosity but not about the CSF. This new understanding of the representation of oral fat in the cerebral cortex and amygdala opens the way for the systematic development of foods with the pleasant mouthfeel of fat, together with ideal nutritional content and has great potential to contribute to healthy eating and a healthy body weight.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Beatboxers and Guitarists Engage Sensorimotor Regions Selectively When Listening to the Instruments They can Play</title>

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy208/5087958?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Studies of classical musicians have demonstrated that expertise modulates neural responses during auditory perception. However, it remains unclear whether such expertise-dependent plasticity is modulated by the instrument that a musician plays. To examine whether the recruitment of sensorimotor regions during music perception is modulated by instrument-specific experience, we studied nonclassical musicians—beatboxers, who predominantly use their vocal apparatus to produce sound, and guitarists, who use their hands. We contrast fMRI activity in 20 beatboxers, 20 guitarists, and 20 nonmusicians as they listen to novel beatboxing and guitar pieces. All musicians show enhanced activity in sensorimotor regions (IFG, IPC, and SMA), but only when listening to the musical instrument they can play. Using independent component analysis, we find expertise-selective enhancement in sensorimotor networks, which are distinct from changes in attentional networks. These findings suggest that long-term sensorimotor experience facilitates access to the posterodorsal “how” pathway during auditory processing.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: KCC2 Regulates Dendritic Spine Formation in a Brain-Region Specific and BDNF Dependent Manner</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy198</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy198/5088308?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;KCC2 is the major chloride extruder in neurons. The spatiotemporal regulation of KCC2 expression orchestrates the developmental shift towards inhibitory GABAergic drive and the formation of glutamatergic synapses. Whether KCC2’s role in synapse formation is similar in different brain regions is unknown. First, we found that KCC2 subcellular localization, but not overall KCC2 expression levels, differed between cortex and hippocampus during the first postnatal week. We performed site-specific in utero electroporation of KCC2 cDNA to target either hippocampal CA1 or somatosensory cortical pyramidal neurons. We found that a premature expression of KCC2 significantly decreased spine density in CA1 neurons, while it had the opposite effect in cortical neurons. These effects were cell autonomous, because single-cell biolistic overexpression of KCC2 in hippocampal and cortical organotypic cultures also induced a reduction and an increase of dendritic spine density, respectively. In addition, we found that the effects of its premature expression on spine density were dependent on BDNF levels. Finally, we showed that the effects of KCC2 on dendritic spine were dependent on its chloride transporter function in the hippocampus, contrary to what was observed in cortex. Altogether, these results demonstrate that KCC2 regulation of dendritic spine development, and its underlying mechanisms, are brain-region specific.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Ca2+ Signals in Astrocytes Facilitate Spread of Epileptiform Activity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy196</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy196/5088306?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Epileptic seizures are associated with increased astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling, but the fine spatiotemporal kinetics of the ictal astrocyte–neuron interplay remains elusive. By using 2-photon imaging of awake head-fixed mice with chronic hippocampal windows we demonstrate that astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals precede neuronal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevations during the initial bout of kainate-induced seizures. On average, astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevations preceded neuronal activity in CA1 by about 8 s. In subsequent bouts of epileptic seizures, astrocytes and neurons were activated simultaneously. The initial astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevation was abolished in mice lacking the type 2 inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate-receptor (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Itpr2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;−/−&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). Furthermore, we found that &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Itpr2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;−/−&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibited 60% less epileptiform activity compared with wild-type mice when assessed by telemetric EEG monitoring. In both genotypes we also demonstrate that spreading depression waves may play a part in seizure termination. Our findings imply a role for astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals in ictogenesis.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Adenosine Receptor-Mediated Developmental Loss of Spike Timing-Dependent Depression in the Hippocampus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy194</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy194/5088307?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Critical periods of synaptic plasticity facilitate the reordering and refining of neural connections during development, allowing the definitive synaptic circuits responsible for correct adult physiology to be established. Presynaptic spike timing-dependent long-term depression (t-LTD) exists in the hippocampus, which depends on the activation of NMDARs and that probably fulfills a role in synaptic refinement. This t-LTD is present until the third postnatal week in mice, disappearing in the fourth week of postnatal development. We were interested in the mechanisms underlying this maturation related loss of t-LTD and we found that at CA3–CA1 synapses, presynaptic NMDA receptors (pre-NMDARs) are tonically active between P13 and P21, mediating an increase in glutamate release during this critical period of plasticity. Conversely, at the end of this critical period (P22–P30) and coinciding with the loss of t-LTD, these pre-NMDARs are no longer tonically active. Using immunogold electron microscopy, we demonstrated the existence of pre-NMDARs at Schaffer collateral synaptic boutons, where a decrease in the number of pre-NMDARs during development coincides with the loss of both tonic pre-NMDAR activation and t-LTD. Interestingly, this t-LTD can be completely recovered by antagonizing adenosine type 1 receptors (A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R), which also recovers the tonic activation of pre-NMDARs at P22–P30. By contrast, the induction of t-LTD was prevented at P13–P21 by an agonist of A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R, as was tonic pre-NMDAR activation. Furthermore, we found that the adenosine that mediated the loss of t-LTD during the fourth week of development is supplied by astrocytes. These results provide direct evidence for the mechanism that closes the window of plasticity associated with t-LTD, revealing novel events probably involved in synaptic remodeling during development.&lt;/span&gt;</description>
