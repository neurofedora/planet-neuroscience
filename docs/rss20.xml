	<description>Publication date: February 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Zilong   Qiu&lt;br /&gt;  MECP2 is a critical gene for neural development, mutations or duplication of which led to severe neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Rett syndrome (RTT) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Extensive works during the past decade yield ample insights into the molecular and cellular functions of MeCP2 in neural development. Furthermore, genetic manipulations in Mecp2 mouse models strongly suggested that deficiency in synaptic plasticity and various behaviors of Mecp2 null or transgenic mice could be rescued in adulthood. Further studies elucidating neural circuits responsible for symptoms in MECP2-associated disorders in rodent and non-human primate models will shed light on the development of potential therapeutic interventions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: February 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Aaron   Katzman, Cristina M   Alberini&lt;br /&gt; The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is critical for memory formation, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Clinical and animal model studies have shown that changes in PFC excitation and inhibition are important for cognitive functions as well as related disorders. Here, we discuss recent findings revealing the roles of the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic proteins neuroligin 1 (NLGN1) and NLGN2 in the PFC in memory formation and modulation of memory strength. We propose that shifts in NLGN1 and NLGN2 expression in specific excitatory and inhibitory neuronal subpopulations in response to experience regulate the dynamic processes of memory consolidation and strengthening. Because excitatory/inhibitory imbalances accompany neuropsychiatric disorders in which strength and flexibility of representations play important roles, understanding these mechanisms may suggest novel therapies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: June 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Guosong   Hong, Xiao   Yang, Tao   Zhou, Charles M   Lieber&lt;br /&gt; Existing implantable neurotechnologies for understanding the brain and treating neurological diseases have intrinsic properties that have limited their capability to achieve chronically-stable brain interfaces with single-neuron spatiotemporal resolution. These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to ‘look and behave’ like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

The morphological and molecular heterogeneity of oligodendrocytes and their progenitors point to functions beyond establishing saltatory nerve conduction. Here, we review the diversity in the oligodendroglial lineage as well as the classical and new functions identified for oligodendrocytes and their progenitors. Because oligodendroglia remain highly responsive to environmental changes, they likely contribute to various neurological and psychiatric diseases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Human neuroimaging studies consistently show a hunger-dependent, selective enhancement of responses to images of food in association cortex and amygdala. More recently, cellular-resolution imaging combined with circuit mapping experiments in behaving mice have revealed underlying neuronal population dynamics and enabled tracing of pathways by which hunger circuits influence the assignment of value to visual objects in visual association cortex, insular cortex, and amygdala. These experiments begin to provide a mechanistic understanding of motivation-specific neural processing of need-relevant cues in healthy humans and in disease states such as obesity and other eating disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Since the earliest days of embryology, lineage questions have been addressed with methods of increasing specificity, capacity, and resolution. Yet, a full realization of individual cell lineages remains challenging for complex systems. A recent explosion of technical advances in genome-editing and single-cell sequencing has enabled lineage analysis in an unprecedented scale, speed, and depth across different species. In this review, we discuss the application of available as well as future genetic labeling techniques for tracking neural lineages in vivo in the mammalian nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

During development, individual gene activity can dynamically engage different signaling networks; thus genetic mutations can lead to different functional changes at different times. Interpretation of phenotypes can be further complicated if initial functional changes trigger compensatory mechanisms. Examining genetic mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders reveals cellular phenotypes that change over the course of development and exist long before behavioral deficits are assessed. Correspondingly, earlier genetic interventions in these disorder models have often been more effective at improving behavioral deficits than late interventions. The restricted period of effective intervention demonstrates that identifying a target window is an essential component of treatment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Recent work suggests that they play a key role in regulating brain energy supply by increasing blood flow to regions where neurons are active, and setting the baseline level of blood flow. Controversy persists over whether lactate derived from astrocyte glycolysis is used to power oxidative phosphorylation in neurons, but astrocytes sustain neuronal ATP production by recycling neurotransmitter glutamate that would otherwise need to be resynthesised from glucose, and by providing a short-term energy store in the form of glycogen that can be mobilised when neurons are active. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

To achieve these precise shapes, glia and neurons exhibit coordinated morphological changes on the time scale of minutes and on size scales ranging from nanometers to hundreds of microns. Here, we review recent studies that reveal the highly dynamic, localized morphological changes of mammalian neuron–glia contacts. We then explore the power of Drosophila and C. elegans models to study coordinated changes at defined neuron–glia contacts, highlighting the use of innovative genetic and imaging tools to uncover the molecular mechanisms responsible for coordinated morphogenesis of neurons and glia. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Derived from the yolk sac during development, microglia self-renew, self-regulate their numbers during homeostatic conditions, and show a robust proliferative capacity even in adulthood. Together with monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), microglia coordinate the regeneration of CNS myelin around axons, termed remyelination. Gene expression analyses and experimental modelling have identified pro-remyelination roles for microglia/MDM in clearance of myelin debris, secretion of growth factors, and remodelling of the extracellular matrix. Further investigations into the molecular mechanisms controlling these regenerative functions will reveal novel therapeutic strategies to enhance remyelination, by harnessing the beneficial effects of the innate immune response to injury. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

This neural activity reflects internal processes by which the brain plans and executes volitional movements. The study of motor planning offers an opportunity to understand how the structure and dynamics of neural circuits support persistent internal states and how these states influence behavior. Recent advances in large-scale neural recordings are beginning to decipher the relationship of the dynamics of populations of neurons during motor planning and movements. New behavioral tasks in rodents, together with quantified perturbations, link dynamics in specific nodes of neural circuits to behavior. These studies reveal a neural network distributed across multiple brain regions that collectively supports motor planning. We review recent advances and highlight areas where further work is needed to achieve a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying motor planning and related cognitive processes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Recently, developments in new experimental approaches have brought about several novel insights about NG2-glia and myelinating oligodendrocytes, indicating a diverse toolkit of functions in experience-dependent myelination and homeostasis in the adult CNS. In this review, we summarize some of the topical studies that highlight newly emerging findings implicating oligodendroglia-lineage cells in brain plasticity, homeostasis and pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Studies have found that sensory, prefrontal, hippocampal, cerebellar, and striatal regions, as well as the circuits that connect them, are perturbed in mouse models of ASD and ID. Dissecting the disruptions in morphology and activity in these neural circuits might help us to understand the shared risk between the two disorders as well as their clinical heterogeneity. Treatments that target the balance between excitation and inhibition in these regions are able to reverse pathological phenotypes, elucidating this deficit as a commonality across models and opening new avenues for intervention. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Understanding the mechanisms underlying neuronal structural changes is central to our knowledge of how the nervous system is shaped for complex behaviors and how it further adapts to developmental and environmental demands. Caenorhabditis elegans provides a powerful model for examining developmental processes and for discovering mechanisms controlling neural plasticity. Recent findings have identified conserved themes underlying neural plasticity in development and under environmental stress. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

We review recent research through this lens, and provide practical guidance for researchers in the decision-making field. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

These platforms leverage basic advances in biocompatible materials, semiconductor device designs and systems engineering concepts to afford modes of operation that are qualitatively distinct from those of conventional approaches that tether animals to external hardware by means of optical fibers, electrical cables and/or fluidic tubing. Neuroscience studies that exploit the unique features of these technologies enable insights into neural function through targeted stimulation, inhibition and recording, with spatially and genetically precise manipulation of neural circuit activity.

Individual network components in the mushroom bodies of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster represent cues, learning signals and behavioral outcomes of learned experience. Recent findings have highlighted the importance of dopamine-driven plasticity and activity in feedback and feedforward connections, between various elements of the mushroom body neural network. These computational motifs have been shown to be crucial for long term olfactory memory consolidation, integration of internal states, re-evaluation and updating of learned information. The often recurrent circuit anatomy and a prolonged requirement for activity in parts of these underlying networks, suggest that self-sustained and precisely timed activity is a fundamental feature of network computations in the insect brain. Together these processes allow flies to continuously adjust the content of their learned knowledge and direct their behavior in a way that best represents learned expectations and serves their most pressing current needs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Numerous genes in the endo-lysosomal pathways have been found to associate with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations of these genes lead to dysfunction in multiple steps of the endo-lysosomal network: autophagy, endocytic trafficking and lysosomal degradation, resulting in accumulation of pathogenic proteins. Although the exact pathogenic mechanism varies for different disease-associated genes, dysfunction of the endo-lysosomal pathways represents a converging mechanism shared by these diseases. Therefore, strategies that correct or compensate for endo-lysosomal dysfunction may be promising therapeutic approaches to treat neurodegenerative diseases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Transcranial alternating current stimulation modulates auditory temporal resolution in elderly people</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/241471v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Recent research provides evidence for a functional role of brain oscillations for perception. For example, auditory temporal resolution seems to be linked to individual gamma frequency of auditory cortex. Individual gamma frequency not only correlates with performance in between-channel gap detection tasks but can be modulated via auditory transcranial alternating current stimulation. Modulation of individual gamma frequency is accompanied by an improvement in gap detection performance. Aging changes electrophysiological frequency components and sensory processing mechanisms. Therefore, we conducted a study to investigate the link between individual gamma frequency and gap detection performance in elderly people using auditory transcranial alternating current stimulation. In a within-subject design, nine participants were electrically stimulated with two individualized transcranial alternating current stimulation frequencies: 3 Hz above their individual gamma frequency (experimental condition) and 4 Hz below their individual gamma frequency (control condition) while they were performing a between-channel gap detection task. As expected, individual gamma frequencies correlated significantly with gap detection performance at baseline and in the experimental condition, transcranial alternating current stimulation modulated gap detection performance. In the control condition, stimulation did not modulate gap detection performance. In addition, in elderly, the effect of transcranial alternating current stimulation on auditory temporal resolution seems to be dependent on endogenous frequencies in auditory cortex: elderlies with slower individual gamma frequencies and lower auditory temporal resolution profit from auditory transcranial alternating current stimulation and show increased gap detection performance during stimulation. Our results strongly suggest individualized transcranial alternating current stimulation protocols for successful modulation of performance.</description>

	<description>I elaborate binocular geometry with a novel eye model that incorporates the fovea's temporalward displacement and the cornea and the lens' misalignment. The formulated binocular correspondence results in longitudinal horopters that are conic sections resembling empirical horopters. When the eye model's asymmetry parameters' range is that which is observed in healthy eyes, abathic distance also falls within its experimentally observed range. This range in abathic distance is similar to that of the vergence resting position distance. Further, the conic's orientation is specified by the eyes' version angle, integrating binocular geometry with eye movement. This integration presents the possibility for modeling 3D perceptual stability during physiological eye movements.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A topographic axis of transcriptional identity in thalamus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/241315v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/241315v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>A fundamental goal in neuroscience is to uncover common principles by which different modalities of information are processed. In the mammalian brain, thalamus acts as the essential hub for forebrain circuits handling inputs from sensory, motor, limbic, and cognitive pathways. Whether thalamus imposes common transformations on each of these modalities is unknown. Molecular characterization offers a principled approach to revealing the organization of thalamus. Using near-comprehensive and projection-specific transcriptomic sequencing, we found that almost all thalamic nuclei fit into one of three profiles. These profiles lie on a single axis of genetic variance which is aligned with the mediolateral spatial axis of thalamus. Genes defining this axis of variance include receptors and ion channels, providing a systematic diversification of input/output transformations across the topography of thalamus. Single cell transcriptional profiling revealed graded heterogeneity within individual thalamic nuclei, demonstrating that a spectrum of cell types and potentially diverse input/output transforms exist within a given thalamic nucleus. Together, our data argue for an archetypal organization of pathways serving diverse input modalities, and provides a comprehensive organizational scheme for thalamus.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The Class I E3 Ubiquitin Ligase TRIM67 Modulates Brain Development and Behavior</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/241331v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/241331v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Specific class I members of the TRIM family of E3 ubiquitin ligases have been implicated in neuronal development from invertebrates to mammals. The single invertebrate class I TRIM and mammalian TRIM9 regulate axon branching and guidance in response to the axon guidance cue netrin-1, whereas mammalian TRIM46 establishes the axon initial segment. In humans, mutations in TRIM1 and TRIM18 are implicated in Optiz Syndrome, characterized by midline defects and often mild intellectual disability. TRIM67 is the most evolutionarily conserved vertebrate class I TRIM, yet is the least studied. Here we show that TRIM67 interacts with both its closest paralog TRIM9 and the netrin receptor DCC, and is differentially enriched in specific brain regions at specific developmental points. We describe the anatomical and behavioral consequences of deletion of murine Trim67. While viable, mice lacking Trim67 display severe impairments in spatial memory, cognitive flexibility, social novelty preference, muscle function and sensorimotor gating. Additionally, they exhibit abnormal anatomy of several brain regions, including the hippocampus, striatum and thalamus, as well as the corpus callosum. This study demonstrates the necessity for TRIM67 in appropriate brain development and function.</description>

	<description>Manipulating the dynamics of neural systems through targeted stimulation is a frontier of research and clinical neuroscience; however, the control schemes considered for neural systems are mismatched for the unique needs of manipulating neural dynamics. An appropriate control method should respect the variability in neural systems, incorporating moment to moment &quot;input&quot; to the neural dynamics and behaving based on the current neural state, irrespective of the past trajectory. We propose such a controller under a nonlinear state-space feedback framework that steers one dynamical system to function as through it were another dynamical system entirely. This &quot;myopic&quot; controller is formulated through a novel variant of a model reference control cost that manipulates dynamics in a step-wise manner, omitting the need to pre-calculate a rigid and computationally costly neural feedback control solution. To demonstrate the breadth of this control's utility, two examples with distinctly different applications in neuroscience are studied. First an unhealthy motor-like system containing an unwanted beta-oscillation spiral attractor is controlled to function as a healthy motor system, a relevant clinical example for neurological disorders. Second, we show the myopic control's utility to probe the causal dynamics of cognitive processes by transforming a winner-take-all decision-making system to operate as a robust neural integrator of evidence.</description>

	<description>We investigated whether visuoauditory association can be artificially implanted in rodents and then retrieved in a behaviorally relevant context. Rats were trained to approach the left or right hole of a behavioral apparatus to retrieve a reward depending on the side of electrical stimulation of the auditory cortex (EAC) they received and mice were fear-conditioned to EAC. Next, an irrelevant visual stimulus (VS) was repeatedly paired with EAC in the presence of cholecystokinin (CCK) or with activation of terminals of entorhinal CCK neurons in the auditory cortex. In subsequent behavioral testing with VS, rats approached the hole associated with reward availability and mice showed a freezing response to the VS. A CCK antagonist blocked the establishment of visuoauditory association, whereas a CCK agonist rescued the deficit of association. Our findings provide a scientific foundation for &quot;memory implantation&quot; and indicate that CCK is the switching chemical for formation of visuoauditory association.</description>

	<description>In primates, proximal cortical areas are interconnected via within-cortex ''intrinsic'' pathway, whereas distant areas are connected via ''extrinsic'' white matter pathway. It is not well known how cortical areas are interconnected in small-brained mammals like rodents. In this study, we systematically analyzed the data of Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas to answer this question and found that the ipsilateral cortical connections in mice are almost exclusively contained within the grey matter with the exception of the retrosplenial area. We analyzed the layer-specific distribution of axonal projections within the grey matter using Cortical Box method and obtained the following results. First, widespread axonal projections were observed in both upper and lower layers in the vicinity of injections, whereas highly specific ''point-to-point'' projections were observed toward remote areas. Second, such long-range projections were predominantly aligned in the anteromedial-posterolateral direction. Third, in majority of these projections, the connecting axons traveled through layer 6. Finally, the projections from the primary and higher order areas to distant targets preferentially terminated in the middle and superficial layers, respectively, suggesting hierarchical connections similar to those of primates. Overall, our study suggests the conserved nature of neocortical organization across species despite conspicuous differences in wiring strategy.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Disrupted structural connectivity in Pediatric Bipolar Disorder</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/241091v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/241091v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) has been linked to disrupted structural and functional connectivity between prefrontal networks and limbic brain regions. Studies of patients with pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD) can help elucidate the developmental origins of altered structural connectivity underlying BD and provide novel insights into the aetiology of BD. Methods: The network properties of whole-brain structural connectomes, constructed using probabilistic tractography and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), were compared between groups of un-medicated PBD patients with psychosis euthymic and matched healthy controls. Specific network measures were correlated with neurocognitive and psychotic scores, thus providing a comprehensive characterization of topological brain changes underlying PBD. Results: Widespread changes in the structural connectivity of PBD patients were found in both cortical and subcortical networks, notably affecting the orbitofrontal cortex, frontal gyrus, amygdala, and hippocampus. Graph theoretical analysis revealed that PBD connectomes have fewer hubs, weaker rich club organization, different modular structure and increased network asymmetries compared to healthy participants. Moreover, patients' IQ and psychotic symptoms significantly correlated with the local efficiency of the orbitofrontal cortex. Conclusion: The results show that PBD is associated with significant changes in structural network topology, which may indicate a reduced capacity for balanced whole-brain integration of information. Localized network changes involve brain regions associated with emotional processing and regulation, as well as cognitive processing, some of which correlate with cognitive and clinical measures. These findings suggest that structural brain connectivity changes may contribute to the deficits in emotion processing and regulation found in PBD.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Association of BDNF Val66Met Polymorphism and Brain BDNF levels with Major Depression and Suicide</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/233304v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/233304v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>BACKGROUND: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is implicated in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) and suicide. Both are partly caused by early life adversity (ELA) and ELA reduces both BDNF protein and gene expression. This study examines the association of BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and brain BDNF levels with depression and suicide. We hypothesized that both major depression and ELA would be associated with the Met allele and lower brain BDNF levels. Such an association would be consistent with low BDNF mediating the effect of ELA on adulthood suicide and MDD. METHODS: BDNF Val66Met polymorphism was genotyped in postmortem brains of 37 suicide decedents and 53 non-suicides. Additionally, BDNF protein levels were determined by Western blot in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 9; BA9), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; BA24), caudal brainstem and rostral brainstem. The relationships between these measures and major depression, death by suicide and reported childhood adversity were examined. RESULTS: Depressed subjects had an excess of the Met allele and lower BDNF levels in ACC and caudal brainstem compared with non-depressed subjects. No effect of history of suicide death or early life adversity was observed with genotype, but lower BDNF levels in ACC were found in subjects who had been exposed to early life adversity and/or died by suicide compared to nonsuicide decedents and no reported childhood adversity. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides further evidence for low BDNF in major depression related to the BDNF met risk allele. Future studies should seek to determine how altered BDNF expression contributes to MDD and suicide.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Firing rate equations require a spike synchrony mechanism to correctly describe fast oscillations in inhibitory networks</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Federico Devalle, Alex Roxin, Ernest Montbrió&lt;/p&gt;

Recurrently coupled networks of inhibitory neurons robustly generate oscillations in the gamma band. Nonetheless, the corresponding Wilson-Cowan type firing rate equation for such an inhibitory population does not generate such oscillations without an explicit time delay. We show that this discrepancy is due to a voltage-dependent spike-synchronization mechanism inherent in networks of spiking neurons which is not captured by standard firing rate equations. Here we investigate an exact low-dimensional description for a network of heterogeneous canonical Class 1 inhibitory neurons which includes the sub-threshold dynamics crucial for generating synchronous states. In the limit of slow synaptic kinetics the spike-synchrony mechanism is suppressed and the standard Wilson-Cowan equations are formally recovered as long as external inputs are also slow. However, even in this limit synchronous spiking can be elicited by inputs which fluctuate on a time-scale of the membrane time-constant of the neurons. Our meanfield equations therefore represent an extension of the standard Wilson-Cowan equations in which spike synchrony is also correctly described.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oZ1Gs-satsc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Deep Architectures for Automated Seizure Detection in Scalp EEGs. (arXiv:1712.09776v1 [cs.LG])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Automated seizure detection using clinical electroencephalograms is a
challenging machine learning problem because the multichannel signal often has
an extremely low signal to noise ratio. Events of interest such as seizures are
easily confused with signal artifacts (e.g, eye movements) or benign variants
(e.g., slowing). Commercially available systems suffer from unacceptably high
false alarm rates. Deep learning algorithms that employ high dimensional models
have not previously been effective due to the lack of big data resources. In
this paper, we use the TUH EEG Seizure Corpus to evaluate a variety of hybrid
deep structures including Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-Term
Memory Networks. We introduce a novel recurrent convolutional architecture that
delivers 30% sensitivity at 7 false alarms per 24 hours. We have also evaluated
our system on a held-out evaluation set based on the Duke University Seizure
Corpus and demonstrate that performance trends are similar to the TUH EEG
Seizure Corpus. This is a significant finding because the Duke corpus was
collected with different instrumentation and at different hospitals. Our work
shows that deep learning architectures that integrate spatial and temporal
contexts are critical to achieving state of the art performance and will enable
a new generation of clinically-acceptable technology.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: A clinical decision support tool that automatically interprets
EEGs can reduce time to diagnosis and enhance real-time applications such as
ICU monitoring. Clinicians have indicated that a sensitivity of 95% with a
specificity below 5% was the minimum requirement for clinical acceptance. We
propose a highperformance classification system based on principles of big data
and machine learning. Methods: A hybrid machine learning system that uses
hidden Markov models (HMM) for sequential decoding and deep learning networks
for postprocessing is proposed. These algorithms were trained and evaluated
using the TUH EEG Corpus, which is the world's largest publicly available
database of clinical EEG data. Results: Our approach delivers a sensitivity
above 90% while maintaining a specificity below 5%. This system detects three
events of clinical interest: (1) spike and/or sharp waves, (2) periodic
lateralized epileptiform discharges, (3) generalized periodic epileptiform
discharges. It also detects three events used to model background noise: (1)
artifacts, (2) eye movement (3) background. Conclusions: A hybrid HMM/deep
learning system can deliver a low false alarm rate on EEG event detection,
making automated analysis a viable option for clinicians. Significance: The TUH
EEG Corpus enables application of highly data consumptive machine learning
algorithms to EEG analysis. Performance is approaching clinical acceptance for
real-time applications.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Integrated information theory provides a mathematical framework to fully
characterize the cause-effect structure of a physical system. Here, we
introduce PyPhi, a Python software package that implements this framework for
causal analysis and unfolds the full cause-effect structure of discrete
dynamical systems of binary elements. The software allows users to easily study
these structures, serves as an up-to-date reference implementation of the
formalisms of integrated information theory, and has been applied in research
on complexity, emergence, and certain biological questions. We first provide an
overview of the main algorithm and demonstrate PyPhi's functionality in the
course of analyzing an example system, and then describe details of the
algorithm's design and implementation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyPhi can be installed with Python's package manager via the command 'pip
install pyphi' on Linux and macOS systems equipped with Python 3.4 or higher.
PyPhi is open-source and licensed under the GPLv3; the source code is hosted on
GitHub at https://github.com/wmayner/pyphi. Comprehensive and
continually-updated documentation is available at https://pyphi.readthedocs.io.
The pyphi-users mailing list can be joined at

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Analysis of BOLD fMRI Signal Preprocessing Pipeline on Different Datasets while Reducing False Positive Rates. (arXiv:1712.09479v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The technology of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) based on Blood
Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal has been widely used in clinical
treatments and brain function researches. The BOLD signal has to be
preprocessed before being analyzed using either functional connectivity
measurements or statistical methods. Current researches show that data
preprocessing steps may influence the results of analysis, yet there is no
consensus on preprocessing method. In this paper, an evaluation method is
proposed for analyzing the preprocessing pipeline of resting state BOLD fMRI
(rs-BOLD fMRI) data under putative task experiment designs to cast some lights
on the preprocessing stage, covering both first and second level analysis. The
choices of preprocessing parameters and steps are altered to investigate
preprocessing pipelines while observing statistical analysis results, trying to
reduce false positives as reported by Eklund et al. in their 2016 PNAS paper.
All of the experiment data are separated into 7 datasets, consisting of 220
healthy control samples and 136 patient data that are from 38 incomplete Spinal
Cord Injury (SCI) patients and 16 Cerebral Stroke (CS) patients, including
multiple scans of some patients at different time. These data were acquired
from two different MRI scanners, which may cause difference in analysis
results. The evaluation result shows that it has little effect to change
parameters in each steps of the classical preprocessing pipeline, which
consists head motion correction, normalization and smoothing. Removing time
points and the following detrend step can reduce false positives. However,
covariates regression and filtering has complicated effects on the data. Note
that for single subject analysis, false positives declined consistently after
filtering. The result of patient data and healthy controls data which are
scanned under the same machine with ...

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07855</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We show that dynamical gain modulation of neurons' stimulus response is
described as an information-theoretic cycle that generates entropy associated
with the stimulus-related activity from entropy produced by the modulation. To
articulate this theory, we describe stimulus-evoked activity of a neural
population based on the maximum entropy principle with constraints on two types
of overlapping activities, one that is controlled by stimulus conditions and
the other, termed internal activity, that is regulated internally in an
organism. We demonstrate that modulation of the internal activity realises gain
control of stimulus response, and controls stimulus information. A cycle of
neural dynamics is then introduced to model information processing by the
neurons during which the stimulus information is dynamically enhanced by the
internal gain-modulation mechanism. Based on the conservation law for entropy
production, we demonstrate that the cycle generates entropy ascribed to the
stimulus-related activity using entropy supplied by the internal mechanism,
analogously to a heat engine that produces work from heat. We provide an
efficient cycle that achieves the highest entropic efficiency to retain the
stimulus information. The theory allows us to quantify efficiency of the
internal computation and its theoretical limit.

	<description>Volumetric imaging tools that are simple to adopt, flexible, and robust, are in high demand in the field of neuroscience, where the ability to image neurons and their networks with high spatiotemporal resolution is essential. Using an axially elongated focus approximating a Bessel beam, in combination with two-photon fluorescence microscopy, has proven successful at such an endeavor. Here we demonstrate three-photon fluorescence imaging with an axially extended Bessel focus. We use an axicon-based module which allowed for the generation of Bessel foci of varying numerical aperture and axial length, and apply this volumetric imaging tool to image mouse brain slices and for in vivo imaging of the mouse brain.</description>

	<description>Associated stimulus valence affects neural responses at an early processing stage. However, in the field of written language processing, it is unclear whether semantics of a word or low-level visual features affect early neural processing advantages. The current study aimed to investigate the role of semantic content on valence association. Participants completed a learning session to associate either words (Experiment 1, N=24) or pseudowords (Experiment 2, N=24) with a certain valence (gain-associated, neutral or loss-associated). Behavioural and neural response changes based on the associated valence were investigated in a separate test session. Gain-associated stimuli were learned fastest. Response times were faster towards gain- and loss-associated than neutral stimuli if they were words, but not pseudowords. Early P1 effects of associated valence occurred for both pseudowords and words. Specifically, loss-associated valence resulted in increased P1 amplitudes to pseudowords, compared to decreased amplitudes to words. Although visual features are likely to explain P1 effects for pseudowords, the inversed effect for words suggests that semantic content affects associative learning, potentially leading to stronger valence associations.</description>

	<description>The nucleus basalis (NB) projects cholinergic axons to the cortex where they play a major role in arousal, attention and learning. Cholinergic inputs shift cortical dynamics from synchronous to asynchronous and improves the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of sensory response. Yet, the underlying mechanisms of these changes remain unclear. Using simultaneous extracellular and whole cell patch recordings in layer 4 barrel cortex we show that activation of the cholinergic system has a differential effect on ongoing and sensory evoked activities. Cholinergic activation eliminated the large and correlated spontaneous synaptic fluctuations in membrane potential while sparing the synaptic response to whisker stimulation. This differential effect of cholinergic activation provides a unified explanation for the increased SNR of sensory response and for the reduction in both trial to trial variability and noise correlations as well as explaining the shift into desynchronized cortical state which are the hallmarks of arousal and attention.</description>

These length-dependent transcriptional changes are modest in Mecp2-mutant samples, but, given the low sensitivity of high-throughput transcriptome profiling technology, the statistical significance of these results needs to be re-evaluated. Here, we show that the apparent length dependent trends previously observed in MeCP2 microarray and RNA-Sequencing datasets, particularly in genes with low fold-changes, disappeared after accounting for baseline variability estimated from randomized control samples. As we found no similar bias with NanoString technology, this long-gene bias seems to be particular to PCR amplification-based platforms. In contrast, authentic long gene effects, such as those caused by topoisomerase inhibition, can be detected even after adjustment for baseline variability. Accurate detection of length-dependent trends requires establishing a baseline from randomized control samples.</description>

	<description>Hunger evokes stereotypic behaviors that favor the discovery of nutrients. The neural pathways that coordinate internal and external cues to motivate food seeking behaviors are only partly known. Drosophila that are food deprived increase locomotor activity, are more efficient in locating a discrete source of nutrition, and are willing to overcome adversity to obtain food. Here we developed a semi-naturalistic assay and show that two distinct dopaminergic neural circuits regulate food-seeking behaviors. One group, the PAM neurons, functions in food deprived flies while the other functions in well fed flies, and both promote food seeking. These satiation state-dependent circuits converge on dopamine D1 receptor-expressing Kenyon cells of the mushroom body, where neural activity promotes food seeking behavior independent of satiation state. These findings provide evidence for active food seeking in well-fed flies that is separable from hunger-driven seeking.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Circuit and cellular mechanisms facilitate the transformation from dense to sparse coding in the insect olfactory system</title>

	<description>Transformations between sensory representations are shaped by neural mechanisms at the cellular and the circuit level. In the insect olfactory system encoding of odour information undergoes a transition from a dense spatio-temporal population code in the antennal lobe to a sparse code in the mushroom body. However, the exact mechanisms shaping odour representations and their role in sensory processing are incompletely identified. Here, we investigate the transformation from dense to sparse odour representations in a spiking model of the insect olfactory system, focusing on two ubiquitous neural mechanisms: spike-frequency adaptation at the cellular level and lateral inhibition at the circuit level. We find that cellular adaptation is essential for sparse representations in time (temporal sparseness), while lateral inhibition regulates sparseness in the neuronal space (population sparseness). The interplay of both mechanisms shapes dynamical odour representations, which are optimised for discrimination of odours during stimulus onset and offset. In addition, we find that odour identity is stored on a prolonged time scale in the adaptation levels but not in the spiking activity of the principal cells of the mushroom body, providing a testable hypothesis for the location of the so-called odour trace.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Homozygous Boricua TBCK Mutation Causes Neurodegeneration and Aberrant Autophagy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25130</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25130</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Autosomal recessive mutations in &lt;em&gt;TBCK&lt;/em&gt; cause intellectual disability of variable severity. Although the physiologic function of TBCK remains unclear, loss-of-function mutations are associated with inhibition of mTORC1 signaling. As mTORC1 signaling is known to regulate autophagy, we hypothesized that TBCK-encephalopathy patients with a neurodegenerative course have defects in autophagic-lysosomal dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Children (n=8) of Puerto Rican (Boricua) descent affected with homozygous &lt;em&gt;TBCK&lt;/em&gt; p.R126X mutations underwent extensive neurological phenotyping and neurophysiological studies. We quantified autophagosome content in TBCK&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; patient-derived fibroblasts by immunostaining and assayed autophagic markers by Western assay. Free sialylated oligosaccharide profiles were assayed in patient's urine and fibroblasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The neurologic phenotype of children with &lt;em&gt;TBCK&lt;/em&gt; p.R126X mutations, which we call TBCK-encephaloneuronopathy (TBCKE), include congenital hypotonia, progressive motor neuronopathy, leukoencephalopathy and epilepsy. Systemic features include coarse facies, dyslipidemia, and osteoporosis. TBCK&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; fibroblasts &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; exhibit increased numbers of LC3+ autophagosomes, and increased autophagic flux by immunoblots. Free oligosaccharide profiles in fibroblasts and urine of TBCKE patients differ from control fibroblasts and are ameliorated by treatment with the mTORC1 activator leucine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: TBCKE is a clinically distinguishable syndrome with progressive central and peripheral nervous system dysfunction, consistently seen in patients with the p.R126X mutation. We provide evidence that inappropriate autophagy in the absence of cellular stressors may play a role in this disorder, and that mTORC1 activation may ameliorate the autophagic-lysosomal system dysfunction. Free oligosaccharide profiles could serve as a novel biomarker for this disorder as well as a tool to evaluate potential therapeutic interventions. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Vasodilator Dysfunction and Oligodendrocyte Dysmaturation in Aging White Matter</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25129</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Microvascular brain injury (mVBI) is a common pathologic correlate of vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) that leads to white matter injury (WMI). VCID appears to arise from chronic recurrent white matter ischemia that triggers oxidative stress and an increase in total oligodendrocyte lineage cells. We hypothesized that mVBI involves vasodilator dysfunction of white matter penetrating arterioles and aberrant oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) responses to WMI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We analyzed cases of mVBI with low Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change in prefrontal cortex WM from rapid autopsies in a population-based cohort where VCID frequently occurs. Arteriolar vasodilator function was quantified by videomicroscopy. OPC maturation was quantified using lineage specific markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: ACh-mediated arteriolar dilation in mVBI was significantly reduced in WM penetrators relative to pial arterioles. Astrogliosis-defined WMI was positively associated with increased OPCs and was negatively associated with decreased mature oligodendrocytes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: Selectively impaired vasodilator function of WM penetrating arterioles in mVBI occurs in association with aberrant differentiation of OPCs in WMI, which supports that myelination disturbances in VCID are related to disrupted maturation of myelinating oligodendrocytes.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Pathological mechanisms underlying single large-scale mitochondrial DNA deletions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25127</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective. Single, large-scale deletions in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are a common cause of mitochondrial disease. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the genetic defect and molecular phenotype to improve understanding of pathogenic mechanisms associated with single, large-scale mtDNA deletions in skeletal muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods. We investigated 23 muscle biopsies taken from adult patients (6 males/17 females with a mean age of 43y) with characterised single, large-scale mtDNA deletions. Mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency in skeletal muscle biopsies was quantified by immunoreactivity levels for complex I and complex IV proteins. Single muscle fibres with varying degrees of deficiency were selected from six patient biopsies for determination of mtDNA deletion level and copy number by quantitative qPCR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results. We have defined three ‘classes' of single, large-scale deletion with distinct patterns of mitochondrial deficiency, determined by the size and location of the deletion. Single fibre analyses showed that fibres with greater respiratory chain deficiency harboured higher levels of mtDNA deletion with an increase in total mtDNA copy number. For the first time, we have demonstrated that threshold levels for complex I and complex IV deficiency differ based on deletion class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation. Combining genetic and immunofluorescent assays, we conclude that thresholds for complex I and complex IV deficiency are modulated by the deletion of complex-specific protein-encoding genes. Furthermore, removal of mt-tRNA genes impacts specific complexes only at high deletion levels, when complex-specific protein-encoding genes remain. These novel findings provide valuable insight into the pathogenic mechanisms associated with these mutations. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Myeloid cell plasticity in the evolution of central nervous system autoimmunity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25128</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Myeloid cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells, are a prominent component of central nervous system (CNS) infiltrates during multiple sclerosis (MS) and the animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Although myeloid cells are generally thought to be pro-inflammatory, alternatively-polarized subsets can serve non-inflammatory and/or reparative functions. Here we investigate the heterogeneity and biological properties of myeloid cells during central nervous system autoimmunity. Methods: Myeloid cell phenotypes in chronic active MS lesions were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. In addition, immune cells were isolated from the CNS during exacerbations and remissions of EAE and characterized by flow cytometric, genetic and functional assays. Results: Myeloid cells expressing iNOS, indicative of a pro-inflammatory phenotype, were detected in the actively demyelinating rim of chronic active MS lesions, whereas macrophages expressing mannose receptor (CD206), a marker of alternatively-polarized human myeloid cells, were enriched in the quiescent lesion core. During EAE, CNS-infiltrating myeloid cells, as well as microglia, shifted from expression of pro- to non-inflammatory markers immediately prior to clinical remissions. Murine CNS myeloid cells expressing the alternative lineage marker arginase-1 (Arg1) were partially derived from iNOS&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; precursors and were deficient in activating encephalitogenic T cells compared with their Arg1&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; counterparts. Interpretation: These observations demonstrate the heterogeneity of CNS myeloid cells, their evolution during the course of autoimmune demyelinating disease, and their plasticity on the single cell level. Future therapeutic strategies for disease modification in individuals with MS may be focused on accelerating the transition of CNS myeloid cells from a pro- to a non-inflammatory phenotype.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Task Engagement Enhances Population Encoding of Stimulus Meaning in Primary Auditory Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/240556v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/240556v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The main functions of primary sensory cortical areas are classically considered to be the extraction and representation of stimulus features. In contrast, higher cortical sensory association areas are thought to be responsible for combining these sensory representations with internal motivations and learnt associations. These regions generate appropriate neural responses that are maintained until a motor command is executed. Within this framework, responses of the primary sensory areas during task performance are expected to carry less information about the behavioral meaning of the stimulus than higher sensory, association, motor and frontal cortices. Here we demonstrate instead that the neuronal population responses in the early primary auditory cortex (A1) display many aspects of responses generally associated with higher-level areas. A1 activity was recorded in awake ferrets while they were either passively listening or actively discriminating two periodic click trains of different rates in a Go/No-Go paradigm. By applying population-level dimensionality reduction techniques, we found that task-engagement induced a shift in the nature of the encoding from a sensory-driven representation of the two stimuli to a behaviorally relevant representation of the two categories that specifically enhances the target stimulus. We demonstrate that this shift in encoding relies partly on a novel mechanism of change in spontaneous activity patterns upon engagement in the task. We show that this population-level representation of stimuli in A1 population activity bears strong similarities to responses in the frontal cortex, but appears earlier following stimulus presentation. Analysis of neural activity recorded in various Go/No-Go tasks, with different sounds and reinforcement paradigms, reveals that this striking population-level enhancement of target representation is a general property of task engagement. These findings indicate that primary sensory cortices play a highly flexible role in the processing of incoming stimuli and implement a crucial change in the structure of population activity in order to extract task-relevant information during behavior.</description>

	<description>Neurons communicate through neurotransmitter release at specialized synaptic regions known as active zones (AZs). Using transgenic biosensors to image postsynaptic glutamate receptor activation following single vesicle fusion events at Drosophila neuromuscular junctions, we analyzed release probability (Pr) maps for a defined connection with ~300 AZs between synaptic partners. Although Pr was very heterogeneous, it represented a stable and unique feature of each AZ. Pr heterogeneity was not abolished in mutants lacking Synaptotagmin 1, suggesting the AZ itself is likely to harbor a key determinant(s). Indeed, AZ Pr was strongly correlated with presynaptic Ca2+ channel density and Ca2+ influx at single release sites. In addition, Pr variability was reflected in the postsynaptic compartment, as high Pr AZs displayed a distinct pattern of glutamate receptor clustering. Developmental analysis suggests that high Pr sites emerge from earlier formed AZs, with a temporal maturation in transmission strength occurring over several days.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Deep image reconstruction from human brain activity</title>

	<description>Machine learning-based analysis of human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) patterns has enabled the visualization of perceptual content. However, it has been limited to the reconstruction with low-level image bases or to the matching to exemplars. Recent work showed that visual cortical activity can be decoded (translated) into hierarchical features of a deep neural network (DNN) for the same input image, providing a way to make use of the information from hierarchical visual features. Here, we present a novel image reconstruction method, in which the pixel values of an image are optimized to make its DNN features similar to those decoded from human brain activity at multiple layers. We found that the generated images resembled the stimulus images (both natural images and artificial shapes) and the subjective visual content during imagery. While our model was solely trained with natural images, our method successfully generalized the reconstruction to artificial shapes, indicating that our model indeed reconstructs or generates images from brain activity, not simply matches to exemplars. A natural image prior introduced by another deep neural network effectively rendered semantically meaningful details to reconstructions by constraining reconstructed images to be similar to natural images. Furthermore, human judgment of reconstructions suggests the effectiveness of combining multiple DNN layers to enhance visual quality of generated images. The results suggest that hierarchical visual information in the brain can be effectively combined to reconstruct perceptual and subjective images.</description>

	<description>Visual motion analysis is fundamental to survival across the animal kingdom. In insects, our understanding of the underlying computations has centered on the Hassenstein-Reichardt motion detector, which computes two-point cross-correlation via multiplication; in mammalian cortex, it is postulated that a similar signal is computed by comparing matched squaring operations. Both of these operations are difficult to implement biophysically in a precise fashion; moreover, they fail to detect the more complex multipoint local motion cues present in the visual environment. Here, via single-unit recordings in two visual specialists, dragonfly &quot;(Odonata)&quot; and macaque, and via model simulations, we show that neuronal computations are not simply approximations to idealized behaviors forced by biological constraints, but rather, are signatures of a common computational strategy to capture multiple local motion cues. The similarity of motion computations at the neuronal level in the brains of two extremely dissimilar animals, with evolutionary divergence of over 700 Myr, suggests convergence on a common computational scheme for detecting visual motion.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Local motion adaptation enhances the representation of spatial structure at EMD arrays</title>

Neuronal representation and extraction of spatial information are essential for behavioral control. For flying insects, a plausible way to gain spatial information is to exploit distance-dependent optic flow that is generated during translational self-motion. Optic flow is computed by arrays of local motion detectors retinotopically arranged in the second neuropile layer of the insect visual system. These motion detectors have adaptive response characteristics, i.e. their responses to motion with a constant or only slowly changing velocity decrease, while their sensitivity to rapid velocity changes is maintained or even increases. We analyzed by a modeling approach how motion adaptation affects signal representation at the output of arrays of motion detectors during simulated flight in artificial and natural 3D environments. We focused on translational flight, because spatial information is only contained in the optic flow induced by translational locomotion. Indeed, flies, bees and other insects segregate their flight into relatively long intersaccadic translational flight sections interspersed with brief and rapid saccadic turns, presumably to maximize periods of translation (80% of the flight). With a novel adaptive model of the insect visual motion pathway we could show that the motion detector responses to background structures of cluttered environments are largely attenuated as a consequence of motion adaptation, while responses to foreground objects stay constant or even increase. This conclusion even holds under the dynamic flight conditions of insects.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/M2ZXTJ0hcKU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Due to the recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies, it becomes possible to directly analyze microbial communities in human body and environment. To understand how microbial communities adapt, develop, and interact with the human body and the surrounding environment, one of the fundamental challenges is to infer the interactions among different microbes. However, due to the compositional and high-dimensional nature of microbial data, statistical inference cannot offer reliable results. Consequently, new approaches that can accurately and robustly estimate the associations (putative interactions) among microbes are needed to analyze such compositional and high-dimensional data. We propose a novel framework called Microbial Prior Lasso (MPLasso) which integrates graph learning algorithm with microbial co-occurrences and associations obtained from scientific literature by using automated text mining. We show that MPLasso outperforms existing models in terms of accuracy, microbial network recovery rate, and reproducibility. Furthermore, the association networks we obtain from the Human Microbiome Project datasets show credible results when compared against laboratory data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YyG4OvVgNL0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Cells decode information of signaling activation at a scale of tens of minutes by downstream gene expression with a scale of hours to days, leading to cell fate decisions such as cell differentiation. However, no system identification method with such different time scales exists. Here we used compressed sensing technology and developed a system identification method using data of different time scales by recovering signals of missing time points. We measured phosphorylation of ERK and CREB, immediate early gene expression products, and mRNAs of decoder genes for neurite elongation in PC12 cell differentiation and performed system identification, revealing the input–output relationships between signaling and gene expression with sensitivity such as graded or switch-like response and with time delay and gain, representing signal transfer efficiency. We predicted and validated the identified system using pharmacological perturbation. Thus, we provide a versatile method for system identification using data with different time scales.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/w9dIuKnCqY0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Peptide-protein interactions contribute a significant fraction of the protein-protein interactome. Accurate modeling of these interactions is challenging due to the vast conformational space associated with interactions of highly flexible peptides with large receptor surfaces. To address this challenge we developed a fragment based high-resolution peptide-protein docking protocol. By streamlining the Rosetta fragment picker for accurate peptide fragment ensemble generation, the PIPER docking algorithm for exhaustive fragment-receptor rigid-body docking and Rosetta FlexPepDock for flexible full-atom refinement of PIPER docked models, we successfully addressed the challenge of accurate and efficient global peptide-protein docking at high-resolution with remarkable accuracy, as validated on a small but representative set of peptide-protein complex structures well resolved by X-ray crystallography. Our approach opens up the way to high-resolution modeling of many more peptide-protein interactions and to the detailed study of peptide-protein association in general. PIPER-FlexPepDock is freely available to the academic community as a server at http://piperfpd.furmanlab.cs.huji.ac.il.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hYhEtP3vh8E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

In computational biology, modeling is a fundamental tool for formulating, analyzing and predicting complex phenomena. Most neuron models, however, are designed to reproduce certain small sets of empirical data. Hence their outcome is usually not compatible or comparable with other models or datasets, making it unclear how widely applicable such models are. In this study, we investigate these aspects of modeling, namely credibility and generalizability, with a specific focus on auditory neurons involved in the localization of sound sources. The primary cues for binaural sound localization are comprised of interaural time and level differences (ITD/ILD), which are the timing and intensity differences of the sound waves arriving at the two ears. The lateral superior olive (LSO) in the auditory brainstem is one of the locations where such acoustic information is first computed. An LSO neuron receives temporally structured excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs that are driven by ipsi- and contralateral sound stimuli, respectively, and changes its spike rate according to binaural acoustic differences. Here we examine seven contemporary models of LSO neurons with different levels of biophysical complexity, from predominantly functional ones (‘shot-noise’ models) to those with more detailed physiological components (variations of integrate-and-fire and Hodgkin-Huxley-type). These models, calibrated to reproduce known monaural and binaural characteristics of LSO, generate largely similar results to each other in simulating ITD and ILD coding. Our comparisons of physiological detail, computational efficiency, predictive performances, and further expandability of the models demonstrate (1) that the simplistic, functional LSO models are suitable for applications where low computational costs and mathematical transparency are needed, (2) that more complex models with detailed membrane potential dynamics are necessary for simulation studies where sub-neuronal nonlinear processes play important roles, and (3) that, for general purposes, intermediate models might be a reasonable compromise between simplicity and biological plausibility.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1q5zmINJAsQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Mass cytometry (CyTOF) has greatly expanded the capability of cytometry. It is now easy to generate multiple CyTOF samples in a single study, with each sample containing single-cell measurement on 50 markers for more than hundreds of thousands of cells. Current methods do not adequately address the issues concerning combining multiple samples for subpopulation discovery, and these issues can be quickly and dramatically amplified with increasing number of samples. To overcome this limitation, we developed Partition-Assisted Clustering and Multiple Alignments of Networks (PAC-MAN) for the fast automatic identification of cell populations in CyTOF data closely matching that of expert manual-discovery, and for alignments between subpopulations across samples to define dataset-level cellular states. PAC-MAN is computationally efficient, allowing the management of very large CyTOF datasets, which are increasingly common in clinical studies and cancer studies that monitor various tissue samples for each subject.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aHhVhLnyCbQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Anatomical studies demonstrate that brain reformats input information to
generate reliable responses for performing computations. However, it remains
unclear how neural circuits encode complex spatio-temporal patterns. We show
that neural dynamics are strongly influenced by the phase alignment between the
input and the spontaneous chaotic activity. Input structuring along the
dominant chaotic projections causes the chaotic trajectories to become stable
channels (or attractors), hence, improving the computational capability of a
recurrent network. Using mean field analysis, we derive the impact of input
structuring on the overall stability of attractors formed. Our results indicate
that input alignment determines the extent of intrinsic noise suppression and
hence, alters the attractor state stability, thereby controlling the network's
inference ability.

	<description>A single-nucleotide polymorphism in the human arylamine N-acetyltransferase 2 (Nat2) gene has recently been identified as associated with insulin resistance in humans. To understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which alterations in Nat2 activity might cause insulin resistance, we examined murine ortholog Nat1 knockout (KO) mice.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We study synaptically coupled neuronal networks to identify the role of
coupling delays in network's synchronized behaviors. We consider a network of
excitable, relaxation oscillator neurons where two distinct populations, one
excitatory and one inhibitory, are coupled and interact with each other. The
excitable population is uncoupled, while the inhibitory population is tightly
coupled. A geometric singular perturbation analysis yields existence and
stability conditions for synchronization states under different firing patterns
between the two populations, along with formulas for the periods of such
synchronous solutions. Our results demonstrate that the presence of coupling
delays in the network promotes synchronization. Numerical simulations are
conducted to supplement and validate analytical results. We show the results
carry over to a model for spindle sleep rhythms in thalamocortical networks,
one of the biological systems which motivated our study. The analysis helps to
explain how coupling delays in either excitatory or inhibitory synapses
contribute to producing synchronized rhythms.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Can we hear the sound of our brain? Is there any technique which can enable
us to hear the neuro-electrical impulses originating from the different lobes
of brain? The answer to all these questions is YES. In this paper we present a
novel method with which we can sonify the Electroencephalogram (EEG) data
recorded in rest state as well as under the influence of a simplest acoustical
stimuli - a tanpura drone. The tanpura drone has a very simple yet very complex
acoustic features, which is generally used for creation of an ambiance during a
musical performance. Hence, for this pilot project we chose to study the
correlation between a simple acoustic stimuli (tanpura drone) and sonified EEG
data. Till date, there have been no study which deals with the direct
correlation between a bio-signal and its acoustic counterpart and how that
correlation varies under the influence of different types of stimuli. This is
the first of its kind study which bridges this gap and looks for a direct
correlation between music signal and EEG data using a robust mathematical
microscope called Multifractal Detrended Cross Correlation Analysis (MFDXA).
For this, we took EEG data of 10 participants in 2 min 'rest state' (i.e. with
white noise) and in 2 min 'tanpura drone' (musical stimulus) listening
condition. Next, the EEG signals from different electrodes were sonified and
MFDXA technique was used to assess the degree of correlation (or the cross
correlation coefficient) between tanpura signal and EEG signals. The variation
of {\gamma}x for different lobes during the course of the experiment also
provides major interesting new information. Only music stimuli has the ability
to engage several areas of the brain significantly unlike other stimuli (which
engages specific domains only).

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain atlases are a ubiquitous tool used for analyzing and interpreting brain
imaging datasets. Traditionally, brain atlases divided the brain into regions
separated by anatomical landmarks. In the last decade, several attempts have
been made to parcellate the brain into regions with distinct functional
activity using fMRI. To construct a brain atlas using fMRI, data driven
algorithms are used to group voxels with similar functional activity together
to form regions. Hierarchical clustering is one parcellation method that has
been used for functional parcellation of the brain, resulting in parcellations
that align well with cytoarchitectonic divisions of the brain. However, few
rigorous data driven evaluations of the method have been performed. Moreover,
the effect of removing autocorrelation trends from fMRI time series
(prewhitening) on the structure of the resultant atlas has not been previously
explored. In this paper, we use hierarchical clustering to produce functional
parcellations of the brain using hierarchical clustering. We use both
prewhitened and raw fMRI time series to construct the atlas. The resultant
atlases were then evaluated for their homogeneity, separation between regions,
reproducibility across subjects, and reproducibility across scans.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Autism Classification Using Brain Functional Connectivity Dynamics and Machine Learning. (arXiv:1712.08041v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The goal of the present study is to identify autism using machine learning
techniques and resting-state brain imaging data, leveraging the temporal
variability of the functional connections (FC) as the only information. We
estimated and compared the FC variability across brain regions between typical,
healthy subjects and autistic population by analyzing brain imaging data from a
world-wide multi-site database known as ABIDE (Autism Brain Imaging Data
Exchange). Our analysis revealed that patients diagnosed with autism spectrum
disorder (ASD) show increased FC variability in several brain regions that are
associated with low FC variability in the typical brain. We then used the
enhanced FC variability of brain regions as features for training machine
learning models for ASD classification and achieved 65% accuracy in
identification of ASD versus control subjects within the dataset. We also used
node strength estimated from number of functional connections per node averaged
over the whole scan as features for ASD classification.The results reveal that
the dynamic FC measures outperform or are comparable with the static FC
measures in predicting ASD.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The role of self-touch experience in the formation of the self. (arXiv:1712.07843v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07843</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07843</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The human self has many facets: there is the physical body and then there are
different concepts or representations supported by processes in the brain such
as the ecological, social, temporal, conceptual, and experiential self. The
mechanisms of operation and formation of the self are, however, largely
unknown. The basis is constituted by the ecological or sensorimotor self that
deals with the configuration of the body in space and its action possibilities.
This self is prereflective, prelinguistic, and initially perhaps even largely
independent of visual inputs. Instead, somatosensory (tactile and
proprioceptive) information both before and after birth may play a key part. In
this paper, we propose that self-touch experience may be a fundamental
mechanisms to bootstrap the formation of the sensorimotor self and perhaps even
beyond. We will investigate this from the perspectives of phenomenology,
developmental psychology, and neuroscience. In light of the evidence from fetus
and infant development, we will speculate about the possible mechanisms that
may drive the formation of first body representations drawing on self-touch
experience.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Mechanistic modeling quantifies the influence of tumor growth kinetics on the response to anti-angiogenic treatment</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005874</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Thomas D. Gaddy, Qianhui Wu, Alyssa D. Arnheim, Stacey D. Finley&lt;/p&gt;

Tumors exploit angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vasculature, in order to obtain nutrients required for continued growth and proliferation. Targeting factors that regulate angiogenesis, including the potent promoter vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is therefore an attractive strategy for inhibiting tumor growth. Computational modeling can be used to identify tumor-specific properties that influence the response to anti-angiogenic strategies. Here, we build on our previous systems biology model of VEGF transport and kinetics in tumor-bearing mice to include a tumor compartment whose volume depends on the “angiogenic signal” produced when VEGF binds to its receptors on tumor endothelial cells. We trained and validated the model using published &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; measurements of xenograft tumor volume, producing a model that accurately predicts the tumor’s response to anti-angiogenic treatment. We applied the model to investigate how tumor growth kinetics influence the response to anti-angiogenic treatment targeting VEGF. Based on multivariate regression analysis, we found that certain intrinsic kinetic parameters that characterize the growth of tumors could successfully predict response to anti-VEGF treatment, the reduction in tumor volume. Lastly, we use the trained model to predict the response to anti-VEGF therapy for tumors expressing different levels of VEGF receptors. The model predicts that certain tumors are more sensitive to treatment than others, and the response to treatment shows a nonlinear dependence on the VEGF receptor expression. Overall, this model is a useful tool for predicting how tumors will respond to anti-VEGF treatment, and it complements pre-clinical &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; mouse studies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Fxm9nfQQELA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Theoretical perspectives on central chemosensitivity: CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-sensitive neurons in the locus coeruleus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005853</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Maria C. Quintero, Robert W. Putnam, Juan M. Cordovez&lt;/p&gt;

Central chemoreceptors are highly sensitive neurons that respond to changes in pH and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels. An increase in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; typically reflects a rise in the firing rate of these neurons, which stimulates an increase in ventilation. Here, we present an ionic current model that reproduces the basic electrophysiological activity of individual CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-sensitive neurons from the locus coeruleus (LC). We used this model to explore chemoreceptor discharge patterns in response to electrical and chemical stimuli. The modeled neurons showed both stimulus-evoked activity and spontaneous activity under physiological parameters. Neuronal responses to electrical and chemical stimulation showed specific firing patterns of spike frequency adaptation, postinhibitory rebound, and post-stimulation recovery. Conversely, the response to chemical stimulation alone (based on physiological CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; changes), in the absence of external depolarizing stimulation, showed no signs of postinhibitory rebound or post-stimulation recovery, and no depolarizing sag. A sensitivity index for the firing-rate response to the different stimuli revealed that the contribution of an applied stimulus current exceeded that of the chemical signals. The firing-rate response increased indefinitely with injected depolarizing current, but reached saturation with chemical stimuli. Our computational model reproduced the regular pacemaker-like spiking pattern, action potential shape, and most of the membrane properties that characterize CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-sensitive neurons from the locus coeruleus. This validates the model and highlights its potential as a tool for studying the cellular mechanisms underlying the altered central chemosensitivity present in a variety of disorders such as sudden infant death syndrome, depression, and anxiety. In addition, the model results suggest that small external electrical signals play a greater role in determining the chemosensitive response to changes in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; than previously thought. This highlights the importance of considering electrical synaptic transmission in studies of intrinsic chemosensitivity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oQuj4KpDgu4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Tensor-driven extraction of developmental features from varying paediatric EEG datasets. (arXiv:1712.07443v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective. Consistently changing physiological properties in developing
children's brains challenges new data heavy technologies, like brain-computer
interfaces (BCI). Advancing signal processing methods in such technologies to
be more sensitive to developmental changes could help improve their function
and usability in paediatric populations. Taking advantage of the
multi-dimensional structure of EEG data through tensor analysis offers a
framework to extract relevant developmental features present in paediatric
resting-state EEG datasets. Methods. Three paediatric datasets from varying
developmental states and populations were analyzed using a developed two-step
constrained Parallel Factor (PARAFAC) tensor decomposition. The datasets
included the Muir Maxwell Epilepsy Centre, Children's Hospital Boston-MIT and
the Child Mind Institute, outlining two impaired and one healthy population,
respectively. Within dataset cross-validation used support vector machines
(SVM) for classification of out-of-fold data predicting subject age as a proxy
measure of development. t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE)
maps complemented classification analysis through visualization of the
high-dimensional feature structures. Main Results. Development-sensitive
features were successfully identified for the developmental conditions of each
dataset. SVM classification accuracy and misclassification costs were improved
significantly for both healthy and impaired paediatric populations. t-SNE maps
revealed suitable tensor factorization was key in extracting developmental
features. Significance. The described methods are a promising tool for
incorporating the unique developmental features present throughout childhood
EEG into new technologies like BCI and its applications.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Quantum approaches to music cognition. (arXiv:1712.07417v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Quantum cognition emerged as an important discipline of mathematical
psychology during the last two decades. Using abstract analogies between mental
phenomena and the formal framework of physical quantum theory, quantum
cognition demonstrated its ability to resolve several puzzles from cognitive
psychology, issued in the bounded rationality research program. Until now,
quantum cognition essentially exploited ideas from projective (Hilbert space)
geometry, such as quantum probability or quantum similarity. However, many
powerful tools provided by physical quantum theory, such as symmetry groups and
their representation theories, particularly local gauge symmetries and their
connection to physical forces, have not been utilized in the field of quantum
cognition research sofar. This is somewhat astonishing as &quot;mental forces&quot; or
&quot;mental energies&quot; appear as important metaphorical concepts in cognitive
science. One particular example is music psychology, where static or dynamic
tonal attraction phenomena are computationally often modeled in terms of
metaphorical forces. Inspired by seminal work by Guerino Mazzola on the
connection between musical forces and symmetries in tonal music, our study aims
at elucidating and reconciling musical forces in the framework of quantum
cognition. Based on the fundamental transposition symmetry of tonal music, as
reflected by the circle of fifths, we develop different wave function
descriptions over this underlying tonal space, governed by a Schr\&quot;odinger
equation containing different interaction energies. We present quantum models
for static and dynamic tonal attraction and compare them with traditional
computational models in musicology. Our approach turns out to be more
parsimonious and of greater explanatory power than symbolic models of music
perception.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Improvement of Resting-state EEG Analysis Process with Spectrum Weight-Voting based on LES. (arXiv:1712.07369v1 [eess.SP])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07369</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;EEG is a non-invasive technique for recording brain bioelectric activity,
which has potential applications in various fields such as human-computer
interaction and neuroscience. However, there are many difficulties in analyzing
EEG data, including its complex composition, low amplitude as well as low
signal-to-noise ratio. Some of the existing methods of analysis are based on
feature extraction and machine learning to differentiate the phase of
schizophrenia that samples belong to. However, medical research requires the
use of machine learning not only to give more accurate classification results,
but also to give the results that can be applied to pathological studies. The
main purpose of this study is to obtain the weight values as the representation
of influence of each frequency band on the classification of schizophrenia
phases on the basis of a more effective classification method using the LES
feature extraction, and then the weight values are processed and applied to
improve the accuracy of machine learning classification. We propose a method
called weight-voting to obtain the weights of sub-bands features by using
results of classification for voting to fit the actual categories of EEG data,
and using weights for reclassification. Through this method, we can first
obtain the influence of each band in distinguishing three schizophrenia phases,
and analyze the effect of band features on the risk of schizophrenia
contributing to the study of psychopathology. Our results show that there is a
high correlation between the change of weight of low gamma band and the
difference between HC, CHR and FES. If the features revised according to
weights are used for reclassification, the accuracy of result will be improved
compared with the original classifier, which confirms the role of the band
weight distribution.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Neural computation from first principles: Using the maximum entropy method to obtain an optimal bits-per-joule neuron. (arXiv:1606.03063v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03063</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03063</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Optimization results are one method for understanding neural computation from
Nature's perspective and for defining the physical limits on neuron-like
engineering. Earlier work looks at individual properties or performance
criteria and occasionally a combination of two, such as energy and information.
Here we make use of Jaynes' maximum entropy method and combine a larger set of
constraints, possibly dimensionally distinct, each expressible as an
expectation. The method identifies a likelihood-function and a sufficient
statistic arising from each such optimization. This likelihood is a
first-hitting time distribution in the exponential class. Particular constraint
sets are identified that, from an optimal inference perspective, justify
earlier neurocomputational models. Interactions between constraints, mediated
through the inferred likelihood, restrict constraint-set parameterizations,
e.g., the energy-budget limits estimation performance which, in turn, matches
an axonal communication constraint. Such linkages are, for biologists,
experimental predictions of the method. In addition to the related likelihood,
at least one type of constraint set implies marginal distributions, and in this
case, a Shannon bits/joule statement arises.

	<description>Synaptic plasticity – the directed modulation of synaptic connections by specific activity histories or physiological signals – is believed to be a major mechanism for the modification of neuronal network function. This belief, however, has a ‘flip side’: the supposition that synapses do not change spontaneously in manners unrelated to such signals. Contrary to this supposition, recent studies reveal that synapses do change spontaneously, and to a fairly large extent. Here we review experimental results on spontaneous synaptic remodeling, its relative contributions to total synaptic remodeling, its statistical characteristics, and its physiological importance.</description>

A total of 41 different &lt;em&gt;SERAC1&lt;/em&gt; variants were identified, including 20 that have not been reported before. With the exception of 2 families with a milder phenotype, all affected individuals showed a strikingly homogeneous phenotype and time course. Severe, reversible neonatal liver dysfunction and hypoglycemia were seen in &amp;gt;40% of all cases. Starting at a median age of 6 months, muscular hypotonia (91%) was seen, followed by progressive spasticity (82%, median onset = 15 months) and dystonia (82%, 18 months). The majority of affected individuals never learned to walk (68%). Seventy-nine percent suffered hearing loss, 58% never learned to speak, and nearly all had significant intellectual disability (88%). Magnetic resonance imaging features were accordingly homogenous, with bilateral basal ganglia involvement (98%); the characteristic “putaminal eye” was seen in 53%. The urinary marker 3-methylglutaconic aciduria was present in virtually all patients (98%). Supportive treatment focused on spasticity and drooling, and was effective in the individuals treated; hearing aids or cochlear implants did not improve communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Note the bundles of descending cortical axons, and the ramifications and small axonal boutons scattered within the striatum. A few large dendrites covered with spines are seen in the upper part of the field, due to leakage of virus to transfect some medium spiny neurons in the striatum as well. In rats with brain iron deficiency, these synaptic terminals become hypersensitive in their ability to release glutamate upon direct light stimulation. See Yepes et al., p. 951 for details.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Ischemic core thresholds change with time to reperfusion: A case control study</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25109-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We aimed to identify whether acute ischemic stroke patients with known complete reperfusion after thrombectomy had the same baseline computed tomography perfusion (CTP) ischemic core threshold to predict infarction as thrombolysis patients with complete reperfusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25109-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients who underwent thrombectomy were matched by age, clinical severity, occlusion location, and baseline perfusion lesion volume to patients who were treated with intravenous alteplase alone from the International Stroke Perfusion Imaging Registry. A pixel-based analysis of coregistered pretreatment CTP and 24-hour diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was then undertaken to define the optimum CTP thresholds for the ischemic core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25109-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 132 eligible thrombectomy patients and 132 matched controls treated with alteplase alone. Baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (median, 15; interquartile range [IQR], 11–19), age (median, 65; IQR, 59–80), and time to intravenous treatment (median, 153 minutes; IQR, 82–315) were well matched (all &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; 0.05). Despite similar baseline CTP ischemic core volumes using the previously validated measure (relative cerebral blood flow [rCBF], &amp;lt;30%), thrombectomy patients had a smaller median 24-hour infarct core of 17.3ml (IQR, 11.3–32.8) versus 24.3ml (IQR, 16.7–42.2; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.011) in alteplase-treated controls. As a result, the optimal threshold to define the ischemic core in thrombectomy patients was rCBF &amp;lt;20% (area under the curve [AUC], 0.89; 95% CI, 0.84, 0.94), whereas in alteplase controls the optimal ischemic core threshold remained rCBF &amp;lt;30% (AUC, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.77, 0.85).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25109-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thrombectomy salvaged tissue with lower CBF, likely attributed to earlier reperfusion. For patients who achieve rapid reperfusion, a stricter rCBF threshold to estimate the ischemic core should be considered. Ann Neurol 2017;82:995–1003&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Boys in a famous choir: Singing and ticcing</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This informal observational study on the tic prevalence in 40 young singers was carried out during a public concert of Bach's Christmas Oratorio. Tics were highly prevalent (present in 35% = 14 boys). Given the possibility of an overrepresentation of perioral tics in this group of highly achieving young vocal artists, one might speculate that there is a relationship between the ability of the motor system to produce a surplus of movements (tics) and high performance (exquisite singing). Despite the unusual study design, with all its limitations, our observations strengthen the view that tics may be related to motor learning. However, alternative explanations, for example, that repetitive motor performance or personality traits in singers drive tic development, could also be true. In light of the boys choir's enchantment, the sole perception of tics as a disorder falls short of the properties of the motor system. Ann Neurol 2017;82:1029–1031&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Efficient Algorithms for Searching the Minimum Information Partition in Integrated Information Theory. (arXiv:1712.06745v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to integrate information in the brain is considered to be an
essential property for cognition and consciousness. Integrated Information
Theory (IIT) hypothesizes that the amount of integrated information ($\Phi$) in
the brain is related to the level of consciousness. IIT proposes that to
quantify information integration in a system as a whole, integrated information
should be measured across the partition of the system at which information loss
caused by partitioning is minimized, called the Minimum Information Partition
(MIP). The computational cost for exhaustively searching for the MIP grows
exponentially with system size, making it difficult to apply IIT to real neural
data. It has been previously shown that if a measure of $\Phi$ satisfies a
mathematical property, submodularity, the MIP can be found in a polynomial
order by an optimization algorithm. However, although the first version of
$\Phi$ is submodular, the later versions are not. In this study, we empirically
explore to what extent the algorithm can be applied to the non-submodular
measures of $\Phi$ by evaluating the accuracy of the algorithm in simulated
data and real neural data. We find that the algorithm identifies the MIP in a
nearly perfect manner even for the non-submodular measures. Our results show
that the algorithm allows us to measure $\Phi$ in large systems within a
practical amount of time.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00579</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;It has been repeatedly conjectured that the brain retrieves statistical
regularities from stimuli. Here we present a new statistical approach allowing
to address this conjecture. This approach is based on a new class of stochastic
processes driven by chains with memory of variable length. It leads to a new
experimental protocol in which sequences of auditory stimuli generated by a
stochastic chain are presented to volunteers while electroencephalographic
(EEG) data is recorded from their scalp. A new statistical model selection
procedure for functional data is introduced and proved to be consistent.
Applied to samples of EEG data collected using our experimental protocol it
produces results supporting the conjecture that the brain effectively
identifies the structure of the chain generating the sequence of stimuli.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;For a class of fast {\it Cl-}type inhibitory spiking neuron models with
delayed feedback fed with a Poisson stochastic process of excitatory impulses,
it is proven that the stream of output interspike intervals cannot be presented
as a Markov process of any order.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Molecular recognition and packing frustration in a helical protein</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005909</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/OC7JzGxYhIA/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Loan Huynh, Chris Neale, Régis Pomès, Hue Sun Chan&lt;/p&gt;

Biomolecular recognition entails attractive forces for the functional native states and discrimination against potential nonnative interactions that favor alternate stable configurations. The challenge posed by the competition of nonnative stabilization against native-centric forces is conceptualized as frustration. Experiment indicates that frustration is often minimal in evolved biological systems although nonnative possibilities are intuitively abundant. Much of the physical basis of minimal frustration in protein folding thus remains to be elucidated. Here we make progress by studying the colicin immunity protein Im9. To assess the energetic favorability of nonnative versus native interactions, we compute free energies of association of various combinations of the four helices in Im9 (referred to as H1, H2, H3, and H4) by extensive explicit-water molecular dynamics simulations (total simulated time &amp;gt; 300 μs), focusing primarily on the pairs with the largest native contact surfaces, H1-H2 and H1-H4. Frustration is detected in H1-H2 packing in that a nonnative packing orientation is significantly stabilized relative to native, whereas such a prominent nonnative effect is not observed for H1-H4 packing. However, in contrast to the favored nonnative H1-H2 packing in isolation, the native H1-H2 packing orientation is stabilized by H3 and loop residues surrounding H4. Taken together, these results showcase the contextual nature of molecular recognition, and suggest further that nonnative effects in H1-H2 packing may be largely avoided by the experimentally inferred Im9 folding transition state with native packing most developed at the H1-H4 rather than the H1-H2 interface.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OC7JzGxYhIA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A Prospective Trial of Magnetic Resonance guided Focused Ultrasound Thalamotomy for Essential Tremor: Results at the 2-year Follow-up</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25126</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25126</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Magnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) has recently been investigated as a new treatment modality for essential tremor (ET), but the durability of the procedure has not yet been evaluated. This study reports results at a 2- year follow-up after MRgFUS thalamotomy for ET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A total of 76 patients with moderate-to-severe ET, who had not responded to at least two trials of medical therapy, were enrolled in the original randomized study of unilateral thalamotomy and evaluated using the clinical rating scale for tremor. Sixty-seven of the patients continued in the open-label extension phase of the study with monitoring for 2 years. Nine patients were excluded by two years, for example because of alternative therapy such as deep brain stimulation (n = 3) or inadequate thermal lesioning (n = 1). However, all patients in each follow-up period were analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Mean hand tremor score at baseline (19.8±4.9, 76 patients) improved by 55% at 6 months (8.6±4.5, 75 patients). The improvement in tremor score from baseline was durable at 1 year (53%, 8.9±4.8, 70 patients) and at 2 years (56%, 8.8±5.0, 67 patients). Similarly, the disability score at baseline (16.4±4.5, 76 patients) improved by 64% at 6 months (5.4±4.7, 75 patients). This improvement was also sustained at 1 year (5.4±5.3, 70 patients) and at 2 years (6.5±5.0, 67 patients). Paresthesias and gait disturbances were the most common adverse effects at 1 year-each observed in 10 patients with an additional 5 patients experiencing neurological adverse effects. None of the adverse events worsened over the period of follow up and 2 of these resolved. There were no new delayed complications at 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: Tremor suppression after MRgFUS thalamotomy for ET is stably maintained at 2 years. Latent or delayed complications do not develop after treatment. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: MYRF is associated with encephalopathy with reversible myelin vacuolization</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25125</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25125</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reversible myelin vacuolization is associated with variable conditions including mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion (MERS), which is characterized by mildly impaired consciousness and transient splenial lesion. Familial and/or recurrent cases with a clinical diagnosis of MERS suggest the presence of genetic factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We examined a family in which the proband presented with a history of recurrent encephalopathy with extensive but reversible cerebral myelin vacuolization and neurological symptoms similar to those of MERS spanning over three generations. Whole-exome sequencing was performed in family members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight rare nonsynonymous single-nucleotide variants shared by all patients were identified. By filtering genes expressed in the corpus callosum, we identified a heterozygous c.1208A&amp;gt;G predicting p.Gln403Arg in the highly conserved DNA-binding domain in the myelin regulatory factor (&lt;em&gt;MYRF&lt;/em&gt;) gene. We subsequently screened the coding regions of &lt;em&gt;MYRF&lt;/em&gt; by Sanger sequencing in our cohort comprised of 33 sporadic cases with MERS and three cases in another family with extensive myelin vacuolization, and identified the same heterozygous c.1208A&amp;gt;G in all affected members in the second family. Luciferase assay revealed that transcriptional activity of N-terminal region of MYRF was significantly diminished by introducing the c.1208A&amp;gt;G variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;MYRF is a transcriptional regulator that is necessary for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin maintenance. Functional defects of MYRF are likely to be causally associated with encephalopathy with extensive myelin vacuolization. We propose the term “&lt;em&gt;MYRF&lt;/em&gt;-related mild encephalopathy with reversible myelin vacuolization (MMERV)”. Our findings provide a new perspective on the pathogenesis of myelin vacuolization. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The characterisation of biomarkers and endophenotypic measures has been a
central goal of research in psychiatry over the last years. While most of this
research has focused on the identification of biomarkers and endophenotypes,
using various experimental approaches, it has been recognised that their
instantiations, through computational models, have a great potential to help us
understand and interpret these experimental results. However, the enormous
increase in available neurophysiological and neurocognitive as well as
computational data also poses new challenges. How can a researcher stay on top
of the experimental literature? How can computational modelling data be
efficiently compared to experimental data? How can computational modelling most
effectively inform experimentalists? Recently, a general scientific framework
for the generation of executable tests that automatically compare model results
to experimental observations, SciUnit, has been proposed. Here we exploit this
framework for research in psychiatry to address the challenges mentioned above.
We extend the SciUnit framework by adding an experimental database, which
contains a comprehensive collection of relevant experimental observations, and
a prediction database, which contains a collection of predictions generated by
computational models. Together with appropriately designed SciUnit tests and
methods to mine and visualise the databases, model data and test results, this
extended framework has the potential to greatly facilitate the use of
computational models in psychiatry. As an initial example we present ASSRUnit,
a module for auditory steady-state response deficits in psychiatric disorders.

Predicting novel microRNA (miRNA)-disease associations is clinically significant due to miRNAs’ potential roles of diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for various human diseases. Previous studies have demonstrated the viability of utilizing different types of biological data to computationally infer new disease-related miRNAs. Yet researchers face the challenge of how to effectively integrate diverse datasets and make reliable predictions. In this study, we presented a computational model named Laplacian Regularized Sparse Subspace Learning for MiRNA-Disease Association prediction (LRSSLMDA), which projected miRNAs/diseases’ statistical feature profile and graph theoretical feature profile to a common subspace. It used Laplacian regularization to preserve the local structures of the training data and a &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-norm constraint to select important miRNA/disease features for prediction. The strength of dimensionality reduction enabled the model to be easily extended to much higher dimensional datasets than those exploited in this study. Experimental results showed that LRSSLMDA outperformed ten previous models: the AUC of 0.9178 in global leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) and the AUC of 0.8418 in local LOOCV indicated the model’s superior prediction accuracy; and the average AUC of 0.9181+/-0.0004 in 5-fold cross validation justified its accuracy and stability. In addition, three types of case studies further demonstrated its predictive power. Potential miRNAs related to Colon Neoplasms, Lymphoma, Kidney Neoplasms, Esophageal Neoplasms and Breast Neoplasms were predicted by LRSSLMDA. Respectively, 98%, 88%, 96%, 98% and 98% out of the top 50 predictions were validated by experimental evidences. Therefore, we conclude that LRSSLMDA would be a valuable computational tool for miRNA-disease association prediction.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8AF4L8T4qyg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Optimal number of spacers in CRISPR arrays</title>

Prokaryotic organisms survive under constant pressure of viruses. CRISPR-Cas system provides its prokaryotic host with an adaptive immune defense against viruses that have been previously encountered. It consists of two components: Cas-proteins that cleave the foreign DNA and CRISPR array that suits as a virus recognition key. CRISPR array consists of a series of spacers, short pieces of DNA that originate from and match the corresponding parts of viral DNA called protospacers. Here we estimate the number of spacers in a CRISPR array of a prokaryotic cell which maximizes its protection against a viral attack. The optimality follows from a competition between two trends: too few distinct spacers make host vulnerable to an attack by a virus with mutated corresponding protospacers, while an excessive variety of spacers dilutes the number of the CRISPR complexes armed with the most recent and thus most useful spacers. We first evaluate the optimal number of spacers in a simple scenario of an infection by a single viral species and later consider a more general case of multiple viral species. We find that depending on such parameters as the concentration of CRISPR-Cas interference complexes and its preference to arm with more recently acquired spacers, the rate of viral mutation, and the number of viral species, the predicted optimal number of spacers lies within a range that agrees with experimentally-observed values.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1nIpevm5XbY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Survival analysis represents an important outcome measure in clinical research and clinical trials; further, survival ranking may offer additional advantages in clinical trials. In this study, we developed a non-parametric ranking-based technique to transform patients' survival data into a linear space of hazard ranks. The transformation enables the utilization of machine learning base-learners including Gaussian process regression, Lasso, and random forest on survival data. The method was submitted to the DREAM Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Stratification Challenge. Ranked first place, the model gave more accurate ranking predictions on the PRO-ACT ALS dataset in comparison to Cox proportional hazard model. By utilizing right-censored data in its training process, the method demonstrated its state-of-the-art predictive power in ALS survival ranking. Its feature selection identified multiple important factors, some of which conflicts with previous studies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6KF5NSd6aag&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: An error-tuned model for sensorimotor learning</title>

Current models of sensorimotor control posit that motor commands are generated by combining multiple modules which may consist of internal models, motor primitives or motor synergies. The mechanisms which select modules based on task requirements and modify their output during learning are therefore critical to our understanding of sensorimotor control. Here we develop a novel modular architecture for multi-dimensional tasks in which a set of fixed primitives are each able to compensate for errors in a single direction in the task space. The contribution of the primitives to the motor output is determined by both top-down contextual information and bottom-up error information. We implement this model for a task in which subjects learn to manipulate a dynamic object whose orientation can vary. In the model, visual information regarding the context (the orientation of the object) allows the appropriate primitives to be engaged. This top-down module selection is implemented by a Gaussian function tuned for the visual orientation of the object. Second, each module's contribution adapts across trials in proportion to its ability to decrease the current kinematic error. Specifically, adaptation is implemented by cosine tuning of primitives to the current direction of the error, which we show to be theoretically optimal for reducing error. This error-tuned model makes two novel predictions. First, interference should occur between alternating dynamics only when the kinematic errors associated with each oppose one another. In contrast, dynamics which lead to orthogonal errors should not interfere. Second, kinematic errors alone should be sufficient to engage the appropriate modules, even in the absence of contextual information normally provided by vision. We confirm both these predictions experimentally and show that the model can also account for data from previous experiments. Our results suggest that two interacting processes account for module selection during sensorimotor control and learning.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EJRADLSVu2E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Invariant recognition drives neural representations of action sequences</title>

Recognizing the actions of others from visual stimuli is a crucial aspect of human perception that allows individuals to respond to social cues. Humans are able to discriminate between similar actions despite transformations, like changes in viewpoint or actor, that substantially alter the visual appearance of a scene. This ability to generalize across complex transformations is a hallmark of human visual intelligence. Advances in understanding action recognition at the neural level have not always translated into precise accounts of the computational principles underlying what representations of action sequences are constructed by human visual cortex. Here we test the hypothesis that invariant action discrimination might fill this gap. Recently, the study of artificial systems for static object perception has produced models, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), that achieve human level performance in complex discriminative tasks. Within this class, architectures that better support invariant object recognition also produce image representations that better match those implied by human and primate neural data. However, whether these models produce representations of action sequences that support recognition across complex transformations and closely follow neural representations of actions remains unknown. Here we show that spatiotemporal CNNs accurately categorize video stimuli into action classes, and that deliberate model modifications that improve performance on an invariant action recognition task lead to data representations that better match human neural recordings. Our results support our hypothesis that performance on invariant discrimination dictates the neural representations of actions computed in the brain. These results broaden the scope of the invariant recognition framework for understanding visual intelligence from perception of inanimate objects and faces in static images to the study of human perception of action sequences.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O-ttRSy9wU0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Filament turnover tunes both force generation and dissipation to control long-range flows in a model actomyosin cortex</title>

Actomyosin-based cortical flow is a fundamental engine for cellular morphogenesis. Cortical flows are generated by cross-linked networks of actin filaments and myosin motors, in which active stress produced by motor activity is opposed by passive resistance to network deformation. Continuous flow requires local remodeling through crosslink unbinding and and/or filament disassembly. But how local remodeling tunes stress production and dissipation, and how this in turn shapes long range flow, remains poorly understood. Here, we study a computational model for a cross-linked network with active motors based on minimal requirements for production and dissipation of contractile stress: Asymmetric filament compliance, spatial heterogeneity of motor activity, reversible cross-links and filament turnover. We characterize how the production and dissipation of network stress depend, individually, on cross-link dynamics and filament turnover, and how these dependencies combine to determine overall rates of cortical flow. Our analysis predicts that filament turnover is required to maintain active stress against external resistance and steady state flow in response to external stress. Steady state stress increases with filament lifetime up to a characteristic time &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, then decreases with lifetime above &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;. Effective viscosity increases with filament lifetime up to a characteristic time &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, and then becomes independent of filament lifetime and sharply dependent on crosslink dynamics. These individual dependencies of active stress and effective viscosity define multiple regimes of steady state flow. In particular our model predicts that when filament lifetimes are shorter than both &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, the dependencies of effective viscosity and steady state stress on filament turnover cancel one another, such that flow speed is insensitive to filament turnover, and shows a simple dependence on motor activity and crosslink dynamics. These results provide a framework for understanding how animal cells tune cortical flow through local control of network remodeling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lHK-if0u2KM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: MAGPIE: Simplifying access and execution of computational models in the life sciences</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Christoph Baldow, Sebastian Salentin, Michael Schroeder, Ingo Roeder, Ingmar Glauche&lt;/p&gt;

Over the past decades, quantitative methods linking theory and observation became increasingly important in many areas of life science. Subsequently, a large number of mathematical and computational models has been developed. The BioModels database alone lists more than 140,000 Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) models. However, while the exchange within specific model classes has been supported by standardisation and database efforts, the generic application and especially the re-use of models is still limited by practical issues such as easy and straight forward model execution. MAGPIE, a Modeling and Analysis Generic Platform with Integrated Evaluation, closes this gap by providing a software platform for both, publishing and executing computational models without restrictions on the programming language, thereby combining a maximum on flexibility for programmers with easy handling for non-technical users. MAGPIE goes beyond classical SBML platforms by including &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; models, independent of the underlying programming language, ranging from simple script models to complex data integration and computations. We demonstrate the versatility of MAGPIE using four prototypic example cases. We also outline the potential of MAGPIE to improve transparency and reproducibility of computational models in life sciences. A demo server is available at magpie.imb.medizin.tu-dresden.de.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/V972smzk-78&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Optimal occlusion uniformly partitions red blood cells fluxes within a microvascular network</title>

In animals, gas exchange between blood and tissues occurs in narrow vessels, whose diameter is comparable to that of a red blood cell. Red blood cells must deform to squeeze through these narrow vessels, transiently blocking or occluding the vessels they pass through. Although the dynamics of vessel occlusion have been studied extensively, it remains an open question why microvessels need to be so narrow. We study occlusive dynamics within a model microvascular network: the embryonic zebrafish trunk. We show that pressure feedbacks created when red blood cells enter the finest vessels of the trunk act together to uniformly partition red blood cells through the microvasculature. Using mathematical models as well as direct observation, we show that these occlusive feedbacks are tuned throughout the trunk network to prevent the vessels closest to the heart from short-circuiting the network. Thus occlusion is linked with another open question of microvascular function: how are red blood cells delivered at the same rate to each micro-vessel? Our analysis shows that tuning of occlusive feedbacks increase the total dissipation within the network by a factor of 11, showing that uniformity of flows rather than minimization of transport costs may be prioritized by the microvascular network.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5_-91bcH5rs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: High-frequency oscillations are not better biomarkers of epileptogenic tissues than spikes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25124</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25124</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in intracerebral EEG (stereoelectroencephalography, SEEG) are considered as better biomarkers of epileptogenic tissues than spikes. How this can be applied at the patient level remains poorly understood. We investigated how well the HFOs and the spikes can predict epileptogenic regions with a large spatial sampling at the patient level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We analyzed non-REM sleep SEEG recordings sampled at 2,048Hz of thirty patients. Ripples (R, 80-250Hz), fast ripples (FR, 250-500Hz) and spikes were automatically detected. Rates of these markers and several combinations – spikes co-occurring with HFOs or FRs and cross rate (Spk⊗HFO) – were compared to a quantified measure of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) by performing a receiver operating characteristic analysis for each patient individually. We used a Wilcoxon sign rank test corrected for false-discovery rate to assess whether a marker was better than the others for predicting the SOZ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 2930 channels was analyzed (median of 100 channels per patient). The HFOs or any of its variants were not statistically better than spikes. Only one feature, the cross-rate was better than all the other markers. Moreover, fast ripples, even though very specific, were not delineating all epileptogenic tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: At the patient level, the performance of the HFOs is weakened by the presence of strong physiological HFO generators. Fast ripples are not sensitive enough to be the unique biomarker of epileptogenicity. Nevertheless, combining HFOs and spikes using our proposed measure –the cross rate– is a better strategy than using only one marker. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Person-specific contribution of neuropathologies to cognitive loss in old age</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Mixed neuropathologies are the most common cause of dementia at the population level, but how different neuropathologies contribute to cognitive decline at the individual level remains unknown. We quantified the contribution of nine neuropathologies to cognitive loss at an individual level. Methods: Participants (n=1,079) came from 2 longitudinal clinical-pathologic studies of aging. All completed 2+ cognitive evaluations (maximum = 22), died and underwent neuropathologic examinations to identify Alzheimer's disease (AD), other neurodegenerative diseases, and vascular pathologies. Linear mixed models examined associations of neuropathologies with cognitive decline and estimated the proportion of cognitive loss accounted for by each neuropathology at a person-specific level. Results: Neuropathology was ubiquitous, with 94% of participants having 1+, 78% having 2+, 58% having 3+, and 35% having 4+. AD was most frequent (65%) but rarely occurred in isolation (9%). Remarkably, more than 230 different neuropathologic combinations were observed, each of which occurred in &amp;lt;6% of the cohort. The relative contributions of specific neuropathologies to cognitive loss varied widely across individuals. Although AD accounted for an average of about 50% of the observed cognitive loss, the proportion accounted for at the individual level ranged widely from 22% to 100%. Lewy bodies and hippocampal sclerosis also had potent effects, but again their impacts varied at the person-specific level. Interpretation: There is much greater heterogeneity in the comorbidity and cognitive impact of age-related neuropathologies than currently appreciated, suggesting an urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches that embrace the complexity of disease to combat cognitive decline in old age.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monoclonal antibodies that target CD20 expressing B cells represent an important new treatment option for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). B cell depleting therapy is highly effective against relapsing forms of the disease, and is also the first treatment approach proven to protect against disability worsening in primary progressive MS. Moreover, evolving clinical experience with B cell therapy, combined with a more sophisticated understanding of humoral immunity in preclinical models and in patients with MS, have led to major progress in deciphering the immune pathogenesis of MS. Here, we review the nuanced roles of B cells in MS autoimmunity, the clinical data supporting use of ocrelizumab and other anti-CD20 therapies in the treatment of MS, as well as safety and practical considerations for prescribing. Lastly, we summarize remaining unanswered questions regarding the proper role of anti-CD20 therapy in MS, its limitations, and the future landscape of B cell based approaches to treatment.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Mechanisms of Caspr2 antibodies in autoimmune encephalitis and neuromyotonia</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: To determine the pathogenic mechanisms of autoantibodies to the cell adhesion molecule Caspr2 in acquired neuromyotonia and autoimmune encephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Caspr2 positive samples were confirmed using a cell-based assay, and their IgG subtypes were determined by ELISA and cell-based assay. A solid phase binding assay quantified the binding of Caspr2 to contactin-2 in the presence of Caspr2 autoantibodies. Living cultures of primary rat hippocampal neurons were incubated with Caspr2-positive or control sera and the distribution of Caspr2-positive immunofluorescent puncta and total surface Caspr2 were quantified. HEK cells transfected to express Caspr2 were incubated with Caspr2-positive or control samples, and cell-surface biotinylation and Western blot were used to assess total, internalized, and surface levels of Caspr2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We confirmed six samples with strong Caspr2 reactivity. IgG4 Caspr2 antibodies were present in all six cases. Caspr2 interacted with another cell adhesion molecule, contactin-2, with nanomolar affinity in the solid phase assay, and Caspr2 autoantibodies inhibited this interaction. Caspr2 autoantibodies did not affect the surface expression of Caspr2 in rat primary hippocampal neurons or transfected HEK cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: Caspr2 autoantibodies inhibit the interaction of Caspr2 with contactin-2 but do not cause internalization of Caspr2. Functional blocking of cell adhesion molecule interactions represents a potential mechanism with therapeutic implications for IgG4 autoantibodies to cell adhesion molecules in neurological diseases.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Motor sequence awareness in impaired in dystonia despite normal performance</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25121</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25121</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;OBJECTIVE&lt;/b&gt;: Dystonia is a movement disorder that has been associated with impaired motor learning and sequence recognition. However, despite evidence that patients with dystonia have a reduced sense of agency, it is unclear whether dystonia is specifically associated with impaired recognition of a &lt;em&gt;movement&lt;/em&gt; sequence. We have shown previously that performance consistency in the temporal and kinematic domains predicts awareness of underlying motor patterns in a finger tapping task. Because movements in dystonia are characterized by high variability, we predicted that subjects with dystonia would have decreased motor sequence awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;METHODS: Subjects with dystonia (n= 20) and healthy control adults (n= 30) performed finger tapping sequences with a common motor pattern and changing stimulus-to-response mappings. Subjects were said to be “aware” of the motor pattern if they recognized their fingers moved in the same order during each stimulus-to-response remapping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;RESULTS&lt;/b&gt;: Subjects with dystonia had decreased motor pattern awareness, but those differences were not due to greater performance variability. Subjects with dystonia tapped sequences as series of discrete movements, rather than as a combined series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;INTERPRETATION: Dystonia is associated with impaired recognition of a repeating movement pattern. This difference may result from a strategy to separate sequential elements and attend to them individually. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Inadequate Brain Glycogen or Sleep Increases Spreading Depression Susceptibility</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25122</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25122</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Glycogen in astrocyte endfeet contributes to maintenance of low extracellular glutamate and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentrations around synapses. Sleep deprivation (SD), a common migraine trigger induces transcriptional changes in astrocytes reducing glycogen breakdown. We hypothesize that when glycogen utilization cannot match synaptic energy demand, extracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; can rise to levels that activate neuronal pannexin-1 channels and downstream inflammatory pathway, which might be one of the mechanisms initiating migraine headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We suppressed glycogen breakdown by inhibiting glycogen phosphorylation with 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-D-arabinitol (DAB) and by SD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: DAB caused neuronal pannexin-1 large-pore opening and activation of the downstream inflammatory pathway as shown by procaspase-1 cleavage and HMGB1 release from neurons. Six-hour SD induced pannexin-1 mRNA. DAB and SD also lowered the cortical spreading depression (CSD) induction threshold, which was reversed by glucose or lactate supplement, suggesting that glycogen-derived energy substrates are needed to prevent CSD generation. Supporting this, knocking-down neuronal lactate transporter, MCT2 with an anti-sense oligonucleotide or inhibiting glucose transport from vessels to astrocytes with intracerebroventricularly given phloretin reduced the CSD threshold. In vivo recordings with a K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-sensitive/selective fluoroprobe, APG-4 disclosed that DAB treatment or SD caused significant rise in extracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; during whisker-stimulation, illustrating the critical role of glycogen in extracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; clearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Synaptic metabolic stress caused by insufficient glycogen-derived energy substrate supply can activate neuronal pannexin-1 channels as well as lowering the CSD threshold. Therefore, conditions that limit energy supply to synapse (e.g. SD) may predispose to migraine attacks as suggested by genetic studies associating glucose or lactate transporter deficiency with migraine.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25111-sec-0101&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focal seizures are assumed to arise from a hypersynchronous activity affecting a circumscribed brain region. Using microelectrodes in seizure-generating deep mesial regions of 9 patients, we investigated the firing of hundreds of single neurons before, during, and after ictal electroencephalogram (EEG) discharges. Neuronal spiking activity at seizure initiation was highly heterogeneous and not hypersynchronous. Furthermore, groups of neurons showed significant changes in activity minutes before the seizure with no concomitant changes in the corresponding macroscopic EEG recordings. Altogether, our findings suggest that only limited subsets of neurons in epileptic depth regions initiate the seizure-onset and that ictogenic mechanisms operate in submillimeter-scale microdomains.

	<description>Persistent pain, which is poorly treated and estimated to afflict one third of the world’s population, is largely mediated by the sensitization of nociceptive neurons. This sensitization involves de novo gene expression to support biochemical and structural changes required to maintain amplified pain signaling that frequently persists even after injury to tissue resolves. While transcription-dependent changes in gene expression are important, recent work demonstrates that activity-dependent regulation of mRNA translation is key to controlling the cellular proteome and the development and maintenance of persistent pain.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: 17{beta}-Estradiol Acutely Potentiates Glutamatergic Synaptic Transmission in the Hippocampus through Distinct Mechanisms in Males and Females</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12314?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12314?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Estradiol (E2) acutely potentiates glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the hippocampus of both male and female rats. Here, we investigated whether E2-induced synaptic potentiation occurs via presynaptic and/or postsynaptic mechanisms and which estrogen receptors (ERs) mediate E2's effects in each sex. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings of mEPSCs in CA1 pyramidal neurons showed that E2 increases both mEPSC frequency and amplitude within minutes, but often in different cells. This indicated that both presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms are involved, but that they occur largely at different synapses. Two-photon (2p) glutamate uncaging at individual dendritic spines showed that E2 increases the amplitude of uncaging-evoked EPSCs (2pEPSCs) and calcium transients (2pCaTs) at a subset of spines on a dendrite, demonstrating synapse specificity of E2's postsynaptic effects. All of these results were essentially the same in males and females. However, additional experiments using ER-selective agonists indicated sex differences in the mechanisms underlying E2-induced potentiation. In males, an ERβ agonist mimicked the postsynaptic effects of E2 to increase mEPSC, 2pEPSC, and 2pCaT amplitude, whereas in females, these effects were mimicked by an agonist of G protein-coupled ER-1. The presynaptic effect of E2, increased mEPSC frequency, was mimicked by an ERα agonist in males, whereas in females, an ERβ agonist increased mEPSC frequency. Thus, E2 acutely potentiates glutamatergic synapses similarly in both sexes, but distinct ER subtypes mediate the presynaptic and postsynaptic aspects of potentiation in each sex. This indicates a latent sex difference in which different molecular mechanisms converge to the same functional endpoint in males versus females.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Some sex differences in the brain may be latent differences, in which the same functional endpoint is achieved through distinct underlying mechanisms in males versus females. Here we report a latent sex difference in molecular regulation of excitatory synapses in the hippocampus. The steroid 17β-estradiol is known to acutely potentiate glutamatergic synaptic transmission in both sexes. We find that this occurs through a combination of increased presynaptic glutamate release probability and increased postsynaptic sensitivity to glutamate in both sexes, but that distinct estrogen receptor subtypes underlie each aspect of potentiation in each sex. These results indicate that therapeutics targeting a specific estrogen receptor subtype or its downstream signaling would likely affect synaptic transmission differently in the hippocampus of each sex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Graded Elevation of c-Jun in Schwann Cells In Vivo: Gene Dosage Determines Effects on Development, Remyelination, Tumorigenesis, and Hypomyelination</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12297?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12297?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Schwann cell c-Jun is implicated in adaptive and maladaptive functions in peripheral nerves. In injured nerves, this transcription factor promotes the repair Schwann cell phenotype and regeneration and promotes Schwann-cell-mediated neurotrophic support in models of peripheral neuropathies. However, c-Jun is associated with tumor formation in some systems, potentially suppresses myelin genes, and has been implicated in demyelinating neuropathies. To clarify these issues and to determine how c-Jun levels determine its function, we have generated c-Jun OE/+ and c-Jun OE/OE mice with graded expression of c-Jun in Schwann cells and examined these lines during development, in adulthood, and after injury using RNA sequencing analysis, quantitative electron microscopic morphometry, Western blotting, and functional tests. Schwann cells are remarkably tolerant of elevated c-Jun because the nerves of c-Jun OE/+ mice, in which c-Jun is elevated ~6-fold, are normal with the exception of modestly reduced myelin thickness. The stronger elevation of c-Jun in c-Jun OE/OE mice is, however, sufficient to induce significant hypomyelination pathology, implicating c-Jun as a potential player in demyelinating neuropathies. The tumor suppressor P19&lt;sup&gt;ARF&lt;/sup&gt; is strongly activated in the nerves of these mice and, even in aged c-Jun OE/OE mice, there is no evidence of tumors. This is consistent with the fact that tumors do not form in injured nerves, although they contain proliferating Schwann cells with strikingly elevated c-Jun. Furthermore, in crushed nerves of c-Jun OE/+ mice, where c-Jun levels are overexpressed sufficiently to accelerate axonal regeneration, myelination and function are restored after injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In injured and diseased nerves, the transcription factor c-Jun in Schwann cells is elevated and variously implicated in controlling beneficial or adverse functions, including trophic Schwann cell support for neurons, promotion of regeneration, tumorigenesis, and suppression of myelination. To analyze the functions of c-Jun, we have used transgenic mice with graded elevation of Schwann cell c-Jun. We show that high c-Jun elevation is a potential pathogenic mechanism because it inhibits myelination. Conversely, we did not find a link between c-Jun elevation and tumorigenesis. Modest c-Jun elevation, which is beneficial for regeneration, is well tolerated during Schwann cell development and in the adult and is compatible with restoration of myelination and nerve function after injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neural Representations of Hierarchical Rule Sets: The Human Control System Represents Rules Irrespective of the Hierarchical Level to Which They Belong</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12281?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12281?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Humans use rules to organize their actions to achieve specific goals. Although simple rules that link a sensory stimulus to one response may suffice in some situations, often, the application of multiple, hierarchically organized rules is required. Recent theories suggest that progressively higher level rules are encoded along an anterior-to-posterior gradient within PFC. Although some evidence supports the existence of such a functional gradient, other studies argue for a lesser degree of specialization within PFC. We used fMRI to investigate whether rules at different hierarchical levels are represented at distinct locations in the brain or encoded by a single system. Thirty-seven male and female participants represented and applied hierarchical rule sets containing one lower-level stimulus–response rule and one higher-level selection rule. We used multivariate pattern analysis to investigate directly the representation of rules at each hierarchical level in absence of information about rules from other levels or other task-related information, thus providing a clear identification of low- and high-level rule representations. We could decode low- and high-level rules from local patterns of brain activity within a wide frontoparietal network. However, no significant difference existed between regions encoding representations of rules from both levels except for precentral gyrus, which represented only low-level rule information. Our findings show that the brain represents conditional rules regardless of their level in the explored hierarchy, so the human control system did not organize task representation according to this dimension. Our paradigm represents a promising approach to identifying critical principles that shape this control system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Several recent studies investigating the organization of the human control system propose that rules at different control levels are organized along an anterior-to-posterior gradient within PFC. In this study, we used multivariate pattern analysis to explore independently the representation of formally identical conditional rules belonging to different levels of a cognitive hierarchy and provide for the first time a clear identification of low- and high-level rule representations. We found no major spatial differences between regions encoding rules from different hierarchical levels. This suggests that the human brain does not use levels in the investigated hierarchy as a topographical organization principle to represent rules controlling our behavior. Our paradigm represents a promising approach to identifying which principles are critical.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Activation of {gamma}-Secretase Trimming Activity by Topological Changes of Transmembrane Domain 1 of Presenilin 1</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;-Secretase is an intramembrane cleaving protease that is responsible for the generation of amyloid-β peptides, which are linked to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. Recently, -secretase modulators (GSMs) have been shown to specifically decrease production of the aggregation-prone and toxic longer Aβ species, and concomitantly increase the levels of shorter Aβ. We previously found that phenylimidazole-type GSMs bind to presenilin 1 (PS1), the catalytic subunit of the -secretase, and allosterically modulate -secretase activity. However, the precise conformational alterations in PS1 remained unclear. Here we mapped the amino acid residues in PS1 that is crucial for the binding and pharmacological actions of E2012, a phenylimidazole-type GSM, using photoaffinity labeling and the substituted cysteine accessibility method. We also demonstrated that a piston-like vertical motion of transmembrane domain (TMD) 1 occurs during modulation of Aβ production. Taking these results together, we propose a model for the molecular mechanism of phenylimidazole-type GSMs, in which the trimming activity of -secretase is modulated by the position of the TMD1 of PS1 in the lipid bilayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Reduction of the toxic longer amyloid-β peptide is one of the therapeutic approaches for Alzheimer disease. A subset of small compounds called -secretase modulators specifically decreases the longer amyloid-β production, although its mechanistic action remains unclear. Here we found that the modulator compound E2012 targets to the hydrophilic loop 1 of presenilin 1, which is a catalytic subunit of the -secretase. Moreover, E2012 triggers the piston movement of the transmembrane domain 1 of presenilin 1, which impacts on the -secretase activity. These results illuminate how -secretase modulators allosterically affect the proteolytic activity, and highlight the importance of the structural dynamics of presenilin 1 in the complexed process of the intramembrane cleavage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Multimodal Imaging in Rat Model Recapitulates Alzheimer's Disease Biomarkers Abnormalities</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Imaging biomarkers are frequently proposed as endpoints for clinical trials targeting brain amyloidosis in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the specific impact of amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation on biomarker abnormalities remains elusive in AD. Using the McGill-R-Thy1-APP transgenic rat as a model of selective Aβ pathology, we characterized the longitudinal progression of abnormalities in biomarkers commonly used in AD research. Middle-aged (9–11 months) transgenic animals (both male and female) displayed mild spatial memory impairments and disrupted cingulate network connectivity measured by resting-state fMRI, even in the absence of hypometabolism (measured with PET [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG) or detectable fibrillary amyloidosis (measured with PET [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]NAV4694). At more advanced ages (16–19 months), cognitive deficits progressed in conjunction with resting connectivity abnormalities; furthermore, hypometabolism, Aβ plaque accumulation, reduction of CSF Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1-42&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations, and hippocampal atrophy (structural MRI) were detectable at this stage. The present results emphasize the early impact of Aβ on brain connectivity and support a framework in which persistent Aβ aggregation itself is sufficient to impose memory circuits dysfunction, which propagates to adjacent brain networks at later stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The present study proposes a &quot;back translation&quot; of the Alzheimer pathological cascade concept from human to animals. We used the same set of Alzheimer imaging biomarkers typically used in large human cohorts and assessed their progression over time in a transgenic rat model, which allows for a finer spatial resolution not attainable with mice. Using this translational platform, we demonstrated that amyloid-β pathology recapitulates an Alzheimer-like profile of biomarker abnormalities even in the absence of other hallmarks of the disease such as neurofibrillary tangles and widespread neuronal losses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cellular and Molecular Analysis of Dendritic Morphogenesis in a Retinal Cell Type That Senses Color Contrast and Ventral Motion</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;As neuronal dendrites develop, they acquire cell-type-specific features including characteristic size, shape, arborization, location and synaptic patterns. These features, in turn, are major determinants of type-specific neuronal function. Because neuronal diversity complicates the task of relating developmental programs to adult structure and function, we analyzed dendritic morphogenesis in a single retinal ganglion cell (RGC) type in mouse called J-RGC. We documented the emergence of five dendritic features that underlie J-RGC physiology: (1) dendritic field size, which approximate receptive field size; (2) dendritic complexity, which affects how J-RGCs sample space; (3) asymmetry, which contributes to direction-selectivity; (4) restricted lamination within the inner plexiform layer (IPL), which renders J-RGCs responsive to light decrements; and (5) distribution of synaptic inputs, which generate a color-opponent receptive field. We found dendritic growth in J-RGCs is accompanied by a refinement in dendritic self-crossing. Asymmetry arises by a combination of selective pruning and elaboration, whereas laminar restriction results from biased outgrowth toward the outermost IPL. Interestingly, asymmetry develops in a protracted dorsoventral wave, whereas lamination does so in a rapid centrifugal wave. As arbors mature, they acquire excitatory and inhibitory synapses, with the latter forming first and being concentrated in proximal dendrites. Thus, distinct mechanisms operate in different spatiotemporal dimensions of J-RGC dendritic patterning to generate the substrate for specific patterns of synaptogenesis. Finally, we asked whether the defining molecular signature of J-RGCs, the adhesion molecule JAM-B, regulates morphogenesis, and showed that it promotes dendro-dendritic interactions. Our results reveal multiple mechanisms that shape a dendritic arbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Visual perception begins in the retina, where distinct types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are tuned to specific visual features such as direction of motion. The features to which each RGC type responds are determined largely by the number and type of synaptic inputs it receives, and these, in turn, are greatly influenced by the size, shape, arborization pattern, and location of its dendrites. We analyzed dendritic morphogenesis in a functionally characterized RGC type, the J-RGC, demonstrating distinct mechanisms that operate in different dimensions to generate the dendritic scaffold and synaptic patterns for feature detection. Our work elucidates cellular and molecular mechanisms that shape dendritic arbors and synaptic distribution, enabling J-RGC connectivity and thus, function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sleep in Humans Stabilizes Pattern Separation Performance</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Replay of hippocampal neural representations during sleep is thought to promote systems consolidation of declarative memory. How this reprocessing of memory during sleep affects the hippocampal representation itself, is unclear. Here we tested hippocampal stimulus processing (i.e., pattern separation) before and after periods of sleep and wakefulness in humans (female and male participants). Pattern separation deteriorated across the wake period but remained stable across sleep (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.013) with this sleep–wake difference being most pronounced for stimuli with low similarity to targets (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.006). Stimuli with the highest similarity showed a reversed pattern with reduced pattern separation performance after sleep (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.038). Pattern separation performance was positively correlated with sleep spindle density, slow oscillation density, and theta power phase-locked to slow oscillations. Sleep, presumably by neural memory replay, shapes hippocampal representations and enhances computations of pattern separation to subsequent presentation of similar stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The consolidation of hippocampus-dependent memories is causally related to reactivation during sleep of previously encoded representations. Here, we show that reactivation-based consolidation processes during sleep shape the hippocampal representation itself. We studied the effect of sleep and wakefulness on pattern separation (i.e., orthogonalization of similar representations) and completion performance (i.e., recall of a memory in light of noisy input) that are essential cognitive elements of encoding and retrieval of information by the hippocampus. Our results demonstrate that pattern separation was stabilized after sleep but diminished after wakefulness. We further showed that pattern separation was related to EEG oscillatory parameters of non-REM sleep serving as markers of sleep-dependent memory consolidation and hippocampal reactivation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Network Configurations in the Human Brain Reflect Choice Bias during Rapid Face Processing</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12226?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Network interactions are likely to be instrumental in processes underlying rapid perception and cognition. Specifically, high-level and perceptual regions must interact to balance pre-existing models of the environment with new incoming stimuli. Simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and fMRI (EEG/fMRI) enables temporal characterization of brain–network interactions combined with improved anatomical localization of regional activity. In this paper, we use simultaneous EEG/fMRI and multivariate dynamical systems (MDS) analysis to characterize network relationships between constitute brain areas that reflect a subject's choice for a face versus nonface categorization task. Our simultaneous EEG and fMRI analysis on 21 human subjects (12 males, 9 females) identifies early perceptual and late frontal subsystems that are selective to the categorical choice of faces versus nonfaces. We analyze the interactions between these subsystems using an MDS in the space of the BOLD signal. Our main findings show that differences between face-choice and house-choice networks are seen in the network interactions between the early and late subsystems, and that the magnitude of the difference in network interaction positively correlates with the behavioral false-positive rate of face choices. We interpret this to reflect the role of saliency and expectations likely encoded in frontal &quot;late&quot; regions on perceptual processes occurring in &quot;early&quot; perceptual regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Our choices are affected by our biases. In visual perception and cognition such biases can be commonplace and quite curious—e.g., we see a human face when staring up at a cloud formation or down at a piece of toast at the breakfast table. Here we use multimodal neuroimaging and dynamical systems analysis to measure whole-brain spatiotemporal dynamics while subjects make decisions regarding the type of object they see in rapidly flashed images. We find that the degree of interaction in these networks accounts for a substantial fraction of our bias to see faces. In general, our findings illustrate how the properties of spatiotemporal networks yield insight into the mechanisms of how we form decisions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuropeptides, such as neuropeptide S (NPS) and oxytocin (OXT), represent potential options for the treatment of anxiety disorders due to their potent anxiolytic profile. In this study, we aimed to reveal the mechanisms underlying the behavioral action of NPS, and present a chain of evidence that the effects of NPS within the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) are mediated via actions on local OXT neurons in male Wistar rats. First, retrograde studies identified NPS fibers originating in the brainstem locus coeruleus, and projecting to the PVN. FACS identified prominent NPS receptor expression in PVN-OXT neurons. Using genetically encoded calcium indicators, we further demonstrated that NPS reliably induces a transient increase in intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration in a subpopulation of OXT neurons, an effect mediated by NPS receptor. In addition, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) NPS evoked a significant somatodendritic release of OXT within the PVN as assessed by microdialysis in combination with a highly sensitive radioimmunoassay. Finally, we could show that the anxiolytic effect of NPS seen after i.c.v. or intra-PVN infusion requires responsive OXT neurons of the PVN and locally released OXT. Thus, pharmacological blockade of OXT receptors as well as chemogenetic silencing of OXT neurons within the PVN prevented the effect of synthetic NPS. In conclusion, our results indicate a significant role of the OXT system in mediating the effects of NPS on anxiety, and fill an important gap in our understanding of brain neuropeptide interactions in the context of regulation of emotional behavior within the hypothalamus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Given the rising scientific interest in neuropeptide research in the context of emotional and stress-related behaviors, our findings demonstrate a novel intrahypothalamic mechanism involving paraventricular oxytocin neurons that express the neuropeptide S receptor. These neurons respond with transient Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; increase and somatodendritic oxytocin release following neuropeptide S stimulation. Thereby, oxytocin neurons seem essential for neuropeptide S-induced anxiolysis, as this effect was blocked by pharmacological and chemogenetic inhibition of the oxytocin system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Conditional Deletion of Ric-8b in Olfactory Sensory Neurons Leads to Olfactory Impairment</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The olfactory system can discriminate a vast number of odorants. This ability derives from the existence of a large family of odorant receptors expressed in the cilia of the olfactory sensory neurons. Odorant receptors signal through the olfactory-specific G-protein subunit, Gαolf. Ric-8b, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, interacts with Gαolf and can amplify odorant receptor signal transduction &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. To explore the function of Ric-8b &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, we generated a tissue specific knock-out mouse by crossing OMP-Cre transgenic mice to Ric-8b floxed mice. We found that olfactory-specific Ric-8b knock-out mice of mixed sex do not express the Gαolf protein in the olfactory epithelium. We also found that in these mice, the mature olfactory sensory neuron layer is reduced, and that olfactory sensory neurons show increased rate of cell death compared with wild-type mice. Finally, behavioral tests showed that the olfactory-specific Ric-8b knock-out mice show an impaired sense of smell, even though their motivation and mobility behaviors remain normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Ric-8b is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) expressed in the olfactory epithelium and in the striatum. Ric-8b interacts with the olfactory Gαolf subunit, and can amplify odorant signaling through odorant receptors &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. However, the functional significance of this GEF in the olfactory neurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; remains unknown. We report that deletion of Ric-8b in olfactory sensory neurons prevents stable expression of Gαolf. In addition, we demonstrate that olfactory neurons lacking Ric-8b (and consequently Gαolf) are more susceptible to cell death. Ric-8b conditional knock-out mice display impaired olfactory guided behavior. Our results reveal that Ric-8b is essential for olfactory function, and suggest that it may also be essential for Gαolf-dependent functions in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Extensive Tonotopic Mapping across Auditory Cortex Is Recapitulated by Spectrally Directed Attention and Systematically Related to Cortical Myeloarchitecture</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Auditory selective attention is vital in natural soundscapes. But it is unclear how attentional focus on the primary dimension of auditory representation—acoustic frequency—might modulate basic auditory functional topography during active listening. In contrast to visual selective attention, which is supported by motor-mediated optimization of input across saccades and pupil dilation, the primate auditory system has fewer means of differentially sampling the world. This makes spectrally-directed endogenous attention a particularly crucial aspect of auditory attention. Using a novel functional paradigm combined with quantitative MRI, we establish in male and female listeners that human frequency-band-selective attention drives activation in both myeloarchitectonically estimated auditory core, and across the majority of tonotopically mapped nonprimary auditory cortex. The attentionally driven best-frequency maps show strong concordance with sensory-driven maps in the same subjects across much of the temporal plane, with poor concordance in areas outside traditional auditory cortex. There is significantly greater activation across most of auditory cortex when best frequency is attended, versus ignored; the same regions do not show this enhancement when attending to the least-preferred frequency band. Finally, the results demonstrate that there is spatial correspondence between the degree of myelination and the strength of the tonotopic signal across a number of regions in auditory cortex. Strong frequency preferences across tonotopically mapped auditory cortex spatially correlate with R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-estimated myeloarchitecture, indicating shared functional and anatomical organization that may underlie intrinsic auditory regionalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Perception is an active process, especially sensitive to attentional state. Listeners direct auditory attention to track a violin's melody within an ensemble performance, or to follow a voice in a crowded cafe. Although diverse pathologies reduce quality of life by impacting such spectrally directed auditory attention, its neurobiological bases are unclear. We demonstrate that human primary and nonprimary auditory cortical activation is modulated by spectrally directed attention in a manner that recapitulates its tonotopic sensory organization. Further, the graded activation profiles evoked by single-frequency bands are correlated with attentionally driven activation when these bands are presented in complex soundscapes. Finally, we observe a strong concordance in the degree of cortical myelination and the strength of tonotopic activation across several auditory cortical regions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Working Memory and Decision-Making in a Frontoparietal Circuit Model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12167?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Working memory (WM) and decision-making (DM) are fundamental cognitive functions involving a distributed interacting network of brain areas, with the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) at the core. However, the shared and distinct roles of these areas and the nature of their coordination in cognitive function remain poorly understood. Biophysically based computational models of cortical circuits have provided insights into the mechanisms supporting these functions, yet they have primarily focused on the local microcircuit level, raising questions about the principles for distributed cognitive computation in multiregional networks. To examine these issues, we developed a distributed circuit model of two reciprocally interacting modules representing PPC and PFC circuits. The circuit architecture includes hierarchical differences in local recurrent structure and implements reciprocal long-range projections. This parsimonious model captures a range of behavioral and neuronal features of frontoparietal circuits across multiple WM and DM paradigms. In the context of WM, both areas exhibit persistent activity, but, in response to intervening distractors, PPC transiently encodes distractors while PFC filters distractors and supports WM robustness. With regard to DM, the PPC module generates graded representations of accumulated evidence supporting target selection, while the PFC module generates more categorical responses related to action or choice. These findings suggest computational principles for distributed, hierarchical processing in cortex during cognitive function and provide a framework for extension to multiregional models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Working memory and decision-making are fundamental &quot;building blocks&quot; of cognition, and deficits in these functions are associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. These cognitive functions engage distributed networks with prefrontal cortex (PFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) at the core. It is not clear, however, what the contributions of PPC and PFC are in light of the computations that subserve working memory and decision-making. We constructed a biophysical model of a reciprocally connected frontoparietal circuit that revealed shared and distinct functions for the PFC and PPC across working memory and decision-making tasks. Our parsimonious model connects circuit-level properties to cognitive functions and suggests novel design principles beyond those of local circuits for cognitive processing in multiregional brain networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Morphological Constraints on Cerebellar Granule Cell Combinatorial Diversity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12153?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Combinatorial expansion by the cerebellar granule cell layer (GCL) is fundamental to theories of cerebellar contributions to motor control and learning. Granule cells (GrCs) sample approximately four mossy fiber inputs and are thought to form a combinatorial code useful for pattern separation and learning. We constructed a spatially realistic model of the cerebellar GCL and examined how GCL architecture contributes to GrC combinatorial diversity. We found that GrC combinatorial diversity saturates quickly as mossy fiber input diversity increases, and that this saturation is in part a consequence of short dendrites, which limit access to diverse inputs and favor dense sampling of local inputs. This local sampling also produced GrCs that were combinatorially redundant, even when input diversity was extremely high. In addition, we found that mossy fiber clustering, which is a common anatomical pattern, also led to increased redundancy of GrC input combinations. We related this redundancy to hypothesized roles of temporal expansion of GrC information encoding in service of learned timing, and we show that GCL architecture produces GrC populations that support both temporal and combinatorial expansion. Finally, we used novel anatomical measurements from mice of either sex to inform modeling of sparse and filopodia-bearing mossy fibers, finding that these circuit features uniquely contribute to enhancing GrC diversification and redundancy. Our results complement information theoretic studies of granule layer structure and provide insight into the contributions of granule layer anatomical features to afferent mixing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cerebellar granule cells are among the simplest neurons, with tiny somata and, on average, just four dendrites. These characteristics, along with their dense organization, inspired influential theoretical work on the granule cell layer as a combinatorial expander, where each granule cell represents a unique combination of inputs. Despite the centrality of these theories to cerebellar physiology, the degree of expansion supported by anatomically realistic patterns of inputs is unknown. Using modeling and anatomy, we show that realistic input patterns constrain combinatorial diversity by producing redundant combinations, which nevertheless could support temporal diversification of like combinations, suitable for learned timing. Our study suggests a neural substrate for producing high levels of both combinatorial and temporal diversity in the granule cell layer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Interlayer Repulsion of Retinal Ganglion Cell Mosaics Regulates Spatial Organization of Functional Maps in the Visual Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12141?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In higher mammals, orientation tuning of neurons is organized into a quasi-periodic pattern in the primary visual cortex. Our previous model studies suggested that the topography of cortical orientation maps may originate from moiré interference of ON and OFF retinal ganglion cell (RGC) mosaics, but did not account for how the consistent spatial period of maps could be achieved. Here we address this issue with two crucial findings on the development of RGC mosaics: first, homotypic local repulsion between RGCs can develop a long-range hexagonal periodicity. Second, heterotypic interaction restrains the alignment of ON and OFF mosaics, and generates a periodic interference pattern map with consistent spatial frequency. To validate our model, we quantitatively analyzed the RGC mosaics in cat data, and confirmed that the observed retinal mosaics showed evidence of heterotypic interactions, contrary to the previous view that ON and OFF mosaics are developed independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Orientation map is one of the most studied functional maps in the brain, but it has remained unanswered how the consistent spatial periodicity of maps could be developed. In the current study, we address this issue with our developmental model for the retinal origin of orientation map. We showed that local repulsive interactions between retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) can develop a hexagonal periodicity in the RGC mosaics and restrict the alignment between ON and OFF mosaics, so that they generate a periodic pattern with consistent spatial frequency for both the RGC mosaics and the cortical orientation maps. Our results demonstrate that the organization of functional maps in visual cortex, including its structural consistency, may be constrained by a retinal blueprint.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Ubiquitin E3 Ligase TRAF6 Exacerbates Ischemic Stroke by Ubiquitinating and Activating Rac1</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12123?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stroke is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and excitotoxicity contribute to neuronal death during ischemic stroke; however, the mechanisms underlying these complicated pathophysiological processes remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we found that the expression of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) was markedly increased after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in mice. TRAF6 ablation in male mice decreased the infarct volume and neurological deficit scores and decreased proinflammatory signaling, oxidative stress, and neuronal death after cerebral I/R, whereas transgenic overexpression of TRAF6 in male mice exhibited the opposite effects. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that TRAF6 induced Rac1 activation and consequently promoted I/R injury by directly binding and ubiquitinating Rac1. Either functionally mutating the TRAF6 ubiquitination site on Rac1 or inactivating Rac1 with a specific inhibitor reversed the deleterious effects of TRAF6 overexpression during I/R injury. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that TRAF6 is a key promoter of ischemic signaling cascades and neuronal death after cerebral I/R injury. Therefore, the TRAF6/Rac1 pathway might be a promising target to attenuate cerebral I/R injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Stroke is one of the most severe and devastating neurological diseases globally. The complicated pathophysiological processes restrict the translation of potential therapeutic targets into medicine. Further elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury may open a new window for pharmacological interventions to promote recovery from stroke. Our study revealed that ischemia-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) upregulation binds and ubiquitinates Rac1 directly, which promotes neuron death through neuroinflammation and neuro-oxidative signals. Therefore, precisely targeting the TRAF6-Rac1 axis may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for stroke recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Detailed Dendritic Excitatory/Inhibitory Balance through Heterosynaptic Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs is a key feature of cortical dynamics. Such a balance is arguably preserved in dendritic branches, yet its underlying mechanism and functional roles remain unknown. In this study, we developed computational models of heterosynaptic spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) to show that the excitatory/inhibitory balance in dendritic branches is robustly achieved through heterosynaptic interactions between excitatory and inhibitory synapses. The model reproduces key features of experimental heterosynaptic STDP well, and provides analytical insights. Furthermore, heterosynaptic STDP explains how the maturation of inhibitory neurons modulates the selectivity of excitatory neurons for binocular matching in the critical period plasticity. The model also provides an alternative explanation for the potential mechanism underlying the somatic detailed balance that is commonly associated with inhibitory STDP. Our results propose heterosynaptic STDP as a critical factor in synaptic organization and the resultant dendritic computation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Recent experimental studies reveal that relative differences in spike timings experienced among neighboring glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses on a dendritic branch significantly influences changes in the efficiency of these synapses. This heterosynaptic form of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is potentially important for shaping the synaptic organization and computation of neurons, but its functional role remains elusive. Through computational modeling at the parameter regime where previous experimental results are well reproduced, we show that heterosynaptic plasticity serves to finely balance excitatory and inhibitory inputs on the dendrite. Our results suggest a principle of GABA-driven neural circuit formation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: FGF-FGFR Mediates the Activity-Dependent Dendritogenesis of Layer IV Neurons during Barrel Formation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and FGF receptors (FGFRs) are known for their potent effects on cell proliferation/differentiation and cortical patterning in the developing brain. However, little is known regarding the roles of FGFs/FGFRs in cortical circuit formation. Here we show that &lt;i&gt;Fgfr1&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;/3 and &lt;i&gt;Fgf7&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;9&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;10&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;22&lt;/i&gt; mRNAs are expressed in the developing primary somatosensory (S1) barrel cortex. Barrel cortex layer IV spiny stellate cells (bSCs) are the primary recipients of ascending sensory information via thalamocortical axons (TCAs). Detail quantification revealed distinctive phases for bSC dendritogenesis: orienting dendrites toward TCAs, adding &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; dendritic segments, and elongating dendritic length, while maintaining dendritic patterns. Deleting &lt;i&gt;Fgfr1&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt; in bSCs had minimal impact on dendritic polarity but transiently increased the number of dendritic segments. However, 6 d later, FGFR1/2/3 loss of function reduced dendritic branch numbers. These data suggest that FGFs/FGFRs have a role in stabilizing dendritic patterning. Depolarization of cultured mouse cortical neurons upregulated the levels of several &lt;i&gt;Fgf&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Fgfr&lt;/i&gt; mRNAs within 2 h. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt;, within 6 h of systemic kainic acid administration at postnatal day 6, mRNA levels of &lt;i&gt;Fgf9&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Fgf10&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Fgfr2c&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Fgfr3b&lt;/i&gt; in S1 cortices were enhanced, and this was accompanied by exuberant dendritogenesis of bSCs by 24 h. Deleting &lt;i&gt;Fgfr1&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt; abolished kainic acid-induced bSC dendritic overgrowth. Finally, FGF9/10 gain of function also resulted in extensive dendritogenesis. Together, our data suggest that FGFs/FGFRs can be regulated by glutamate transmission to modulate/stabilize bSC dendritic complexity. Both male and female mice were used for our study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Glutamatergic transmission plays critical roles in cortical circuit formation. Its dysregulation has been proposed as a core factor in the etiology of many neurological diseases. We found that excessive glutamate transmission upregulated mRNA expression of &lt;i&gt;Fgfrs&lt;/i&gt; and their ligands &lt;i&gt;Fgfs&lt;/i&gt;. Deleting &lt;i&gt;Fgfr1&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt; not only impaired bSC dendritogenesis but also abolished glutamate transmission-induced dendritic overgrowth. Overexpressing FGF9 or FGF10 in cortical glutamatergic neurons results in excessive dendritic outgrowth within 24 h, resembling the changes induced by excessive glutamate transmission. Our findings provide strong evidence for the physiological role of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and FGF receptors (FGFRs) in establishing and maintaining cortical circuits. Perturbing the expression levels of FGFs/FGFRs by excessive glutamatergic neurotransmission could lead to abnormal neuronal circuits, which may contribute to neurological and psychiatric disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Using induced human dopamine (DA) neurons, a study by Burbulla and colleagues demonstrated a toxic cascade of cellular dysfunctions which may underlie Parkinson’s disease (PD) progression. Their findings reveal what could be the causal relationship between multiple pathogenic pathways in human neurons obtained from idiopathic and familial cases, and suggest novel targets for therapeutic intervention.</description>

	<description>Early brain activity is crucial for neurogenesis and the development of brain networks. However, it has been challenging to localize regions in the developing human brain that contribute to spontaneous waves of neuronal activity. Recently, Arichi and colleagues reported that the temporal and heteromodal insular cortices have a central role in propagating these neural instructional signals.</description>

	<description>Bioprinting is a method by which a cell-encapsulating bioink is patterned to create complex tissue architectures. Given the potential impact of this technology on neural research, we review the current state-of-the-art approaches for bioprinting neural tissues. While 2D neural cultures are ubiquitous for studying neural cells, 3D cultures can more accurately replicate the microenvironment of neural tissues. By bioprinting neuronal constructs, one can precisely control the microenvironment by specifically formulating the bioink for neural tissues, and by spatially patterning cell types and scaffold properties in three dimensions.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flexible timing by temporal scaling of cortical responses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flexible timing by temporal scaling of cortical responses, Published online: 04 December 2017; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-017-0028-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-017-0028-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Humans can deliberately control the timing of their actions but the neural mechanisms underlying such control are largely unknown. In this article, Wang, Narain and their colleagues report that such flexibility emerges in rhesus monkeys from the ability of their brain to flexibly control the speed at which cortical responses unfold in time.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/ujYYLqvdfFU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>
