An ideal observer will give equivalent weight to sources of information that are equally reliable. However, when averaging visual information, human observers tend to downweight or discount features that are relatively outlying or deviant (‘robust averaging’). Why humans adopt an integration policy that discards important decision information remains unknown. Here, observers were asked to judge the average tilt in a circular array of high-contrast gratings, relative to an orientation boundary defined by a central reference grating. Observers showed robust averaging of orientation, but the extent to which they did so was a positive predictor of their overall performance. Using computational simulations, we show that although robust averaging is suboptimal for a perfect integrator, it paradoxically enhances performance in the presence of “late” noise, i.e. which corrupts decisions during integration. In other words, robust decision strategies increase the brain’s resilience to noise arising in neural computations during decision-making.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9-7Oog0_4kM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Towards a category theory approach to analogy: Analyzing re-representation and acquisition of numerical knowledge</title>

Category Theory, a branch of mathematics, has shown promise as a modeling framework for higher-level cognition. We introduce an algebraic model for &lt;i&gt;analogy&lt;/i&gt; that uses the language of category theory to explore analogy-related cognitive phenomena. To illustrate the potential of this approach, we use this model to explore three objects of study in cognitive literature. First, (a) we use &lt;i&gt;commutative diagrams&lt;/i&gt; to analyze an effect of playing particular educational board games on the learning of numbers. Second, (b) we employ a notion called &lt;i&gt;coequalizer&lt;/i&gt; as a formal model of re-representation that explains a property of computational models of analogy called “flexibility” whereby non-similar representational elements are considered matches and placed in structural correspondence. Finally, (c) we build a formal learning model which shows that re-representation, language processing and analogy making can explain the acquisition of knowledge of rational numbers. These objects of study provide a picture of acquisition of numerical knowledge that is compatible with empirical evidence and offers insights on possible connections between notions such as relational knowledge, analogy, learning, conceptual knowledge, re-representation and procedural knowledge. This suggests that the approach presented here facilitates mathematical modeling of cognition and provides novel ways to think about analogy-related cognitive phenomena.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sBo6FmxKjSc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Noise correlations in the human brain and their impact on pattern classification</title>

Multivariate decoding methods, such as multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA), are highly effective at extracting information from brain imaging data. Yet, the precise nature of the information that MVPA draws upon remains controversial. Most current theories emphasize the enhanced sensitivity imparted by aggregating across voxels that have mixed and weak selectivity. However, beyond the selectivity of individual voxels, neural variability is correlated across voxels, and such noise correlations may contribute importantly to accurate decoding. Indeed, a recent computational theory proposed that noise correlations enhance multivariate decoding from heterogeneous neural populations. Here we extend this theory from the scale of neurons to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and show that noise correlations between heterogeneous populations of voxels (i.e., voxels selective for different stimulus variables) contribute to the success of MVPA. Specifically, decoding performance is enhanced when voxels with high vs. low noise correlations (measured during rest or in the background of the task) are selected during classifier training. Conversely, voxels that are strongly selective for one class in a GLM or that receive high classification weights in MVPA tend to exhibit high noise correlations with voxels selective for the other class being discriminated against. Furthermore, we use simulations to show that this is a general property of fMRI data and that selectivity and noise correlations can have distinguishable influences on decoding. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that if there is signal in the data, the resulting above-chance classification accuracy is modulated by the magnitude of noise correlations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MRF7w8Pk05Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A Mixed Finite Element Method to Solve the EEG Forward Problem. (arXiv:1604.05764v2 [math.NA] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.05764</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.05764</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Finite element methods have been shown to achieve high accuracies in
numerically solving the EEG forward problem and they enable the realistic
modeling of complex geometries and important conductive features such as
anisotropic conductivities. To date, most of the presented approaches rely on
the same underlying formulation, the continuous Galerkin (CG)-FEM. In this
article, a novel approach to solve the EEG forward problem based on a mixed
finite element method (Mixed-FEM) is introduced. To obtain the Mixed-FEM
formulation, the electric current is introduced as an additional unknown
besides the electric potential. As a consequence of this derivation, the
Mixed-FEM is, by construction, current preserving, in contrast to the CG-FEM.
Consequently, a higher simulation accuracy can be achieved in certain
scenarios, e.g., when the diameter of thin insulating structures, such as the
skull, is in the range of the mesh resolution.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A theoretical derivation of the Mixed-FEM approach for EEG forward
simulations is presented, and the algorithms implemented for solving the
resulting equation systems are described. Subsequently, first evaluations in
both sphere and realistic head models are presented, and the results are
compared to previously introduced CG-FEM approaches. Additional visualizations
are shown to illustrate the current preserving property of the Mixed-FEM.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on these results, it is concluded that the newly presented Mixed-FEM
can at least complement and in some scenarios even outperform the established
CG-FEM approaches, which motivates a further evaluation of the Mixed-FEM for
applications in bioelectromagnetism.

	<description>When navigating the real-world, the spatiotemporal sequencing of events is intrinsically bound to one's physical trajectory; when recollecting the past or imagining the future, the temporal and spatial dimension of events can be independently manipulated. Yet, the rules enabling the flexible use of spatial and temporal cognitive maps likely differ in one major way as time is directional (oriented from past-to-future) whereas space is not. Using combined magneto- and electroencephalography, we sought to capture such differences by characterizing time-resolved brain activity while participants mentally ordered memories from different mental perspectives in time (past/future) or space (west/east). We report two major neural dissociations underlying the mental ordering of events in time and in space: first, brain responses evoked by the temporal order and the temporal distance of events-to-self dissociated at early and late latencies, respectively whereas spatial order and distance of events-to-self elicited late brain responses simultaneously. Second, brain responses distinguishing self-position in time and the temporal order of events involved sources in the hippocampal formation; spatial perspective, order and distance did not. These results suggest that the neural dynamics evoked by the temporal ordering of a series of events retrieved from long-term memory, i.e. the psychological time arrow, entails dedicated cognitive processes in the hippocampal formation that are fundamentally distinct from the mapping of spatial location.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Quasi-Periodic Patterns of Intrinsic Brain Activity in Individuals and their Relationship to Global Signal</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/180596v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/180596v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Quasiperiodic patterns (QPPs) as reported by Majeed et al., 2011 are prominent features of the brain intrinsic activity that involve important large-scale networks (default mode, DMN; task positive, TPN) and are likely to be major contributors to widely used measures of functional connectivity. We examined the variability of these patterns in 470 individuals from the Human Connectome Project resting state functional MRI dataset. The QPPs from individuals can be coarsely categorized into two types: one where strong anti-correlation between the DMN and TPN is present, and another without this anti-correlation. QPP type could be predicted by an individual global signal, with higher global signal corresponding to QPPs without anti-correlation. After global signal regression, all QPPs showed strong anti-correlation between DMN and TPN. QPP occurrence and type was similar between a subgroup of individuals with extremely low motion and the rest of the sample, which shows that motion is not a major contributor to the QPPs. QPP occurrence only weakly correlates with the estimate of slow respiratory-induced fMRI signal fluctuations, an indication that physiological noise is not the primary source of the QPP. QPPs were more similar for the same subjects scanned on different days than for different subjects. These results provide the first assessment of the variability in individual QPPs and their relationship to physiological parameters.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The influence of startReact on long-latency reflexive muscle activation during the transition from posture to movement</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/180554v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Many motor tasks involve transitions from posture to movement such as shifting from holding an object to setting it on a surface. Although many movements are voluntary processes, they are facilitated through motor pathways that span the continuum between reflexive and voluntary control. The mechanisms driving the long-latency stretch reflex (LLSR) have remained hotly contested. Recently, startReact has been shown to influence the fast muscular response to perturbations (Ravichandran et. al. 2013). The objective of this study was to evaluate how the LLSR and startReact impact the muscular response during the transition from posture to movement. We hypothesized that both the LLSR and startReact would be involved throughout the transition from posture to movement; however there would be a clear transition from LLSR dominance during posture to startReact dominance near/during movement. We tested this hypothesis using perturbations of elbow posture at various times before a fast ballistic extension movement. We found clear evidence that both the LLSR and startReact components were influenced changes in the late long-latency time window. The results provide insights on how the nervous system regulates involuntary responses to perturbations during the transition from maintenance of arm posture to movement.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Ventral hippocampal CA1 and CA3 differentially mediate learned approach-avoidance conflict processing</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/180513v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/180513v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The ventral hippocampus is thought to play a key role in the resolution of approach-avoidance conflict, a scenario that arises when stimuli with opposing valences are present simultaneously. Little is known, however, about the contributions of specific hippocampal sub-regions in this process, a critical issue given the functional and anatomical heterogeneity of this structure. Using a non-spatial cue-based paradigm in rats, we found that transient pharmacological inactivation of ventral CA1 produced an avoidance of a conflict cue imbued with both learned positive and negative outcomes, whereas inactivation of the ventral CA3 resulted in the opposite pattern of behavior, with significant preference for the conflict cue. In contrast, dorsal CA1- and CA3-inactivated rats showed no change in conflict behavior. Our findings provide important insight into the functions and circuitry of the ventral hippocampus by demonstrating that the ventral CA1 and CA3 subserve distinct and opposing roles in approach-avoidance conflict processing.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Stable representation of sounds in the posterior striatum during flexible auditory decisions</title>

	<description>The neuronal pathways that link sounds to rewarded actions remain elusive. It is unclear whether neurons in the posterior tail of the dorsal striatum (which receive direct input from the auditory system) mediate action selection, as other striatal circuits do. Here, we examined the role of posterior striatal neurons in auditory decisions in mice. We found that, in contrast to the anterior dorsal striatum, activation of the posterior striatum did not elicit systematic movement. However, activation of posterior striatal neurons during sound presentation in an auditory discrimination task biased the animals' choices, and transient inactivation of these neurons largely impaired sound discrimination. Moreover, the activity of these neurons reliably encoded stimulus features, but was only minimally influenced by the animals' choices. Our results suggest that posterior striatal neurons play an essential role in auditory decisions, yet these neurons provide sensory information downstream rather than motor commands during well-learned sound-driven tasks.</description>

	<description>Similarity search, such as identifying similar images in a database or similar documents on the Web, is a fundamental computing problem faced by many large-scale information retrieval systems. We discovered that the fly's olfactory circuit solves this problem using a novel variant of a traditional computer science algorithm (called locality-sensitive hashing). The fly's circuit assigns similar neural activity patterns to similar input stimuli (odors), so that behaviors learned from one odor can be applied when a similar odor is experienced. The fly's algorithm, however, uses three new computational ingredients that depart from traditional approaches. We show that these ingredients can be translated to improve the performance of similarity search compared to traditional algorithms when evaluated on several benchmark datasets. Overall, this perspective helps illuminate the logic supporting an important sensory function (olfaction), and it provides a conceptually new algorithm for solving a fundamental computational problem.</description>

	<description>Peripheral nerve damage initiates a complex series of cellular and structural processes that culminate in chronic neuropathic pain. Our study defines local angiotensin signaling via activation of the Angiotensin II (Ang II) type-2 receptor (AT2R) on macrophages as the critical trigger of neuropathic pain. An AT2R-selective antagonist attenuates neuropathic, but not inflammatory pain hypersensitivity in mice, and requires the cell damage-sensing ion channel transient receptor potential family-A member-1 (TRPA1). Mechanical and cold pain hypersensitivity that are characteristic of neuropathic conditions can be attenuated by chemogenetic depletion of peripheral macrophages and AT2R-null hematopoietic cell transplantation. Our findings show no AT2R expression in mouse or human sensory neurons, rather AT2R expression and activation in macrophages triggers production of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, which trans-activate TRPA1 on sensory neurons. Our study defines the precise neuro-immune crosstalk underlying nociceptor sensitization at the site of nerve injury. This form of cell-to-cell signaling represents a critical peripheral mechanism for chronic neuropathic pain, and therefore identifies multiple analgesic targets.</description>

Protein design remains an important problem in computational structural biology. Current computational protein design methods largely use physics-based methods, which make use of information from a single protein structure. This is despite the fact that multiple structures of many protein folds are now readily available in the PDB. While ensemble protein design methods can use multiple protein structures, they treat each structure independently. Here, we introduce a flexible backbone strategy, FlexiBaL-GP, which learns global protein backbone movements directly from multiple protein structures. FlexiBaL-GP uses the machine learning method of Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models to learn a lower dimensional representation of the protein coordinates that best represent backbone movements. These learned backbone movements are used to explore alternative protein backbones, while engineering a protein within a parallel tempered MCMC framework. Using the human ubiquitin–USP21 complex as a model we demonstrate that our design strategy outperforms current strategies for the interface design task of identifying tight binding ubiquitin variants for USP21.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/t6T6ch57tGE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

In recent years, there have been many computational simulations of spontaneous neural dynamics. Here, we describe a simple model of spontaneous neural dynamics that controls an agent moving in a simple virtual environment. These dynamics generate interesting brain-environment feedback interactions that rapidly destabilize neural and behavioral dynamics demonstrating the need for homeostatic mechanisms. We investigate roles for homeostatic plasticity both locally (local inhibition adjusting to balance excitatory input) as well as more globally (regional “task negative” activity that compensates for “task positive”, sensory input in another region) balancing neural activity and leading to more stable behavior (trajectories through the environment). Our results suggest complementary functional roles for both local and macroscale mechanisms in maintaining neural and behavioral dynamics and a novel functional role for macroscopic “task-negative” patterns of activity (e.g., the default mode network).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kCaFdi-3S6Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs), including emerging multi-drug resistant organisms, threaten healthcare systems worldwide. Efficient containment measures of HAIs must mobilize the entire healthcare network. Thus, to best understand how to reduce the potential scale of HAI epidemic spread, we explore patient transfer patterns in the French healthcare system. Using an exhaustive database of all hospital discharge summaries in France in 2014, we construct and analyze three patient networks based on the following: transfers of patients with HAI (HAI-specific network); patients with suspected HAI (suspected-HAI network); and all patients (general network). All three networks have heterogeneous patient flow and demonstrate small-world and scale-free characteristics. Patient populations that comprise these networks are also heterogeneous in their movement patterns. Ranking of hospitals by centrality measures and comparing community clustering using community detection algorithms shows that despite the differences in patient population, the HAI-specific and suspected-HAI networks rely on the same underlying structure as that of the general network. As a result, the general network may be more reliable in studying potential spread of HAIs. Finally, we identify transfer patterns at both the French regional and departmental (county) levels that are important in the identification of key hospital centers, patient flow trajectories, and regional clusters that may serve as a basis for novel wide-scale infection control strategies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Hha9dvbFa6M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Histologic and biochemical alterations predict pulmonary mechanical dysfunction in aging mice with chronic lung inflammation</title>

Both aging and chronic inflammation produce complex structural and biochemical alterations to the lung known to impact work of breathing. Mice deficient in surfactant protein D (Sftpd) develop progressive age-related lung pathology characterized by tissue destruction/remodeling, accumulation of foamy macrophages and alteration in surfactant composition. This study proposes to relate changes in tissue structure seen in normal aging and in chronic inflammation to altered lung mechanics using a computational model. Alterations in lung function in aging and Sftpd -/- mice have been inferred from fitting simple mechanical models to respiratory impedance data (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;rs&lt;/sub&gt;), however interpretation has been confounded by the simultaneous presence of multiple coexisting pathophysiologic processes. In contrast to the inverse modeling approach, this study uses simulation from experimental measurements to recapitulate how aging and inflammation alter &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;rs&lt;/sub&gt;. Histologic and mechanical measurements were made in C57BL6/J mice and congenic Sftpd-/- mice at 8, 27 and 80 weeks of age (n = 8/group). An anatomic computational model based on published airway morphometry was developed and &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;rs&lt;/sub&gt; was simulated between 0.5 and 20 Hz. End expiratory pressure dependent changes in airway caliber and recruitment were estimated from mechanical measurements. Tissue elements were simulated using the constant phase model of viscoelasticity. Baseline elastance distribution was estimated in 8-week-old wild type mice, and stochastically varied for each condition based on experimentally measured alteration in elastic fiber composition, alveolar geometry and surfactant composition. Weighing reduction in model error against increasing model complexity allowed for identification of essential features underlying mechanical pathology and their contribution to &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;rs&lt;/sub&gt;. Using a maximum likelihood approach, alteration in lung recruitment and diminished elastic fiber density were shown predictive of mechanical alteration at airway opening, to a greater extent than overt acinar wall destruction. Model-predicted deficits in PEEP-dependent lung recruitment correlate with altered lung lining fluid composition independent of age or genotype.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/W_PqHjUd6fU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the brain, systems are organized in a modular way, serving different
functionalities. We present a novel method, based on random matrix theory, for
the detection of functional modules in neural systems. Our method can
efficiently filter out both local unit-specific noise and global system- wide
dependencies that typically obfuscate the presence of sub-structures, thus
unveiling a hidden functional structure. Using correlation-based community
detection, the method yields an optimally contrasted mesoscopic functional
structure, i.e. groups of neurons (or small brain regions) that are positively
correlated internally, while at the same time negatively correlated with each
other. The method is purely data driven and does not use any presumptions or
network representation. In an experimental dataset containing time series of
neuronal gene expression, the method detects two hidden functional modules
which are recognized as existing anatomical regions, without any prior
anatomical knowledge(, showing the potential of the method to be used on brain
data).

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Fluctuations between high- and low-modularity topology in time-resolved functional connectivity. (arXiv:1511.06427v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06427</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06427</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Modularity is an important topological attribute for functional brain
networks. Recent studies have reported that modularity of functional networks
varies not only across individuals being related to demographics and cognitive
performance, but also within individuals co-occurring with fluctuations in
network properties of functional connectivity, estimated over short time
intervals. However, characteristics of these time-resolved functional networks
during periods of high and low modularity have remained largely unexplored. In
this study we investigate spatiotemporal properties of time-resolved networks
in the high and low modularity periods during rest, with a particular focus on
their spatial connectivity patterns, temporal homogeneity and test-retest
reliability. We show that spatial connectivity patterns of time-resolved
networks in the high and low modularity periods are represented by increased
and decreased dissociation of the default mode network module from
task-positive network modules, respectively. We also find that the instances of
time-resolved functional connectivity sampled from within the high (low)
modularity period are relatively homogeneous (heterogeneous) over time,
indicating that during the low modularity period the default mode network
interacts with other networks in a variable manner. We confirmed that the
occurrence of the high and low modularity periods varies across individuals
with moderate inter-session test-retest reliability and that it is correlated
with previously-reported individual differences in the modularity of functional
connectivity estimated over longer timescales. Our findings illustrate how
time-resolved functional networks are spatiotemporally organized during periods
of high and low modularity, allowing one to trace individual differences in
long-timescale modularity to the variable occurrence of network configurations
at shorter timescales.

	<description>The functional impairment of the motor system associated with Parkinson's Disease is thought to arise as a result of pathological synchronization of the networks formed by the basal ganglia and motor cortex. In this paper, we investigate changes to the directed connectivity in these networks following chronic dopamine depletion to evaluate the plausibility of a number of hypotheses proposed to explain the emergence of pathological oscillations. To do this, we used multisite recordings from anaesthetised rats that were injected with the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) to produce a lesion of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. We carried out a systematic analysis of the network using a novel non-parametric directionality analysis for estimation of directed neural interactions, as well as its conditioned variant which permits the analysis of the dependence of a connectivity upon a third reference signal. We find evidence of the dopamine dependency of both low beta (14-20 Hz) and high beta/low gamma (20-40 Hz) directed interactions within the BG and cortico-BG networks. Notably, 6-OHDA lesions were associated with enhancement of the cortical 'hyper-direct' connection to the STN and feedback from this structure to the cortex and striatum in the low beta frequency range. Furthermore, we find beta synchronization to be robust to conditioning using signal from any signal structure. Conversely, we find that high beta/gamma drive from the cortex to subcortical regions is significantly weakened by 6-OHDA lesions. We also provide evidence that gamma is routed from striatum in a pathway that is independent of STN. These results further inform our understanding of the substrates for, and impact of, pathological rhythms in salient brain networks in PD.</description>

	<description>Mutations causing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) strongly implicate regulators of RNA-processing that are ubiquitously expressed throughout development. To understand the molecular impact of ALS-causing mutations on early neuronal development and disease, we performed transcriptomic analysis of differentiated human control and VCP-mutant induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) during motor neurogenesis. We identify intron retention (IR) as the predominant splicing change affecting early stages of wild-type neural differentiation, targeting key genes involved in the splicing machinery. Importantly, IR occurs prematurely in VCP-mutant cultures compared with control counterparts; these events are also observed in independent RNAseq datasets from SOD1- and FUS-mutant motor neurons (MNs). Together with related effects on 3'UTR length variation, these findings implicate alternative RNA-processing in regulating distinct stages of lineage restriction from iPSCs to MNs, and reveal a temporal deregulation of such processing by ALS mutations. Thus, ALS-causing mutations perturb the same post-transcriptional mechanisms that underlie human motor neurogenesis.</description>

	<description>From what to wear to a friend's party, to whether to stay in academia or pursue a career in industry, nearly all of our decisions are accompanied by a degree of confidence that provides an assessment of the expected outcome. Although significant progress has been made in understanding the computations underlying confidence judgment, the preponderance of studies focuses on perceptual decisions, in which individuals sequentially sample noisy information and accumulate it as evidence until a threshold is exceeded. Once a decision is made, they initiate an action to implement the choice. However, we often have to make decisions during ongoing actions in dynamic environments where the value and the availability of the alternative options can change with time and previous actions. The current study aims to decipher the computations underlying confidence judgment in action decisions that are made in a dynamic environment. Using a reaching task in which movements are initiated to multiple potential targets, we show that action selection, reaction time and choice confidence all emerge from a common computation in which parallel prepared actions compete based on the overall desirability of targets and action plans.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Signal complexity of human intracranial EEG tracks successful associative memory formation across individuals</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/180240v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Memory performance is highly variable between individuals. Most studies examining human memory, however, have largely focused on the neural correlates of successful memory formation within individuals, rather than the differences between them. As such, what gives rise to this variability is poorly understood. Here, we examined intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings captured from 43 participants implanted with subdural electrodes for seizure monitoring as they performed a paired-associates verbal memory task. We identified three separate but related signatures of neural activity that tracked differences in successful memory formation across individuals. High performing individuals consistently exhibited less broadband power, flatter power spectral density (PSD) slopes, and greater complexity in their iEEG signals. Furthermore, within individuals across three separate time scales ranging from seconds to days, successful recall was positively associated with these same metrics. Our data therefore suggest that memory ability across individuals can be indexed by increased neural signal complexity.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Alpha activity in the ventral and dorsal visual stream controls information flow during working memory</title>

	<description>The electrophysiological mechanisms underlying working memory maintenance of information in the ventral and dorsal visual stream (VVS, DVS) remain elusive. Here we used electrocorticography recordings covering VVS, DVS and prefrontal cortex (PFC) in epilepsy patients while they were performing a delayed match-to-sample task. The experimental conditions (face identity, orientation) were designed to engage either the VVS or DVS. Alpha power was reduced in the VVS during maintenance of face identity and in the DVS during maintenance of spatial orientation of the very same stimuli. The phase of alpha oscillations modulated broadband high-frequency activity (BHA) in both regions. Interestingly, BHA occurred across broader alpha phase ranges when task-relevant information was maintained, putatively reflecting longer excitable &quot;duty cycles&quot;. Our findings support a model in which the VVS and DVS are recruited by the PFC via selective reduction of alpha power. As a result, excitable duty cycles in the relevant area are extended.</description>

	<description>In the visual system, the response to a stimulus in a neuron's receptive field can be modulated by stimulus context, and the strength of these contextual influences vary with stimulus intensity. Recent work has shown how a theoretical model, the stabilized supralinear network (SSN), can account for such modulatory influences, using a small set of computational mechanisms. While the predictions of the SSN have been confirmed in primary visual cortex (V1), its computational principles apply with equal validity to any cortical structure. We have therefore tested the generality of the SSN by examining modulatory influences in the middle temporal area (MT) of the primate visual cortex, using electrophysiological recordings and pharmacological manipulations. We developed a novel stimulus that can be adjusted parametrically to be larger or smaller in the space of all possible motion directions. We found, as predicted by the SSN, that MT neurons integrate across motion directions for low-contrast stimuli, but that they exhibit suppression by the same stimuli when they are high in contrast. These results are analogous to those found in visual cortex when stimulus size is varied in the space domain. We further tested the mechanisms of inhibition using pharmacologically manipulations of inhibitory efficacy. As predicted by the SSN, local manipulation of inhibitory strength altered firing rates, but did not change the strength of surround suppression. These results are consistent with the idea that the SSN can account for modulatory influences along different stimulus dimensions and in different cortical areas.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Computer Simulations Predict High Structural Heterogeneity of Functional State of NMDA Receptors</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/180091v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>It is unclear how the known atomic structures of neuronal NMDA receptors (NMDARs) relate to the functional states of NMDARs inferred from electrophysiological recordings. We address this problem by all-atom computer simulations, a method successfully applied in the past to much smaller biomolecules. Our simulations predict that four 'non-active' cryoEM structures of NMDARs rapidly interconvert on submicrosecond timescales, and therefore, correspond to the same functional state of the receptor.</description>

	<description>Increased place field size and signal autocorrelation along the dorsoventral hippocampal axis in rodents are considered a fundamental aspect of hippocampal organization, yet such evidence is lacking in humans. Using fMRI, we report corresponding evidence of increasing neural similarity from posterior to anterior hippocampus (dorsoventral homologues) in humans. These findings help account for observed shifting in representational granularity, from global context (anterior) to local details (posterior), along the hippocampal axis.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Deciphering HLA-I motifs across HLA peptidomes improves neo-antigen predictions and identifies allostery regulating HLA specificity</title>

The precise identification of Human Leukocyte Antigen class I (HLA-I) binding motifs plays a central role in our ability to understand and predict (neo-)antigen presentation in infectious diseases and cancer. Here, by exploiting co-occurrence of HLA-I alleles across ten newly generated as well as forty public HLA peptidomics datasets comprising more than 115,000 unique peptides, we show that we can rapidly and accurately identify many HLA-I binding motifs and map them to their corresponding alleles without any &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; knowledge of HLA-I binding specificity. Our approach recapitulates and refines known motifs for 43 of the most frequent alleles, uncovers new motifs for 9 alleles that up to now had less than five known ligands and provides a scalable framework to incorporate additional HLA peptidomics studies in the future. The refined motifs improve neo-antigen and cancer testis antigen predictions, indicating that unbiased HLA peptidomics data are ideal for &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; predictions of neo-antigens from tumor exome sequencing data. The new motifs further reveal distant modulation of the binding specificity at P2 for some HLA-I alleles by residues in the HLA-I binding site but outside of the B-pocket and we unravel the underlying mechanisms by protein structure analysis, mutagenesis and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; binding assays.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PyX3xsSmxSk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Ischemia/Reperfusion Induces Interferon-Stimulated Gene Expression in Microglia</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Innate immune signaling is important in the pathophysiology of ischemia/reperfusion (stroke)-induced injury and recovery. Several lines of evidence support a central role for microglia in these processes. Recent work has identified Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and type I interferon (IFN) signaling in both ischemia/reperfusion-induced brain injury and ischemic preconditioning-mediated neuroprotection. To determine the effects of &quot;ischemia/reperfusion-like&quot; conditions on microglia, we performed genomic analyses on wild-type (WT) and &lt;i&gt;TLR4&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; cultured microglia after sequential exposure to hypoxia/hypoglycemia and normoxia/normoglycemia (H/H–N/N). We observed increased expression of type 1 IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) as the predominant transcriptomal feature of H/H–N/N-exposed WT, but not &lt;i&gt;TLR4&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;, microglia. Microarray analysis on &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; sorted microglia from ipsilateral male mouse cortex after a transient &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; ischemic pulse also demonstrated robust expression of ISGs. Type 1 IFNs, including the IFN-αs and IFN-β, activate the interferon-α/β receptor (IFNAR) complex. We confirmed both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; H/H–N/N- and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; ischemia/reperfusion-induced microglial ISG responses by quantitative real-time PCR and demonstrated that both were dependent on IFNAR1. We characterized the effects of hypoxia/hypoglycemia on phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), release of type 1 IFNs, and surface expression of IFNAR1 in microglia. We demonstrated that IFN-β induces dose-dependent secretion of ISG chemokines in cultured microglia and robust ISG expression in microglia both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Finally, we demonstrated that the microglial ISG chemokine responses to TLR4 agonists were dependent on TLR4 and IFNAR1. Together, these data suggest novel ischemia/reperfusion-induced pathways for both TLR4-dependent and -independent, IFNAR1-dependent, type 1 IFN signaling in microglia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States and is a leading cause of serious long-term disability worldwide. Innate immune responses are critical in stroke pathophysiology, and microglia are key cellular effectors in the CNS response to ischemia/reperfusion. Using a transcriptional analysis approach, we identified a robust interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene response within microglia exposed to ischemia/reperfusion in both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; experimental paradigms. Using a number of complementary techniques, we have demonstrated that these responses are dependent on innate immune signaling components including Toll-like receptor-4 and type I IFNs. We have also elucidated several novel ischemia/reperfusion-induced microglial signaling mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Feeding Releases Endogenous Opioids in Humans</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8284?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8284?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The endogenous opioid system supports a multitude of functions related to appetitive behavior in humans and animals, and it has been proposed to govern hedonic aspects of feeding thus contributing to the development of obesity. Here we used positron emission tomography to investigate whether feeding results in hedonia-dependent endogenous opioid release in humans. Ten healthy males were recruited for the study. They were scanned with the μ-opioid-specific ligand [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]carfentanil three times, as follows: after a palatable meal, a nonpalatable meal, and after an overnight fast. Subjective mood, satiety, and circulating hormone levels were measured. Feeding induced significant endogenous opioid release throughout the brain. This response was more pronounced following a nonpalatable meal versus a palatable meal, and independent of the subjective hedonic responses to feeding. We conclude that feeding consistently triggers cerebral opioid release even in the absence of subjective pleasure associated with feeding, suggesting that metabolic and homeostatic rather than exclusively hedonic responses play a role in the feeding-triggered cerebral opioid release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The endogenous opioid system supports both hedonic and homeostatic functions. It has been proposed that overeating and concomitant opioid release could downregulate opioid receptors and promote the development of obesity. However, it remains unresolved whether feeding leads to endogenous opioid release in humans. We used &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; positron emission tomography to test whether feeding triggers cerebral opioid release and whether this response is associated with pleasurable sensations. We scanned volunteers using the μ-opioid receptor-specific radioligand [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]carfentanil three times, as follows: after an overnight fast, after consuming a palatable meal, and after consuming a nonpalatable meal. Feeding led to significant endogenous opioid release, and this occurred also in the absence of feeding-triggered hedonia. Feeding-triggered opioid release thus also reflects metabolic and homeostatic responses rather than hedonic responses exclusively.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Information-Theoretic Evidence for Predictive Coding in the Face-Processing System</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8273?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8273?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Predictive coding suggests that the brain infers the causes of its sensations by combining sensory evidence with internal predictions based on available prior knowledge. However, the neurophysiological correlates of (pre)activated prior knowledge serving these predictions are still unknown. Based on the idea that such preactivated prior knowledge must be maintained until needed, we measured the amount of maintained information in neural signals via the active information storage (AIS) measure. AIS was calculated on whole-brain beamformer-reconstructed source time courses from MEG recordings of 52 human subjects during the baseline of a Mooney face/house detection task. Preactivation of prior knowledge for faces showed as α-band-related and β-band-related AIS increases in content-specific areas; these AIS increases were behaviorally relevant in the brain's fusiform face area. Further, AIS allowed decoding of the cued category on a trial-by-trial basis. Our results support accounts indicating that activated prior knowledge and the corresponding predictions are signaled in low-frequency activity (&amp;lt;30 Hz).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Our perception is not only determined by the information our eyes/retina and other sensory organs receive from the outside world, but strongly depends also on information already present in our brains, such as prior knowledge about specific situations or objects. A currently popular theory in neuroscience, predictive coding theory, suggests that this prior knowledge is used by the brain to form internal predictions about upcoming sensory information. However, neurophysiological evidence for this hypothesis is rare, mostly because this kind of evidence requires strong a priori assumptions about the specific predictions the brain makes and the brain areas involved. Using a novel, assumption-free approach, we find that face-related prior knowledge and the derived predictions are represented in low-frequency brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Calcineurin Dysregulation Underlies Spinal Cord Injury-Induced K+ Channel Dysfunction in DRG Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8256?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8256?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dysfunction of the fast-inactivating Kv3.4 potassium current in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons contributes to the hyperexcitability associated with persistent pain induced by spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the underlying mechanism is not known. In light of our previous work demonstrating modulation of the Kv3.4 channel by phosphorylation, we investigated the role of the phosphatase calcineurin (CaN) using electrophysiological, molecular, and imaging approaches in adult female Sprague Dawley rats. Pharmacological inhibition of CaN in small-diameter DRG neurons slowed repolarization of the somatic action potential (AP) and attenuated the Kv3.4 current. Attenuated Kv3.4 currents also exhibited slowed inactivation. We observed similar effects on the recombinant Kv3.4 channel heterologously expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, supporting our findings in DRG neurons. Elucidating the molecular basis of these effects, mutation of four previously characterized serines within the Kv3.4 N-terminal inactivation domain eliminated the effects of CaN inhibition on the Kv3.4 current. SCI similarly induced concurrent Kv3.4 current attenuation and slowing of inactivation. Although there was little change in CaN expression and localization after injury, SCI induced upregulation of the native regulator of CaN 1 (RCAN1) in the DRG at the transcript and protein levels. Consistent with CaN inhibition resulting from RCAN1 upregulation, overexpression of RCAN1 in naive DRG neurons recapitulated the effects of pharmacological CaN inhibition on the Kv3.4 current and the AP. Overall, these results demonstrate a novel regulatory pathway that links CaN, RCAN1, and Kv3.4 in DRG neurons. Dysregulation of this pathway might underlie a peripheral mechanism of pain sensitization induced by SCI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Pain sensitization associated with spinal cord injury (SCI) involves poorly understood maladaptive modulation of neuronal excitability. Although central mechanisms have received significant attention, recent studies have identified peripheral nerve hyperexcitability as a driver of persistent pain signaling after SCI. However, the ion channels and signaling molecules responsible for this change in primary sensory neuron excitability are still not well defined. To address this problem, this study used complementary electrophysiological and molecular methods to determine how Kv3.4, a voltage-gated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel robustly expressed in dorsal root ganglion neurons, becomes dysfunctional upon calcineurin (CaN) inhibition. The results strongly suggest that CaN inhibition underlies SCI-induced dysfunction of Kv3.4 and the associated excitability changes through upregulation of the native regulator of CaN 1 (RCAN1).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sound-Evoked Activity Influences Myelination of Brainstem Axons in the Trapezoid Body</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8239?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8239?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Plasticity of myelination represents a mechanism to tune the flow of information by balancing functional requirements with metabolic and spatial constraints. The auditory system is heavily myelinated and operates at the upper limits of action potential generation frequency and speed observed in the mammalian CNS. This study aimed to characterize the development of myelin within the trapezoid body, a central auditory fiber tract, and determine the influence sensory experience has on this process in mice of both sexes. We find that &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; conduction speed doubles following hearing onset and the ability to support high-frequency firing increases concurrently. Also in this time, the diameter of trapezoid body axons and the thickness of myelin double, reaching mature-like thickness between 25 and 35 d of age. Earplugs were used to induce ~50 dB elevation in auditory thresholds. If introduced at hearing onset, trapezoid body fibers developed thinner axons and myelin than age-matched controls. If plugged during adulthood, the thickest trapezoid body fibers also showed a decrease in myelin. These data demonstrate the need for sensory activity in both development and maintenance of myelin and have important implications in the study of myelin plasticity and how this could relate to sensorineural hearing loss following peripheral impairment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The auditory system has many mechanisms to maximize the dynamic range of its afferent fibers, which operate at the physiological limit of action potential generation, precision, and speed. In this study we demonstrate for the first time that changes in peripheral activity modifies the thickness of myelin in sensory neurons, not only in development but also in mature animals. The current study suggests that changes in CNS myelination occur as a downstream mechanism following peripheral deficit. Given the required submillisecond temporal precision for binaural auditory processing, reduced myelination might augment sensorineural hearing impairment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Changes in White Matter Microstructure Impact Cognition by Disrupting the Ability of Neural Assemblies to Synchronize</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8227?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8227?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cognition is compromised by white matter (WM) injury but the neurophysiological alterations linking them remain unclear. We hypothesized that reduced neural synchronization caused by disruption of neural signal propagation is involved. To test this, we evaluated group differences in: diffusion tensor WM microstructure measures within the optic radiations, primary visual area (V1), and cuneus; neural phase synchrony to a visual attention cue during visual-motor task; and reaction time to a response cue during the same task between 26 pediatric patients (17/9: male/female) treated with cranial radiation treatment for a brain tumor (12.67 ± 2.76 years), and 26 healthy children (16/10: male/female; 12.01 ± 3.9 years). We corroborated our findings using a corticocortical computational model representing perturbed signal conduction from myelin. Patients show delayed reaction time, WM compromise, and reduced phase synchrony during visual attention compared with healthy children. Notably, using partial least-squares–path modeling we found that WM insult within the optic radiations, V1, and cuneus is a strong predictor of the slower reaction times via disruption of neural synchrony in visual cortex. Observed changes in synchronization were reproduced in a computational model of WM injury. These findings provide new evidence linking cognition with WM via the reliance of neural synchronization on propagation of neural signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; By comparing brain tumor patients to healthy children, we establish that changes in the microstructure of the optic radiations and neural synchrony during visual attention predict reaction time. Furthermore, by testing the directionality of these links through statistical modeling and verifying our findings with computational modeling, we infer a causal relationship, namely that changes in white matter microstructure impact cognition in part by disturbing the ability of neural assemblies to synchronize. Together, our human imaging data and computer simulations show a fundamental connection between WM microstructure and neural synchronization that is critical for cognitive processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Altered Balance of Receptive Field Excitation and Suppression in Visual Cortex of Amblyopic Macaque Monkeys</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In amblyopia, a visual disorder caused by abnormal visual experience during development, the amblyopic eye (AE) loses visual sensitivity whereas the fellow eye (FE) is largely unaffected. Binocular vision in amblyopes is often disrupted by interocular suppression. We used 96-electrode arrays to record neurons and neuronal groups in areas V1 and V2 of six female macaque monkeys (&lt;i&gt;Macaca nemestrina&lt;/i&gt;) made amblyopic by artificial strabismus or anisometropia in early life, as well as two visually normal female controls. To measure suppressive binocular interactions directly, we recorded neuronal responses to dichoptic stimulation. We stimulated both eyes simultaneously with large sinusoidal gratings, controlling their contrast independently with raised-cosine modulators of different orientations and spatial frequencies. We modeled each eye's receptive field at each cortical site using a difference of Gaussian envelopes and derived estimates of the strength of central excitation and surround suppression. We used these estimates to calculate ocular dominance separately for excitation and suppression. Excitatory drive from the FE dominated amblyopic visual cortex, especially in more severe amblyopes, but suppression from both the FE and AEs was prevalent in all animals. This imbalance created strong interocular suppression in deep amblyopes: increasing contrast in the AE decreased responses at binocular cortical sites. These response patterns reveal mechanisms that likely contribute to the interocular suppression that disrupts vision in amblyopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Amblyopia is a developmental visual disorder that alters both monocular vision and binocular interaction. Using microelectrode arrays, we examined binocular interaction in primary visual cortex and V2 of six amblyopic macaque monkeys (&lt;i&gt;Macaca nemestrina&lt;/i&gt;) and two visually normal controls. By stimulating the eyes dichoptically, we showed that, in amblyopic cortex, the binocular combination of signals is altered. The excitatory influence of the two eyes is imbalanced to a degree that can be predicted from the severity of amblyopia, whereas suppression from both eyes is prevalent in all animals. This altered balance of excitation and suppression reflects mechanisms that may contribute to the interocular perceptual suppression that disrupts vision in amblyopes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Acute Increases in Protein O-GlcNAcylation Dampen Epileptiform Activity in Hippocampus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8207?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8207?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;O-GlcNAcylation is a ubiquitous and dynamic post-translational modification involving the O-linkage of β-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylglucosamine to serine/threonine residues of membrane, cytosolic, and nuclear proteins. This modification is similar to phosphorylation and regarded as a key regulator of cell survival and homeostasis. Previous studies have shown that phosphorylation of serine residues on synaptic proteins is a major regulator of synaptic strength and long-term plasticity, suggesting that O-GlcNAcylation of synaptic proteins is likely as important as phosphorylation; however, few studies have investigated its role in synaptic efficacy. We recently demonstrated that acutely increasing O-GlcNAcylation induces a novel form of LTD at CA3-CA1 synapses, O-GlcNAc LTD. Here, using hippocampal slices from young adult male rats and mice, we report that epileptiform activity at CA3-CA1 synapses, generated by GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R inhibition, is significantly attenuated when protein O-GlcNAcylation is pharmacologically increased. This dampening effect is lost in slices from GluA2 KO mice, indicating a requirement of GluA2-containing AMPARs, similar to expression of O-GlcNAc LTD. Furthermore, we find that increasing O-GlcNAcylation decreases spontaneous CA3 pyramidal cell activity under basal and hyperexcitable conditions. This dampening effect was also observed on cortical hyperexcitability during &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; EEG recordings in awake mice where the effects of the proconvulsant pentylenetetrazole are attenuated by acutely increasing O-GlcNAcylation. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the post-translational modification, O-GlcNAcylation, is a novel mechanism by which neuronal and synaptic excitability can be regulated, and suggest the possibility that increasing O-GlcNAcylation could be a novel therapeutic target to treat seizure disorders and epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We recently reported that an acute pharmacological increase in protein O-GlcNAcylation induces a novel form of long-term synaptic depression at hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses (O-GlcNAc LTD). This synaptic dampening effect on glutamatergic networks suggests that increasing O-GlcNAcylation will depress pathological hyperexcitability. Using &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; models of epileptiform activity, we show that acutely increasing O-GlcNAc levels can significantly attenuate ongoing epileptiform activity and prophylactically dampen subsequent seizure activity. Together, our findings support the conclusion that protein O-GlcNAcylation is a regulator of neuronal excitability, and it represents a promising target for further research on seizure disorder therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Why New Spinal Cord Plasticity Does Not Disrupt Old Motor Behaviors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8198?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8198?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;When new motor learning changes the spinal cord, old behaviors are not impaired; their key features are preserved by additional compensatory plasticity. To explore the mechanisms responsible for this compensatory plasticity, we transected the spinal dorsal ascending tract before or after female rats acquired a new behavior—operantly conditioned increase or decrease in the right soleus H-reflex—and examined an old behavior—locomotion. Neither spinal dorsal ascending tract transection nor H-reflex conditioning alone impaired locomotion. Nevertheless, when spinal dorsal ascending tract transection and H-reflex conditioning were combined, the rats developed a limp and a tilted posture that correlated in direction and magnitude with the H-reflex change. When the right H-reflex was increased by conditioning, the right step lasted longer than the left and the right hip was higher than the left; when the right H-reflex was decreased by conditioning, the opposite occurred. These results indicate that ascending sensory input guides the compensatory plasticity that normally prevents the plasticity underlying H-reflex change from impairing locomotion. They support the concept of the state of the spinal cord as a negotiated equilibrium that reflects the concurrent influences of all the behaviors in an individual's repertoire; and they support the new therapeutic strategies this concept introduces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The spinal cord provides a reliable final common pathway for motor behaviors throughout life. Until recently, its reliability was explained by the assumption that it is hardwired; but it is now clear that the spinal cord changes continually as new behaviors are acquired. Nevertheless, old behaviors are preserved. This study shows that their preservation depends on sensory feedback from the spinal cord to the brain: if feedback is removed, the acquisition of a new behavior may disrupt an old behavior. In sum, when a new behavior changes the spinal cord, sensory feedback to the brain guides further change that preserves old behaviors. This finding contributes to a new understanding of spinal cord function and to development of new rehabilitation therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Gain Modulation as a Mechanism for Coding Depth from Motion Parallax in Macaque Area MT</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8180?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8180?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Observer translation produces differential image motion between objects that are located at different distances from the observer's point of fixation [motion parallax (MP)]. However, MP can be ambiguous with respect to depth sign (near vs far), and this ambiguity can be resolved by combining retinal image motion with signals regarding eye movement relative to the scene. We have previously demonstrated that both extra-retinal and visual signals related to smooth eye movements can modulate the responses of neurons in area MT of macaque monkeys, and that these modulations generate neural selectivity for depth sign. However, the neural mechanisms that govern this selectivity have remained unclear. In this study, we analyze responses of MT neurons as a function of both retinal velocity and direction of eye movement, and we show that smooth eye movements modulate MT responses in a systematic, temporally precise, and directionally specific manner to generate depth-sign selectivity. We demonstrate that depth-sign selectivity is primarily generated by multiplicative modulations of the response gain of MT neurons. Through simulations, we further demonstrate that depth can be estimated reasonably well by a linear decoding of a population of MT neurons with response gains that depend on eye velocity. Together, our findings provide the first mechanistic description of how visual cortical neurons signal depth from MP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Motion parallax is a monocular cue to depth that commonly arises during observer translation. To compute from motion parallax whether an object appears nearer or farther than the point of fixation requires combining retinal image motion with signals related to eye rotation, but the neurobiological mechanisms have remained unclear. This study provides the first mechanistic account of how this interaction takes place in the responses of cortical neurons. Specifically, we show that smooth eye movements modulate the gain of responses of neurons in area MT in a directionally specific manner to generate selectivity for depth sign from motion parallax. We also show, through simulations, that depth could be estimated from a population of such gain-modulated neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Selective Silencing of Hippocampal Parvalbumin Interneurons Induces Development of Recurrent Spontaneous Limbic Seizures in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8166?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8166?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most frequent form of focal epilepsies and is generally associated with malfunctioning of the hippocampal formation. Recently, a preferential loss of parvalbumin (PV) neurons has been observed in the subiculum of TLE patients and in animal models of TLE. To demonstrate a possible causative role of defunct PV neurons in the generation of TLE, we permanently inhibited GABA release selectively from PV neurons of the ventral subiculum by injecting a viral vector expressing tetanus toxin light chain in male mice. Subsequently, mice were subjected to telemetric EEG recording and video monitoring. Eighty-eight percent of the mice presented clusters of spike-wave discharges (C-SWDs; 40.0 ± 9.07/month), and 64% showed spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRSs; 5.3 ± 0.83/month). Mice injected with a control vector presented with neither C-SWDs nor SRSs. No neurodegeneration was observed due to vector injection or SRS. Interestingly, mice that presented with only C-SWDs but no SRSs, developed SRSs upon injection of a subconvulsive dose of pentylenetetrazole after 6 weeks. The initial frequency of SRSs declined by ~30% after 5 weeks. In contrast to permanent silencing of PV neurons, transient inhibition of GABA release from PV neurons through the designer receptor hM4Di selectively expressed in PV-containing neurons transiently reduced the seizure threshold of the mice but induced neither acute nor recurrent seizures. Our data demonstrate a critical role for perisomatic inhibition mediated by PV-containing interneurons, suggesting that their sustained silencing could be causally involved in the development of TLE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Development of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) generally takes years after an initial insult during which maladaptation of hippocampal circuitries takes place. In human TLE and in animal models of TLE, parvalbumin neurons are selectively lost in the subiculum, the major output area of the hippocampus. The present experiments demonstrate that specific and sustained inhibition of GABA release from parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (mostly basket cells) in sector CA1/subiculum is sufficient to induce hyperexcitability and spontaneous recurrent seizures in mice. As in patients with nonlesional TLE, these mice developed epilepsy without signs of neurodegeneration. The experiments highlight the importance of the potent inhibitory action mediated by parvalbumin cells in the hippocampus and identify a potential mechanism in the development of TLE.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Steady-State Free Ca2+ in Astrocytes Is Decreased by Experience and Impacts Arteriole Tone</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8150?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8150?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes can control basal synaptic strength and arteriole tone via their resting Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activity. However, whether resting astrocyte Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; can adjust to a new steady-state level, with an impact on surrounding brain cells, remains unknown. Using two-photon Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging in male rat acute brain slices of the somatosensory neocortex, we found that theta burst neural activity produced an unexpected long-lasting reduction in astrocyte free Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the soma and endfeet. The drop in intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; was attenuated by antagonists targeting multiple ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors, and intracellular cascades involved Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; stores and nitric oxide. The reduction in astrocyte endfoot Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; was coincident with an increase in arteriole tone, and both the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; drop and the tone change were prevented by an NMDA receptor antagonist. Astrocyte patch-clamp experiments verified that the glutamate receptors in question were located on astrocytes and that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; changes within astrocytes were responsible for the long-lasting change in arteriole diameter caused by theta burst neural activity. In astrocytes from animals that lived in an enriched environment, we measured a relatively lower resting Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; level that occluded any further drop in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in response to theta burst activity. These data suggest that electrically evoked patterns of neural activity or natural experience can adjust steady-state resting astrocyte Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and that the effect has an impact on basal arteriole diameter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The field of astrocyte-neuron and astrocyte-arteriole interactions is currently in a state of refinement. Experimental evidence &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; suggests that direct manipulation of astrocyte-free Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; regulates synaptic signaling and local blood flow control; however, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; experiments fail to link synaptically evoked astrocyte Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients and immediate changes to various astrocyte-mediated processes. To clarify this discrepancy, we examined a different aspect of astrocyte Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;: the resting, steady-state free Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; of astrocytes, its modulation, and its potential role in the tonic regulation of surrounding brain cells. We found that &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; neural activity induced a long-lasting reduction in resting free astrocyte Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and that this phenomenon changed arteriole tone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Role for the Left Angular Gyrus in Episodic Simulation and Memory</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8142?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8142?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies indicate that episodic simulation (i.e., imagining specific future experiences) and episodic memory (i.e., remembering specific past experiences) are associated with enhanced activity in a common set of neural regions referred to as the core network. This network comprises the hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex, and left angular gyrus, among other regions. Because fMRI data are correlational, it is unknown whether activity increases in core network regions are critical for episodic simulation and episodic memory. In the current study, we used MRI-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to assess whether temporary disruption of the left angular gyrus would impair both episodic simulation and memory (16 participants, 10 females). Relative to TMS to a control site (vertex), disruption of the left angular gyrus significantly reduced the number of internal (i.e., episodic) details produced during the simulation and memory tasks, with a concomitant increase in external detail production (i.e., semantic, repetitive, or off-topic information), reflected by a significant detail by TMS site interaction. Difficulty in the simulation and memory tasks also increased after TMS to the left angular gyrus relative to the vertex. In contrast, performance in a nonepisodic control task did not differ statistically as a function of TMS site (i.e., number of free associates produced or difficulty in performing the free associate task). Together, these results are the first to demonstrate that the left angular gyrus is critical for both episodic simulation and episodic memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Humans have the ability to imagine future episodes (i.e., episodic simulation) and remember episodes from the past (i.e., episodic memory). A wealth of neuroimaging studies have revealed that these abilities are associated with enhanced activity in a core network of neural regions, including the hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex, and left angular gyrus. However, neuroimaging data are correlational and do not tell us whether core regions support critical processes for simulation and memory. In the current study, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation and demonstrated that temporary disruption of the left angular gyrus leads to impairments in simulation and memory. The present study provides the first causal evidence to indicate that this region is critical for these fundamental abilities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Polysialylation at Early Stages of Oligodendrocyte Differentiation Promotes Myelin Repair</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8131?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8131?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Polysialic acid is a glycan modification of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) produced by the polysialyltransferases ST8SIA2 and ST8SIA4. Polysialic acid has been detected in multiple sclerosis plaques, but its beneficial or adverse role in remyelination is elusive. Here, we show that, despite a developmental delay, myelination at the onset and during cuprizone-induced demyelination was unaffected in male &lt;i&gt;Ncam1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; or &lt;i&gt;St8sia2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. However, remyelination, restoration of oligodendrocyte densities, and motor recovery after the cessation of cuprizone treatment were compromised. Impaired differentiation of NCAM- or ST8SIA2-negative oligodendrocyte precursors suggested an underlying cell-autonomous mechanism. In contrast, premature differentiation in ST8SIA4-negative cultures explained the accelerated remyelination previously observed in &lt;i&gt;St8sia4&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. mRNA profiling during differentiation of human stem cell-derived and primary murine oligodendrocytes indicated that the opposing roles of ST8SIA2 and ST8SIA4 arise from sequential expression. We also provide evidence that potentiation of ST8SIA2 by 9-&lt;i&gt;cis-&lt;/i&gt;retinoic acid and artificial polysialylation of oligodendrocyte precursors by a bacterial polysialyltransferase are mechanisms to promote oligodendrocytic differentiation. Thus, differential targeting of polysialyltransferases and polysialic acid engineering are promising strategies to advance the treatment of demyelinating diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The beneficial or adverse role of polysialic acid (polySia) in myelin repair is a long-standing question. As a modification of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), polySia is produced by the polysialyltransferases ST8SIA2 and ST8SIA4. Here we demonstrate that NCAM and ST8SIA2 promote oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin repair as well as motor recovery after cuprizone-induced demyelination. In contrast, ST8SIA4 delays oligodendrocyte differentiation, explaining its adverse role in remyelination. These opposing roles of the polysialyltransferases are based on different expression profiles. 9-&lt;i&gt;cis-&lt;/i&gt;retinoic acid enhances ST8SIA2 expression, providing a mechanism for understanding how it supports oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination. Furthermore, artificial polysialylation of the cell surface promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation. Thus, boosting ST8SIA2 and engineering of polySia are promising strategies for improving myelin repair.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Pattern Analyses Reveal Separate Experience-Based Fear Memories in the Human Right Amygdala</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Learning fear via the experience of contingencies between a conditioned stimulus (CS) and an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) is often assumed to be fundamentally different from learning fear via instructions. An open question is whether fear-related brain areas respond differently to experienced CS–US contingencies than to merely instructed CS–US contingencies. Here, we contrasted two experimental conditions where subjects were instructed to expect the same CS–US contingencies while only one condition was characterized by prior experience with the CS–US contingency. Using multivoxel pattern analysis of fMRI data, we found CS-related neural activation patterns in the right amygdala (but not in other fear-related regions) that dissociated between whether a CS–US contingency had been instructed and experienced versus merely instructed. A second experiment further corroborated this finding by showing a category-independent neural response to instructed and experienced, but not merely instructed, CS presentations in the human right amygdala. Together, these findings are in line with previous studies showing that verbal fear instructions have a strong impact on both brain and behavior. However, even in the face of fear instructions, the human right amygdala still shows a separable neural pattern response to experience-based fear contingencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In our study, we addressed a fundamental problem of the science of human fear learning and memory, namely whether fear learning via experience in humans relies on a neural pathway that can be separated from fear learning via verbal information. Using two new procedures and recent advances in the analysis of brain imaging data, we localized purely experience-based fear processing and memory in the right amygdala, thereby making a direct link between human and animal research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: ERK/MAPK Signaling Is Required for Pathway-Specific Striatal Motor Functions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8102?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8102?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ERK/MAPK intracellular signaling pathway is hypothesized to be a key regulator of striatal activity via modulation of synaptic plasticity and gene transcription. However, prior investigations into striatal ERK/MAPK functions have yielded conflicting results. Further, these studies have not delineated the cell-type-specific roles of ERK/MAPK signaling due to the reliance on globally administered pharmacological ERK/MAPK inhibitors and the use of genetic models that only partially reduce total ERK/MAPK activity. Here, we generated mouse models in which ERK/MAPK signaling was completely abolished in each of the two distinct classes of medium spiny neurons (MSNs). ERK/MAPK deletion in D1R-MSNs (direct pathway) resulted in decreased locomotor behavior, reduced weight gain, and early postnatal lethality. In contrast, loss of ERK/MAPK signaling in D2R-MSNs (indirect pathway) resulted in a profound hyperlocomotor phenotype. ERK/MAPK-deficient D2R-MSNs exhibited a significant reduction in dendritic spine density, markedly suppressed electrical excitability, and suppression of activity-associated gene expression even after pharmacological stimulation. Our results demonstrate the importance of ERK/MAPK signaling in governing the motor functions of the striatal direct and indirect pathways. Our data further show a critical role for ERK in maintaining the excitability and plasticity of D2R-MSNs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Alterations in ERK/MAPK activity are associated with drug abuse, as well as neuropsychiatric and movement disorders. However, genetic evidence defining the functions of ERK/MAPK signaling in striatum-related neurophysiology and behavior is lacking. We show that loss of ERK/MAPK signaling leads to pathway-specific alterations in motor function, reduced neuronal excitability, and the inability of medium spiny neurons to regulate activity-induced gene expression. Our results underscore the potential importance of the ERK/MAPK pathway in human movement disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Structural Basis of Large-Scale Functional Connectivity in the Mouse</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8092?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/34/8092?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Translational neuroimaging requires approaches and techniques that can bridge between multiple different species and disease states. One candidate method that offers insights into the brain's functional connectivity (FC) is resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI). In both humans and nonhuman primates, patterns of FC (often referred to as the functional connectome) have been related to the underlying structural connectivity (SC; also called the structural connectome). Given the recent rise in preclinical neuroimaging of mouse models, it is an important question whether the mouse functional connectome conforms to the underlying SC. Here, we compared FC derived from rs-fMRI in female mice with the underlying monosynaptic structural connectome as provided by the Allen Brain Connectivity Atlas. We show that FC between interhemispheric homotopic cortical and hippocampal areas, as well as in cortico-striatal pathways, emerges primarily via monosynaptic structural connections. In particular, we demonstrate that the striatum (STR) can be segregated according to differential rs-fMRI connectivity patterns that mirror monosynaptic connectivity with isocortex. In contrast, for certain subcortical networks, FC emerges along polysynaptic pathways as shown for left and right STR, which do not share direct anatomical connections, but high FC is putatively driven by a top-down cortical control. Finally, we show that FC involving cortico-thalamic pathways is limited, possibly confounded by the effect of anesthesia, small regional size, and tracer injection volume. These findings provide a critical foundation for using rs-fMRI connectivity as a translational tool to study complex brain circuitry interactions and their pathology due to neurological or psychiatric diseases across species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; A comprehensive understanding of how the anatomical architecture of the brain, often referred to as the &quot;connectome,&quot; corresponds to its function is arguably one of the biggest challenges for understanding the brain and its pathologies. Here, we use the mouse as a model for comparing functional connectivity (FC) derived from resting-state fMRI with gold standard structural connectivity measures based on tracer injections. In particular, we demonstrate high correspondence between FC measurements of cortico-cortical and cortico-striatal regions and their anatomical underpinnings. This work provides a critical foundation for studying the pathology of these circuits across mouse models and human patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Depressed Synaptic Transmission and Reduced Vesicle Release Sites in Huntington's Disease Neuromuscular Junctions</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive and fatal degenerative disorder that results in debilitating cognitive and motor dysfunction. Most HD studies have focused on degeneration of the CNS. We previously discovered that skeletal muscle from transgenic R6/2 HD mice is hyperexcitable due to decreased chloride and potassium conductances. The progressive and early onset of these defects suggest a primary myopathy in HD. In this study, we examined the relationship between neuromuscular transmission and skeletal muscle hyperexcitability. We used an &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; preparation of the levator auris longus muscle from male and female late-stage R6/2 mice and age-matched wild-type controls. Immunostaining of the synapses and molecular analyses revealed no evidence of denervation. Physiologically, we recorded spontaneous miniature endplate currents (mEPCs) and nerve-evoked EPCs (eEPCs) under voltage-clamp, which, unlike current-clamp records, were independent of the changes in muscle membrane properties. We found a reduction in the number of vesicles released per action potential (quantal content) in R6/2 muscle, which analysis of eEPC variance and morphology indicate is caused by a reduction in the number of vesicle release sites (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;) rather than a change in the probability of release (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;rel&lt;/sub&gt;). Furthermore, analysis of high-frequency stimulation trains suggests an impairment in vesicle mobilization. The depressed neuromuscular transmission in R6/2 muscle may help compensate for the muscle hyperexcitability and contribute to motor impersistence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Recent evidence indicates that Huntington's disease (HD) is a multisystem disorder. Our examination of neuromuscular transmission in this study reveals defects in the motor nerve terminal that may compensate for the muscle hyperexcitability in HD. The technique we used eliminates the effects of the altered muscle membrane properties on synaptic currents and thus provides hitherto the most detailed analysis of synaptic transmission in HD. Clinically, the striking depression of neurotransmission we found may help explain the motor impersistence in HD patients. Therapies that target the highly accessible peripheral nerve and muscle system provide a promising new avenue to lessen the debilitating motor symptoms of HD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Place and Grid Cells in a Loop: Implications for Memory Function and Spatial Coding</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Place cells in the hippocampus and grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex have different codes for space. However, how one code relates to the other is ill understood. Based on the anatomy of the entorhinal-hippocampal circuitry, we constructed a model of place and grid cells organized in a loop to investigate their mutual influence in the establishment of their codes for space. Using computer simulations, we first replicated experiments in rats that measured place and grid cell activity in different environments, and then assessed which features of the model account for different phenomena observed in neurophysiological data, such as pattern completion and pattern separation, global and rate remapping of place cells, and realignment of grid cells. We found that (1) the interaction between grid and place cells converges quickly; (2) the spatial code of place cells does not require, but is altered by, grid cell input; (3) plasticity in sensory inputs to place cells is key for pattern completion but not pattern separation; (4) grid realignment can be explained in terms of place cell remapping as opposed to the other way around; (5) the switch between global and rate remapping is self-organized; and (6) grid cell input to place cells helps stabilize their code under noisy and/or inconsistent sensory input. We conclude that the hippocampus-entorhinal circuit uses the mutual interaction of place and grid cells to encode the surrounding environment and propose a theory on how such interdependence underlies the formation and use of the cognitive map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The mammalian brain implements a positional system with two key pieces: place and grid cells. To gain insight into the dynamics of place and grid cell interaction, we built a computational model with the two cell types organized in a loop. The proposed model accounts for differences in how place and grid cells represent different environments and provides a new interpretation in which place and grid cells mutually interact to form a coupled code for space.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Distortion Distribution of Neural Spike Train Sequence Matching with Optogenetics. (arXiv:1708.06641v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper uses a simple optogenetic model to compare the timing distortion
between a randomly-generated target spike sequence and an externally-stimulated
neuron spike sequence. Optogenetics is an emerging field of neuroscience where
neurons are genetically modified to express light-sensitive receptors that
enable external control over when the neurons fire. Given the prominence of
neuronal signaling within the brain and throughout the body, optogenetics has
significant potential to improve the understanding of the nervous system and to
develop treatments for neurological diseases. This paper primarily considers
two different distortion measures. The first measure is the delay in
externally-stimulated spikes. The second measure is the root mean square error
between the filtered outputs of the target and stimulated spike sequences. The
mean and the distribution of the distortion is derived in closed form when the
target sequence generation rate is sufficiently low. All derived results are
supported with simulations. This work is a step towards an analytical model to
predict whether different spike trains were observed from the same stimulus,
and the broader goal of understanding the quantity and reliability of
information that can be carried by neurons.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;While the ultrastructure of the myelin has been considered to be a
quasi-crystalline stable system, nowadays its multiscale complex dynamics
appears to play a key role for its functionality, degeneration and repair
processes following neurological diseases and trauma. In this work, we have
investigated the axons interactions associated to the nerve functionality,
measuring the spatial distribution of the orientational fluctuations of axons
in a Xenopus Laevis sciatic nerve. At this aim, we have used Scanning micro
X-ray Diffraction (SmXRD), a non-invasive already applied to other
heterogeneous systems presenting complex geometries from microscale to
nanoscale. We have found that the orientational spatial fluctuations of fresh
axons show a correlated disorder described by Levy flight distribution. Thus,
we have studied how this correlated disorder evolves during the degeneration of
the nerve. Our results show that the spatial distribution of axons
orientational fluctuations in unfresh, aged nerve loose the correlated disorder
assuming a randomly disordered behaviour. This work allows a deeper
understanding of nerve states and paves the way to study other materials and
biomaterials with the same technique to detect and to characterize their states
and supramolecular structure, associated with dynamic structural changes at the
nanoscale and mesoscale.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a system empowering humans to communicate
with or control the outside world with exclusively brain intentions.
Electroencephalography (EEG) based BCIs are promising solutions due to their
convenient and portable instruments. Motor imagery EEG (MI-EEG) is a kind of
most widely focused EEG signals, which reveals a subjects movement intentions
without actual actions. Despite the extensive research of MI-EEG in recent
years, it is still challenging to interpret EEG signals effectively due to the
massive noises in EEG signals (e.g., low signal noise ratio and incomplete EEG
signals), and difficulties in capturing the inconspicuous relationships between
EEG signals and certain brain activities. Most existing works either only
consider EEG as chain-like sequences neglecting complex dependencies between
adjacent signals or performing simple temporal averaging over EEG sequences. In
this paper, we introduce both cascade and parallel convolutional recurrent
neural network models for precisely identifying human intended movements by
effectively learning compositional spatio-temporal representations of raw EEG
streams. The proposed models grasp the spatial correlations between physically
neighboring EEG signals by converting the chain like EEG sequences into a 2D
mesh like hierarchy. An LSTM based recurrent network is able to extract the
subtle temporal dependencies of EEG data streams. Extensive experiments on a
large-scale MI-EEG dataset (108 subjects, 3,145,160 EEG records) have
demonstrated that both models achieve high accuracy near 98.3% and outperform a
set of baseline methods and most recent deep learning based EEG recognition
models, yielding a significant accuracy increase of 18% in the cross-subject
validation scenario.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Based on the visceral theory of sleep by I.N. Pigarev, we hypothesize that
mental illnesses are caused due to errors in the commutation of external and
internal information flows in the brain. As a consequence of these errors,
visceral information is constantly present in the cerebral cortex and during
wakefulness, on the one hand, is misinterpreted as coming from the outside
world, and on the other hand creates a persistent noise overload in
exteroceptive (visual and auditory) and proprioceptive channels leading in a
long run to the over-strain and malfunction of the adaptive mechanisms of the
brain.

	<description>Amputees who wish to rid themselves of a phantom limb must weaken the neural representation of the absent limb. Conversely, amputees who wish to replace a lost limb must assimilate a neuroprosthetic with the existing neural representation. Whether we wish to remove a phantom limb or assimilate a synthetic one, we will benefit from knowing more about the developmental process that enables embodiment. A potentially critical contributor to that process is the spontaneous activity – in the form of limb twitches – that occurs exclusively and abundantly during active (REM) sleep, a particularly prominent state in early development.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Demarcating the anatomical structure of the claustrum: piecing together a new functional puddle</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/179879v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Background: A major obstacle in the understanding of the functional anatomy of the claustrum has been, and continues to be, the contradiction surrounding its anatomical boundary and, in particular, its rostral (i.e. anterior to striatum), extent. In a recent review we highlighted gene expression-based evidence from the mouse brain which lends weight to the idea that the anatomical boundary of the claustrum does in fact extend rostral to the anterior apex of the striatum. In light of this evidence, in the present study, we have examined the expression of two genes that have previously been identified as having differential expression in the mouse claustrum, with the aim of: 1, establishing the true neuroanatomical boundaries of the rat claustrum; and 2, determining the efficacy of claustral marker expression in the histological verification of claustral electrode placement following electrophysiological recordings in awake behaving rats. Methods: The expression profiles of two genes, crystallin mu (Crym) and guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein), gamma 2 (Gng2) were assessed immunohistochemically in five male rats (one Wistar Kyoto (WK) and four Lister hooded (LH)). Prior to histological analysis, two of the rats had undergone surgical implantation of tetrodes targeting the putative rostral claustrum. Results: In results that are consistent with those we have previously described in the mouse brain, expression of Crym in the rat brain was highly attenuated, or absent, in the claustrum, demarcating a nuclear boundary that extended considerably beyond the anterior apex of the striatum. In concordance, enriched expression of Gng2 was found in the claustrum, again extending equivalently rostral to the anterior apex of the striatum. The expression of claustral marker genes is a highly effective tool in the verification of electrophysiological electrode placement. Electrophysiological recordings from within this Gng2 and Crym-defined boundary of the rostral claustrum support previous reports of a spatial map in the rostral claustrum. Conclusions: It is now clear that the anatomical boundary of the rat claustrum does in fact extend into more frontal regions of the brain than has previously been asserted. The importance of these findings are considered in the context of the regional specificity of claustral function, anatomical connectivity and electrophysiological properties.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Physiological Gaussian Process Priors for the Hemodynamics in fMRI Analysis</title>

	<description>Inference from fMRI data faces the challenge that the hemodynamic system, that relates the underlying neural activity to the observed BOLD fMRI signal, is not known. We propose a new Bayesian model for task fMRI data with the following features: (i) joint estimation of brain activity and the underlying hemodynamics, (ii) the hemodynamics is modeled nonparametrically with a Gaussian process (GP) prior guided by physiological information and (iii) the predicted BOLD is not necessarily generated by a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. We place a GP prior directly on the predicted BOLD time series, rather than on the hemodynamic response function as in previous literature. This allows us to incorporate physiological information via the GP prior mean in a flexible way. The prior mean function may be generated from a standard LTI system, based on a canonical hemodynamic response function, or a more elaborate physiological model such as the Balloon model. This gives us the nonparametric flexibility of the GP, but allows the posterior to fall back on the physiologically based prior when the data are weak. Results on simulated data show that even with an erroneous prior for the GP, the proposed model is still able to discriminate between active and non-active voxels in a satisfactory way. The proposed model is also applied to real fMRI data, where our Gaussian process model in several cases finds brain activity where a baseline model with fixed hemodynamics does not.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Addiction in a Bounded Rational Model: Role of Environment and its Exploration</title>

	<description>Existing reinforcement learning (RL) theories of addiction often rely on the 'dual-system theory of decision making'. This theory describes behaviour as a product of the interaction between a reactive, slowly adapting, model-free (MF) component, and a planning-oriented, flexible, and computationally demanding, model-based (MB), one. In addiction, the MF component is assumed to overtake the MB component, causing a behavioural shift towards aberrant reactive responses to drugs. RL theories ascribe this behavioural shift to substance induced bio-chemical effects, which are thought to hijack the standard temporal difference learning mechanism regulating the MF component. However, MF processes seem to account mainly for simple, repetitive and compulsive behaviours so that existing RL models have limited power in explaining: 1) the heterogeneity of drug seeking behaviours; 2) the different mechamisms of actions of the different drugs; 3) addictive behaviours which are not associated with drug intake (e.g. gambling). In this paper, we propose that a non-simplistic experimental environment may account for such multifaceted phenomena in addiction, suggesting that heterogeneous addictive behaviours can arise also without modifications or malfunctions of the standard dual system. Environment complexity is often neglected in laboratory setups, despite its role in modulating the adaptation of both MF and MB components. In particular, environment complexity directly affects the MB decision process due to bounded computational resources, and indirectly affects both the MB and MF learning processes, as exploration demands increase as a function of environment complexity. Thus, we employed an environment where highly rewarding actions are followed by several sparse undesired (punishing) effects, in a pattern that exceeds the computational capabilities of the agents. Our simulations show that the suboptimal decision to repeatedly pursue the high reward, despite its negative effects (i.e. addiction-like behaviour), emerges and is maintained for an extended period of time. This behaviour is found as a bifurcation in several individuals of uniform populations of dual-learning agents over a wide range of parameters regulating the interaction between MF and MB control modalities. Our simulations suggest that addiction may also arise independently of a pharmacological component (e.g. gambling and videogaming) under specific conditions of environment complexity.</description>

	<description>Preparing and executing grasping movements demands the coordination of sensory information across multiple scales. The position of an object, required hand shape, and which of our hands to extend must all be coordinated in parallel. The network formed by the macaque anterior intraparietal area (AIP) and hand area (F5) of the ventral premotor cortex is essential in the generation of grasping movements. Yet, the role of this circuit in hand selection is unclear. We recorded from 1342 single- and multi-units in AIP and F5 of two macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) during a delayed grasping task in which monkeys were instructed by a visual cue to perform power or precision grips on a handle presented in five different orientations with either the left or right hand, as instructed by an auditory tone. In AIP, intended hand use was only weakly represented during preparation, while hand use was robustly present in F5 during preparation. Interestingly, visual-centric handle orientation information dominated AIP, while F5 contained an additional body-centric frame during preparation and movement. Together, our results implicate F5 as a site of visuomotor transformation and advocate a strong transition between hand-invariant and hand-specific representations in this parieto-frontal circuit.</description>

	<description>Our voluntary grasping actions lie on a continuum between immediate action and waiting for the right moment, depending on the context. Therefore, studying grasping requires investigating how preparation time affects this process. Two macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) performed a grasping task with a short instruction followed by an immediate or delayed go cue (0-1300 ms) while we recorded in parallel from neurons in the hand area (F5) of the ventral premotor cortex and the anterior intraparietal area (AIP). Initial population dynamics followed a fixed trajectory in the neural state space unique to each grip type, reflecting unavoidable preparation, then diverged depending on the delay. Although similar types of single unit responses were present in both areas, population activity in AIP stabilized within a unique memory state while F5 activity continued to evolve, tracking subjective anticipation of the go cue. Intriguingly, activity during movement initiation clustered into two trajectory clusters, corresponding to movements that were either 'as fast as possible' or withheld movements, demonstrating a widespread state shift in the frontoparietal grasping network when movements must be withheld. Our results reveal how dissociation between static and dynamic components of movement preparation as well as differentiation between cortical areas is possible through population level analysis.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Temperature manipulation of neuronal dynamics in a forebrain motor control nucleus</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Matías A. Goldin, Gabriel B. Mindlin&lt;/p&gt;

Different neuronal types within brain motor areas contribute to the generation of complex motor behaviors. A widely studied songbird forebrain nucleus (HVC) has been recognized as fundamental in shaping the precise timing characteristics of birdsong. This is based, among other evidence, on the stretching and the “breaking” of song structure when HVC is cooled. However, little is known about the temperature effects that take place in its neurons. To address this, we investigated the dynamics of HVC both experimentally and computationally. We developed a technique where simultaneous electrophysiological recordings were performed during temperature manipulation of HVC. We recorded spontaneous activity and found three effects: widening of the spike shape, decrease of the firing rate and change in the interspike interval distribution. All these effects could be explained with a detailed conductance based model of all the neurons present in HVC. Temperature dependence of the ionic channel time constants explained the first effect, while the second was based in the changes of the maximal conductance using single synaptic excitatory inputs. The last phenomenon, only emerged after introducing a more realistic synaptic input to the inhibitory interneurons. Two timescales were present in the interspike distributions. The behavior of one timescale was reproduced with different input balances received form the excitatory neurons, whereas the other, which disappears with cooling, could not be found assuming poissonian synaptic inputs. Furthermore, the computational model shows that the bursting of the excitatory neurons arises naturally at normal brain temperature and that they have an intrinsic delay at low temperatures. The same effect occurs at single synapses, which may explain song stretching. These findings shed light on the temperature dependence of neuronal dynamics and present a comprehensive framework to study neuronal connectivity. This study, which is based on intrinsic neuronal characteristics, may help to understand emergent behavioral changes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mXYitYBBMvs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>EGR1 is an early growth response zinc finger transcription factor with broad actions, including in differentiation, mitogenesis, tumor suppression, and neuronal plasticity. Here we demonstrate that Egr1−/− mice on the C57BL/6 background have normal eyelid development, but back-crossing to BALB/c background for four or five generations resulted in defective eyelid...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/RJAL2TAlZ2w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>The nuclear receptor EcRB1, which is activated by the insect steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), is reportedly phosphorylated by a protein kinase after 20E induction. However, the protein kinase has not been identified, and the significance of EcRB1 phosphorylation is unclear. In this study, we identified a protein kinase C δ...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/2F1hyDAMvxI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>The ELISA is the mainstay for sensitive and quantitative detection of protein analytes. Despite its utility, ELISA is time-consuming, resource-intensive, and infrastructure-dependent, limiting its availability in resource-limited regions. Here, we describe a self-contained immunoassay platform (the “D4 assay”) that converts the sandwich immunoassay into a point-of-care test (POCT).

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Dopamine transporter imaging deficit predicts early transition to synucleinopathy in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: To determine the usefulness of dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging to identify idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (IRBD) patients at risk for short-term development of clinically-defined synucleinopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Eighty-seven patients with polysomnography-confirmed IRBD underwent &lt;sup&gt;123&lt;/sup&gt;I-FP-CIT DAT-SPECT. Results were compared with 20 matched controls without RBD who underwent DAT-SPECT. In patients, FP-CIT uptake was considered abnormal when values were two standard deviations below controls' mean uptake. After DAT-SPECT, patients were followed-up during 5.7 ± 2.2 (range, 2.6-9.9) years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Baseline DAT deficit was found in 51 (58.6%) patients. During follow-up 25 (28.7%) subjects developed clinically-defined synucleinopathy (Parkinson disease in 11, dementia with Lewy bodies in 13, multiple system atrophy in one) with mean latency of 3.2 ± 1.9 years from imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed increased risk of incident synucleinopathy in patients with abnormal DAT-SPECT than with normal DAT-SPECT (20% vs. 6% at three years, 33% vs. 18% at five years; log rank test, p=0.006).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Receiver operating characteristics curve revealed that reduction of FP-CIT uptake in putamen greater than 25% discriminated patients with DAT deficit who developed synucleinopathy from patients with DAT deficit that remained disease-free after three years of follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 5-year follow-up, DAT-SPECT had 75% sensitivity, 51% specificity, 44% positive predictive value, 80% negative predictive value, and like-hood ratio 1.54 to predict synucleinopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: DAT-SPECT identifies IRBD patients at short-term risk for synucleinopathy. Decreased FP-CIT putamen uptake greater than 25% predicts synucleinopathy after three years follow-up. These observations may be useful to select candidates for disease-modification trials in IRBD.

We hypothesized that interictal VHFOs are more specific biomarkers for epileptogenic zone compared to traditional HFOs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25006-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forty patients with focal epilepsy who underwent presurgical stereo-EEG (SEEG) were included in the study. SEEG data were recorded with a sampling rate of 25kHz, and a 30-minute resting period was analyzed for each patient. Ten patients met selected criteria for analyses of correlations with surgical outcome: detection of interictal ripples (Rs), fast ripples (FRs), and VHFOs; resective surgery; and at least 1 year of postoperative follow-up. Using power envelope computation and visual inspection of power distribution matrixes, electrode contacts with HFOs and VHFOs were detected and analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25006-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interictal very fast ripples (VFRs; 500–1,000Hz) were detected in 23 of 40 patients and ultrafast ripples (UFRs; 1,000–2,000Hz) in almost half of investigated subjects (n = 19). VFRs and UFRs were observed only in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and were recorded exclusively from mesiotemporal structures. The UFRs were more spatially restricted in the brain than lower-frequency HFOs. When compared to R oscillations, significantly better outcomes were observed in patients with a higher percentage of removed contacts containing FRs, VFRs, and UFRs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unintended weight loss is a hallmark of Huntington disease (HD), but it is unknown to what extent weight loss impacts the rate of disease progression. Therefore, using longitudinal data from the Enroll-HD study, we assessed the association between baseline body mass index (BMI) and the rate of clinical progression in 5,821 HD mutation carriers. We found that high baseline BMI was associated with a significantly slower rate of functional, motor, and cognitive deterioration (all &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), independent of mutant &lt;em&gt;HTT&lt;/em&gt; CAG repeat size. Our findings provide strong rationale for exploration of systemic metabolism as a therapeutic target in HD. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Opto-magnetic imaging of neural network activity in brain slices at high resolution using color centers in diamond. (arXiv:1708.06158v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06158</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06158</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We suggest a novel approach for wide-field imaging of the neural network
dynamics of brain slices that uses highly sensitivity magnetometry based on
nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. In-vitro recordings in brain slices
is a proven method for the characterization of electrical neural activity and
has strongly contributed to our understanding of the mechanisms that govern
neural information processing. However, traditional recordings can only acquire
signals from a few positions simultaneously, which severely limits their
ability to characterize the dynamics of the underlying neural networks. We
suggest to radically extend the scope of this method using the wide-field
imaging of the neural magnetic fields across the slice by means of NV
magnetometry. Employing comprehensive computational simulations and theoretical
analyses, we characterize the spatiotemporal characteristics of the neural
magnetic fields and derive the required key performance parameters of an
imaging setup based on NV magnetometry. In particular, we determine how the
technical parameters determine the achievable spatial resolution for an optimal
reconstruction of the neural currents from the measured field distributions.
Finally, we compare the imaging of neural slice activity with that of a single
planar pyramidal cell. Our results suggest that imaging of neural slice
activity will be possible with the upcoming generation of NV magnetic field
sensors, while imaging of the activity of a single planar cell remains more
challenging.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Innovations orthogonalization: a solution to the major pitfalls of EEG/MEG &quot;leakage correction&quot;. (arXiv:1708.05931v2 [stat.ME] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05931</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05931</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The problem of interest here is the study of brain functional and effective
connectivity based on non-invasive EEG-MEG inverse solution time series. These
signals generally have low spatial resolution, such that an estimated signal at
any one site is an instantaneous linear mixture of the true, actual, unobserved
signals across all cortical sites. False connectivity can result from analysis
of these low-resolution signals. Recent efforts toward &quot;unmixing&quot; have been
developed, under the name of &quot;leakage correction&quot;. One recent noteworthy
approach is that by Colclough et al (2015 NeuroImage, 117:439-448), which
forces the inverse solution signals to have zero cross-correlation at lag zero.
One goal is to show that Colclough's method produces false human connectomes
under very broad conditions. The second major goal is to develop a new
solution, that appropriately &quot;unmixes&quot; the inverse solution signals, based on
innovations orthogonalization. The new method first fits a multivariate
autoregression to the inverse solution signals, giving the mixed innovations.
Second, the mixed innovations are orthogonalized. Third, the mixed and
orthogonalized innovations allow the estimation of the &quot;unmixing&quot; matrix, which
is then finally used to &quot;unmix&quot; the inverse solution signals. It is shown that
under very broad conditions, the new method produces proper human connectomes,
even when the signals are not generated by an autoregressive model.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Given the structure of a novel molecule, there is still no one who can
reliably predict what odor percept that molecule will evoke. The challenge
comes from both the difficulty in quantitatively characterizing molecular
structure, and the inadequacy of language to fully characterize olfactory
perception. Here, we present a novel approach to both problems.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3744</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Maximum entropy models are increasingly being used to describe the collective
activity of neural populations with measured mean neural activities and
pairwise correlations, but the full space of probability distributions
consistent with these constraints has not been explored. We provide upper and
lower bounds on the entropy for the {\em minimum} entropy distribution over
arbitrarily large collections of binary units with any fixed set of mean values
and pairwise correlations. We also construct specific low-entropy distributions
for several relevant cases. Surprisingly, the minimum entropy solution has
entropy scaling logarithmically with system size for any set of first- and
second-order statistics consistent with arbitrarily large systems. We further
demonstrate that some sets of these low-order statistics can only be realized
by small systems. Our results show how only small amounts of randomness are
needed to mimic low-order statistical properties of highly entropic
distributions, and we discuss some applications for engineered and biological
information transmission systems.

	<description>To date, studies have demonstrated the dynamic influence of exogenous environmental stimuli on multiple regions of the brain. This environmental influence positively and negatively impacts programs governing myelination, and acts on myelinating oligodendrocyte (OL) cells across the human lifespan. Developmentally, environmental manipulation of OL progenitor cells (OPCs) has profound effects on the establishment of functional cognitive, sensory, and motor programs. Furthermore, central nervous system (CNS) myelin remains an adaptive entity in adulthood, sensitive to environmentally induced structural changes.</description>

Epigenomic mapping of enhancer-associated chromatin modifications facilitates the genome-wide discovery of tissue-specific enhancers &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. However, reliance on single chromatin marks leads to high rates of false-positive predictions. More sophisticated, integrative methods have been described, but commonly suffer from limited accessibility to the resulting predictions and reduced biological interpretability. Here we present the Limb Enhancer Genie (LEG), a collection of highly accurate, genome-wide predictions of enhancers in the developing limb, available through a user-friendly online interface. We predict limb enhancers using a combination of &amp;gt;50 published limb-specific datasets and clusters of evolutionarily conserved transcription factor binding sites, taking advantage of the patterns observed at previously &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; validated elements. By combining different statistical models, our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and provides interpretable measures of feature importance. Our results indicate that including a previously unappreciated score that quantifies tissue-specific nuclease accessibility significantly improves prediction performance. We demonstrate the utility of our approach through &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; validation of newly predicted elements. Moreover, we describe general features that can guide the type of datasets to include when predicting tissue-specific enhancers genome-wide, while providing an accessible resource to the general biological community and facilitating the functional interpretation of genetic studies of limb malformations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Tbw5zd-eLMc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Polymodal allosteric regulation of Type 1 Serine/Threonine Kinase Receptors via a conserved electrostatic lock</title>

Type 1 Serine/Threonine Kinase Receptors (STKR1) transduce a wide spectrum of biological signals mediated by TGF-β superfamily members. The STKR1 activity is tightly controlled by their regulatory glycine-serine rich (GS) domain adjacent to the kinase domain. Despite decades of studies, it remains unknown how physiological or pathological GS domain modifications are coupled to STKR1 kinase activity. Here, by performing molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculation of Activin-Like Kinase 2 (ALK2), we found that GS domain phosphorylation, FKBP12 dissociation, and disease mutations all destabilize a D354-R375 salt-bridge, which normally acts as an electrostatic lock to prevent coordination of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the catalytic site. We developed a WAFEX-guided principal analysis and unraveled how phosphorylation destabilizes this highly conserved salt-bridge in temporal and physical space. Using current-flow betweenness scores, we identified an allosteric network of residue-residue contacts between the GS domain and the catalytic site that controls the formation and disruption of this salt bridge. Importantly, our novel network analysis approach revealed how certain disease-causing mutations bypass FKBP12-mediated kinase inhibition to produce leaky signaling in the absence of ligand. We further provide experimental evidence that this salt-bridge lock exists in other STKR1s, and acts as a general safety mechanism in STKR1 to prevent pathological leaky signaling. In summary, our study provides a compelling and unifying allosteric activation mechanism in STKR1 kinases that reconciles a large number of experimental studies and sheds light on a novel therapeutic avenue to target disease-related STKR1 mutants.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KkneVn381dc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Host population structure impedes reversion to drug sensitivity after discontinuation of treatment</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005704</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jonas I. Liechti, Gabriel E. Leventhal, Sebastian Bonhoeffer&lt;/p&gt;

Intense use of antibiotics for the treatment of diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; or gonorrhea has led to rapidly increasing population levels of drug resistance. This has generally necessitated a switch to new drugs and the discontinuation of older ones, after which resistance often only declines slowly or even persists indefinitely. These long-term effects are usually ascribed to low fitness costs of resistance in absence of the drug. Here we show that structure in the host population, in particular heterogeneity in number of contacts, also plays an important role in the reversion dynamics. Host contact structure acts both during the phase of intense treatment, leading to non-random distributions of the resistant strain among the infected population, and after the discontinuation of the drug, by affecting the competition dynamics resulting in a mitigation of fitness advantages. As a consequence, we observe both a lower rate of reversion and a lower probability that reversion to sensitivity on the population level occurs after treatment is stopped. Our simulations show that the impact of heterogeneity in the host structure is maximal in the biologically most plausible parameter range, namely when fitness costs of resistance are small.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aEDhdmGO1Us&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

A major force contributing to the emergence of novelty in nature is the presence of cooperative interactions, where two or more components of a system act in synergy, sometimes leading to higher-order, emergent phenomena. Within molecular evolution, the so called &lt;i&gt;hypercycle&lt;/i&gt; defines the simplest model of an autocatalytic cycle, providing major theoretical insights on the evolution of cooperation in the early biosphere. These closed cooperative loops have also inspired our understanding of how catalytic loops appear in ecological systems. In both cases, hypercycle and ecological cooperative loops, the role played by space seems to be crucial for their stability and resilience against parasites. However, it is difficult to test these ideas in natural ecosystems, where time and spatial scales introduce considerable limitations. Here, we use engineered bacteria as a model system to a variety of environmental scenarios identifying trends that transcend the specific model system, such an enhanced genetic diversity in environments requiring mutualistic interactions. Interestingly, we show that improved environments can slow down mutualistic range expansions as a result of genetic drift effects preceding local resource depletion. Moreover, we show that a parasitic strain is excluded from the population during range expansions (which acknowledges a classical prediction). Nevertheless, environmental deterioration can reshape population interactions, this same strain becoming part of a three-species mutualistic web in scenarios in which the two-strain mutualism becomes non functional. The evolutionary and ecological implications for the design of synthetic ecosystems are outlined.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-lmZyb2t8MA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Neuron’s eye view: Inferring features of complex stimuli from neural responses</title>

Experiments that study neural encoding of stimuli at the level of individual neurons typically choose a small set of features present in the world—contrast and luminance for vision, pitch and intensity for sound—and assemble a stimulus set that systematically varies along these dimensions. Subsequent analysis of neural responses to these stimuli typically focuses on regression models, with experimenter-controlled features as predictors and spike counts or firing rates as responses. Unfortunately, this approach requires knowledge in advance about the relevant features coded by a given population of neurons. For domains as complex as social interaction or natural movement, however, the relevant feature space is poorly understood, and an arbitrary &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; choice of features may give rise to confirmation bias. Here, we present a Bayesian model for exploratory data analysis that is capable of automatically identifying the features present in unstructured stimuli based solely on neuronal responses. Our approach is unique within the class of latent state space models of neural activity in that it assumes that firing rates of neurons are sensitive to multiple discrete time-varying features tied to the &lt;i&gt;stimulus&lt;/i&gt;, each of which has Markov (or semi-Markov) dynamics. That is, we are modeling neural activity as driven by multiple simultaneous stimulus features rather than intrinsic neural dynamics. We derive a fast variational Bayesian inference algorithm and show that it correctly recovers hidden features in synthetic data, as well as ground-truth stimulus features in a prototypical neural dataset. To demonstrate the utility of the algorithm, we also apply it to cluster neural responses and demonstrate successful recovery of features corresponding to monkeys and faces in the image set.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/y_WuW3DO4Dw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Insufficient sleep: Enhanced risk-seeking relates to low local sleep intensity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25023</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: Chronic sleep restriction is highly prevalent in modern society and is in its clinical form, insufficient sleep syndrome, one of the most prevalent diagnoses in clinical sleep laboratories, with substantial negative impact on health and community burden. It reflects every-day sleep loss better than acute sleep deprivation, but its effects and particularly the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown for a variety of critical cognitive domains, as for example risky decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We assessed financial risk-taking behavior after 7 consecutive nights of sleep restriction and after one night of acute sleep deprivation compared to a regular sleep condition in a within-subject design. We further investigated potential underlying mechanisms of sleep loss induced changes in behavior by high-density electroencephalography recordings during restricted sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We show that chronic sleep restriction increases risk-seeking, while this was not observed after acute sleep deprivation. This increase was subjectively not noticed and was related to locally lower values of slow wave energy during preceding sleep, an electrophysiological marker of sleep intensity and restoration, in electrodes over the right prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: This study provides for the first time evidence that insufficient sleep restoration over circumscribed cortical areas leads to aberrant behavior. In chronically sleep restricted subjects, low slow wave sleep intensity over the right prefrontal cortex - which has been shown to be linked to risk behavior – may lead to increased and subjectively unnoticed risk-seeking.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Localization transition induced by learning in random searches. (arXiv:1708.05614v1 [cond-mat.stat-mech])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05614</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05614</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We solve an adaptive search model where a random walker or L\'evy flight
stochastically resets to previously visited sites on a $d$-dimensional lattice
containing one trapping site. Due to reinforcement, a phase transition occurs
when the resetting rate crosses a threshold above which non-diffusive
stationary states emerge, localized around the inhomogeneity. The threshold
depends on the trapping strength and on the walker's return probability in the
memoryless case. The transition belongs to the same class as the
self-consistent theory of Anderson localization. These results show that
similarly to many living organisms and unlike the well-studied Markovian walks,
non-Markov movement processes can allow agents to learn about their environment
and promise to bring adaptive solutions in search tasks.

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24996-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients had autopsy-confirmed FTLD with tauopathy (n = 31), TDP-43 proteinopathy (n = 49), or AD (n = 26) with antemortem CSF. CSF tau levels were compared between groups and correlated with digital histology measurement of postmortem tau pathology averaged from three cerebral regions (angular gyrus, mid-frontal cortex, and anterior cingulate gyrus). Multivariate linear regression tested the association of ante mortem CSF tau levels with postmortem tau pathology adjusting for demographics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

After excluding patients with coincident AD-associated tau pathology accompanying sporadic FTLD, we found lower CSF phosphorylated tau levels in the TDP-43 group (median = 7.4pg/ml; interquartile range [IQR] = 6.0, 12.3; n = 26) compared to the tauopathy group (median = 12.5pg/ml; IQR = 10.7, 15.0; n = 23; Z = 2.6; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In vivo detection of AD copathology in sporadic FTLD patients may help stratify clinical cohorts with pure neuropathology in which low CSF phosphorylated-tau levels may have diagnostic utility to distinguish TDP-43 proteinopathy from tauopathy. Autopsy-confirmed samples are critical for FTLD biomarker development and validation. Ann Neurol 2017;82:247–258&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Fibrin(ogen) deposition is neurotoxic in animal models of MS, but has not been evaluated in human progressive MS cortex. The aim of this study was to investigate the extent and distribution of fibrin(ogen) in progressive MS cortex and elucidate its relationship with neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24997-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A postmortem cohort of pathologically confirmed MS (n = 47) and control (n = 10) cases was used. The extent and distribution of fibrin(ogen) was assessed and related to measures of demyelination, inflammation, and neuronal density. In a subset of cases (MS, n = 20; control, n = 10), expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), a key enzyme in the fibrinolytic cascade, was assessed and related to the extent of fibrin(ogen).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Progressive MS cases with severe fibrin(ogen) deposition have significantly reduced neuronal density. Future studies are needed to elucidate the provenance and putative neurotoxicity of fibrin(ogen), and its potential impact on clinical disability.

Our work focuses on the stability, resilience, and response to perturbation of the bacterial communities in the human gut. Informative flash flood-like disturbances that eliminate most gastrointestinal biomass can be induced using a clinically-relevant iso-osmotic agent. We designed and executed such a disturbance in human volunteers using a dense longitudinal sampling scheme extending before and after induced diarrhea. This experiment has enabled a careful multidomain analysis of a controlled perturbation of the human gut microbiota with a new level of resolution. These new longitudinal multidomain data were analyzed using recently developed statistical methods that demonstrate improvements over current practices. By imposing sparsity constraints we have enhanced the interpretability of the analyses and by employing a new adaptive generalized principal components analysis, incorporated modulated phylogenetic information and enhanced interpretation through scoring of the portions of the tree most influenced by the perturbation. Our analyses leverage the taxa-sample duality in the data to show how the gut microbiota recovers following this perturbation. Through a holistic approach that integrates phylogenetic, metagenomic and abundance information, we elucidate patterns of taxonomic and functional change that characterize the community recovery process across individuals. We provide complete code and illustrations of new sparse statistical methods for high-dimensional, longitudinal multidomain data that provide greater interpretability than existing methods.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bi_0OACHraE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Mapping gene expression as a quantitative trait using whole genome-sequencing and transcriptome analysis allows to discover the functional consequences of genetic variation. We developed a novel method and ultra-fast software Findr for higly accurate causal inference between gene expression traits using cis-regulatory DNA variations as causal anchors, which improves current methods by taking into consideration hidden confounders and weak regulations. Findr outperformed existing methods on the DREAM5 Systems Genetics challenge and on the prediction of microRNA and transcription factor targets in human lymphoblastoid cells, while being nearly a million times faster. Findr is publicly available at https://github.com/lingfeiwang/findr.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jwKwMNrRg0w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Extracting replicable associations across multiple studies: Empirical Bayes algorithms for controlling the false discovery rate</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005700</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by David Amar, Ron Shamir, Daniel Yekutieli&lt;/p&gt;

In almost every field in genomics, large-scale biomedical datasets are used to report associations. Extracting associations that recur across multiple studies while controlling the false discovery rate is a fundamental challenge. Here, we propose a new method to allow joint analysis of multiple studies. Given a set of p-values obtained from each study, the goal is to identify associations that recur in at least &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 1 studies while controlling the false discovery rate. We propose several new algorithms that differ in how the study dependencies are modeled, and compare them and extant methods under various simulated scenarios. The top algorithm, SCREEN (Scalable Cluster-based REplicability ENhancement), is our new algorithm that works in three stages: (1) clustering an estimated correlation network of the studies, (2) learning replicability (e.g., of genes) within clusters, and (3) merging the results across the clusters. When we applied SCREEN to two real datasets it greatly outperformed the results obtained via standard meta-analysis. First, on a collection of 29 case-control gene expression cancer studies, we detected a large set of consistently up-regulated genes related to proliferation and cell cycle regulation. These genes are both consistently up-regulated across many cancer studies, and are well connected in known gene networks. Second, on a recent pan-cancer study that examined the expression profiles of patients with and without mutations in the HLA complex, we detected a large active module of up-regulated genes that are both related to immune responses and are well connected in known gene networks. This module covers thrice more genes as compared to the original study at a similar false discovery rate, demonstrating the high power of SCREEN. An implementation of SCREEN is available in the supplement.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YRu4NDFR8Wk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: T1-/T2-weighted ratio differs in demyelinated cortex of multiple sclerosis</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detecting cortical demyelination in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) is difficult. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ratio maps of T1-weighted and T2-weighted images (T1w/T2w) may be sensitive to cortical myelin levels. In this MRI-histological study, postmortem in situ scans were acquired from six cadavers with MS on a 3 Tesla MRI. Immunocytochemistry was used to correlate myelin status and cortical T1w/T2w measures. The results showed that the T1w/T2w values significantly differed between demyelinated and myelinated cortex (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). The T1w/T2w ratio maps may be a relatively simple, clinically feasible method to assess cortical demyelination. This article is protected by copyright.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In multiple sclerosis, neuropathological studies have shown widespread changes in the cerebral cortex. In vivo imaging is critical since the histopathological substrate of most measurements is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a novel MRI analysis technique, based on the ratio of T1- and T2-weighted signal intensities, we studied the cerebral cortex of a large cohort of patients in early stages of multiple sclerosis. 168 patients with clinically isolated syndrome or relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (Expanded Disability Status Scale: median, 1; range, 0-3.5) and 80 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were investigated. We also searched for the histopathological substrate of the T1/T2-weighted ratio by combining post mortem imaging and histopathology in 9 multiple sclerosis brain donors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients showed lower T1/T2-weighted ratio values in parietal and occipital areas. The four most significant clusters appeared in the medial occipital and posterior cingulate cortex (each left and right). The decrease of the T1/T2-weighted ratio in the posterior cingulate was related to performance in attention. Analysis of the T1/T2-weighted ratio values of post mortem imaging yielded a strong correlation with dendrite density but none of the other parameters including myelin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The T1/T2-weighted ratio decreases in early stages of multiple sclerosis in a widespread manner with a preponderance of posterior areas and with a contribution to attentional performance; it seems to reflect dendrite pathology. As the method is broadly available and applicable to (available) clinical scans, we believe that it is a promising candidate for studying and monitoring cortical pathology or therapeutic effects in multiple sclerosis.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Axonal components of nerves innervating the human arm</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25018</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Axons travelling within the brachial plexus are responsible for the dexterous control of human arm and hand movements. Despite comprehensive knowledge on the topographical anatomy of nerves innervating the human upper limb, the definite quantity of sensory and motor axons within this neural network remains elusive. Our aim was to perform a quantitative analysis of the axonal components of human upper limb nerves based on highly specific molecular features from spinal cord level to the terminal nerves at wrist level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Nerve specimen harvest at pre-defined harvesting sites (plexus roots and cords as well as major nerves originating from the brachial plexus innervating the arm and hand) was performed in nine human heart-beating organ donors. Double immunofluorescence staining using antibodies against choline-acetyltransferase and neurofilament was performed to differentiate motor and sensory axons on nerve cross sections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: 350.000 axons emerge from the spinal cord to innervate the human upper limb of which 10% are motor neurons. In all nerves studied sensory axons outnumber motor axons by a ratio of at least 9:1. The sensory axon contribution increases when moving distally while only 1.700 motor axons reach the hand to innervate the intrinsic musculature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Our results suggest that upper limb motor execution, and particularly dexterous coordination of hand movement require an unexpectedly low number of motor neurons, with a large convergence of afferent input for feedback control.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Persistent seizure control in epileptic mice transplanted with GABA progenitors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25021</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25021</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A significant proportion of the more than 50 million people world-wide currently suffering with epilepsy are resistant to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). As an alternative to AEDs, novel therapies based on cell transplantation offer an opportunity for long-lasting modification of epileptic circuits. To develop such a treatment requires careful preclinical studies in a chronic epilepsy model featuring unprovoked seizures, hippocampal histopathology, and behavioral comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transplantation of progenitor cells from embryonic medial or caudal ganglionic eminence (MGE, CGE) were made in a well-characterized mouse model of status epilepticus-induced epilepsy (systemic pilocarpine). Behavioral testing (handling and open field), continuous video-electroencephalographic (vEEG) monitoring and slice electrophysiology outcomes were obtained up to 270 days after transplantation (DAT). &lt;em&gt;Post hoc&lt;/em&gt; immunohistochemistry was used to confirm cell identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;MGE progenitors transplanted into the hippocampus of epileptic mice rescued handling and open field deficits starting at 60 DAT. In these same mice, an 84-88% reduction in seizure activity was observed between 180 and 210 DAT. Inhibitory postsynaptic current frequency, measured on pyramidal neurons in acute hippocampal slices at 270 DAT, was reduced in epileptic mice but restored to naïve levels in epileptic mice receiving MGE transplants. No reduction in seizure activity was observed in epileptic mice receiving intra-hippocampal CGE progenitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings demonstrate that transplanted MGE progenitors enhance functional GABA-mediated inhibition, reduce spontaneous seizure frequency and rescue behavioral deficits in a chronic epileptic animal model more than six months after treatment.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Inhibiting persistent inward sodium currents prevents myotonia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25017</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25017</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Patients with myotonia congenita have muscle hyperexcitability due to loss-of-function mutations in the ClC-1 chloride channel in skeletal muscle, which causes involuntary firing of muscle action potentials (myotonia), producing muscle stiffness. The excitatory events that trigger myotonic action potentials in the absence of stabilizing ClC-1 current are not fully understood. Our goal was to identify currents that trigger spontaneous firing of muscle in the setting of reduced ClC-1 current.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; intracellular current clamp and voltage clamp recordings were performed in muscle from a mouse model of myotonia congenita.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Intracellular recordings revealed a slow after-depolarization (AfD) that triggers myotonic action potentials. The after depolarization is well-explained by a tetrododoxin-sensitive and voltage-dependent Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; persistent inward current (NaPIC). Notably, this NaPIC undergoes slow inactivation over seconds, suggesting this may contribute to the end of myotonic runs. Highlighting the significance of this mechanism, we found that ranolazine and elevated serum divalent cations eliminate myotonia by inhibiting AfD and NaPIC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: This work significantly changes our understanding of the mechanisms triggering myotonia. Our work suggests that the current focus of treating myotonia, blocking the transient Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current underlying action potentials, is an inefficient approach. We show that inhibiting NaPIC is paralleled by elimination of myotonia. We suggest the ideal myotonia therapy would selectively block NaPIC and spare the transient Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Data assimilation, defined as the fusion of data with preexisting knowledge,
is particularly suited to elucidating underlying phenomena from
noisy/insufficient observations. Although this approach has been widely used in
diverse fields, only recently have efforts been directed to problems in
neuroscience, using mainly intracranial data and thus limiting its
applicability to invasive measurements involving electrode implants. Here we
intend to apply data assimilation to non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG)
measurements to infer brain states and their characteristics. For this purpose,
we use Kalman filtering to combine synthetic EEG data with a coupled
neural-mass model together with Ary's model of the head, which projects
intracranial signals onto the scalp. Our results show that using several
extracranial electrodes allows to successfully estimate the state and
parameters of the neural masses and their interactions, whereas one single
electrode provides only a very partial and insufficient view of the system. The
superiority of using multiple extracranial electrodes over using only one, be
it intra- or extracranial, is shown over a wide variety of dynamical
behaviours. Our results show potential towards future clinical applications of
the method.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we describe our method for classification of brain magnetic
resonance (MR) images into different abnormalities and healthy classes based on
the deep neural network. We propose our method to detect high and low-grade
glioma, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer diseases as well as healthy cases.
Our network architecture has ten learning layers that include seven
convolutional layers and three fully connected layers. We have achieved a
promising result in five categories of brain images (classification task) with
95.7% accuracy.

Granulomas are complex lung lesions that are the hallmark of tuberculosis (TB). Understanding antibiotic dynamics within lung granulomas will be vital to improving and shortening the long course of TB treatment. Three fluoroquinolones (FQs) are commonly prescribed as part of multi-drug resistant TB therapy: moxifloxacin (MXF), levofloxacin (LVX) or gatifloxacin (GFX). To date, insufficient data are available to support selection of one FQ over another, or to show that these drugs are clinically equivalent. To predict the efficacy of MXF, LVX and GFX at a single granuloma level, we integrate computational modeling with experimental datasets into a single mechanistic framework, &lt;i&gt;GranSim&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;GranSim&lt;/i&gt; is a hybrid agent-based computational model that simulates granuloma formation and function, FQ plasma and tissue pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and is based on extensive &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; data. We treat &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; granulomas with recommended daily doses of each FQ and compare efficacy by multiple metrics: bacterial load, sterilization rates, early bactericidal activity and efficacy under non-compliance and treatment interruption. &lt;i&gt;GranSim&lt;/i&gt; reproduces &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; plasma pharmacokinetics, spatial and temporal tissue pharmacokinetics and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; pharmacodynamics of these FQs. We predict that MXF kills intracellular bacteria more quickly than LVX and GFX due in part to a higher cellular accumulation ratio. We also show that all three FQs struggle to sterilize non-replicating bacteria residing in caseum. This is due to modest drug concentrations inside caseum and high inhibitory concentrations for this bacterial subpopulation. MXF and LVX have higher granuloma sterilization rates compared to GFX; and MXF performs better in a simulated non-compliance or treatment interruption scenario. We conclude that MXF has a small but potentially clinically significant advantage over LVX, as well as LVX over GFX. We illustrate how a systems pharmacology approach combining experimental and computational methods can guide antibiotic selection for TB.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2_HiujLsGu4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: An optimal strategy for epilepsy surgery: Disruption of the rich-club?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005637</guid>

Surgery is a therapeutic option for people with epilepsy whose seizures are not controlled by anti-epilepsy drugs. In pre-surgical planning, an array of data modalities, often including intra-cranial EEG, is used in an attempt to map regions of the brain thought to be crucial for the generation of seizures. These regions are then resected with the hope that the individual is rendered seizure free as a consequence. However, post-operative seizure freedom is currently sub-optimal, suggesting that the pre-surgical assessment may be improved by taking advantage of a mechanistic understanding of seizure generation in large brain networks. Herein we use mathematical models to uncover the relative contribution of regions of the brain to seizure generation and consequently which brain regions should be considered for resection. A critical advantage of this modeling approach is that the effect of different surgical strategies can be predicted and quantitatively compared in advance of surgery. Herein we seek to understand seizure generation in networks with different topologies and study how the removal of different nodes in these networks reduces the occurrence of seizures. Since this a computationally demanding problem, a first step for this aim is to facilitate tractability of this approach for large networks. To do this, we demonstrate that predictions arising from a neural mass model are preserved in a lower dimensional, canonical model that is quicker to simulate. We then use this simpler model to study the emergence of seizures in artificial networks with different topologies, and calculate which nodes should be removed to render the network seizure free. We find that for scale-free and rich-club networks there exist specific nodes that are critical for seizure generation and should therefore be removed, whereas for small-world networks the strategy should instead focus on removing sufficient brain tissue. We demonstrate the validity of our approach by analysing intra-cranial EEG recordings from a database comprising 16 patients who have undergone epilepsy surgery, revealing rich-club structures within the obtained functional networks. We show that the postsurgical outcome for these patients was better when a greater proportion of the rich club was removed, in agreement with our theoretical predictions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TavGCoyBLyI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Modeling correlated noise is necessary to decode uncertainty. (arXiv:1708.04860v1 [q-bio.QM])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04860</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain decoding algorithms form an important part of the arsenal of analysis
tools available to neuroscientists, allowing for a more detailed study of the
kind of information represented in patterns of cortical activity. While most
current decoding algorithms focus on estimating a single, most likely stimulus
from the pattern of noisy fMRI responses, the presence of noise causes this
estimate to be uncertain. This uncertainty in stimulus estimates is a
potentially highly relevant aspect of cortical stimulus processing, and
features prominently in Bayesian or probabilistic models of neural coding.
Here, we focus on sensory uncertainty and how best to extract this information
with fMRI. We first demonstrate in simulations that decoding algorithms that
take into account correlated noise between fMRI voxels better recover the
amount of uncertainty (quantified as the width of a probability distribution
over possible stimuli) associated with the decoded estimate. Furthermore, we
show that not all correlated variability should be treated equally, as modeling
tuning-dependent correlations has the greatest impact on decoding performance.
Next, we examine actual noise correlations in human visual cortex, and find
that shared variability in areas V1-V3 depends on the tuning properties of fMRI
voxels. In line with our simulations, accounting for this shared noise between
similarly tuned voxels produces important benefits in decoding. Our findings
underscore the importance of accurate noise models in fMRI decoding approaches,
and suggest a statistically feasible method to incorporate the most relevant
forms of shared noise.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Guiding Network Analysis using Graph Slepians: An Illustration for the C. Elegans Connectome. (arXiv:1708.04657v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04657</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04657</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spectral approaches of network analysis heavily rely upon the
eigendecomposition of the graph Laplacian. For instance, in graph signal
processing, the Laplacian eigendecomposition is used to define the graph
Fourier transform and then transpose signal processing operations to graphs by
implementing them in the spectral domain. Here, we build on recent work that
generalized Slepian functions to the graph setting. In particular, graph
Slepians are band-limited graph signals with maximal energy concentration in a
given subgraph. We show how this approach can be used to guide network
analysis; i.e., we propose a visualization that reveals network organization of
a subgraph, but while striking a balance with global network structure. These
developments are illustrated for the structural connectome of the C. Elegans.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Effect of Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity on Stochastic Burst Synchronization in A Scale-Free Neuronal Network. (arXiv:1708.04543v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We consider an excitatory population of subthreshold Izhikevich neurons which
cannot fire spontaneously without noise. As the coupling strength passes a
threshold, individual neurons exhibit noise-induced burstings. This neuronal
population has adaptive dynamic synaptic strengths governed by the
spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). In the absence of STDP, stochastic
burst synchronization (SBS) between noise-induced burstings of subthreshold
neurons was previously found to occur over a large range of intermediate noise
intensities. Here, we study the effect of additive STDP on the SBS by varying
the noise intensity $D$ in the Barab\'asi-Albert scale-free network (SFN) for
the case of symmetric preferential attachment. This type of SFN exhibits a
power-law degree distribution, and hence it becomes an inhomogeneous one with a
few &quot;hubs&quot; (i.e., super-connected nodes). Occurrence of a &quot;Matthew&quot; effect in
synaptic plasticity is found to occur due to a positive feedback process. Good
burst synchronization gets better via long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic
strengths, while bad burst synchronization gets worse via long-term depression
(LTD). Consequently, a step-like rapid transition to SBS occurs by changing
$D$, in contrast to a relatively smooth transition in the absence of STDP. In
the presence of additive STDP, we also investigate the effects of network
architecture on the SBS for a fixed $D$. Emergences of LTP and LTD of synaptic
strengths are investigated in details via microscopic studies based on both the
distributions of time delays between the burst onset times of the pre- and the
post-synaptic neurons and the pair-correlations between the pre- and the
post-synaptic IIBRs (instantaneous individual burst rates). Finally, a
multiplicative STDP case (depending on states) is also investigated in
comparison with the additive STDP case (independent of states).

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Balanced Information Storage and Transfer in Modular Spiking Neural Networks. (arXiv:1708.04392v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;While information processing in complex systems can be described in abstract,
general terms, there are cases in which the relation between these computations
and the physical substrate of the underlying system is itself of interest.
Prominently, the brain is one such case. With the aim of relating information
and dynamics in biological neural systems, we study a model network of spiking
neurons with different coupling configurations, and explore the relation
between its informational, dynamical, and topological properties. We find that
information transfer and storage peak at two separate points for different
values of the coupling parameter, and are balanced at an intermediate point. In
this configuration, avalanches in the network follow a long-tailed, power
law-like distribution. Furthermore, the avalanche statistics at this point
reproduce empirical findings in the biological brain.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Encoding Multi-Resolution Brain Networks Using Unsupervised Deep Learning. (arXiv:1708.04232v1 [stat.ML])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The main goal of this study is to extract a set of brain networks in multiple
time-resolutions to analyze the connectivity patterns among the anatomic
regions for a given cognitive task. We suggest a deep architecture which learns
the natural groupings of the connectivity patterns of human brain in multiple
time-resolutions. The suggested architecture is tested on task data set of
Human Connectome Project (HCP) where we extract multi-resolution networks, each
of which corresponds to a cognitive task. At the first level of this
architecture, we decompose the fMRI signal into multiple sub-bands using
wavelet decompositions. At the second level, for each sub-band, we estimate a
brain network extracted from short time windows of the fMRI signal. At the
third level, we feed the adjacency matrices of each mesh network at each
time-resolution into an unsupervised deep learning algorithm, namely, a Stacked
De- noising Auto-Encoder (SDAE). The outputs of the SDAE provide a compact
connectivity representation for each time window at each sub-band of the fMRI
signal. We concatenate the learned representations of all sub-bands at each
window and cluster them by a hierarchical algorithm to find the natural
groupings among the windows. We observe that each cluster represents a
cognitive task with a performance of 93% Rand Index and 71% Adjusted Rand
Index. We visualize the mean values and the precisions of the networks at each
component of the cluster mixture. The mean brain networks at cluster centers
show the variations among cognitive tasks and the precision of each cluster
shows the within cluster variability of networks, across the subjects.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Multiscale modeling via split-step methods in neural firing. (arXiv:1611.00509v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal models based on the Hodgkin-Huxley equation form a fundamental
framework in the field of computational neuroscience. While the neuronal state
is often modeled deterministically, experimental recordings show stochastic
fluctuations, presumably driven by molecular noise from the underlying
microphysical conditions. In turn, the firing of individual neurons gives rise
to an electric field n extracellular space, also thought to affect the firing
pattern of nearby neurons.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We develop a multiscale model which combines a stochastic ion channel gating
process taking place on the neuronal membrane, together with the propagation of
an action potential along the neuronal structure. We also devise a numerical
method relying on a split-step strategy which effectively couples these two
processes and we experimentally test the feasibility of this approach. We
finally also explain how the approach can be extended with Maxwell's equations
to allow the potential to be propagated in extracellular space.

	<description>In physiological conditions, adult neurons have low intracellular Cl− [(Cl−)I] levels underlying the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic inhibitory drive. In contrast, neurons have high (Cl−)I levels and excitatory GABA actions in a wide range of pathological conditions including spinal cord lesions, chronic pain, brain trauma, cerebrovascular infarcts, autism, Rett and Down syndrome, various types of epilepsies, and other genetic or environmental insults. The diuretic highly specific NKCC1 chloride importer antagonist bumetanide (PubChem CID: 2461) efficiently restores low (Cl−)I levels and attenuates many disorders in experimental conditions and in some clinical trials.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: MicroRNA-137 and -195* inhibit vasculogenesis in brain arteriovenous malformations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25015</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25015</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objectives&lt;/b&gt;: Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are the most common cause of non-traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage in young adults. The genesis of brain AVM remains enigmatic. We investigated microRNA (miRNA) expression and its contribution to the pathogenesis of brain AVMs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We used a large-scale miRNA analysis on 16 samples including AVMs, hemangioblastoma, and controls to identify a distinct AVM miRNA signature. AVM smooth muscle cells (AVMSMCs) were isolated and identified by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry and candidate miRNAs were then tested in these cells. Migration, tube formation, and CCK-8-induced proliferation assays were used to test the miRNAs effect on phenotypic properties of AVMSMCs. A quantitative proteomics approach was used to identify protein expression changes in AVMSMCs treated with miRNA mimics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: A distinct AVM miRNA signature comprising a large portion of lowly expressed miRNAs was identified. Among these miRNAs, miR-137 and miR-195* levels were significantly decreased in AVMs and constituent AVMSMCs. Experimentally elevating the level of these microRNAs inhibited AVMSMC migration, tube formation and survival in vitro and the formation of vascular rings &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. Proteomics showed the protein expression signature of AVMSMCs and identified downstream proteins regulated by miR-137 and miR-195* which were key signaling proteins involved in vessel development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Our results indicate that miR-137 and miR-195* act as vasculogenic suppressors in AVMs by altering phenotypic properties of AVMSMCs, and that the absence of miR-137 and miR-195* expression leads to abnormal vasculogenesis.

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Seizing Control of KCC2: A New Therapeutic Target for Epilepsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30123-6?rss=yes</guid>

	<description>Deficits in GABAergic inhibition result in the abnormal neuronal activation and synchronization that underlies seizures. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for transforming a normal brain into an epileptic one remain largely unknown. Hyperpolarizing inhibition mediated by type A GABA (GABAA) receptors is dependent on chloride extrusion by the neuron-specific type 2K+–Cl− cotransporter (KCC2). Loss-of-function mutations in KCC2 are a known cause of infantile epilepsy in humans and KCC2 dysfunction is present in patients with both idiopathic and acquired epilepsy.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Neurons have diverse molecular, morphological, connectional and functional properties. We believe that the only realistic way to manage this complexity — and thereby pave the way for understanding the structure, function and development of brain circuits — is to group neurons into types, which can &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly used antidepressants; however, their mechanism of action is elusive. The authors here show that activation of serotonin 5-HT1B receptors on cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons (CCK neurons) in the dentate gyrus underlies the effects of acute SSRI treatment on &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neuronal loss is a hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD), but the mechanisms through which the neurons die are unclear. Here, the authors described evidence for the activation of necroptosis — a programmed form of necrosis that has been implicated in multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functional connectivity analyses of group data have revealed several large-scale distributed brain networks, including the default network (DN), frontoparietal control network (FPN) and dorsal attention network (dATN); however, few studies have examined network organization within individual subjects. The authors performed multiple functional MRI scans in &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neuropathic pain is a common adverse effect of chemotherapeutic agents, such as oxaliplatin. The authors here showed that antibiotic-mediated eradication of the gut microbiota protects mice against both oxaliplatin-induced inflammation in the dorsal root ganglia and mechanical hyperalgesia. The permissive effect of the gut microbiota &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The likelihood of winning a bout of competitive behaviour is increased by past wins, and the neural circuitry underlying this crucial determinant of social rank in a group of mice is identified as a projection from the mediodorsal thalamus to the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Acute or Chronic? A Stressful Question</title>

	<description>Stress is a primary risk factor for neuropsychiatric disorders; at times, even a single trauma can trigger psychopathology. Many rodent models of neuropsychiatric disorders use chronic stress, measuring readouts at the end of long protocols. In a way, traditional chronic models overlook a crucial question: how does the physiological response to stressor(s) turn into a maladaptive pathway that may verge towards psychopathology? Recent evidence suggests that studying the long-term consequences of acute stress would provide critical information on the role of stress in psychopathology.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Loss of inhibition in a circuit in the primary somatosensory cortex that controls the activity of layer 5 neurons drives pain hypersensitivity. Restoring this inhibition resets the inhibitory–excitatory balance, producing analgesia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effectiveness of EGFR treatment is impaired through an early adaptive response. TNF–JNK–Axl–ERK signaling contributes to this primary resistance to EGFR inhibition and might serve as novel target to improve EGFR inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Astroglial Versus Neuronal D-Serine: Check Your Controls!</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30125-X?rss=yes</guid>
	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30125-X?rss=yes</link>
	<description>As we recently reviewed [1], studies from at least six laboratories now indicate that neurons rather than astrocytes are the major sources for D-serine and preferentially express its synthetic enzyme, serine racemase (SR), in the normal brain [1]. We described how several unforeseen artifacts misled established scientists (including ourselves) into believing that serine racemase and D-serine are localized exclusively to astrocytes and represent prima face exemplars of gliotransmission. We were concerned that the purported astrocytic source of D-serine was being perpetuated to this day, despite compelling evidence to the contrary published over the past decade [1].</description>
