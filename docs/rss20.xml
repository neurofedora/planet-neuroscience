	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Mechanistic modeling of light-induced chemotactic infiltration of bacteria into leaf stomata</title>

Light is one of the factors that can play a role in bacterial infiltration into leafy greens by keeping stomata open and providing photosynthetic products for microorganisms. We model chemotactic transport of bacteria within a leaf tissue in response to photosynthesis occurring within plant mesophyll. The model includes transport of carbon dioxide, oxygen, bicarbonate, sucrose/glucose, bacteria, and autoinducer-2 within the leaf tissue. Biological processes of carbon fixation in chloroplasts, and respiration in mitochondria of the plant cells, as well as motility, chemotaxis, nutrient consumption and communication in the bacterial community are considered. We show that presence of light is enough to boost bacterial chemotaxis through the stomatal opening and toward photosynthetic products within the leaf tissue. Bacterial chemotactic ability is a major player in infiltration, and plant stomatal defense in closing the stomata as a perception of microbe-associated molecular patterns is an effective way to inhibit the infiltration.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TYKo3FA9LpI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Autonomous emergence of connectivity assemblies via spike triplet interactions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007835</guid>

Non-random connectivity can emerge without structured external input driven by activity-dependent mechanisms of synaptic plasticity based on precise spiking patterns. Here we analyze the emergence of global structures in recurrent networks based on a triplet model of spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) which depends on the interactions of three precisely-timed spikes and can describe plasticity experiments with varying spike frequency better than the classical pair-based STDP rule. We derive synaptic changes arising from correlations up to third-order and describe them as the sum of structural motifs which determine how any spike in the network influences a given synaptic connection through possible connectivity paths. This motif expansion framework reveals novel structural motifs under the triplet STDP rule, which support the formation of bidirectional connections and ultimately the spontaneous emergence of global network structure in the form of self-connected groups of neurons, or assemblies. We propose that under triplet STDP assembly structure can emerge without the need for externally patterned inputs or assuming a symmetric pair-based STDP rule common in previous studies. The emergence of non-random network structure under triplet STDP occurs through internally-generated higher-order correlations, which are ubiquitous in natural stimuli and neuronal spiking activity, and important for coding. We further demonstrate how neuromodulatory mechanisms that modulate the shape of the triplet STDP rule or the synaptic transmission function differentially promote structural motifs underlying the emergence of assemblies, and quantify the differences using graph theoretic measures.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kXUhjNXvt2A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: Aging But Not Age-Related Hearing Loss Dominates the Decrease of Parvalbumin Immunoreactivity in the Primary Auditory Cortex of Mice</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Alterations in inhibitory circuits of the primary auditory cortex (pAC) have been shown to be an aspect of aging and age-related hearing loss (AHL). Several studies reported a decline in parvalbumin (PV) immunoreactivity in aged rodent pAC of animals displaying AHL and conclude a relationship between reduced sensitivity and declined PV immunoreactivity. However, it remains elusive whether AHL or a general molecular aging is causative for decreased PV immunoreactivity. In this study, we aimed to disentangle the effects of AHL and general aging on PV immunoreactivity patterns in inhibitory interneurons of mouse pAC. We compared young and old animals of a mouse line with AHL (C57BL/6) and a mutant (C57B6.CAST-&lt;i&gt;Cdh23&lt;sup&gt;Ahl+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) that is not vulnerable to AHL according to their hearing status by measuring auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and by an immunohistochemical evaluation of the PV immunoreactivity patterns in two dimensions (rostro-caudal and layer) in the pAC. Although AHL could be confirmed by ABR measurements for the C57BL/6 mice, both aged strains showed a similar reduction of PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; positive interneurons in both, number and density. The pattern of reduction across the rostro-caudal axis and across cortical layers was similar for both aged lines. Our results demonstrate that a reduced PV immunoreactivity is a sign of general, molecular aging and not related to AHL.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: Shunting Inhibition Improves Synchronization in Heterogeneous Inhibitory Interneuronal Networks with Type 1 Excitability Whereas Hyperpolarizing Inhibition Is Better for Type 2 Excitability</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;All-to-all homogeneous networks of inhibitory neurons synchronize completely under the right conditions; however, many modeling studies have shown that biological levels of heterogeneity disrupt synchrony. Our fundamental scientific question is &quot;how can neurons maintain partial synchrony in the presence of heterogeneity and noise?&quot; A particular subset of strongly interconnected interneurons, the PV+ fast-spiking (FS) basket neurons, are strongly implicated in  oscillations and in phase locking of nested  oscillations to theta. Their excitability type apparently varies between brain regions: in CA1 and the dentate gyrus they have type 1 excitability, meaning that they can fire arbitrarily slowly, whereas in the striatum and cortex they have type 2 excitability, meaning that there is a frequency thresh old below which they cannot sustain repetitive firing. We constrained the models to study the effect of excitability type (more precisely bifurcation type) in isolation from all other factors. We use sparsely connected, heterogeneous, noisy networks with synaptic delays to show that synchronization properties, namely the resistance to suppression and the strength of theta phase to  amplitude coupling, are strongly dependent on the pairing of excitability type with the type of inhibition. Shunting inhibition performs better for type 1 and hyperpolarizing inhibition for type 2.  Oscillations and their nesting within theta oscillations are thought to subserve cognitive functions like memory encoding and recall; therefore, it is important to understand the contribution of intrinsic properties to these rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Negative correlation between grey matter in the hippocampus and caudate nucleus in healthy aging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23210?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurobiological changes that occur with aging include a reduction in function and volume of the hippocampus. These changes were associated with corresponding memory deficits in navigation tasks. However, navigation can involve different strategies that are dependent on the hippocampus and caudate nucleus. The proportion of people using hippocampus‐dependent spatial strategies decreases across the lifespan. As such, the decrease in spatial strategies, and corresponding increase in caudate nucleus‐dependent response strategies with age, may play a role in the observed neurobiological changes in the hippocampus. Furthermore, we previously showed a negative correlation between grey matter in the hippocampus and caudate nucleus/striatum in mice, young adults, and in individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. As such, we hypothesized that this negative relationship between the two structures would be present during normal aging. The aim of the current study was to investigate this gap in the literature by studying the relationship between grey matter in the hippocampus and caudate nucleus of the striatum, in relation to each other and to navigation strategies, during healthy aging. Healthy older adults (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 39) were tested on the Concurrent Spatial Discrimination Learning Task (CSDLT), a virtual radial task that dissociates between spatial and response strategies. A regression of strategies against structural MRIs showed for the first time in older adults that the response strategy was associated with higher amounts of grey matter in the caudate nucleus. As expected, the spatial strategy correlated with grey matter in the hippocampus, which was negatively correlated with grey matter in the caudate nucleus. Interestingly, a sex difference emerged showing that among older adult response learners, women have the least amount of grey matter in the hippocampus, which is a known risk for Alzheimer's disease. This difference was absent among spatial learners. These results are discussed in the context of the putative protective role of spatial memory against grey matter loss in the hippocampus, especially in women.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: SARS‐CoV‐2 and Multiple Sclerosis: Not all immune depleting DMTs are equal or bad</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25770?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A major concern during the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) pandemic&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is the use of immunosuppressive therapies for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) due to an increased risk of contracting SARS‐CoV‐2 and more severe disease. The Society of Italian Neurologists (SIN) and the Association of British Neurologists (ABN) MS and Neuroimmunology Advisory Group published guidance for the use of current disease modifying treatments (DMTs) in MS (Table 1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. However, taking into account, less conservative viewpoints&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, the emerging knowledge of the biology of SARS‐CoV‐2, and in particular the role of the immune mechanisms contributing to the disease, we propose modification of these guidelines since it is not clear that immunosuppression is indeed detrimental in people with MS infected with SARS‐CoV‐2. We are thus proposing a more nuanced approach and that the categories of DMTs should be modified based on scientific principles and the biology of severe COVID‐19 (Table 2).&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Unsupervised learning of hidden representations has been one of the most
vibrant research directions in machine learning in recent years. In this work
we study the brain-like Bayesian Confidence Propagating Neural Network (BCPNN)
model, recently extended to extract sparse distributed high-dimensional
representations. The saliency and separability of the hidden representations
when trained on MNIST dataset is studied using an external classifier, and
compared with other unsupervised learning methods that include restricted
Boltzmann machines and autoencoders.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurons modeled by the Rulkov map display a variety of dynamic regimes that
include tonic spikes and chaotic bursting. Here we study an ensemble of
bursting neurons coupled with the Watts-Strogatz small-world topology. We
characterize the sequences of bursts using the symbolic method of time-series
analysis known as ordinal analysis, which detects nonlinear temporal
correlations. We show that the probabilities of the different symbols
distinguish different dynamical regimes, which depend on the coupling strength
and the network topology. These regimes have different spatio-temporal
properties that can be visualized with raster plots.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: WSMN: An optimized multipurpose blind watermarking in Shearlet domain using MLP and NSGA-II. (arXiv:2005.03382v1 [cs.CR])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03382</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03382</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Digital watermarking is a remarkable issue in the field of information
security to avoid the misuse of images in multimedia networks. Although access
to unauthorized persons can be prevented through cryptography, it cannot be
simultaneously used for copyright protection or content authentication with the
preservation of image integrity. Hence, this paper presents an optimized
multipurpose blind watermarking in Shearlet domain with the help of smart
algorithms including MLP and NSGA-II. In this method, four copies of the robust
copyright logo are embedded in the approximate coefficients of Shearlet by
using an effective quantization technique. Furthermore, an embedded random
sequence as a semi-fragile authentication mark is effectively extracted from
details by the neural network. Due to performing an effective optimization
algorithm for selecting optimum embedding thresholds, and also distinguishing
the texture of blocks, the imperceptibility and robustness have been preserved.
The experimental results reveal the superiority of the scheme with regard to
the quality of watermarked images and robustness against hybrid attacks over
other state-of-the-art schemes. The average PSNR and SSIM of the dual
watermarked images are 38 dB and 0.95, respectively; Besides, it can
effectively extract the copyright logo and locates forgery regions under severe
attacks with satisfactory accuracy.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Constructing Accurate and Efficient Deep Spiking Neural Networks with Double-threshold and Augmented Schemes. (arXiv:2005.03231v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03231</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03231</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are considered as a potential candidate to
overcome current challenges such as the high-power consumption encountered by
artificial neural networks (ANNs), however there is still a gap between them
with respect to the recognition accuracy on practical tasks. A conversion
strategy was thus introduced recently to bridge this gap by mapping a trained
ANN to an SNN. However, it is still unclear that to what extent this obtained
SNN can benefit both the accuracy advantage from ANN and high efficiency from
the spike-based paradigm of computation. In this paper, we propose two new
conversion methods, namely TerMapping and AugMapping. The TerMapping is a
straightforward extension of a typical threshold-balancing method with a
double-threshold scheme, while the AugMapping additionally incorporates a new
scheme of augmented spike that employs a spike coefficient to carry the number
of typical all-or-nothing spikes occurring at a time step. We examine the
performance of our methods based on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets.
The results show that the proposed double-threshold scheme can effectively
improve accuracies of the converted SNNs. More importantly, the proposed
AugMapping is more advantageous for constructing accurate, fast and efficient
deep SNNs as compared to other state-of-the-art approaches. Our study therefore
provides new approaches for further integration of advanced techniques in ANNs
to improve the performance of SNNs, which could be of great merit to applied
developments with spike-based neuromorphic computing.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Evolutionary Multi Objective Optimization Algorithm for Community Detection in Complex Social Networks. (arXiv:2005.03181v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03181</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03181</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Most optimization-based community detection approaches formulate the problem
in a single or bi-objective framework. In this paper, we propose two variants
of a three-objective formulation using a customized non-dominated sorting
genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III) to find community structures in a network. In
the first variant, named NSGA-III-KRM, we considered Kernel k means, Ratio cut,
and Modularity, as the three objectives, whereas the second variant, named
NSGA-III-CCM, considers Community score, Community fitness and Modularity, as
three objective functions. Experiments are conducted on four benchmark network
datasets. Comparison with state-of-the-art approaches along with
decomposition-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm variants (MOEA/D-KRM
and MOEA/D-CCM) indicates that the proposed variants yield comparable or better
results. This is particularly significant because the addition of the third
objective does not worsen the results of the other two objectives. We also
propose a simple method to rank the Pareto solutions so obtained by proposing a
new measure, namely the ratio of the hyper-volume and inverted generational
distance (IGD). The higher the ratio, the better is the Pareto set. This
strategy is particularly useful in the absence of empirical attainment function
in the multi-objective framework, where the number of objectives is more than
two.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Functional compensation after lesions: Predicting site and extent of recovery. (arXiv:2005.03093v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In some cases, the function of a lesioned area can be compensated for by
another area. However, it remains unpredictable if and by which other area a
lesion can be compensated. We assume that similar incoming and outgoing
connections are necessary to encode the same function as the damaged region.
The similarity can be measured both locally using the matching index and
looking at a more global scale by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS).
We tested how well both measures can predict the compensating area for the loss
of the visual cortex in kittens. For this case study, the global comparison of
connectivity turns out to be a better method for predicting functional
compensation. In future studies, the extent of the similarity between the
lesioned and compensating regions might be a measure of the extent to which
function can be successfully recovered.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: A Multifactorial Optimization Paradigm for Linkage Tree Genetic Algorithm. (arXiv:2005.03090v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03090</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03090</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Linkage Tree Genetic Algorithm (LTGA) is an effective Evolutionary Algorithm
(EA) to solve complex problems using the linkage information between problem
variables. LTGA performs well in various kinds of single-task optimization and
yields promising results in comparison with the canonical genetic algorithm.
However, LTGA is an unsuitable method for dealing with multi-task optimization
problems. On the other hand, Multifactorial Optimization (MFO) can
simultaneously solve independent optimization problems, which are encoded in a
unified representation to take advantage of the process of knowledge transfer.
In this paper, we introduce Multifactorial Linkage Tree Genetic Algorithm
(MF-LTGA) by combining the main features of both LTGA and MFO. MF-LTGA is able
to tackle multiple optimization tasks at the same time, each task learns the
dependency between problem variables from the shared representation. This
knowledge serves to determine the high-quality partial solutions for supporting
other tasks in exploring the search space. Moreover, MF-LTGA speeds up
convergence because of knowledge transfer of relevant problems. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on two benchmark problems:
Clustered Shortest-Path Tree Problem and Deceptive Trap Function. In comparison
to LTGA and existing methods, MF-LTGA outperforms in quality of the solution or
in computation time.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Prediction of Event Related Potential Speller Performance Using Resting-State EEG. (arXiv:2005.01325v3 [cs.HC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01325</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01325</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Event-related potential (ERP) speller can be utilized in device control and
communication for locked-in or severely injured patients. However, problems
such as inter-subject performance instability and ERP-illiteracy are still
unresolved. Therefore, it is necessary to predict classification performance
before performing an ERP speller in order to use it efficiently. In this study,
we investigated the correlations with ERP speller performance using a
resting-state before an ERP speller. In specific, we used spectral power and
functional connectivity according to four brain regions and five frequency
bands. As a result, the delta power in the frontal region and functional
connectivity in the delta, alpha, gamma bands are significantly correlated with
the ERP speller performance. Also, we predicted the ERP speller performance
using EEG features in the resting-state. These findings may contribute to
investigating the ERP-illiteracy and considering the appropriate alternatives
for each user.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13462</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hearing is often believed to be more sensitive than touch. This assertion is
based on a comparison of sensitivities to weak stimuli. The respective stimuli,
however, are not easily comparable since hearing is gauged using acoustic
pressure and touch using skin displacement. We show that under reasonable
assumptions the auditory and tactile detection thresholds can be reconciled on
a level playing field. The results indicate that the capacity of touch and
hearing to detect weak stimuli varies according to the size of a sensed object
as well as to the frequency of its oscillations. In particular, touch is found
to be more effective than hearing at detecting small and slow objects.

	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09874</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09874</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The recent spreading of coronavirus made many countries impose restrictions
in order to control its dangerous effect on the citizens. We developed a
theoretical dynamical model based on compartmental SIR system with additional
adjustment taken from Flow network and Markov chain frameworks to illustrate
developments and trends based on publicly available data. Based on this Model,
code in R was written and fed by stamped publicly available data from
authorized governmental websites in Spain and in the Nederlands, to compare
trends. Our results show that the 'peak' of infection is already behind us in
both countries, but also demonstrate that there is a danger of rebound of a
spread. It is obvious that measures imposed are giving the results, but we
should be precarious of near future practices and developments since the
majority of population will still be without immunity.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Perspective on the Multiple Pathways to Changing Brain States</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00023</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00023</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this review article, we highlight several disparate ideas that are linked to changes in brain state (i.e., sleep to arousal, Down to Up, synchronized to de-synchronized). In any discussion of the brain state, we propose that the cortical pyramidal neuron has a central position. EEG recordings, which typically assess brain state, predominantly reflect the activity of cortical pyramidal neurons. This means that the dominant rhythmic activity that characterizes a particular brain state ultimately has to manifest globally across the pyramidal neuron population. During state transitions, it is the long-range connectivity of these neurons that broadcast the resultant changes in activity to many subcortical targets. Structures like the thalamus, brainstem/hypothalamic neuromodulatory systems, and respiratory systems can also strongly influence brain state, and for many decades we have been uncovering bidirectional pathways that link these structures to state changes in the cerebral cortex. More recently, movement and active behaviors have emerged as powerful drivers of state changes. Each of these systems involve different circuits distributed across the brain. Yet, for a system-wide change in brain state, there must be a collaboration between these circuits that reflects and perhaps triggers the transition between brain states. As we expand our understanding of how brain state changes, our current challenge is to understand how these diverse sets of circuits and pathways interact to produce the changes observed in cortical pyramidal neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Up and Down States and Memory Consolidation Across Somatosensory, Entorhinal, and Hippocampal Cortices</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the course of a day, brain states fluctuate, from conscious awake information-acquiring states to sleep states, during which previously acquired information is further processed and stored as memories. One hypothesis is that memories are consolidated and stored during “offline” states such as sleep, a process thought to involve transfer of information from the hippocampus to other cortical areas. Up and Down states (UDS), patterns of activity that occur under anesthesia and sleep states, are likely to play a role in this process, although the nature of this role remains unclear. Here we review what is currently known about these mechanisms in three anatomically distinct but interconnected cortical areas: somatosensory cortex, entorhinal cortex, and the hippocampus. In doing so, we consider the role of this activity in the coordination of “replay” during sleep states, particularly during hippocampal sharp-wave ripples. We conclude that understanding the generation and propagation of UDS may provide key insights into the cortico-hippocampal dialogue linking archi- and neocortical areas during memory formation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Progesterone and Allopregnanolone Rapidly Attenuate Estrogen-Associated Mechanical Allodynia in Rats with Persistent Temporomandibular Joint Inflammation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00026</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD) is associated with pain in the joint (temporomandibular joint, TMJ) and muscles involved in mastication. TMD pain dissipates following menopause but returns in some women undergoing estrogen replacement therapy. Progesterone has both anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive properties, while estrogen’s effects on nociception are variable and highly dependent on both natural hormone fluctuations and estrogen dosage during pharmacological treatments, with high doses increasing pain. Allopregnanolone, a progesterone metabolite and positive allosteric modulator of the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor, also has antinociceptive properties. While progesterone and allopregnanolone are antinociceptive, their effect on estrogen-exacerbated TMD pain has not been determined. We hypothesized that removing the source of endogenous ovarian hormones would reduce inflammatory allodynia in the TMJ of rats and both progesterone and allopregnanolone would attenuate the estrogen-provoked return of allodynia. Baseline mechanical sensitivity was measured in female Sprague–Dawley rats (150–175 g) using the von Frey filament method followed by a unilateral injection of complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) into the TMJ. Mechanical allodynia was confirmed 24 h later; then rats were ovariectomized or received sham surgery. Two weeks later, allodynia was reassessed and rats received one of the following subcutaneous hormone treatments over 5 days: a daily pharmacological dose of estradiol benzoate (E2; 50 μg/kg), daily E2 and pharmacological to sub-physiological doses of progesterone (P4; 16 mg/kg, 16 μg/kg, or 16 ng/kg), E2 daily and interrupted P4 given every other day, daily P4, or daily vehicle control. A separate group of animals received allopregnanolone (0.16 mg/kg) instead of P4. Allodynia was reassessed 1 h following injections. Here, we report that CFA-evoked mechanical allodynia was attenuated following ovariectomy and daily high E2 treatment triggered the return of allodynia, which was rapidly attenuated when P4 was also administered either daily or every other day. Allopregnanolone treatment, whether daily or every other day, also attenuated estrogen-exacerbated allodynia within 1 h of treatment, but only on the first treatment day. These data indicate that when gonadal hormone levels have diminished, treatment with a lower dose of progesterone may be effective at rapidly reducing the estrogen-evoked recurrence of inflammatory mechanical allodynia in the TMJ.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurogenesis: Differential Proliferation and Maturation of Subcortical Astrocytes During Postnatal Development</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00435</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes exhibit a region-dependent molecular and functional heterogeneity in the CNS. Although cortical astrocytes proliferate robustly during the first postnatal week and become proliferation quiescent, the temporal proliferation dynamics of astrocytes in subcortical regions during postnatal development remain essentially unknown. Whether subcortical astrocytes mature similarly to cortical astrocytes is also unexplored. In this current study, we examined proliferation of subcortical, especially hypothalamic, astrocytes during postnatal development using genetic labeling of astrocytes and pulse-chase EdU labeling of proliferating cells. While a lower number of proliferating astrocytes was found in the hypothalamus compared to cortex during the first postnatal week, astrocyte proliferation is much more active in hypothalamus than in cortex from P15 to P30 in both proliferating astrocyte density and percentage, indicating a persistent and distinct proliferation pattern of astrocytes in hypothalamus. This observation is further confirmed by Ki67 immunostaining with genetically or immunolabeled astrocytes in hypothalamus and cortex during P15–30. In addition, astrocytes in representative subcortical regions have a modest growth of their domain size and exhibit a significantly smaller domain size compared to cortical astrocytes at P30 when astrocytes have generally completed postnatal maturation. However, the expression of astrocyte-derived Sparc, an important synaptogenic inhibitor, is consistently higher in hypothalamic astrocytes than in cortical astrocytes throughout postnatal development. In summary, our study unveiled a distinct proliferation and maturation pattern of subcortical, especially hypothalamic, astrocytes during postnatal development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Toward Establishing Internal Validity for Correlated Gene Expression Measures in Imaging Genomics of Functional Networks: Why Distance Corrections and External Face Validity Alone Fall Short. Reply to “Distance Is Not Everything in Imaging Genomics of Functional Networks: Reply to a Commentary on Correlated Gene Expression Supports Synchronous Activity in Brain Networks”</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The primary claim of the Richiardi et al. (2015) Science article is that a measure of correlated gene expression, significant strength fraction (SSF), is related to resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) networks. However, there is still debate about this claim and whether spatial proximity, in the form of contiguous clusters, accounts entirely, or only partially, for SSF (Pantazatos and Li, 2017; Richiardi et al., 2017). Here, 13 distributed networks were simulated by combining 34 contiguous clusters randomly placed throughout cortex, with resulting edge distance distributions similar to rsfMRI networks. Cluster size was modulated (6–15 mm radius) to test its influence on SSF false positive rate (SSF-FPR) among the simulated “noise” networks. The contribution of rsfMRI networks on SSF-FPR was examined by comparing simulated networks whose clusters were sampled from: (1) all 1,777 cortical tissue samples, (2) all samples, but with non-rsfMRI cluster centers, and (3) only 1,276 non-rsfMRI samples. Results show that SSF-FPR is influenced only by cluster size (r &amp;gt; 0.9, p &amp;lt; 0.001), not by rsfMRI samples. Simulations using 14 mm radius clusters most resembled rsfMRI networks. When thresholding at p &amp;lt; 10&lt;sup&gt;–4&lt;/sup&gt;, the SSF-FPR was 0.47. Genes that maximize SF have high global spatial autocorrelation. In conclusion, SSF is unrelated to rsfMRI networks. The main conclusion of Richiardi et al. (2015) is based on a finding that is ∼50% likely to be a false positive, not &amp;lt;0.01% as originally reported in the article (Richiardi et al., 2015). We discuss why distance corrections alone and external face validity are insufficient to establish a trustworthy relationship between correlated gene expression measures and rsfMRI networks, and propose more rigorous approaches to preclude common pitfalls in related studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Attentional Processes in Children With Attentional Problems or Reading Difficulties as Revealed Using Brain Event-Related Potentials and Their Source Localization</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Visual attention-related processes include three functional sub-processes: alerting, orienting, and inhibition. We examined these sub-processes using reaction times, event-related potentials (ERPs), and their neuronal source activations during the Attention Network Test (ANT) in control children, attentional problems (AP) children, and reading difficulties (RD) children. During the ANT, electroencephalography was measured using 128 electrodes on three groups of Finnish sixth-graders aged 12–13 years (control = 77; AP = 15; RD = 23). Participants were asked to detect the direction of a middle target fish within a group of five fish. The target stimulus was either preceded by a cue (center, double, or spatial), or without a cue, to manipulate the alerting and orienting sub-processes of attention. The direction of the target fish was either congruent or incongruent in relation to the flanker fish, thereby manipulating the inhibition sub-processes of attention. Reaction time performance showed no differences between groups in alerting, orienting, and inhibition effects. The group differences in ERPs were only found at the source level. Neuronal source analysis in the AP children revealed a larger alerting effect (double-cued vs. non-cued target stimuli) than control and RD children in the left occipital lobe. Control children showed a smaller orienting effect (spatially cued vs. center-cued target stimuli) in the left occipital lobe than AP and RD children. No group differences were found for the neuronal sources related to the inhibition effect. The neuronal activity differences related to sub-processes of attention in the AP and RD groups suggest different underlying mechanisms for attentional and reading problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Effect of External Force on Agency in Physical Human-Machine Interaction</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the advent of intelligent robotic tools for physically assisting humans, user experience, and intuitiveness in particular have become important features for control designs. However, existing works predominantly focus on performance-related measures for evaluating control systems as the subjective experience of a user by large cannot be directly observed. In this study, we therefore focus on agency-related interactions between control and embodiment in the context of physical human-machine interaction. By applying an intentional binding paradigm in a virtual, machine-assisted reaching task, we evaluate how the sense of agency of able-bodied humans is modulated by assistive force characteristics of a physically coupled device. In addition to measuring how assistive force profiles influence the sense of agency with intentional binding, we analyzed the sense of agency using a questionnaire. Remarkably, our participants reported to experience stronger agency when being appropriately assisted, although they contributed less to the control task. This is substantiated by the overall consistency of intentional binding results and the self-reported sense of agency. Our results confirm the fundamental feasibility of the sense of agency to objectively evaluate the quality of human-in-the-loop control for assistive technologies. While the underlying mechanisms causing the perceptual bias observed in the intentional binding paradigm are still to be understood, we believe that this study distinctly contributes to demonstrating how the sense of agency characterizes intuitiveness of assistance in physical human-machine interaction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Exponential Time Differencing Algorithm for Pulse-Coupled Hodgkin-Huxley Neural Networks</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The exponential time differencing (ETD) method allows using a large time step to efficiently evolve stiff systems such as Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neural networks. For pulse-coupled HH networks, the synaptic spike times cannot be predetermined and are convoluted with neuron's trajectory itself. This presents a challenging issue for the design of an efficient numerical simulation algorithm. The stiffness in the HH equations are quite different, for example, between the spike and non-spike regions. Here, we design a second-order adaptive exponential time differencing algorithm (AETD2) for the numerical evolution of HH neural networks. Compared with the regular second-order Runge-Kutta method (RK2), our AETD2 method can use time steps one order of magnitude larger and improve computational efficiency more than ten times while excellently capturing accurate traces of membrane potentials of HH neurons. This high accuracy and efficiency can be robustly obtained and do not depend on the dynamical regimes, connectivity structure or the network size.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: The Photoconvertible Fluorescent Probe, CaMPARI, Labels Active Neurons in Freely-Moving Intact Adult Fruit Flies</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Linking neural circuitry to behavior by mapping active neurons in vivo is a challenge. Both genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) and intermediate early genes (IEGs) have been used to pinpoint active neurons during a stimulus or behavior but have drawbacks such as limiting the movement of the organism, requiring a priori knowledge of the active region or having poor temporal resolution. Calcium-modulated photoactivatable ratiometric integrator (CaMPARI) was engineered to overcome these spatial-temporal challenges. CaMPARI is a photoconvertible protein that only converts from green to red fluorescence in the presence of high calcium concentration and 405 nm light. This allows the experimenter to precisely mark active neurons within defined temporal windows. The photoconversion can then be quantified by taking the ratio of the red fluorescence to the green. CaMPARI promises the ability to trace active neurons during a specific stimulus; however, CaMPARI’s uses in adult Drosophila have been limited to photoconversion during fly immobilization. Here, we demonstrate a method that allows photoconversion of multiple freely-moving intact adult flies during a stimulus. Flies were placed in a dish with filter paper wet with acetic acid (pH = 2) or neutralized acetic acid (pH = 7) and exposed to photoconvertible light (60 mW) for 30 min (500 ms on, 200 ms off). Immediately following photoconversion, whole flies were fixed and imaged by confocal microscopy. The red:green ratio was quantified for the DC4 glomerulus, a bundle of neurons expressing Ir64a, an ionotropic receptor that senses acids in the Drosophila antennal lobe. Flies exposed to acetic acid showed 1.3-fold greater photoconversion than flies exposed to neutralized acetic acid. This finding was recapitulated using a more physiological stimulus of apple cider vinegar. These results indicate that CaMPARI can be used to label neurons in intact, freely-moving adult flies and will be useful for identifying the circuitry underlying complex behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;mTORopathies are a heterogeneous group of neurological disorders characterized by malformations of cortical development (MCD), enhanced cellular mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, and epilepsy that results from mutations in mTOR pathway regulatory genes. Homozygous mutations (del exon 9–13) in the pseudokinase STE20-related kinase adaptor alpha (STRAD-α; STRADA), an mTOR modulator, are associated with Pretzel Syndrome (PS), a neurodevelopmental disorder within the Old Order Mennonite Community characterized by megalencephaly, intellectual disability, and intractable epilepsy. To study the cellular mechanisms of STRADA loss, we generated CRISPR-edited Strada mouse N2a cells, a germline mouse Strada knockout (KO−/−) strain, and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons from PS individuals harboring the STRADA founder mutation. Strada KO in vitro leads to enhanced mTOR signaling and iPSC-derived neurons from PS individuals exhibit enhanced cell size and mTOR signaling activation, as well as subtle alterations in electrical firing properties e.g., increased input resistance, a more depolarized resting membrane potential, and decreased threshold for action potential (AP) generation. Strada−/− mice exhibit high rates of perinatal mortality and out of more than 100 litters yielding both WT and heterozygous pups, only eight Strada−/− animals survived past P5. Strada−/− mice are hypotonic and tremulous. Histopathological examination (n = 5 mice) revealed normal gross brain organization and lamination but all had ventriculomegaly. Ectopic neurons were seen in all five Strada−/− brains within the subcortical white matter mirroring what is observed in human PS brain tissue. These distinct experimental platforms demonstrate that STRADA modulates mTOR signaling and is a key regulator of cell size, neuronal excitability, and cortical lamination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain organoids are stem cell-based self-assembling 3D structures that recapitulate early events of human brain development. Recent improvements with patient-specific 3D brain organoids have begun to elucidate unprecedented details of the defective mechanisms that cause neurodevelopmental disorders of congenital and acquired microcephaly. In particular, brain organoids derived from primary microcephaly patients have uncovered mechanisms that deregulate neural stem cell proliferation, maintenance, and differentiation. Not only did brain organoids reveal unknown aspects of neurogenesis but also have illuminated surprising roles of cellular structures of centrosomes and primary cilia in regulating neurogenesis during brain development. Here, we discuss how brain organoids have started contributing to decoding the complexities of microcephaly, which are unlikely to be identified in the existing non-human models. Finally, we discuss the yet unresolved questions and challenges that can be addressed with the use of brain organoids as in vitro models of neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Influence of Physical Activity and Epigenomics On Cognitive Function and Brain Health in Breast Cancer</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The risk of breast cancer increases with age, with the majority of women diagnosed with breast cancer being postmenopausal. It has been estimated that 25–75% of women with breast cancer experience changes in cognitive function (CF) related to disease and treatment, which compromises psychological well-being, decision making, ability to perform daily activities, and adherence to cancer therapy. Unfortunately, the mechanisms that underlie neurocognitive changes in women with breast cancer remain poorly understood, which in turn limits the development of effective treatments and prevention strategies. Exercise has great potential as a non-pharmaceutical intervention to mitigate the decline in CF in women with breast cancer. Evidence suggests that DNA methylation, an epigenetic mechanism for gene regulation, impacts CF and brain health (BH), that exercise influences DNA methylation, and that exercise impacts CF and BH. Although investigating DNA methylation has the potential to uncover the biologic foundations for understanding neurocognitive changes within the context of breast cancer and its treatment as well as the ability to understand how exercise mitigates these changes, there is a dearth of research on this topic. The purpose of this review article is to compile the research in these areas and to recommend potential areas of opportunity for investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affect a high proportion of the elderly population with an increasing prevalence. Sleep disturbances are frequent in those with MCI and AD. This review summarizes existing research on sleep disturbances and neuroinflammation in MCI and AD. Although strong evidence supports various pathways linking sleep and AD pathology, the temporal direction of this central relationship is not yet known. Improved understanding of sleep disturbance and neuroinflammation in MCI and AD may aid in the identification of targets for their prevention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Ahmed, Priestley et al. use two-photon calcium imaging to study the role of the hippocampus for associating events separated in time. They find that CA1 does not generate persistent activity during trace fear conditioning, but task information is reflected in neural activity changes over longer timescales following learning.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The actin-modulating protein Synaptopodin mediates long-term survival of dendritic spines</title>

	<description>Large spines are stable and important for memory trace formation. The majority of large spines also contains Synaptopodin (SP), an actin-modulating and plasticity-related protein. Since SP stabilizes F-actin, we speculated that the presence of SP within large spines could explain their long lifetime. Indeed, using time-lapse 2-photon-imaging of SP-transgenic granule cells in mouse organotypic tissue cultures we found that spines containing SP survived considerably longer than spines of equal size without SP. Of note, SP-positive spines that underwent pruning first lost SP before disappearing. Whereas the survival time courses of SP-positive (SP+) spines followed conditional two-phase decay functions, SP-negative (SP-) spines and all spines of SP-deficient animals showed single exponential decays. These results implicate SP as a major regulator of long-term spine stability: SP clusters stabilize spines and the presence of SP indicates spines of high stability.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Oscillatory entrainment mechanisms and anticipatory predictive processes in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.07.083154v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Anticipating near-future events is fundamental to adaptive behavior, whereby neural processing of predictable stimuli is significantly facilitated relative to non-predictable inputs. Neural oscillations appear to be a key anticipatory mechanism by which processing of upcoming stimuli is modified, and they often entrain to rhythmic environmental sequences. Clinical and anecdotal observations have led to the hypothesis that people with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) may have deficits in generating predictions in daily life, and as such, a candidate neural mechanism may be failure to adequately entrain neural activity to repetitive environmental patterns. Here, we tested this hypothesis by interrogating rhythmic entrainment both behaviorally and electrophysiologically. We recorded high-density electroencephalography in children with ASD (n=31) and Typically Developing (TD) age- and IQ-matched controls (n=20), while they reacted to an auditory target as quickly as possible. This auditory event was either preceded by predictive rhythmic visual cues, or not. Results showed that while both groups presented highly comparable evoked responses to the visual stimuli, children with ASD showed reduced neural entrainment to the rhythmic visual cues, and altered anticipation of the occurrence of these stimuli. Further, in both groups, neuro-oscillatory phase coherence correlated with behavior. These results describe neural processes that may underlie impaired event anticipation in children with ASD, and support the notion that their perception of events is driven more by instantaneous sensory inputs and less by their temporal predictability.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Robust and accurate decoding of hand kinematics from entire spiking activity using deep learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.07.083063v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.07.083063v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Robustness and decoding accuracy remain major challenges in the clinical translation of intracortical brain-machine interface (BMI) systems. In this work, we show that a signal/decoder co-design methodology (exploiting the synergism between the input signal and decoding algorithm within the design development process) can be used to yield robust and accurate BMI decoding performance. Specifically, through applying this process, we propose the combination of using entire spiking activity (ESA) as the input signal and quasi-recurrent neural network (QRNN) based deep learning as the decoding algorithm. We evaluated the performance of ESA-driven QRNN decoder for decoding hand kinematics from neural signals chronically recorded from the primary motor cortex area of a non-human primate. Our proposed method yielded consistently higher decoding performance than any other methods previously reported across long-term recording sessions. Its high decoding performance could sustain, even when spikes were removed from the raw signals. Overall results demonstrate exceptionally high decoding accuracy and chronic robustness, which is highly desirable given it is an unresolved challenge in BMIs.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Typical and atypical language brain organization based on intrinsic connectivity and multitask functional asymmetries</title>

	<description>We applied a multitask multimodal hierarchical classification (MMHC) to 287 volunteers (150 left-handers) to establish different brain language hemispheric dominance patterns (LangDom). MMHC was based on inter- and intrahemispheric measures of the sentence core network (SENT_CORE): 1) task-induced asymmetries (ACTIV) while listening to, reading, and producing sentences compared to word lists; 2) resting-state degree connectivity (Rs_DC) and asymmetry; and 3) interhemispheric connectivity (Rs_mIHHC). Three LangDom were found, including two typical groups, one with higher (N=125) leftward ACTIV and Rs_DC asymmetries and lower Rs_mIHHC than the other (N=132). The third was an atypical group (ATYP, N=30, 25 left-handers), having rightward ACTIV during the 3 language tasks but high Rs_DC in both hemispheres and high Rs_mIHHC. ATYP LangDom relies on a left SENT_CORE wired for language by default with strong interhemispheric connections with their right SENT_CORE. This loose specialization was associated with 40% of dissociations, decreased anatomical asymmetries, and lower verbal memory.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Immunization with Mycobacterium vaccae NCTC 11659 prevents the development of PTSD- like sleep and behavioral phenotypes after sleep disruption and acute stress in mice</title>

	<description>Because regular sleep disruption can increase vulnerability to stress-related psychiatric disorders, there is a need to explore novel countermeasures to increase stress resilience after inadequate sleep. In this study, we explored the impact of 5 days of intermittent sleep disruption on vulnerability to acute social defeat stress in mice, and investigated the ability of the environmental, immunomodulatory bacterium Mycobacterium vaccae NCTC 11659 (MV) to promote stress resilience in that context. We found that mice receiving sleep disruption plus acute stress developed sleep and behavioral phenotypes that had some features of human posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) including reduced NREM delta power and increased NREM beta power in post-stress sleep EEG, persistent increases in sleep fragmentation and the REM:Sleep ratio, and behavioral changes. Importantly, immunization with heat-killed MV prevented the development of this phenotype. These results support further research into novel, microbial-based countermeasures to improve health and increase resilience to sleep disruption.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: U-shape short-range extrinsic connectivity organisation around the human central sulcus</title>

	<description>The central sulcus is probably one of the most studied folds in the human brain, owing to its clear relationship with primary sensory-motor functional areas. However, due to the difficulty of estimating the trajectories of the U-shape fibres from diffusion MRI, the short structural connectivity of this sulcus remains relatively unknown. In this context, we studied the spatial organization of these U-shape fibres along the central sulcus. Based on high quality diffusion MRI data of 100 right-handed subjects and state-of-the-art pre-processing pipeline, we first define a connectivity space that provide a comprehensive and continuous description of the short-range anatomical connectivity around the central sulcus at both the individual and group levels. We then infer the presence of five major U-shape fibre bundles at the group level in both hemispheres by applying unsupervised clustering in the connectivity space. We propose a quantitative investigation of their position and number of streamlines as a function of phenotypic traits such as sex and hemispheres and functional scores such as handedness and manual dexterity. Main findings of this study are twofold: a description of U-shape short-range connectivity along the central sulcus at group level and the evidence of a significant relationship between the position of three hand related U-shape fibre bundles and the handedness score of subjects.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Diverse deep neural networks all predict human IT well, after training and fitting</title>

	<description>Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on object recognition provide the best current models of high-level visual areas in the brain. What remains unclear is how strongly network design choices, such as architecture, task training, and subsequent fitting to brain data contribute to the observed similarities. Here we compare a diverse set of nine DNN architectures on their ability to explain the representational geometry of 62 isolated object images in human inferior temporal (hIT) cortex, as measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging. We compare untrained networks to their task-trained counterparts, and assess the effect of fitting them to hIT using a cross-validation procedure. To best explain hIT, we fit a weighted combination of the principal components of the features within each layer, and subsequently a weighted combination of layers. We test all models across all stages of training and fitting for their correlation with the hIT representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM) using an independent set of images and subjects. We find that trained models significantly outperform untrained models (accounting for 57% more of the explainable variance), suggesting that features representing natural images are important for explaining hIT. Model fitting further improves the alignment of DNN and hIT representations (by 124%), suggesting that the relative prevalence of different features in hIT does not readily emerge from the particular ImageNet object-recognition task used to train the networks. Finally, all DNN architectures tested achieved equivalent high performance once trained and fitted. Similar ability to explain hIT representations appears to be shared among deep feedforward hierarchies of nonlinear features with spatially restricted receptive fields.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Methods for quantitative susceptibility and R2* mapping in whole post-mortem brains at 7T</title>

	<description>Susceptibility weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is sensitive to the local concentration of iron and myelin. Here, we describe a robust image processing pipeline for quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and R2* mapping of fixed post-mortem, whole-brain data. Using this pipeline, we compare the resulting quantitative maps in brains from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and controls, with validation against iron and myelin histology. Twelve post-mortem brains were scanned with a multi-echo gradient echo sequence at 7T, from which susceptibility and R2* maps were generated. Semi-quantitative histological analysis for ferritin (the principal iron storage protein) and myelin proteolipid protein was performed in the primary motor, anterior cingulate and visual cortices. Magnetic susceptibility and R2* values in primary motor cortex were higher in ALS compared to control brains. Magnetic susceptibility and R2* showed positive correlations with both myelin and ferritin estimates from histology. Four out of nine ALS brains exhibited clearly visible hyperintense susceptibility and R2* values in the primary motor cortex. Our results demonstrate the potential for MRI-histology studies in whole, fixed post-mortem brains to investigate the biophysical source of susceptibility weighted MRI signals in neurodegenerative diseases like ALS.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Impact of Concatenating fMRI Data on Reliability for Functional Connectomics</title>

	<description>Compelling evidence suggests the need for more data per individual to reliably map the functional organization of the human connectome. As the notion that &quot;more data is better&quot; emerges as a golden rule for functional connectomics, researchers find themselves grappling with the challenges of how to obtain the desired amounts of data per participant in a practical manner, particularly for retrospective data aggregation. Increasingly, the aggregation of data across all fMRI scans available for an individual is being viewed as a solution, regardless of scan condition (e.g., rest, task, movie). A number of open questions exist regarding the aggregation process and the impact of different decisions on the reliability of resultant aggregate data. We leveraged the availability of highly sampled test-retest datasets to systematically examine the impact of data aggregation strategies on the reliability of whole-brain functional connectomics. Specifically, we compared functional connectivity estimates derived after concatenating from: 1) multiple scans under the same state, 2) multiple scans under different states (i.e. hybrid or general functional connectivity), and 3) subsets of one long scan. We also varied connectivity processing (i.e. global signal regression, ICA-FIX, and task regression) and estimation procedures. When the total number of time points is equal, and the scan state held constant, concatenating multiple shorter scans had a clear advantage over a single long scan. However, this was not necessarily true when concatenating across different fMRI states (i.e. task conditions), where the reliability from the aggregate data varied across states. Concatenating fewer numbers of states that are more reliable tends to yield higher reliability. Our findings provide an overview of multiple dependencies of data concatenation that should be considered to optimize reliability in analysis of functional connectivity data.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Addressing Inaccurate Nosology in Mental Health: A Multi Label Data Cleansing Approach for Detecting Label Noise from Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data in Mood and Psychosis Disorders</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.06.081521v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.06.081521v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: Mental health diagnostic approaches are seeking to identify biological markers to work alongside advanced machine learning approaches. It is difficult to identify a biological marker of disease when the traditional diagnostic labels themselves are not necessarily valid. Methods: We worked with T1 structural magnetic resonance imaging data collected from individuals with mood and psychosis disorders from over 1400 individuals comprising healthy controls, psychosis patients and their unaffected first-degree relatives including 176 bipolar probands, 134 schizoaffective probands, 240 schizophrenia proband, 581 patients relatives and 362 controls. We assumed there might be noise in the diagnostic labeling process. We detected label noise by classifying the data multiple times using a support vector machine classifier, and then we flagged those individuals in which all classifiers unanimously mislabeled those subjects. Next, we assigned a new diagnostic label to these individuals, based on the biological data (MRI), using iterative data cleansing approach. Results: Simulation results showed our method was highly accurate in identifying label noise. Both diagnostic and Biotype categories showed about 65% and 63% respectively of noisy labels with the largest amount of relabeling occurring between the healthy control and bipolar and schizophrenia disorder individuals as well as in the unaffected close relatives. The extraction of imaging features highlighted regional brain changes associated with each group. Conclusions: This approach represents an initial step towards developing strategies that need not assume existing mental health diagnostic categories are always valid, but rather allows us to leverage this information while also acknowledging that there are misassignments.</description>

	<description>Biological motor control is versatile and efficient. Muscles are flexible and undergo continuous changes requiring distributed adaptive control mechanisms. How proprioception solves this problem in the brain is unknown. Here we pursue a task-driven modeling approach that has provided important insights into other sensory systems. However, unlike for vision and audition where large annotated datasets of raw images or sound are readily available, data of relevant proprioceptive stimuli are not. We generated a large-scale dataset of human arm trajectories as the hand is tracing the alphabet in 3D space, then using a musculoskeletal model derived the spindle firing rates during these movements. We propose an action recognition task that allows training of hierarchical models to classify the character identity from the spindle firing patterns. Artificial neural networks could robustly solve this task, and the networks' units show directional movement tuning akin to neurons in the primate somatosensory cortex. The same architectures with random weights also show similar kinematic feature tuning but do not reproduce the diversity of preferred directional tuning nor do they have invariant tuning across 3D space. Taken together our model is the first to link tuning properties in the proprioceptive system to the behavioral level.</description>

	<description>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is often considered the precursor of Alzheimer's disease. However, MCI is associated with substantially variable progression rates, which are not well understood. Attempts to identify the mechanisms that underlie MCI progression have often focused on the hippocampus, but have mostly overlooked its intricate structure and subdivisions. Here, we utilized deep learning to delineate the contribution of hippocampal subfields to MCI progression. We propose a dense convolutional neural network architecture that differentiates stable and progressive MCI based on hippocampal morphometry with an accuracy of 75.85%. A novel implementation of occlusion analysis revealed marked differences in the contribution of hippocampal subfields to the performance of the model, with presubiculum, CA1, and subiculum showing the most central role. Moreover, the analysis reveals that more than 20% of the hippocampal volume was redundant in the differentiation between stable and progressive MCI.</description>

	<description>Psychedelic drugs are potent modulators of conscious states and therefore powerful tools for investigating their neurobiology. N,N, Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is a particularly interesting serotonergic psychedelic that can rapidly induce an extremely immersive state of consciousness characterized by vivid and elaborate visual imagery. In the present study, we investigated the electrophysiological correlates of the DMT-induced altered state, by recording EEG signals from a pool of participants receiving DMT and (separately) placebo (saline), intravenously, while instructed to keep their eyes closed (i.e. 'resting state'). Consistent with our prior hypotheses, results revealed a spatio-temporal pattern of cortical activation (i.e., travelling waves) similar to that elicited by visual stimulation. Moreover, the typical top-down alpha-band rhythms of closed-eyes rest (i.e. a backward travelling wave) were significantly decreased, while the bottom-up 'forward travelling wave', was significantly increased. These results support a recent model proposing that psychedelics reduce the 'precision-weighting of priors', thus altering the balance of top-down versus bottom-up information passing, where properties of backward waves are considered correlates of this precision weighting. The robust hypothesis-confirming nature of the present findings imply the discovery of an important mechanistic principle underpinning psychedelic-induced altered states - i.e. reduced backward and increased forward travelling waves - and lend further support to prior assumptions about the functional significance of cortical travelling waves.</description>

	<description>Parkinsons disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra that leads to severe motor and non-motor deficits. Although the underlying mechanisms of dopaminergic neuron loss is not entirely clear, increasing evidence suggests mitochondrial malfunction as a key contributor to disease pathogenesis. Recently, we found that human PD patient stem cell-derived dopaminergic neurons exhibit reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) levels, an essential cofactor in mitochondrial function and cellular metabolism. In addition, we found that sirtuins, a group of NAD+-dependent deacetylase enzymes that participate in the regulation of mitochondrial function, energy production, and cell survival, displayed decreased activity in PD dopaminergic neurons, thereby suggesting a potential mechanism for dopaminergic loss in PD. Thus, here we tested whether treatment of PD stem cell-derived dopaminergic neurons with an NAD+ precursor could increase NAD+ levels and improve sirtuin activity.</description>

	<description>It has extensively been documented that human memory exhibits a wide range of systematic distortions, which have been associated with resource constraints. Resource constraints on memory can be formalised in the normative framework of lossy compression, however traditional lossy compression algorithms result in qualitatively different distortions to those found in experiments with humans. We argue that the form of distortions is characteristic of relying on a generative model adapted to the environment for compression. We show that this semantic compression framework can provide a unifying explanation of a wide variety of memory phenomena. We harness recent advances in learning deep generative models, that yield powerful tools to approximate generative models of complex data. We use three datasets, chess games, natural text, and hand-drawn sketches, to demonstrate the effects of semantic compression on memory performance. Our model accounts for memory distortions related to domain expertise, gist-based distortions, contextual effects, and delayed recall.</description>

	<description>A central finding in decision neuroscience is that BOLD activity in several regions, including ventral striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, is correlated with the subjective value of the option being considered, and that BOLD activity in these regions can predict choices out of sample, even at the population-level. Here we show, across two different decision making tasks in a large sample of subjects, that these BOLD value-correlates are intrinsically history dependent. If the subjective value of the previous offer was high, the signal on the current trial will be lower, and vice versa. This kind of history dependency is distinct from previously described adaptation or repetition suppression effects, but instead is of the form predicted by theories of efficient coding such as time-dependent cortical normalization. In terms of practical application, since value-based choice behavior does not exhibit the same history dependence, neural prediction studies may exhibit systematic errors without accounting for history effects. The data-driven, interpretable, whole-brain prediction approach we use to identify history effects also illustrates one way to adjust predictions for neural history dependency.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Functional brain age prediction suggests accelerated aging in preclinical familial Alzheimer's disease, irrespective of fibrillar amyloid-beta pathology</title>

	<description>We aimed at developing a model able to predict brain aging from resting state functional connectivity (rs-fMRI) and assessing whether genetic risk/determinants of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyloid (A{beta}) pathology contributes to accelerated brain aging. Using data collected in 1340 cognitively unimpaired participants from 18 to 94 years old selected across multi-site cohorts, we showed that chronological age can be predicted across the whole lifespan from topological properties of graphs constructed from rs-fMRI. We subsequently used the difference between the model-predicted age and the chronological age in pre-symptomatic autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) mutation carriers and asymptomatic individuals at risk of sporadic AD and assessed the influence of genetics and A{beta} pathology on brain age. Applying our predictive model in the context of preclinical AD revealed that the pre-symptomatic phase of ADAD is characterized by accelerated functional brain aging. This phenomenon is independent from, and might precede, detectable fibrillar A{beta} deposition.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Dynamic metabolic adaptation can promote species coexistence in competitive communities</title>

Microbes are capable of physiologically adapting to diverse environmental conditions by differentially varying the rates at which they uptake different nutrients. In particular, microbes can switch hierarchically between different energy sources, consuming first those that ensure the highest growth rate. Experimentally, this can result in bi-phasic growth curves called “diauxic shifts” that typically arise when microbes are grown in media containing several nutrients. Despite these observations are well-known in microbiology and molecular biology, the mathematical models generally used to describe the population dynamics of microbial communities do not account for dynamic metabolic adaptation, thus implicitly assuming that microbes cannot switch dynamically from one resource to another. Here, we introduce dynamic metabolic adaptation in the framework of consumer-resource models, which are commonly used to describe competitive microbial communities, allowing each species to temporally change its preferred energy source to maximize its own relative fitness. We show that dynamic metabolic adaptation enables the community to self-organize, allowing several species to coexist even in the presence of few resources, and to respond optimally to a time-dependent environment, thus showing that dynamic metabolic adaptation could be an important mechanism for maintaining high levels of diversity even in environments with few energy sources. We show that introducing dynamic metabolic strategies in consumer-resource models is necessary for reproducing experimental growth curves of the baker’s yeast &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; growing in the presence of two carbon sources. Even though diauxic shifts emerge naturally from the model when two resources are qualitatively very different, the model predicts that the existence of such shifts is not a prerequisite for species coexistence in competitive communities.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XmDLglyfd1Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Modern recording methods enable sampling of thousands of neurons during the performance of behavioral tasks, raising the question of how recorded activity relates to theoretical models. In the context of decision making, functional connectivity between choice-selective cortical neurons was recently reported. The straightforward interpretation of these data suggests the existence of selective pools of inhibitory and excitatory neurons. Computationally investigating an alternative mechanism for these experimental observations, we find that a randomly connected network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons generates single-cell selectivity, patterns of pairwise correlations, and the same ability of excitatory and inhibitory populations to predict choice, as in experimental observations. Further, we predict that, for this task, there are no anatomically defined subpopulations of neurons representing choice, and that choice preference of a particular neuron changes with the details of the task. We suggest that distributed stimulus selectivity and functional organization in population codes could be emergent properties of randomly connected networks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TXO2XX1UZlM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Single nucleotide polymorphisms affect RNA-protein interactions at a distance through modulation of RNA secondary structures</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Elan Shatoff, Ralf Bundschuh&lt;/p&gt;

Single nucleotide polymorphisms are widely associated with disease, but the ways in which they cause altered phenotypes are often unclear, especially when they appear in non-coding regions. One way in which non-coding polymorphisms could cause disease is by affecting crucial RNA-protein interactions. While it is clear that changing a protein binding motif will alter protein binding, it has been shown that single nucleotide polymorphisms can affect RNA secondary structure, and here we show that single nucleotide polymorphisms can affect RNA-protein interactions from outside binding motifs through altered RNA secondary structure. By using a modified version of the Vienna Package and PAR-CLIP data for HuR (ELAVL1) in humans we characterize the genome-wide effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms on HuR binding and show that they can have a many-fold effect on the affinity of HuR binding to RNA transcripts from tens of bases away. We also find some evidence that the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms on protein binding might be under selection, with the non-reference alleles tending to make it harder for a protein to bind.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7KPWm87FGE4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Author summary: Postdocs are a critical transition for early-career researchers. This transient period, between finishing a PhD and finding a permanent position, is when early-career researchers develop independent research programs and establish collaborative relationships that can make a successful career. Traditionally, postdocs physically relocate—sometimes multiple times—for these short-term appointments, which creates challenges that can disproportionately affect members of traditionally underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). However, many research activities involving analytical and quantitative work do not require a physical presence in a lab and can be accomplished remotely. Other fields have embraced remote work, yet many academics have been hesitant to hire remote postdocs. In this article, we present advice to both principal investigators (PIs) and postdocs for successfully navigating a remote position. Using the combined experience of the authors (as either remote postdocs or employers of remote postdocs), we provide a road map to overcome the real (and perceived) obstacles associated with remote work. With planning, communication, and creativity, remote postdocs can be a fully functioning and productive member of a research lab. Further, our rules can be useful for research labs generally and can help foster a more flexible and inclusive environment.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/y6RvQlKqVc8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The current academic culture facing women in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields in the United States has sparked the formation of grassroots advocacy groups to empower female scientists in training. However, the impact of these initiatives often goes unmeasured and underappreciated. Our Women in Science and Engineering (WiSE) organization serves postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and research technicians (trainees) at a private research institute for biological sciences. Here we propose the following guidelines for cultivating a successful women-in-STEM-focused group based upon survey results from our own scientific community as well as the experience of our WiSE group leaders. We hope these recommendations can provide guidance to advocacy groups at other research and academic organizations that wish to strengthen their efforts. Whereas our own group specifically focuses on the underrepresented state of women in science, we hope these guidelines may be adapted and applied to groups that advocate for any minority group within the greater scientific community (i.e., those of gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic background, sexual orientation, etc.).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AvXtUUFG44Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

With increasing demand for training in data science, extracurricular or “ad hoc” education efforts have emerged to help individuals acquire relevant skills and expertise. Although extracurricular efforts already exist for many computationally intensive disciplines, their support of data science education has significantly helped in coping with the speed of innovation in data science practice and formal curricula. While the proliferation of ad hoc efforts is an indication of their popularity, less has been documented about the needs that they are designed to meet, the limitations that they face, and practical suggestions for holding successful efforts. To holistically understand the role of different ad hoc formats for data science, we surveyed organizers of ad hoc data science education efforts to understand how organizers perceived the events to have gone—including areas of strength and areas requiring growth. We also gathered recommendations from these past events for future organizers. Our results suggest that the perceived benefits of ad hoc efforts go beyond developing technical skills and may provide continued benefit in conjunction with formal curricula, which warrants further investigation. As increasing numbers of researchers from computational fields with a history of complex data become involved with ad hoc efforts to share their skills, the lessons learned that we extract from the surveys will provide concrete suggestions for the practitioner-leaders interested in creating, improving, and sustaining future efforts.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FGHwcxZsHCE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Modeling cancer cells is essential to better understand the dynamic nature of brain tumors and glioma cells, including their invasion of normal brain. Our goal is to study how the morphology of the glioma cell influences the formation of patterns of collective behavior such as flocks (cells moving in the same direction) or streams (cells moving in opposite direction) referred to as &lt;i&gt;oncostream&lt;/i&gt;. We have observed experimentally that the presence of oncostreams correlates with tumor progression. We propose an original agent-based model that considers each cell as an ellipsoid. We show that stretching cells from round to ellipsoid increases stream formation. A systematic numerical investigation of the model was implemented in R 2. We deduce a phase diagram identifying key regimes for the dynamics (e.g. formation of flocks, streams, scattering). Moreover, we study the effect of cellular density and show that, in contrast to classical models of flocking, increasing cellular density reduces the formation of flocks. We observe similar patterns in R 3 with the noticeable difference that stream formation is more ubiquitous compared to flock formation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yjgIFp7h1B0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Path integration is thought to rely on vestibular and proprioceptive cues yet most studies in humans involve primarily visual input, providing limited insight into their respective contributions. We developed a paradigm involving walking in an omnidirectional treadmill in which participants were guided on two sides of a triangle and then found their back way to origin. In Experiment 1, we tested a range of different triangle types while keeping the distance of the unguided side constant to determine the influence of spatial geometry. Participants overshot the angle they needed to turn and undershot the distance they needed to walk, with no consistent effect of triangle type. In Experiment 2, we manipulated distance while keeping angle constant to determine how path integration operated over both shorter and longer distances. Participants underestimated the distance they needed to walk to the origin, with error increasing as a function of the walked distance. To attempt to account for our findings, we developed configural-based computational models involving vector addition, the second of which included terms for the influence of past trials on the current one. We compared against a previously developed configural model of human path integration, the Encoding-Error model. We found that the vector addition models captured the tendency of participants to under-encode guided sides of the triangles and an influence of past trials on current trials. Together, our findings expand our understanding of body-based contributions to human path integration, further suggesting the value of vector addition models in understanding these important components of human navigation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IlBS8UmnS-w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Spinal afferent nerve endings in the submucosa of mouse distal colon that arise from a single nonpeptidergic spinal afferent neuron whose cell body originated in lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia (DRG). The nerve endings identified from this single sensory neuron were labeled after injection of neuronal tracer into DRG.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major sensory nerve pathway between the colon and central nervous system (spinal cord and brain) that underlies the gut–brain axis, is via spinal afferent neurons, with cell bodies in dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Our aim was to identify the sensory nerve endings in the colon that arise from single colorectal‐projecting DRG neurons. C57BL/6 mice were anesthetized and lumbosacral L6‐S1 DRG injected with dextran biotin. Mice recovered for 7 days. The whole colon was then removed and stained to visualize single axons and nerve endings immunoreactive to calcitonin gene‐related peptide (CGRP). Single axons arising from DRG were identified in the distal colon and their morphological features and CGRP immunoreactivity characterized. After entering the colon, single axons ramified rostrally or caudally along many rows of myenteric ganglia with little circumferential displacement, giving off varicose endings in multiple ganglia. Nerve endings arising from two classes of colorectal‐projecting DRG neuron were identified. One class was peptidergic neurons that had nerve endings in circular muscle, myenteric ganglia, and submucosa. Another class of nonpeptidergic neurons innervated mucosal crypts, myenteric ganglia, and submucosa. Different morphological types of nerve endings which innervate different anatomical layers of colon can arise from the same axon and sensory neuron in DRG. These findings suggest single peptidergic and nonpeptidergic sensory neurons in DRG are potentially capable of detecting sensory stimuli from different anatomical layers of the colon, via different types of nerve endings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Three identified groups (red, blue, and green) of axons which projected differently to the vestibular nuclei and to the nodulus (X) and flocculus (Fl) indicated functionally distinct heterogeneous populations of vestibulocerebellar neurons.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A significant population of neurons in the vestibular nuclei projects to the cerebellum as mossy fibers (MFs) which are involved in the control and adaptation of posture, eye‐head movements, and autonomic function. However, little is known about their axonal projection patterns. We studied the morphology of single axons of medial vestibular nucleus (MVN) neurons as well as those originating from primary afferents, by labeling with biotinylated dextran amine (BDA). MVN axons (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 35) were classified into three types based on their major predominant termination patterns. The Cbm‐type terminated only in the cerebellum (15 axons), whereas others terminated in the cerebellum and contralateral vestibular nuclei (cVN/Cbm‐type, 13 axons), or in the cerebellum and ipsilateral vestibular nuclei (iVN/Cbm‐type, 7 axons). Cbm‐ and cVN/Cbm‐types mostly projected to the nodulus and uvula without any clear relationship with longitudinal stripes in these lobules. They were often bilateral, and sometimes sent branches to the flocculus and to other vermal lobules. Also, the iVN/Cbm‐type projected mainly to the ipsilateral nodulus. Neurons of these types of axons showed different distribution within the MVN. The number of MF terminals of some vestibulocerebellar axons, iVN/Cbm‐type axons in particular, and primary afferent axons were much smaller than observed in previously studied MF axons originating from major precerebellar nuclei and the spinal cord. The results demonstrated that a heterogeneous population of MVN neurons provided divergent MF inputs to the cerebellum. The cVN/Cbm‐ and iVN/Cbm‐types indicate that some excitatory neuronal circuits within the vestibular nuclei supply their collaterals to the vestibulocerebellum as MFs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The astrocyte network in the ventral nerve cord neuropil of the Drosophila third‐instar larva&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/911271db-26b1-4d82-b1ea-0b7891a52fff/cne24852-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have provided a detailed analysis of astrocyte morphology and territory in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; third‐instar ventral nerve cord where there already exists considerable understanding of the neuronal network. Astrocyte shape varies from globular to multi‐arbored; their arbors can extend across segments and into different neuronal domains. Our data are consistent with a model of a developmental growth process dominated by competitive or repulsive interactions between astrocytes, but should also include cell‐autonomous aspects, as well as use of structural features for growth. This study provides the foundation for a robust, functionally oriented connectome needed to understand neuron–glia interactions in this neuropil.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding neuronal function at the local and circuit level requires understanding astrocyte function. We have provided a detailed analysis of astrocyte morphology and territory in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; third‐instar ventral nerve cord where there already exists considerable understanding of the neuronal network. Astrocyte shape varies more than previously reported; many have bilaterally symmetrical partners, many have a high percentage of their arborization in adjacent segments, and many have branches that follow structural features. Taken together, our data are consistent with, but not fully explained by, a model of a developmental growth process dominated by competitive or repulsive interactions between astrocytes. Our data suggest that the model should also include cell‐autonomous aspects, as well as the use of structural features for growth. Variation in location of arborization territory for identified astrocytes was great enough that a standardized scheme of neuropil division among the six astrocytes that populate each hemi‐segment is not possible at the third instar. The arborizations of the astrocytes can extend across neuronal functional domains. The ventral astrocyte in particular, whose territory can extend well into the proprioceptive region of the neuropil, has no obvious branching pattern that correlates with domains of particular sensory modalities, suggesting that the astrocyte would respond to neuronal activity in any of the sensory modalities, perhaps integrating across them. This study sets the stage for future studies that will generate a robust, functionally oriented connectome that includes both partners in neuronal circuits—the neurons and the glial cells, providing the foundation necessary for studies to elucidate neuron–glia interactions in this neuropil.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Mild carotid stenosis creates gradual, progressive, lifelong brain, and eye damage: An experimental laboratory rat model&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9566fb6b-678c-41e2-b65f-24cf6fe2765f/cne24851-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mild occlusion affects behavior, brain, and eyes morphology. Diffusion‐tensor imaging revealed brain abnormalities in both groups, but only bilateral rats show effects in the optic nerve. Histology revealed for those areas changes in astrocytes, microglia, and number of apoptotic cells. Bilateral occlusion produced a severe damage to both eyes while in unilateral the damage was only in the occluded side.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In humans, carotid stenosis of 70% and above might be the cause of clinical symptoms such as transient ischemic attack and stroke. No clinical or animal studies have evaluated mild carotid occlusion, and few examined unilateral occlusion. Here, Westar rats underwent bilateral or unilateral carotid occlusion of 28–45%. Long‐term effects were evaluated 9–11 months later. We conducted cognitive evaluation using spatial learning in a water maze and exploration behavior in an open field. Morphology of the brain was examined by MRI using diffusion‐tensor imaging (DTI) and immunohistochemistry staining of the brain and eyes. Cognitive deficit was found in spatial memory and exploration behavior in both occluded groups. Brain and eyes histology presented severe damage in the bilateral group, compared to the unilateral one. DTI revealed an increase in mean diffusivity (MD) in the ventral thalamus and a decrease in fractional anisotropy in optic nerve and optic tract in bilateral rats, while unilateral rats showed only an increase in MD in the ventral pons. In those areas, a significant change in astrocytes, microglia, and number of apoptotic cells were found. Bilateral occlusion produced severe damage to both retinas, while unilateral occlusion produced damage mainly in the occluded side. We found that mild carotid stenosis, even in a unilateral occlusion, creates behavioral abnormalities presented by brain and eye histopathology. The results support our hypothesis that gradual formation of mild carotid stenosis along the life course leads to progressive damage that may create different degenerative diseases at a later age.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Expression and distribution of trophoblast glycoprotein in the mouse retina&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/24d2bc5e-3809-408b-81b2-a71d1b01fa42/cne24850-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trophoblast glycoprotein (TPBG) is a leucine‐rich repeat glycoprotein with an intracellular PDZ‐binding motif that is localized to the dendrites and axon terminals of retinal rod bipolar cells and in the cell body and dendrites of an uncharacterized amacrine cell. Immunofluorescent labeling of TPBG in rod bipolar cells is significantly reduced in the TRPM1 knockout retina, yet total retinal TPBG is constant. This suggests that antibody access may be blocked in certain activity states, possibly by TPBG binding to a PDZ protein in a light‐ or phosphorylation‐dependent manner.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recently identified the leucine‐rich repeat (LRR) adhesion protein, trophoblast glycoprotein (TPBG), as a novel PKCα‐dependent phosphoprotein in retinal rod bipolar cells (RBCs). Since TPBG has not been thoroughly examined in the retina, this study characterizes the localization and expression patterns of TPBG in the developing and adult mouse retina using two antibodies, one against the N‐terminal LRR domain and the other against the C‐terminal PDZ‐interacting motif. Both antibodies labeled RBC dendrites in the outer plexiform layer and axon terminals in the IPL, as well as a putative amacrine cell with their cell bodies in the inner nuclear layer (INL) and a dense layer in the middle of the inner plexiform layer (IPL). In live transfected HEK293 cells, TPBG was localized to the plasma membrane with the N‐terminal LRR domain facing the extracellular space. TPBG immunofluorescence in RBCs was strongly altered by the loss of TRPM1 in the adult retina, with significantly less dendritic and axon terminal labeling in TRPM1 knockout compared to wild type, despite no change in total TPBG detected by immunoblotting. During retinal development, TPBG expression increases dramatically just prior to eye opening with a time course closely correlated with that of TRPM1 expression. In the retina, LRR proteins have been implicated in the development and maintenance of functional bipolar cell synapses, and TPBG may play a similar role in RBCs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Reorganization of longitudinal compartments in the laterally protruding paraflocculus of the postnatal mouse cerebellum</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Reorganization of longitudinal compartments in the laterally protruding paraflocculus of the postnatal mouse cerebellum&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/75da3991-2bd1-4d49-ad7a-b00e4770c44c/cne24849-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paraflocculus (PFl), neighbored by the flocculus (Fl) and copula pyramidis (Cop), forms remarkable protrusion between postnatal Days 1 and 7 (P1, P7) in the mouse cerebellum. The paravermal compartment of &lt;i&gt;pcdh10&lt;/i&gt;+ Purkinje cells (arrowheads) migrate laterally to become accommodated within the laterally oriented striped compartmentalization in the bulb‐shaped paraflocculus.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paraflocculus and the neighboring smaller flocculus form a remarkable protrusion in the ventrolateral aspect of the mouse cerebellum, in which the longitudinal compartments are conspicuously oriented perpendicularly to the sagittal plane. The developmental process of such anatomical arrangements in these lobules has not been fully clarified. Here, we used the genetic tractability of &lt;i&gt;pcdh10‐lacZ&lt;/i&gt; knock‐in (OL‐KO), &lt;i&gt;IP&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;R1‐nls‐lacZ&lt;/i&gt; transgenic (1NM13) and Gpr26cre‐Ai9‐AldocV mice to track the development of compartments and examined local longitudinal orientation of Purkinje cells within the paraflocculus and flocculus. We observed a distinct &lt;i&gt;pcdh10&lt;/i&gt;‐positive (&lt;i&gt;pcdh10&lt;/i&gt;+) compartment in the flocculus, whereas the paraflocculus and other lobules had a continuous paravermal &lt;i&gt;pcdh10&lt;/i&gt;+ compartment, in the embryonic OL‐KO cerebellum. During the first postnatal week, the parafloccular &lt;i&gt;pcdh10&lt;/i&gt;+ compartment shifted laterally to the most lateral edge in the caudal part of the protruding paraflocculus. Although the most medial edge of the parafloccular &lt;i&gt;pcdh10&lt;/i&gt;+ compartment remained in the nonprotruding part of the paraflocculus, it was disrupted from the originally continuous &lt;i&gt;pcdh10&lt;/i&gt;+ compartment in the copula pyramidis. The local longitudinal orientation changed gradually along with the mediolateral extent of the copula pyramidis, almost becoming perpendicular to the sagittal plane in the laterally connected paraflocculus in the adult cerebellum. This rotational change in orientation was derived from the short U‐shaped embryonic cerebellum, in which the surfaces of the flocculus and paraflocculus were oriented laterally. These results indicated that the peculiar compartmental organization of the paraflocculus originates from the embryonic common hemispheric compartmental organization and shaped by the significant reorganization process in the first postnatal week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Spatial models of cell distribution in human lumbar dorsal root ganglia&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/7f4667d4-6dde-4d84-adcc-b61710495e1a/cne24848-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) are novel targets for neural interface technologies that treat neurological disorders, such as chronic pain and spinal cord injury. The three‐dimensional cellular anatomy of DRG are not well‐mapped, particularly in humans, limiting the effectiveness of neurotechnology. We developed a semi‐automated algorithm to quantify the three‐dimensional distribution of neural elements in histologically‐processed tissue. We applied this algorithm to sequential NF200‐stained histology slices obtained from human lumbar DRG and demonstrated that cell bodies typically congregate around the dorsal edge of the ganglia. These results are crucial to the development of safe and effective clinical neural interface technologies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dorsal root ganglia (DRG), which contain the somata of primary sensory neurons, have increasingly been considered as novel targets for clinical neural interfaces, both for neuroprosthetic and pain applications. Effective use of either neural recording or stimulation technologies requires an appropriate spatial position relative to the target neural element, whether axon or cell body. However, the internal three‐dimensional spatial organization of human DRG neural fibers and somata has not been quantitatively described. In this study, we analyzed 202 cross‐sectional images across the length of 31 human L4 and L5 DRG from 10 donors. We used a custom semi‐automated graphical user interface to identify the locations of neural elements in the images and normalize the output to a consistent spatial reference for direct comparison by spinal level. By applying a recursive partitioning algorithm, we found that the highest density of cell bodies at both spinal levels could be found in the inner 85% of DRG length, the outer‐most 25–30% radially, and the dorsal‐most 69–76%. While axonal density was fairly homogeneous across the DRG length, there was a distinct low density region in the outer 7–11% radially. These findings are consistent with previous qualitative reports of neural distribution in DRG. The quantitative measurements we provide will enable improved targeting of future neural interface technologies and DRG‐focused pharmaceutical therapies, and provide a rigorous anatomical description of the bridge between the central and peripheral nervous systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Ablation of spinal cord estrogen receptor α‐expressing interneurons reduces chemically induced modalities of pain and itch</title>

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estrogens underlie, at least in part, the greater pain sensitivity and chronic pain prevalence that women experience compared to men. Previous studies revealed populations of estrogen receptor‐expressing neurons in primary afferents and in superficial dorsal horn neurons, but there is limited information as to the contribution of these neurons to the generation of acute and chronic pain. Here we molecularly characterized neurons in the mouse superficial spinal cord dorsal horn that express estrogen receptor α (ERα) and explored the behavioral consequences of their ablation. The great majority of spinal ERα‐positive neurons are excitatory interneurons and many co‐express the neuropeptide, substance P. After viral, caspase‐mediated ablation of spinal ERα‐expressing cells, we did not observe changes in acute mechanical or heat pain processing, but recorded significant changes in the response to chemically‐evoked persistent pain behavior as well as pruritogen‐evoked itch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estrogens are presumed to underlie, at least in part, the greater pain sensitivity and chronic pain prevalence that women experience compared to men. Although previous studies revealed populations of estrogen receptor‐expressing neurons in primary afferents and in superficial dorsal horn neurons, there is little to no information as to the contribution of these neurons to the generation of acute and chronic pain. Here we molecularly characterized neurons in the mouse superficial spinal cord dorsal horn that express estrogen receptor α (ERα) and explored the behavioral consequences of their ablation. We found that spinal ERα‐positive neurons are largely excitatory interneurons and many coexpress substance P, a marker for a discrete subset of nociceptive, excitatory interneurons. After viral, caspase‐mediated ablation of spinal ERα‐expressing cells, we observed a significant decrease in the first phase of the formalin test, but in male mice only. ERα‐expressing neuron‐ablation also reduced pruritogen‐induced scratching in both male and female mice. There were no ablation‐related changes in mechanical or heat withdrawal thresholds or in capsaicin‐induced nocifensive behavior. In chronic pain models, we found no change in Complete Freund's adjuvant‐induced thermal or mechanical hypersensitivity, or in partial sciatic nerve injury‐induced mechanical allodynia. We conclude that ERα labels a subpopulation of excitatory interneurons that are specifically involved in chemically evoked persistent pain and pruritogen‐induced itch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, in contrast to healthy controls make autoantibodies to the RNA binding protein heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1). Using experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of MS, injections of anti‐hnRNP A1 antibodies lead to increased neurodegeneration as shown by a loss of neuronal cell bodies in the ventral spinal cord (graph). We demonstrate that anti‐hnRNP A1 antibodies localized within and surrounding neuronal cell bodies of the ventral spinal cord. In these areas we demonstrate that neurons display increased hnRNP A1 mislocalization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, increased stress granule formation while also expressing inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Additionally, anti‐hnRNP A1 antibodies were localized to CD16&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CD68&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; immune cells leading to an increase in iNOS in the surrounding tissue and subsequent neurodegeneration.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurodegeneration, including loss of neurons and axons, is a feature of progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). The mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration are mostly unknown. Research implicates autoimmunity to nonmyelin self‐antigens as important contributors to disease pathogenesis. Data from our lab implicate autoimmunity to the RNA binding protein (RBP) heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) as a possible mechanism of neurodegeneration in MS. MS patients make antibodies to hnRNP A1, which have been shown to lead to neuronal dysfunction in vitro. Using an animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), we show here that injection of anti‐hnRNP A1 antibodies, in contrast to control antibodies, resulted in worsened disease and increased neurodegeneration. We found a reduction of NeuN&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neuronal cell bodies in areas of the ventral gray matter of the spinal cord where anti‐hnRNP A1 antibodies localized. Neurons displayed increased levels of hnRNP A1 nucleocytoplasmic mislocalization and stress granule formation, both markers of neuronal injury. Anti‐hnRNP A1 antibodies were found to surround neuronal cell bodies and interact with CD68&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; immune cells via Fc receptors. Additionally, anti‐hnRNP A1 antibodies were found within neuronal cell bodies including those of the ventral spinocerebellar tract (VSCT), a tract previously shown to undergo neurodegeneration in anti‐hnRNP A1 antibody injected EAE mice. Finally, both immune cells and neurons showed increased levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase, another indicator of cell damage. These findings suggest that autoimmunity to RBPs, such as hnRNP A1, play a role in neurodegeneration in EAE with important implications for the pathogenesis of MS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Candidates for photic entrainment pathways to the circadian clock via optic lobe neuropils in the Madeira cockroach</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Candidates for photic entrainment pathways to the circadian clock via optic lobe neuropils in the Madeira cockroach&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ebf9b454-6a80-484a-9ced-5a9659241f56/cne24844-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the nocturnal Madeira cockroach, parallel photic entrainment pathways from the compound eye to the circadian clock in the accessory medulla (AME) control circadian rest‐activity rhythms. We hypothesize that UV light promotes sleep via activation of ipsilateral pigment‐dispersing factor‐releasing morning clock cells (aPDFMEs/pPDFMEs) mediated via interneurons (CRZ MNe) between medulla layers 2 and 4. In contrast, green light directly activates contralateral PDF evening clock cells in the lamina, promoting activity at night. In addition, rest‐activity rhythms may be entrained via extraocular photoreceptors terminating in the accessory laminae (ALA).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compound eye of cockroaches is obligatory for entrainment of the Madeira cockroach's circadian clock, but the cellular nature of its entrainment pathways is enigmatic. Employing multiple‐label immunocytochemistry, histochemistry, and backfills, we searched for photic entrainment pathways to the accessory medulla (AME), the circadian clock of the Madeira cockroach. We wanted to know whether photoreceptor terminals could directly contact pigment‐dispersing factor‐immunoreactive (PDF‐ir) circadian pacemaker neurons with somata in the lamina (PDFLAs) or somata next to the AME (PDFMEs). Short green‐sensitive photoreceptor neurons of the compound eye terminated in lamina layers LA1 and LA2, adjacent to PDFLAs and PDFMEs that branched in LA3. Long UV‐sensitive compound eye photoreceptor neurons terminated in medulla layer ME2 without direct contact to ipsilateral PDFMEs that arborized in ME4. Multiple neuropeptide‐ir interneurons branched in ME4, connecting the AME to ME2. Before, extraocular photoreceptors of the lamina organ were suggested to send terminals to accessory laminae. There, they overlapped with PDFLAs that mostly colocalized PDF, FMRFamide, and 5‐HT immunoreactivities, and with terminals of ipsi‐ and contralateral PDFMEs. We hypothesize that during the day cholinergic activation of the largest PDFME via lamina organ photoreceptors maintains PDF release orchestrating phases of sleep–wake cycles. As ipsilateral PDFMEs express excitatory and contralateral PDFMEs inhibitory PDF autoreceptors, diurnal PDF release keeps both PDF‐dependent clock circuits in antiphase. Future experiments will test whether ipsilateral PDFMEs are sleep‐promoting morning cells, while contralateral PDFMEs are activity‐promoting evening cells, maintaining stable antiphase via the largest PDFME entrained by extraocular photoreceptors of the lamina organ.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Cognitive problems, especially disturbances in episodic memory, and hippocampal sclerosis are common in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) but little is known about the relationship of hippocampal morphology with memory. We aimed to relate hippocampal surface‐shape patterns to verbal and visual learning.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We analysed hippocampal surface shapes on high‐resolution MRI images and the Adult Memory and Information Processing Battery in 145 unilateral refractory TLE patients undergoing epilepsy surgery, a validation set of 55 unilateral refractory TLE patients and 39 age‐ and sex‐matched healthy volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both left (LTLE) and right (RTLE) TLE patients had lower verbal (LTLE 44 ± 11; RTLE 45 ± 10) and visual learning (LTLE 34 ± 8; RTLE 30 ± 8) scores than healthy controls (verbal 58 ± 8; visual 39 ± 6; p&amp;lt;0.001). Verbal learning was more impaired the greater the atrophy of the left superolateral hippocampal head. In contrast, visual memory was worse with greater bilateral inferiomedial hippocampal atrophy. Postsurgical verbal memory decline was more common in LTLE than in RTLE (reliable change index in LTLE 27% vs. RTLE 7%, p=0.006), whereas there were no differences in postsurgical visual memory decline between those groups. Preoperative atrophy of the left hippocampal tail predicted postsurgical verbal memory decline.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memory deficits in TLE are associated with specific morphological alterations of the hippocampus, which could help stratify TLE patients into those at high vs. low risk of presurgical or postsurgical memory deficits. This knowledge could improve planning and prognosis of selective epilepsy surgery and neuropsychological counselling in TLE.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Genetically Elevated LDL Associates with Lower Risk of Intracerebral Hemorrhage</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25740?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observational studies point to an inverse correlation between low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), but it remains unclear whether this association is causal. We tested the hypothesis that genetically elevated LDL is associated with reduced risk of ICH.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We constructed one polygenic risk score (PRS) per lipid trait (total cholesterol, LDL, high‐density lipoprotein [HDL], and triglycerides) using independent genomewide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for each trait. We used data from 316,428 individuals enrolled in the UK Biobank to estimate the effect of each PRS on its corresponding trait, and data from 1,286 ICH cases and 1,261 matched controls to estimate the effect of each PRS on ICH risk. We used these estimates to conduct Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified 410, 339, 393, and 317 lipid‐related SNPs for total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides, respectively. All four PRSs were strongly associated with their corresponding trait (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 1.00 × 10&lt;sup&gt;‐100&lt;/sup&gt;). While one SD increase in the PRSs for total cholesterol (odds ratio [OR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.85–0.99; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03) and LDL cholesterol (OR = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.81–0.95; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002) were inversely associated with ICH risk, no significant associations were found for HDL and triglycerides (both &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 0.05). MR analyses indicated that 1mmol/L (38.67mg/dL) increase of genetically instrumented total and LDL cholesterol were associated with 23% (OR = 0.77; 95% CI = 0.65–0.98; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03) and 41% lower risks of ICH (OR = 0.59; 95% CI = 0.42–0.82; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002), respectively.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetically elevated LDL levels were associated with lower risk of ICH, providing support for a potential causal role of LDL cholesterol in ICH. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Systems Biology: Differential Expression of Plasma Exo-miRNA in Neurodegenerative Diseases by Next-Generation Sequencing</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative diseases encompass a wide variety of pathological conditions caused by a loss of neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) and are severely debilitating. Exosome contains bio-signatures of great diagnostic and therapeutic value. There is proof that exosomal proteins can be biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). MicroRNAs in exosome has potential to be an important source of biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we report exosomal microRNA performance of human plasma in neurodegenerative diseases by small RNA sequencing. A wide range of altered exo-miRNA expression levels were detected in both AD and PD patients. Down-regulated miRNAs in AD samples were enriched in ECM-receptor interaction pathway and both up-/down-regulated miRNAs in PD samples were enriched in fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. Compared to the control, 8 miRNAs were found to be significantly elevated/declined in AD and PD samples, of which 4 miRNAs were newly identified. Additionally, two exosome isolating methods were compared and the reproducibility of plasma exo-miRNA expression was confirmed, suggesting the feasibility of large-scale clinical application of this method. This study revealed exo-miRNA expression levels in neurodegenerative diseases, proposed new biomarkers and their potential functional pathway for AD and PD, confirmed the reproductivity of exo-miRNA profiles by using a different exosome isolating method, and compared the results with plasma miRNA expression. Therefore, this study also provides a precedent for identifying exosomal biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases in plasma by high-throughput sequencing and it could extend the therapeutic repertoire of exosomal biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Oxidative Stress-Induced Axon Fragmentation Is a Consequence of Reduced Axonal Transport in Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia SPAST Patient Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a group of inherited disorders characterized by progressive spasticity and paralysis of the lower limbs. Autosomal dominant mutations in SPAST gene account for ∼40% of adult-onset patients. We have previously shown that SPAST patient cells have reduced organelle transport and are therefore more sensitive to oxidative stress. To test whether these effects are present in neuronal cells, we first generated 11 induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell lines from fibroblasts of three healthy controls and three HSP patients with different SPAST mutations. These cells were differentiated into FOXG1-positive forebrain neurons and then evaluated for multiple aspects of axonal transport and fragmentation. Patient neurons exhibited reduced levels of SPAST encoded spastin, as well as a range of axonal deficits, including reduced levels of stabilized microtubules, lower peroxisome transport speed as a consequence of reduced microtubule-dependent transport, reduced number of peroxisomes, and higher density of axon swellings. Patient axons fragmented significantly more than controls following hydrogen peroxide exposure, suggesting for the first time that the SPAST patient axons are more sensitive than controls to the deleterious effects of oxidative stress. Treatment of patient neurons with tubulin-binding drugs epothilone D and noscapine rescued axon peroxisome transport and protected them against axon fragmentation induced by oxidative stress, showing that SPAST patient axons are vulnerable to oxidative stress-induced degeneration as a consequence of reduced axonal transport.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Sensory- and Action-Oriented Embodiment of Neurally-Interfaced Robotic Hand Prostheses</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Embodiment is the percept that something not originally belonging to the self becomes part of the body. Feeling embodiment for a prosthesis may counteract amputees’ altered image of the body and increase prosthesis acceptability. Prosthesis embodiment has been studied longitudinally in an amputee receiving feedback through intraneural and perineural multichannel electrodes implanted in her stump. Three factors—invasive (vs non-invasive) stimulation, training, and anthropomorphism—have been tested through two multisensory integration tasks: visuo-tactile integration (VTI) and crossing-hand effect in temporal order judgment (TOJ), the former more sensible to an extension of a safe margin around the body and the latter to action-oriented remapping. Results from the amputee participant were compared with the ones from healthy controls. Testing the participant with intraneural stimulation produced an extension of peripersonal space, a sign of prosthesis embodiment. One-month training extended the peripersonal space selectively on the side wearing the prostheses. More and less-anthropomorphic prostheses benefited of intraneural feedback and extended the peripersonal space. However, the worsening of TOJ performance following arm crossing was present only wearing the more trained, despite less anthropomorphic, prosthesis, suggesting that training was critical for our participant to achieve operative tool-like embodiment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: EEG Functional Connectivity Underlying Emotional Valance and Arousal Using Minimum Spanning Trees</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00355</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00355</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, traditional methods such as power spectrum and amplitude analysis have been used to research the emotional electroencephalogram (EEG). The brain network method is also used in emotional EEG research, which can better reflect the activity of brains. A minimum spanning tree (MST) represents the key information flow in the weighted brain network, and it provides a sensitive method to capture subtle information in network organization while effectively avoiding the shortcomings of traditional brain networks. The DEAP dataset provides electroencephalogram (EEG) data for four categories of emotions: high arousal and high valence (HAHV), high arousal and low valence (HALV), low arousal and high valence (LAHV), and low arousal and low valence (LALV). Phase lag index (PLI) weighted matrices were calculated in five frequency bands. On this basis, the minimum spanning trees were constructed. At the same valence level in the gamma (γ) band, HAHV and HALV showed significant higher mean PLI (MPLI), maximum degree (Degree&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) and leaf fraction and significant lower diameter and eccentricity than LAHV and LALV. At the same arousal level in the γ band, HALV showed significant higher MPLI, Degree&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and leaf fraction and significant lower diameter and eccentricity than HAHV. These results indicate that the low-arousal showed more line-shaped configurations than the high-arousal. Additionally, in the high-arousal condition, a shift toward more star-shaped trees from high-valence to low-valence supports the trend toward randomness of the brain network with negative emotions and that the brain is more activated when faced with negative emotions. From a brain network perspective, this phenomenon provides a theoretical basis for negative bias.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Resting State EEG in Exercise Intervention Studies: A Systematic Review of Effects and Methods</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00155</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00155</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Exercise has been shown to alter brain plasticity and is explored as a therapeutic intervention in a wide variety of neurological diseases. Electroencephalography (EEG) offers an inexpensive method of studying brain electrocortical activity shortly after exercise and thus offers a way of exploring the influence of exercise on the brain. We conducted a systematic review to summarize the current body of evidence regarding methods of EEG analysis and the reported effects of exercise interventions on EEG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: PubMed, Web of Science and EMBASE were searched for studies investigating resting state EEG in exercise intervention studies carried out in participants &amp;gt;17 years of age and with no history of epilepsy. Further, studies solely investigating event-related potentials as an outcome measure were excluded. Relevant data were extracted, and a risk-of-bias assessment was carried out using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. A qualitative synthesis of results was carried out. A protocol for the systematic review was uploaded to https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/ (ID: CRD42019134570) and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) statement was followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Out of 1,993 records screened, 54 studies were included in a final qualitative synthesis with a total of 1,445 participants. Our synthesis showed that studies were mainly carried out using frequency analysis as an analytical method. Generally, findings across studies were inconsistent and few were adjusted for multiple comparisons. Studies were mainly of low quality and usually carried out in small populations, lowering the significance of results reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Changes in the EEG as a result of an exercise intervention are elusive and difficult to replicate. Future studies should provide biologically sound hypotheses underlying assumptions, include larger populations and use standardized EEG methods to increase replicability. EEG remains an interesting methodology to examine the effects of exercise on the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Functional neurological disorders are characterized by neurological symptoms that have no identifiable pathology and little is known about their underlying pathophysiology.&lt;/p&gt;Objectives&lt;p&gt;To analyze motor cortex excitability and intracortical inhibitory and excitatory circuits’ imbalance in patients with flaccid functional weakness.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Twenty-one consecutive patients with acute onset of flaccid functional weakness were recruited. Single and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols were used to analyze resting motor thresholds (RMT) and intracortical inhibitory (short interval intracortical inhibition – SICI) and excitatory (intracortical facilitation – ICF) circuits’ imbalance between the affected and non-affected motor cortices.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We observed a significant increase in RMT and SICI in the affected motor cortex (p &amp;lt; 0.001), but not for ICF, compared to the contralateral unaffected side.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This study extends current knowledge of functional weakness, arguing for a specific central nervous system abnormality which may be involved in the symptoms’ pathophysiology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Plasticity of Persistent Activity and Its Constraints</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00015</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00015</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stimulus information is maintained in working memory by action potentials that persist after the stimulus is no longer physically present. The prefrontal cortex is a critical brain area that maintains such persistent activity due to an intrinsic network with unique synaptic connectivity, NMDA receptors, and interneuron types. Persistent activity can be highly plastic depending on task demands but it also appears in naïve subjects, not trained or required to perform a task at all. Here, we review what aspects of persistent activity remain constant and what factors can modify it, focusing primarily on neurophysiological results from non-human primate studies. Changes in persistent activity are constrained by anatomical location, with more ventral and more anterior prefrontal areas exhibiting the greatest capacity for plasticity, as opposed to posterior and dorsal areas, which change relatively little with training. Learning to perform a cognitive task for the first time, further practicing the task, and switching between learned tasks can modify persistent activity. The ability of the prefrontal cortex to generate persistent activity also depends on age, with changes noted between adolescence, adulthood, and old age. Mean firing rates, variability and correlation of persistent discharges, but also time-varying firing rate dynamics are altered by these factors. Plastic changes in the strength of intrinsic network connections can be revealed by the analysis of synchronous spiking between neurons. These results are essential for understanding how the prefrontal cortex mediates working memory and intelligent behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Genome-Wide Screen of the Hippocampus in Aged Rats Identifies Mitochondria, Metabolism and Aging Processes Implicated in Sevoflurane Anesthesia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00122</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown multiple mechanisms and pathophysiological changes after anesthesia, and genome-wide studies have been implemented in the studies of brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the genome-wide gene expression patterns and modulation networks after general anesthesia remains to be elucidated. Therefore, whole transcriptome microarray analysis was used to explore the coding gene expression patterns in the hippocampus of aged rats after sevoflurane anesthesia. Six hundred and thirty one upregulated and 183 downregulated genes were screened out, then 44 enriched terms of biological process, 16 of molecular function and 18 of the cellular components were identified by Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG analysis. Among them, oxidative stress, metabolism, aging, and neurodegeneration were the most enriched biological processes and changed functions. Thus, involved genes of these processes were selected for qPCR verification and a good consistency was confirmed. The potential signaling pathways were further constructed including mitochondrion and oxidative stress-related Hifs-Prkcd-Akt-Nfe2l2-Sod1 signaling, multiple metabolism signaling (Scd2, Scap-Hmgcs2, Aldh18a1-Glul and Igf1r), as well as aging and neurodegeneration related signaling (Spidr-Ercc4-Cdkn1a-Pmaip1 and Map1lc3b). These results provide potential therapeutic gene targets for brain function modulation and memory formation process after inhaled anesthesia in the elderly, which could be valuable for preventing postoperative brain disorders and diseases, such as perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND), from the genetic level in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Gender Differences in Neurodegeneration, Neuroinflammation and Na+-Ca2+ Exchangers in the Female A53T Transgenic Mouse Model of Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00118</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Twelve-month-old male mice expressing the human A53T variant of α-synuclein (A53T) develop dopamine neuron degeneration, neuroinflammation, and motor deficits, along with dysfunctions of the mitochondrial Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; exchanger (NCX) isoforms 1 (NCX1) and 3 (NCX3) in the nigrostriatal system. Since gender is thought to play a role in the etiology of Parkinson’s disease (PD), we characterized neurochemical and behavioral alterations in 12-month-old female A53T transgenic mice. We investigated the presence of dopaminergic degeneration, astrogliosis and microgliosis using immunohistochemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule-1 (IBA-1) in both the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and striatum. In the same regions, we also evaluated the co-localization of NCX1 in cells positive for IBA-1 and the co-localization of NCX3 in TH-positive neurons and fibers. Furthermore, in both male and female mice, we performed motor (beam walking and pole tests) and memory [novel object recognition (NOR) and spontaneous alternation] tasks, together with tests to evaluate peripheral deficits (olfactory and stool collection tests). Female A53T transgenic mice displayed degeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons, but neither microgliosis nor astrogliosis in the SNc and striatum. Moreover, female A53T transgenic mice displayed co-localization between NCX1 and IBA-1 positive cells in the striatum but not SNc, whereas NCX3 did not co-localize with either TH-positive terminals or neuronal bodies in the nigrostriatal system. Furthermore, female A53T transgenic mice showed increased crossing time in the beam walking test, but no impairments in the pole or memory tests, and in tests that evaluated peripheral deficits, whereas male A53T transgenic mice displayed motor, memory and peripheral deficits. Immunohistochemical and behavioral results obtained here in the female mice differ from those previously observed in males, and suggest a dissimilar influence of NCX1 and NCX3 on dopaminergic function in female and male A53T transgenic mice, strengthening the validity of these mice as a model for studying the etiological factors of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Age-Related Changes in Pain Perception Are Associated With Altered Functional Connectivity During Resting State</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aging affects pain experience and brain functioning. However, how aging leads to changes in pain perception and brain functional connectivity has not yet been completely understood. To investigate resting-state and pain perception changes in old and young participants, this study employed region of interest (ROI) to ROI resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) analysis of imaging data by using regions implicated in sensory and affective dimensions of pain, descending pain modulation, and the default-mode networks (DMNs). Thirty-seven older (66.86 ± 4.04 years; 16 males) and 38 younger healthy participants (20.74 ± 4.15 years; 19 males) underwent 10 min’ eyes-closed resting-state scanning. We examined the relationship between rsFC parameters with pressure pain thresholds. Older participants showed higher pain thresholds than younger. Regarding rsFC, older adults displayed increased connectivity of pain-related sensory brain regions in comparison to younger participants: increased rsFC between bilateral primary somatosensory area (SI) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and between SI(L) and secondary somatosensory area (SII)-(R) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC). Moreover, decreased connectivity in the older compared to the younger group was found among descending pain modulatory regions: between the amygdala(R) and bilateral insula(R), thalamus(R), ACC, and amygdala(L); between the amygdala(L) and insula(R) and bilateral thalamus; between ACC and bilateral insula, and between periaqueductal gray (PAG) and bilateral thalamus. Regarding the DMN, the posterior parietal cortex and lateral parietal (LP; R) were more strongly connected in the older group than in the younger group. Correlational analyses also showed that SI(L)-SII(R) rsFC was positively associated with pressure pain thresholds in older participants. In conclusion, these findings suggest a compensatory mechanism for the sensory changes that typically accompanies aging. Furthermore, older participants showed reduced functional connectivity between key nodes of the descending pain inhibitory pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), a hereditary cerebral small vessel disease caused by mutations in NOTCH3, is characterized by recurrent stroke without vascular risk factors, mood disturbances, and dementia. MRI imaging shows cerebral white matter (WM) hyperintensity, particularly in the external capsule and temporal pole. Missense mutations related to a cysteine residue in the 34 EGFr on the NOTCH3 extracellular domain (N3ECD) are a typical mutation of CADASIL. On the other hand, atypical mutations including cysteine sparing mutation, null mutation, homozygous mutation, and other associate genes are also reported. From the viewpoint of gain of function apart from Notch signaling or loss of function of Notch signaling, we review the research article about CADASIL and summarized the pathogenesis of small vessel, stroke, and dementia in this disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: LKB1 coordinates neurite remodeling to drive synapse layer emergence in the outer retina</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.56931</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56931</link>
	<description>Structural changes in pre and postsynaptic neurons that accompany synapse formation often temporally and spatially overlap. Thus, it has been difficult to resolve which processes drive patterned connectivity. To overcome this, we use the laminated outer murine retina. We identify the serine/threonine kinase LKB1 as a key driver of synapse layer emergence. The absence of LKB1 in the retina caused a marked mislocalization and delay in synapse layer formation. In parallel, LKB1 modulated postsynaptic horizontal cell refinement and presynaptic photoreceptor axon growth. Mislocalized horizontal cell processes contacted aberrant cone axons in LKB1 mutants. These defects coincided with altered synapse protein organization, and horizontal cell neurites were misdirected to ectopic synapse protein regions. Together, these data suggest that LKB1 instructs the timing and location of connectivity in the outer retina via coordinate regulation of pre and postsynaptic neuron structure and the localization of synapse-associated proteins.</description>

	<title>eLife: Essential function of the alveolin network in the subpellicular microtubules and conoid assembly in Toxoplasma gondii</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.56635</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56635</link>
	<description>The coccidian subgroup of Apicomplexa possesses an apical complex harboring a conoid, made of unique tubulin polymer fibers. This enigmatic organelle extrudes in extracellular invasive parasites and is associated to the apical polar ring (APR). The APR serves as microtubule-organizing center for the 22 subpellicular microtubules (SPMTs) that are linked to a patchwork of flattened vesicles, via an intricate network composed of alveolins. Here, we capitalize on ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM) to localize the &lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/i&gt; Apical Cap protein 9 (AC9) and its partner AC10, identified by BioID, to the alveolin network and intercalated between the SPMTs. Parasites conditionally depleted in AC9 or AC10 replicate normally but are defective in microneme secretion and fail to invade and egress from infected cells. Electron microscopy revealed that the mature parasite mutants are conoidless, while U-ExM highlighted the disorganization of the SPMTs which likely results in the catastrophic loss of APR and conoid.</description>

	<title>eLife: Temporal integration of auxin information for the regulation of patterning</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55832</link>
	<description>Positional information is essential for coordinating the development of multicellular organisms. In plants, positional information provided by the hormone auxin regulates rhythmic organ production at the shoot apex, but the spatio-temporal dynamics of auxin gradients is unknown. We used quantitative imaging to demonstrate that auxin carries high-definition graded information not only in space but also in time. We show that, during organogenesis, temporal patterns of auxin arise from rhythmic centrifugal waves of high auxin travelling through the tissue faster than growth. We further demonstrate that temporal integration of auxin concentration is required to trigger the auxin-dependent transcription associated with organogenesis. This provides a mechanism to temporally differentiate sites of organ initiation and exemplifies how spatio-temporal positional information can be used to create rhythmicity.</description>

	<title>eLife: Auditory cortical alpha/beta desynchronization prioritizes the representation of memory items during a retention period</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.55508</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55508</link>
	<description>To-be-memorized information in working-memory could be protected against distracting influences by processes of functional inhibition or prioritization. Modulations of oscillations in the alpha to beta range in task-relevant sensory regions have been suggested to play an important role for both mechanisms. We adapted a Sternberg task variant to the auditory modality, with a strong or a weak distracting sound presented at a predictable time during the retention period. Using a time-generalized decoding approach relatively decreased strength of memorized information was found prior to strong distractors, paralleled by decreased pre-distractor alpha / beta power in the left superior temporal gyrus (lSTG). Over the entire group, reduced beta power in lSTG was associated with relatively increased strength of memorized information. The extent of alpha power modulations within participants was negatively correlated strength of memorized information. Overall our results are compatible with a prioritization account, however point to nuanced differences between alpha and beta oscillations.</description>

	<description>The Xist lncRNA mediates X chromosome inactivation (XCI)&lt;sup&gt;1,2&lt;/sup&gt;. Here we show that Spen, an Xist-binding repressor protein essential for XCI&lt;sup&gt;3-9&lt;/sup&gt;, binds to ancient retroviral RNA, performing a surveillance role to recruit chromatin silencing machinery to these parasitic loci. Spen inactivation activates a subset of endogenous retroviral (ERV) elements in mouse embryonic stem cells, with gain of chromatin accessibility, active histone modifications, and ERV RNA transcription. Spen binds directly to ERV RNAs that show structural similarity to the A-repeat of Xist, a region critical for Xist-mediated gene silencing&lt;sup&gt;10-11&lt;/sup&gt;. ERV RNA and Xist A-repeat bind the RRM domains of Spen in a competitive manner. Insertion of an ERV into an A-repeat deficient Xist rescues binding of Xist RNA to Spen and results in strictly local gene silencing in cis. These results suggest that Xist may coopt transposable element RNA-protein interactions to repurpose powerful antiviral chromatin silencing machinery for sex chromosome dosage compensation.</description>

	<title>eLife: Recurrent circuit dynamics underlie persistent activity in the macaque frontoparietal network</title>

	<description>During delayed oculomotor response tasks, neurons in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) and the frontal eye fields (FEF) exhibit persistent activity that reflects the active maintenance of behaviorally relevant information. Despite many computational models of the mechanisms of persistent activity, there is a lack of circuit-level data from the primate to inform the theories. To fill this gap, we simultaneously recorded ensembles of neurons in both LIP and FEF while macaques performed a memory-guided saccade task. A population encoding model revealed strong and symmetric long-timescale recurrent excitation between LIP and FEF. Unexpectedly, LIP exhibited stronger local functional connectivity than FEF, and many neurons in LIP had longer network and intrinsic timescales. The differences in connectivity could be explained by the strength of recurrent dynamics in attractor networks. These findings reveal reciprocal multi-area circuit dynamics in the frontoparietal network during persistent activity and lay the groundwork for quantitative comparisons to theoretical models.</description>

	<title>eLife: Quantifying antibiotic impact on within-patient dynamics of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase resistance</title>

	<description>Antibiotic-induced perturbation of the human gut flora is expected to play an important role in mediating the relationship between antibiotic use and the population prevalence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, but little is known about how antibiotics affect within-host resistance dynamics. Here we develop a data-driven model of the within-host dynamics of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt;. We use bla&lt;sub&gt;CTX-M&lt;/sub&gt; (the most widespread ESBL gene family) and 16S rRNA (a proxy for bacterial load) abundance data from 833 rectal swabs from 133 ESBL-positive patients followed up in a prospective cohort study in three European hospitals. We find that cefuroxime and ceftriaxone are associated with increased bla&lt;sub&gt;CTX-M&lt;/sub&gt; abundance during treatment (21% and 10% daily increase, respectively), while treatment with meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, and oral ciprofloxacin is associated with decreased bla&lt;sub&gt;CTX-M&lt;/sub&gt; (8% daily decrease for all). The model predicts that typical antibiotic exposures can have substantial long-term effects on bla&lt;sub&gt;CTX-M&lt;/sub&gt; carriage duration.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Teacher-student neural coupling during teaching and learning</title>

	<description>Human communication is remarkably versatile, enabling teachers to share highly abstracted and novel information with their students. What neural processes enable such transfer of information across brains during naturalistic teaching and learning? Here, we show that during lectures, wherein information transmission is unidirectional and flows from the teacher to the student, the student's brain mirrors the teacher's brain and that this neural coupling is correlated with learning outcomes. A teacher was scanned in fMRI giving an oral lecture with slides on a scientific topic followed by a review lecture. Students were then scanned watching either the intact lecture and review (N = 20) or a temporally scrambled version of the lecture (N = 20). Using intersubject correlation (ISC), we observed widespread teacher-student neural coupling spanning sensory cortex and language regions along the superior temporal sulcus as well as higher-level regions including posterior medial cortex (PMC), superior parietal lobule (SPL), and dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. Teacher-student alignment in higher-level areas was not observed when learning was disrupted by temporally scrambling the lecture. Moreover, teacher-student coupling in PMC was significantly correlated with learning outcomes: the more closely the student's brain mirrored the teacher's brain, the more the student improved between behavioral pre-learning and post-learning assessments. Together, these results suggest that the alignment of neural responses between teacher and students may underlie effective communication of complex information across brains in classroom settings.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Efficient codes for memory determine pitch representations</title>

	<description>Perceptual systems have finite memory resources and must store incoming signals in compressed formats. To test whether representations of a sound's pitch might derive from this need for compression, we compared discrimination of harmonic and inharmonic sounds across delays. In contrast to inharmonic spectra, harmonic spectra can be summarized, and thus compressed, using their fundamental frequency (f0). Despite being comparable for sounds presented back-to-back, discrimination was better for harmonic than inharmonic stimuli when sounds were separated in time, implicating memory representations unique to harmonic sounds. Patterns of individual differences indicated that listeners use different representations depending on the time delay between sounds, directly comparing the spectra of temporally adjacent sounds, but transitioning to comparing f0s across delays. The need to compress sound into memory appears to determine reliance on f0-based pitch, and may explain its importance in music, in which listeners must extract relationships between notes separated in time.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Cadherin-13 is a critical regulator of GABAergic modulation in human stem cell derived neuronal networks</title>

	<description>Activity in the healthy brain relies on concerted interplay of excitation (E) and inhibition (I) via balanced synaptic communication between glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. A growing number of studies imply that disruption of this E/I balance is a commonality in many brain disorders, however, obtaining mechanistic insight into these disruptions, with translational value for the human patient, has typically been hampered by methodological limitations. Cadherin-13 (CDH13) has strongly been associated to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and comorbid disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. CDH13 localises at inhibitory presynapses, specifically of parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SST) expressing GABAergic neurons. However, the mechanism by which CDH13 regulates the function of inhibitory synapses in human neurons remains unknown. Starting from human induced pluripotent stem cells, we established a robust method to generate a homogenous population of SST and PV expressing GABAergic neurons (iGABA) in vitro, and co-cultured these with glutamatergic neurons at defined E/I ratios on micro-electrode arrays. We identified functional network parameters that are most reliably affected by GABAergic modulation as such, and through alterations of E/I balance by reduced expression of CDH13 in iGABAs. We found that CDH13-deficiency in iGABAs decreased E/I balance by means of increased inhibition. Moreover, CDH13 interacts with Integrin-{beta}1 and Integrin-{beta}3, which play opposite roles in the regulation of inhibitory synaptic strength via this interaction. Taken together, this model allows for standardized investigation of the E/I balance in a human neuronal background and can be deployed to dissect the cell-type specific contribution of disease genes to the E/I balance.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The Impact of Graph Construction Scheme and Community Detection Algorithm on the Reliability of Community and Hub Identification in Structural Brain Networks</title>

	<description>The human brain is a complex network of volumes of tissue (nodes) that are interconnected by white matter tracts (edges). It can be represented as a graph to allow us to use graph theory to gain insight into normal human development and brain disorders. Most graph theoretical metrics measure either whole-network (global) or node-specific (local) properties of the network. However, a critical question in network neuroscience is how nodes cluster together to form communities, each of which possibly plays a specific functional role. Community partition analysis allows us to investigate the mesoscale organization of the brain. Various algorithms have been proposed in the literature, that allow the identification of such communities, with each algorithm resulting in different communities for the network. Those communities also depend on the method used to weigh the edges of the graphs representing the brain networks. In this work, we use the test-retest data from the Human Connectome Project to compare 32 such community detection algorithms, each paired with 7 graph construction schemes, and assess the reproducibility of the resulting community partitions. The reproducibility of community partition depended heavily on both the graph construction scheme and the community detection algorithm. Hard community detection algorithms, via which each node is assigned to only one community, outperformed soft ones, via which each node can be a part of more than one community. The best reproducibility was observed for the graph construction scheme that combines 9 white matter tract metrics paired with the greedy stability optimization algorithm, with either discrete or continuous Markovian chain. This graph-construction scheme / community detection algorithm pair also gave the highest similarity between representative group community affiliation and individual community affiliation. Connector hubs were better reproduced than provincial hubs.</description>

	<description>Visual perception in natural environments depends on the ability to focus on salient stimuli while ignoring distractions. This kind of selective visual attention is associated with gamma oscillations in the visual cortex. While the nucleus reticularis thalami (nRT) has been implicated in selective attention, its role in modulating visual perception remains unknown. Here we show that somatostatin-expressing neurons (SOM) in the nRT preferentially project to visual thalamic nuclei, as compared to the more abundant parvalbumin-expressing neurons, and powerfully modulate both visual information transmission and gamma oscillations in the primary visual cortex (V1). These findings represent a novel circuit through which the nRT can influence representation of visual information.</description>

	<description>The latest generation of genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) is significantly advancing our ability to study electrical activity from large numbers of identified neurons. The further refinement of the technology will contribute to our understanding of behavior-evoked information perception, transfer and processing on a cellular level across brain regions. The development of GEVIs relies on synthetic biology which includes rational and random modifications of indicator sequence. One strategy in GEVI design is based on creating chimeras between voltage sensitive protein domains (VSDs) and fluorescent proteins (FPs). However, in this design scenario, the mechanistic details of voltage-induced fluorescence change that would inform rational design and improvements of GEVIs are still largely missing. Here we preformed a systematic study of how nature of the FP and altering the insertion site affects the characteristics of Ciona intestinalis voltage-sensitive phosphatase-based GEVIs. Surprisingly, we found that regardless of vast difference in phylogenesis, biochemical properties, fluorophore structure, sequence and excitation/emission spectra between FPs, the resulting GEVIs exhibit virtually identical decrease in fluorescence intensity in response to depolarization. These results stand in strong contrast to studies demonstrating that small numbers of targeted mutations in the FP sequence cause dramatic changes in both signal size and polarity.</description>

	<description>Complex neural dynamics in the prefrontal cortex contribute to context-dependent decisions and attentional competition. To analyze these dynamics, we apply demixed principal component analysis to activity of a primate prefrontal cell sample recorded in a cued target detection task. The results track dynamics of cue and object coding, feeding into movements along a target present-absent decision axis in a low-dimensional subspace of population activity. For a single stimulus, object and cue coding are seen mainly in the contralateral hemisphere. Later, a developing decision code in both hemispheres may reflect interhemispheric communication. With a target in one hemifield and a competing distractor in the other, each hemisphere initially encodes the contralateral object, but finally, decision coding is dominated by the task-relevant target. Tracking complex neural events in a low-dimensional activity subspace illuminates information flow towards task-appropriate behavior, unravelling mechanisms of prefrontal computation.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: An inhalation anaesthesia approach for neonatal mice allowing streamlined stereotactic injection in the brain</title>

	<description>Investigating brain function requires tools and techniques to visualise, modify and manipulate neuronal tissue. One powerful and popular method is intracerebral injection of customised viruses, allowing expression of exogenous transgenes. This technique is a standard procedure for adult mice, and is used by laboratories worldwide. Use of neonatal animals in scientific research allows investigation of developing tissues, and enables long-term study of cell populations. However, procedures on neonatal mice are more challenging, due to the lack of reliable methods and apparatus for anaesthesia of these animals. Here, we report an inhalation-based protocol for anaesthesia of neonatal (P0-2) mice, and present a custom 3D-printed apparatus for maintenance of anaesthesia during surgical procedures. This approach significantly enhances animal welfare and facilitates wider and simpler use of neonatal rodents in scientific research. Our optimised method of anaesthesia enables a rapid method of stereotactic injection in neonatal mice for transduction of brain tissue. We demonstrate this procedure for targeted labelling of specific brain regions, and in vivo modification of tissue prior to organotypic culture. This anaesthetic approach can be readily employed by any laboratory, and will enable safer use of neonatal rodents across a diverse spectrum of scientific disciplines.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Microglial phagocytosis dysfunction is related to local neuronal activity in a genetic model of epilepsy</title>

	<description>Microglial phagocytosis of apoptotic cells is an essential component of the brain regenerative response in neurodegenerative diseases. Phagocytosis is very efficient in physiological conditions, as well as during apoptotic challenge induced by excitotoxicity or inflammation, but is impaired in mouse and human mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). Here we extend our studies to a genetic model of progressive myoclonus epilepsy type 1 (EPM1) in mice lacking cystatin B (CSTB), an inhibitor of cysteine proteases involved in lysosomal proteolysis. We first demonstrated that microglial phagocytosis was impaired in the hippocampus in Cstb knock-out (KO) mice when seizures arise and hippocampal atrophy begins, at 1 month of age. To test if this blockage was related to the lack of Cstb in microglia, we used an in vitro model of phagocytosis and siRNAs to acutely reduce Cstb expression but we found no significant effect in the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. We then tested whether seizures were involved in the phagocytosis impairment, similar to MTLE, and analyzed Cstb KO mice before seizures begin, at postnatal day 14. Here, phagocytosis impairment was restricted to the granule neuron layer but not to the subgranular zone, where there are no active neurons. Furthermore, we observed apoptotic cells (both phagocytosed and not phagocytosed) in Cstb deficient mice at close proximity to active, cFos+ neurons and used mathematical modeling to demonstrate that the physical relationship between apoptotic cells and cFos+ neurons was specific for Cstb KO mice. These results suggest a complex crosstalk between apoptosis, phagocytosis and neuronal activity, hinting that local neuronal activity could be related to phagocytosis dysfunction in Cstb KO mice. Overall, this data suggest that phagocytosis impairment is an early feature of hippocampal damage in epilepsy and opens novel therapeutic approaches for epileptic patients based on targeting microglial phagocytosis.</description>

	<description>Age has a major effect on brain volume. However, the normative studies available are constrained by small sample sizes, restricted age coverage and significant methodological variability. These limitations introduce inconsistencies and may obscure or distort the lifespan trajectories of brain morphometry. In response, we capitalised on the resources of the Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) Consortium to examine the age-related morphometric trajectories of the ventricles, the basal ganglia (caudate, putamen, pallidum, and nucleus accumbens), the thalamus, hippocampus and amygdala using magnetic resonance imaging data obtained from 18,605 individuals aged 3-90 years. All subcortical structure volumes were at their maximum early in life; the volume of the basal ganglia showed a gradual monotonic decline thereafter while the volumes of the thalamus, amygdala and the hippocampus remained largely stable (with some degree of decline in thalamus) until the sixth decade of life followed by a steep decline thereafter. The lateral ventricles showed a trajectory of continuous enlargement throughout the lifespan. Significant age-related increase in inter-individual variability was found for the hippocampus and amygdala and the lateral ventricles. These results were robust to potential confounders and could be used to derive risk predictions for the early identification of diverse clinical phenotypes.</description>

	<description>Delineating age-related cortical trajectories in healthy individuals is critical given the association of cortical thickness with cognition and behaviour. Previous research has shown that deriving robust estimates of age-related brain morphometric changes requires large-scale studies. In response, we conducted a large-scale analysis of cortical thickness in 17,075 individuals aged 3-90 years by pooling data through the Lifespan Working group of the Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) Consortium. We used fractional polynomial (FP) regression to characterize age-related trajectories in cortical thickness, and we computed normalized growth centiles using the parametric Lambda, Mu, and Sigma (LMS) method. Inter-individual variability was estimated using meta-analysis and one-way analysis of variance. Overall, cortical thickness peaked in childhood and had a steep decrease during the first 2-3 decades of life; thereafter, it showed a gradual monotonic decrease which was steeper in men than in women particularly in middle-life. Notable exceptions to this general pattern were entorhinal, temporopolar and anterior cingulate cortices. Inter-individual variability was largest in temporal and frontal regions across the lifespan. Age and its FP combinations explained up to 59% variance in cortical thickness. These results reconcile uncertainties about age-related trajectories of cortical thickness; the centile values provide estimates of normative variance in cortical thickness, and may assist in detecting abnormal deviations in cortical thickness, and associated behavioural, cognitive and clinical outcomes.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Felix Siebenhühner, Sheng H. Wang, Gabriele Arnulfo, Anna Lampinen, Lino Nobili, J. Matias Palva, Satu Palva&lt;/p&gt;

Phase synchronization of neuronal oscillations in specific frequency bands coordinates anatomically distributed neuronal processing and communication. Typically, oscillations and synchronization take place concurrently in many distinct frequencies, which serve separate computational roles in cognitive functions. While within-frequency phase synchronization has been studied extensively, less is known about the mechanisms that govern neuronal processing distributed across frequencies and brain regions. Such integration of processing between frequencies could be achieved via cross-frequency coupling (CFC), either by phase–amplitude coupling (PAC) or by &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-cross–frequency phase synchrony (CFS). So far, studies have mostly focused on local CFC in individual brain regions, whereas the presence and functional organization of CFC between brain areas have remained largely unknown. We posit that interareal CFC may be essential for large-scale coordination of neuronal activity and investigate here whether genuine CFC networks are present in human resting-state (RS) brain activity. To assess the functional organization of CFC networks, we identified brain-wide CFC networks at mesoscale resolution from stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) and at macroscale resolution from source-reconstructed magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We developed a novel, to our knowledge, graph-theoretical method to distinguish genuine CFC from spurious CFC that may arise from nonsinusoidal signals ubiquitous in neuronal activity. We show that genuine interareal CFC is present in human RS activity in both SEEG and MEG data. Both CFS and PAC networks coupled theta and alpha oscillations with higher frequencies in large-scale networks connecting anterior and posterior brain regions. CFS and PAC networks had distinct spectral patterns and opposing distribution of low- and high-frequency network hubs, implying that they constitute distinct CFC mechanisms. The strength of CFS networks was also predictive of cognitive performance in a separate neuropsychological assessment. In conclusion, these results provide evidence for interareal CFS and PAC being 2 distinct mechanisms for coupling oscillations across frequencies in large-scale brain networks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/iApG8yeSIYU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: In search of common developmental and evolutionary origin of the claustrum and subplate</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.24922?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;In search of common developmental and evolutionary origin of the claustrum and subplate&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9d019221-95c1-430d-b14e-455e63f242d6/cne24922-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarities in gene expression patterns prompted our speculations on the common developmental and evolutionary origin of the claustrum and the subplate. Here we systematically compare the currently available data on cytoarchitecture, evolutionary origin, gene expression, cell types, birthdates, neurogenesis, lineage and migration, circuit connectivity, and cell death of the neurons that contribute to the claustrum and subplate. Almost all of the markers we examined that were expressed in the subplate/Layer 6b were also expressed in the claustral complex, but not all claustrum specific or enriched genes were expressed in subplate/Layer 6b, suggesting overall similarities, but also some differences. There are numerous similarities between the adult connectivity patters of Layer 6b and claustrum. In particular, both have extensive cortical connections. However, there are differences in the relative strength of their reciprocal connectivity with various other structures in the adult. Based on their similarities and differences we propose a partially common early evolutionary origin of the cells that become claustrum and subplate, a likely scenario that is shared in these cell populations across all amniotes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human claustrum, a major hub of widespread neocortical connections, is a thin, bilateral sheet of gray matter located between the insular cortex and the striatum. The subplate is a largely transient cortical structure that contains some of the earliest generated neurons of the cerebral cortex and has important developmental functions to establish intra‐ and extracortical connections. In human and macaque some subplate cells undergo regulated cell death, but some remain as interstitial white matter cells. In mouse and rat brains a compact layer is formed, Layer 6b, and it remains underneath the cortex, adjacent to the white matter. Whether Layer 6b in rodents is homologous to primate subplate or interstitial white matter cells is still debated. Gene expression patterns, such as those of &lt;i&gt;Nurr1/Nr4a2&lt;/i&gt;, have suggested that the rodent subplate and the persistent subplate cells in Layer 6b and the claustrum might have similar origins. Moreover, the birthdates of the claustrum and Layer 6b are similarly precocious in mice. These observations prompted our speculations on the common developmental and evolutionary origin of the claustrum and the subplate. Here we systematically compare the currently available data on cytoarchitecture, evolutionary origin, gene expression, cell types, birthdates, neurogenesis, lineage and migration, circuit connectivity, and cell death of the neurons that contribute to the claustrum and subplate. Based on their similarities and differences we propose a partially common early evolutionary origin of the cells that become claustrum and subplate, a likely scenario that is shared in these cell populations across all amniotes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Nimodipine Reduces Dysfunction and Demyelination in Models of Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25749?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25749?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treatment of relapses in multiple sclerosis (MS) has not advanced beyond steroid use, which reduces acute loss of function, but has little effect on residual disability. Acute loss of function in an MS model (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [EAE]) is partly due to central nervous system (CNS) hypoxia, and function can promptly improve upon breathing oxygen. Here, we investigate the cause of the hypoxia and whether it is due to a deficit in oxygen supply arising from impaired vascular perfusion. We also explore whether the CNS‐selective vasodilating agent, nimodipine, may provide a therapy to restore function, and protect from demyelination in 2 MS models.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A variety of methods have been used to measure basic cardiovascular physiology, spinal oxygenation, mitochondrial function, and tissue perfusion in EAE.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report that the tissue hypoxia in EAE is associated with a profound hypoperfusion of the inflamed spinal cord. Treatment with nimodipine restores spinal oxygenation and can rapidly improve function. Nimodipine therapy also reduces demyelination in both EAE and a model of the early MS lesion.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loss of function in EAE, and demyelination in EAE, and the model of the early MS lesion, seem to be due, at least in part, to tissue hypoxia due to local spinal hypoperfusion. Therapy to improve blood flow not only protects neurological function but also reduces demyelination. We conclude that nimodipine could be repurposed to offer substantial clinical benefit in MS.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Longitudinal Assessment of Multiple Sclerosis with the Brain‐Age Paradigm</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25746?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25746?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the natural course of multiple sclerosis (MS), the brain is exposed to aging as well as disease effects. Brain aging can be modeled statistically; the so‐called “brain‐age” paradigm. Here, we evaluated whether brain‐predicted age difference (brain‐PAD) was sensitive to the presence of MS, clinical progression, and future outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a longitudinal, multicenter sample of 3,565 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, in 1,204 patients with MS and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and 150 healthy controls (mean follow‐up time: patients 3.41 years, healthy controls 1.97 years), we measured “brain‐predicted age” using T1‐weighted MRI. We compared brain‐PAD among patients with MS and patients with CIS and healthy controls, and between disease subtypes. Relationships between brain‐PAD and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) were explored.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with MS had markedly higher brain‐PAD than healthy controls (mean brain‐PAD +10.3 years; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 8.5–12.1] versus 4.3 years; 95% CI = 2.1 to 6.4; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). The highest brain‐PADs were in secondary‐progressive MS (+13.3 years; 95% CI = 11.3–15.3). Brain‐PAD at study entry predicted time‐to‐disability progression (hazard ratio 1.02; 95% CI = 1.01–1.03; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001); although normalized brain volume was a stronger predictor. Greater annualized brain‐PAD increases were associated with greater annualized EDSS score (r = 0.26; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain‐age paradigm is sensitive to MS‐related atrophy and clinical progression. A higher brain‐PAD at baseline was associated with more rapid disability progression and the rate of change in brain‐PAD related to worsening disability. Potentially, “brain‐age” could be used as a prognostic biomarker in early‐stage MS, to track disease progression or stratify patients for clinical trial enrollment.

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science and medicine aim to identify verifiable and replicable truths. However, the paths to such truths are frequently characterised by swinging pendulums of opposing perspectives. This is especially so in human neuroscience and the brain‐based clinical sciences, where the target of investigation is the most complex of all biological systems. This paper overviews a set of interrelated neuroscientific and clinical hypotheses, models, experiments and predictions with which I have been involved for the last two decades. Traversing visual neuroscience, consciousness science, genetics, chronobiology, and biological and clinical psychiatry, the work illustrates how developments in science and medicine can occur through a combination of synthesis, serendipity and experimentation. The paper also reflects on doing science with the inimitable John ‘Jack’ Pettigrew, and outlines how Pettigrew and I conceived, proposed, tested and developed two new scientific models — one on neural mechanisms of binocular rivalry, the other on the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder. I also provide an update on various aspects of our models and data, and describe lessons learned from Pettigrew on how perspectives in science exhibit their own fluctuations, ironically like the very phenomena on which we worked.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Functional organisation and connectivity of the dorsal column nuclei complex reveals a sensorimotor integration and distribution hub</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Functional organisation and connectivity of the dorsal column nuclei complex reveals a sensorimotor integration and distribution hub&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ac2bc1f8-5b10-4b15-8f15-72b1b0d33827/cne24942-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dorsal column nuclei complex (DCN‐complex) includes the dorsal column nuclei (DCN, referring to the gracile and cuneate nuclei collectively), external cuneate, X, and Z nuclei, and the median accessory nucleus. The DCN are organised by both somatotopy and modality, and have a diverse range of afferent inputs and projection targets. The functional organisation and connectivity of the DCN implicate them in a variety of sensorimotor functions, beyond their commonly accepted role in processing and transmitting somatosensory information to the thalamus, yet this is largely underappreciated in the literature. To consolidate insights into their sensorimotor functions, this review examines the morphology, organisation, and connectivity of the DCN and their associated nuclei. First, we briefly discuss the receptors, afferent fibres, and pathways involved in conveying tactile and proprioceptive information to the DCN. Next, we review the modality and somatotopic arrangements of the remaining constituents of the DCN‐complex. Finally, we examine and discuss the functional implications of the myriad of DCN‐complex projection targets throughout the diencephalon, midbrain, and hindbrain, in addition to their modulatory inputs from the cortex. The organisation and connectivity of the DCN‐complex suggest that these nuclei should be considered a complex integration and distribution hub for sensorimotor information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Neuroarchitecture of the central complex in the brain of the honeybee: neuronal cell types&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/55d91127-2eb5-4a5a-84a0-9398ca07362e/cne24941-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central complex (CX) in the insect brain is a higher order integration center that controls a number of behaviors, most prominently goal directed locomotion. The CX comprises the protocerebral bridge (PB), the upper division of the central body (CBU), the lower division of the central body (CBL), and the paired noduli (NO). Although spatial orientation has been extensively studied in honeybees at the behavioral level, most electrophysiological and anatomical analyses have been carried out in other insect species, leaving the morphology and physiology of neurons that constitute the CX in the honeybee mostly enigmatic. The goal of this study was to morphologically identify neuronal cell types of the CX in the honeybee &lt;i&gt;Apis mellifera&lt;/i&gt;. By performing iontophoretic dye injections into the CX, we traced 16 subtypes of neuron that connect a subdivision of the CX with other regions in the bee`s central brain, and eight subtypes that mainly interconnect different subdivisions of the CX. They establish extensive connections between the CX and the lateral complex, the superior protocerebrum and the posterior protocerebrum. Characterized neuron classes and subtypes are morphologically similar to those described in other insects, suggesting considerable conservation in the neural network relevant for orientation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The past decade has witnessed an explosion in applications for neural recording and stimulation in the treatment of clinical disorders. Neuromodulatory approaches are now a mainstay of care for essential tremor and Parkinson’s disease, and are expanding rapidly into a wide range of other neurological and psychiatric diseases. In parallel, advancements in endovascular approaches to cerebrovascular diseases have resulted in minimally invasive techniques that deliver devices to neural tissue in the central and peripheral nervous systems, with significantly improved safety and efficacy. In this review, we discuss the history of endovascular neural recording and stimulation, its current progress, and applications for neurological disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Deep Learning Provides Exceptional Accuracy to ECoG-Based Functional Language Mapping for Epilepsy Surgery</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00409</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The success of surgical resection in epilepsy patients depends on preserving functionally critical brain regions, while removing pathological tissues. Being the gold standard, electro-cortical stimulation mapping (ESM) helps surgeons in localizing the function of eloquent cortex through electrical stimulation of electrodes placed directly on the cortical brain surface. Due to the potential hazards of ESM, including increased risk of provoked seizures, electrocorticography based functional mapping (ECoG-FM) was introduced as a safer alternative approach. However, ECoG-FM has a low success rate when compared to the ESM. In this study, we address this critical limitation by developing a new algorithm based on deep learning for ECoG-FM and thereby we achieve an accuracy comparable to ESM in identifying eloquent language cortex. In our experiments, with 11 epilepsy patients who underwent presurgical evaluation (through deep learning-based signal analysis on 637 electrodes), our proposed algorithm obtained an accuracy of 83.05% in identifying language regions, an exceptional 23% improvement with respect to the conventional ECoG-FM analysis (∼60%). Our findings have demonstrated, for the first time, that deep learning powered ECoG-FM can serve as a stand-alone modality and avoid likely hazards of the ESM in epilepsy surgery. Hence, reducing the potential for developing post-surgical morbidity in the language function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Harmonization of Brain Diffusion MRI: Concepts and Methods</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00396</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00396</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;MRI diffusion data suffers from significant inter- and intra-site variability, which hinders multi-site and/or longitudinal diffusion studies. This variability may arise from a range of factors, such as hardware, reconstruction algorithms and acquisition settings. To allow a reliable comparison and joint analysis of diffusion data across sites and over time, there is a clear need for robust data harmonization methods. This review article provides a comprehensive overview of diffusion data harmonization concepts and methods, and their limitations. Overall, the methods for the harmonization of multi-site diffusion images can be categorized in two main groups: diffusion parametric map harmonization (DPMH) and diffusion weighted image harmonization (DWIH). Whereas DPMH harmonizes the diffusion parametric maps (e.g., FA, MD, and MK), DWIH harmonizes the diffusion-weighted images. Defining a gold standard harmonization technique for dMRI data is still an ongoing challenge. Nevertheless, in this paper we provide two classification tools, namely a feature table and a flowchart, which aim to guide the readers in selecting an appropriate harmonization method for their study.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Myriocin Effect on Tvrm4 Retina, an Autosomal Dominant Pattern of Retinitis Pigmentosa</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00372</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00372</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Tvrm4 mice, a model of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (RP), carry a mutation of Rhodopsin gene that can be activated by brief exposure to very intense light. Here, we test the possibility of an anatomical, metabolic, and functional recovery by delivering to degenerating Tvrm4 animals, Myriocin, an inhibitor of ceramide de novo synthesis previously shown to effectively slow down retinal degeneration in rd10 mutants (Strettoi et al., 2010; Piano et al., 2013). Different routes and durations of Myriocin administration were attempted by using either single intravitreal (i.v.) or long-term, repeated intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections. The retinal function of treated and control animals was tested by ERG recordings. Retinas from ERG-recorded animals were studied histologically to reveal the extent of photoreceptor death. A correlation was observed between Myriocin administration, lowering of retinal ceramides, and preservation of ERG responses in i.v. injected cases. Noticeably, the i.p. treatment with Myriocin decreased the extension of the retinal-degenerating area, preserved the ERG response, and correlated with decreased levels of biochemical indicators of retinal oxidative damage. The results obtained in this study confirm the efficacy of Myriocin in slowing down retinal degeneration in genetic models of RP independently of the underlying mutation responsible for the disease, likely targeting ceramide-dependent, downstream pathways. Alleviation of retinal oxidative stress upon Myriocin treatment suggests that this molecule, or yet unidentified metabolites, act on cellular detoxification systems supporting cell survival. Altogether, the pharmacological approach chosen here meets the necessary pre-requisites for translation into human therapy to slow down RP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Analyzing Brain Connectivity in the Mutual Regulation of Emotion–Movement Using Bidirectional Granger Causality</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Body language and movement are important media of emotional expression. There is an interactive physiological relationship between emotion and movement. Thus, we hypothesize that the emotional cortex interacts with the motor cortex during the mutual regulation of emotion and movement. And this interaction can be revealed by brain connectivity analysis based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signal processing. We proposed a brain connectivity analysis method: bidirectional long short-term memory Granger causality (bi-LSTM-GC). The theoretical basis of the proposed method was Granger causality estimation using a bidirectional LSTM recurrent neural network (RNN) for solving nonlinear parameters. Then, we compared the accuracy of the bi-LSTM-GC with other unidirectional connectivity methods. The results demonstrated that the information interaction existed among multiple brain regions (EEG 10-20 system) in the paradigm of emotion–movement regulation. The detected directional dependencies in EEG signals were mainly distributed from the frontal to the central region and from the prefrontal to the central–parietal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Crossing the Cleft: Communication Challenges Between Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Historically, neuroscience principles have heavily influenced artificial intelligence (AI), for example the influence of the perceptron model, essentially a simple model of a biological neuron, on artificial neural networks. More recently, notable recent AI advances, for example the growing popularity of reinforcement learning, often appear more aligned with cognitive neuroscience or psychology, focusing on function at a relatively abstract level. At the same time, neuroscience stands poised to enter a new era of large-scale high-resolution data and appears more focused on underlying neural mechanisms or architectures that can, at times, seem rather removed from functional descriptions. While this might seem to foretell a new generation of AI approaches arising from a deeper exploration of neuroscience specifically for AI, the most direct path for achieving this is unclear. Here we discuss cultural differences between the two fields, including divergent priorities that should be considered when leveraging modern-day neuroscience for AI. For example, the two fields feed two very different applications that at times require potentially conflicting perspectives. We highlight small but significant cultural shifts that we feel would greatly facilitate increased synergy between the two fields.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Neuroprotective Effects of Diabetes Drugs for the Treatment of Neonatal Hypoxia-Ischemia Encephalopathy</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The perinatal period represents a time of great vulnerability for the developing brain. A variety of injuries can result in death or devastating injury causing profound neurocognitive deficits. Hypoxic-ischemic neonatal encephalopathy (HIE) remains the leading cause of brain injury in term infants during the perinatal period with limited options available to aid in recovery. It can result in long-term devastating consequences with neurologic complications varying from mild behavioral deficits to severe seizure, intellectual disability, and/or cerebral palsy in the newborn. Despite medical advances, the only viable option is therapeutic hypothermia which is classified as the gold standard but is not used, or may not be as effective in preterm cases, infection-associated cases or low resource settings. Therefore, alternatives or adjunct therapies are urgently needed. Ongoing research continues to advance our understanding of the mechanisms contributing to perinatal brain injury and identify new targets and treatments. Drugs used for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have demonstrated neuroprotective properties and therapeutic efficacy from neurological sequelae following HIE insults in preclinical models, both alone, or in combination with induced hypothermia. In this short review, we have focused on recent findings on the use of diabetes drugs that provide a neuroprotective effect using in vitro and in vivo models of HIE that could be considered for clinical translation as a promising treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Effectiveness and Safety of Acupuncture for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00098</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00098</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: The effects of acupuncture on Alzheimer's disease (AD) outcomes remain controversial. The aim of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for the treatment of AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Chinese BioMedical Literature Database, VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang Data were searched to identify relevant randomized controlled trials from inception to January 19, 2019. Data were extracted and evaluated by two authors independently. The data analysis was conducted using R (version 3.6.0) and RStudio (version 1.2.1335) software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Thirty trials involving 2,045 patients were included. Acupuncture plus drug therapy may have been more beneficial for general cognitive function in AD patients than drug therapy alone (short-term treatment: MD, mean difference = 1.94, 95% CI: 1.11, 2.77; p &amp;lt; 0.01; medium-term treatment: MD = 4.41, 95% CI: 1.83, 7.00; p &amp;lt; 0.01). People who received acupuncture plus drug therapy attained higher ADL (Activities of Daily Living) scores than patients who received drug therapy alone for medium-term treatment duration (MD = −2.14; 95% CI: −3.69, −0.59; p &amp;lt; 0.01). However, there is no statistically significant difference in subgroup effect on MMSE (Mini-mental Status Examination) and ADLs (p &amp;gt; 0.05) when comparing acupuncture treatment with drug therapy (such as Donepezil hydrochloride, Nimodipine, or Yizhijiannao), or acupuncture plus drug therapy (such as Donepezil hydrochloride, Dangguishaoyaosan, or Jiannaosan) with drug therapy alone. There was also no significant difference in general cognitive function, ADLs, or incidence of adverse events between acupuncture treatment and drug therapy (p &amp;gt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: This review indicates that acupuncture plus drug therapy may have a more beneficial effect for AD patients than drug therapy alone on general cognitive function in the short and medium term and on ADLs in the medium term. Acupuncture alone may not have superior effects compared with drug therapy on global cognitive function, ADLs, and incidence of adverse events. Duration of treatment may not modify the effect of acupuncture in comparison with drug therapy. Additional large-scale and high-quality clinical trials are needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Cryo-EM structures and functional properties of CALHM channels of the human placenta</title>

	<description>The transport of substances across the placenta is essential for the development of the fetus. Here, we were interested in the role of channels of the calcium homeostasis modulator (CALHM) family in the human placenta. By transcript analysis, we found the paralogs CALHM2, 4, and 6 to be highly expressed in this organ and upregulated during trophoblast differentiation. Based on electrophysiology, we found that activation of these paralogs differs from the voltage- and calcium-gated channel CALHM1. Cryo-EM structures of CALHM4 display decameric and undecameric assemblies with large cylindrical pore, while in CALHM6 a conformational change has converted the pore shape into a conus that narrows at the intracellular side, thus describing distinct functional states of the channel. The pore geometry alters the distribution of lipids, which occupy the cylindrical pore of CALHM4 in a bilayer-like arrangement whereas they have redistributed in the conical pore of CALHM6 with potential functional consequences.</description>

	<title>eLife: The histone modification reader ZCWPW1 links histone methylation to PRDM9-induced double strand break repair</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.53459</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53459</link>
	<description>The histone modification writer Prdm9 has been shown to deposit H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 at future double-strand break (DSB) sites during the very early stages of meiosis, but the reader of these marks remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Zcwpw1 is an H3K4me3 reader that is required for DSB repair and synapsis in mouse testes. We generated H3K4me3 reader-dead Zcwpw1 mutant mice and found that their spermatocytes were arrested at the pachytene-like stage, which phenocopies the &lt;i&gt;Zcwpw1&lt;/i&gt; knock–out mice. Based on various ChIP-seq and immunofluorescence analyses using several mutants, we found that Zcwpw1's occupancy on chromatin is strongly promoted by the histone-modification activity of PRDM9. Zcwpw1 localizes to DMC1-labelled hotspots in a largely Prdm9-dependent manner, where it facilitates completion of synapsis by mediating the DSB repair process. In sum, our study demonstrates the function of ZCWPW1 that acts as part of the selection system for epigenetics-based recombination hotspots in mammals.</description>

	<description>The Triatominae are a vector species for &lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma cruzi&lt;/i&gt;, the aetiological agent of the neglected tropical Chagas disease. Their distribution stretches across Latin America, with some species occurring outside of the Americas. In particular, the cosmopolitan vector, &lt;i&gt;Triatoma rubrofasciata&lt;/i&gt;, has already been detected in many Asian and African countries. We applied an ensemble forecasting niche modelling approach to project the climatic suitability of 11 triatomine species under current climate conditions on a global scale. Our results revealed potential hotspots of triatomine species diversity in tropical and subtropical regions between 21°N and 24°S latitude. We also determined the climatic suitability of two temperate species (&lt;i&gt;T. infestans&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;T. sordida&lt;/i&gt;) in Europe, western Australia and New Zealand. &lt;i&gt;Triatoma rubrofasciata&lt;/i&gt; has been projected to find climatically suitable conditions in large parts of coastal areas throughout Latin America, Africa and Southeast Asia, emphasising the importance of an international vector surveillance program in these regions.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Keratinocytes are required for normal cold and heat sensation</title>

	<description>Keratinocytes are the most abundant cell type in the epidermis, the most superficial layer of the skin. Historically, epidermal-innervating sensory neurons were thought to be the exclusive detectors and transmitters of environmental stimuli. However, recent work from our lab and others has demonstrated that keratinocytes are also critical for normal mechanotransduction and mechanically-evoked behavioral responses in mice. Here, we asked whether keratinocyte activity is also required for normal cold and heat sensation. We first observed cold-induced activity in mouse, rat, hibernating 13-lined ground squirrel, and human keratinocytes and determined that keratinocyte cold activity is conserved across mammalian species. Next, using transgenic mouse tissues and pharmacological tools, we determined that keratinocyte cold responses require the release of intracellular calcium through one or more unknown cold-sensitive proteins. This cold-induced keratinocyte activity is required for normal cold sensation as optogenetic inhibition of epidermal cells reduced reflexive behavioral responses to cold stimuli. Keratinocyte inhibition also decreased reflexive behavioral responses to heat stimuli. Lastly, we demonstrated that epidermal ATP-P2X4 signaling is required for normal cold and heat sensation. Based on these data and our previous findings, keratinocyte purinergic signaling is a modality-conserved amplification system that is required for normal somatosensation in vivo.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Spontaneous activity changes in large-scale cortical networks in older adults couple to distinct hemodynamic morphology</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.05.079749v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Neurovascular coupling is a dynamic core mechanism supporting brain energy demand. Therefore, even spontaneous changes in neural activity not linked directly to goal-directed behavior are expected to evoke a vascular hemodynamic response (HDR). Here, we developed a novel procedure for estimating transient neural activity states based on source-localized electroencephalogram (EEG) in combination with HDR estimation based on simultaneously acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We demonstrate a readily apparent spatial correspondence between electrophysiological neural states and time-locked local HDR during rest, describing for the first time how features of neurovascular coupling may differ among unique large-scale brain networks. In the default mode network, the HDR pattern in our sample of older adults was associated with a structural surrogate marker of general cerebrovascular deterioration and predicted temporal disruption in electrophysiological activity linked to memory decline. These results demonstrate the potential of our integrated EEG/fMRI analysis for making inferences about neural and vascular processes in higher-level cognitive networks in healthy and at-risk populations.</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Haplotype of the astrocytic water channel AQP4 is associated with slow wave energy regulation in human NREM sleep</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000623</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Sara Marie Ulv Larsen, Hans-Peter Landolt, Wolfgang Berger, Maiken Nedergaard, Gitte Moos Knudsen, Sebastian Camillo Holst&lt;/p&gt;

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow through the brain parenchyma is facilitated by the astrocytic water channel aquaporin 4 (AQP4). Homeostatically regulated electroencephalographic (EEG) slow waves are a hallmark of deep non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and have been implicated in the regulation of parenchymal CSF flow and brain clearance. The human &lt;i&gt;AQP4&lt;/i&gt; gene harbors several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with AQP4 expression, brain-water homeostasis, and neurodegenerative diseases. To date, their role in sleep-wake regulation is unknown. To investigate whether functional variants in &lt;i&gt;AQP4&lt;/i&gt; modulate human sleep, nocturnal EEG recordings and cognitive performance were investigated in 123 healthy participants genotyped for a common eight-SNP &lt;i&gt;AQP4&lt;/i&gt;-haplotype. We show that this &lt;i&gt;AQP4&lt;/i&gt;-haplotype is associated with distinct modulations of NREM slow wave energy, strongest in early sleep and mirrored by changes in sleepiness and reaction times during extended wakefulness. The study provides the first human evidence for a link between AQP4, deep NREM sleep, and cognitive consequences of prolonged wakefulness.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/l_UpAu5nDhA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Expression profiling of precuneus layer III cathepsin D‐immunopositive pyramidal neurons in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease: Evidence for neuronal signaling vulnerability&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ad9c116f-ea25-4913-9132-463e541393e0/cne24929-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precuneus (PreC) layer III projection neurons, which contain lysosomal hydrolase cathepsin D (CatD) are dysfunctional in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Expression profiling of PreC CatD‐ positive layer III neurons revealed significant dysregulation of a mosaic of genes in tissue from subjects with mild cognitive impairment and AD that was not previously appreciated in terms of their indication of systems‐wide signaling defects in a key hub of the default mode memory network.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precuneus (PreC; Brodmann area 7), a key hub within the default mode network (DMN) displays amyloid and tau‐containing neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology during the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). PreC layer III projection neurons contain lysosomal hydrolase cathepsin D (CatD), a marker of neurons vulnerable to NFT pathology. Here we applied single population laser capture microdissection coupled with custom‐designed microarray profiling to determine the genetic signature of PreC CatD‐positive‐layer III neurons accrued from postmortem tissue obtained from the Rush Religious Orders Study (RROS) cases with a premortem clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. Expression profiling revealed significant differential expression of key transcripts in MCI and AD compared to NCI that underlie signaling defects, including dysregulation of genes within the endosomal‐lysosomal and autophagy pathways, cytoskeletal elements, AD‐related genes, ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors, cholinergic enzymes and receptors, markers of monoamine neurotransmission as well as steroid‐related transcripts. Pervasive defects in both MCI and AD were found in select transcripts within these key gene ontology categories, underscoring the vulnerability of these corticocortical projection neurons during the onset and progression of dementia. Select PreC dysregulated genes detected via custom‐designed microarray analysis were validated using qPCR. In summary, expression profiling of PreC CatD ‐positive layer III neurons revealed significant dysregulation of a mosaic of genes in MCI and AD that were not previously appreciated in terms of their indication of systems‐wide signaling defects in a key hub of the DMN.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Identification of Differentially Expressed Genes and Key Pathways in the Dorsal Root Ganglion After Chronic Compression</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuropathic pain (NP) is caused by primary or secondary impairment of the peripheral or central nervous systems. Its etiology is complex and involves abnormal patterns of gene expression and pathway activation. Using bioinformatics analysis, we aimed to identify NP-associated changes in genes and pathways in L4 and L5 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in a rat model of NP induced by chronic compression of the DRG (CCD). Genome-wide transcriptional analyses were used to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying NP. We screened differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 7 days after CCD in comparison with sham-operated controls. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blotting were used to confirm the presence of key DEGs. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)-pathway analysis of DEGs and global signal transduction network analysis of DEGs were also conducted. The CCD group developed clear mechanical and thermal allodynia in the ipsilateral hind paw compared with the sham group. This comparison identified 1,887 DEGs, with 1156 upregulated and 731 downregulated DEGs, and 123 DEG-enriched pathways. We identified the key candidate genes that might play a role in the development of NP, namely syndecan 1 (Sdc1), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit gamma (Pi3k), Janus kinase 2 (Jak2), jun proto-oncogene, AP-1 transcription factor subunit (Jun), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) by analyzing the global signal transduction network. RT-qPCR and western blot analysis confirmed the microarray results. The DEGs Sdc1, Pi3k, Jak2, Jun, and IL-6, and the cytokine signaling pathway, the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, the toll-like receptor signaling pathway, and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway may have decisive modulatory roles in both nerve regeneration and NP. These results provide deeper insight into the mechanism underlying NP and promising therapeutic targets for its treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Rbfox1 Is Expressed in the Mouse Brain in the Form of Multiple Transcript Variants and Contains Functional E Boxes in Its Alternative Promoters</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00066</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The RNA-binding protein RBFOX1 is an important regulator of neuron development and neuronal excitability. Rbfox1 is a dosage-sensitive gene and in both mice and humans, decreased expression of Rbfox1 has been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. Alternative promoters drive expression of Rbfox1 transcript isoforms that encode an identical protein. The tissue- and developmental stage-specific expression of these isoforms, as well as the underlying regulatory mechanisms, are, however, unclear. Here, we set out to capture all of the Rbfox1 transcript isoforms and identify transcriptional mechanisms that regulate brain-specific Rbfox1 expression. Isoform sequencing identified multiple alternative Rbfox1 transcript variants in the mouse cerebral cortex, including transcripts with novel first exons, alternatively spliced exons and 3′-truncations. Quantitative RT-PCR determined the expression of the alternative first exons in the developing cerebral cortex and different subregions of the juvenile brain. Alternative first exons were found to be highly stage- and subregion specific in their expression patterns suggesting that they fulfill specific functions during cortex development and in different brain regions. Using reporter assays we found that the promoter regions of the two first exons E1B and E1C/E1C.1 contain several functional E-boxes. Together, we provide an extensive picture of Rbfox1 isoform expression. We further identified important regulatory mechanisms that drive neuron-specific Rbfox1 expression. Thus, our study forms the basis for further research into the mechanisms that ensure physiological Rbfox1 expression in the brain. It also helps to understand why, in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders deletion of individual RBFOX1 transcript isoforms could affect brain function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: The Delta-Opioid Receptor; a Target for the Treatment of Pain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00052</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, pain represents one of the most important societal burdens. Current treatments are, however, too often ineffective and/or accompanied by debilitating unwanted effects for patients dealing with chronic pain. Indeed, the prototypical opioid morphine, as many other strong analgesics, shows harmful unwanted effects including respiratory depression and constipation, and also produces tolerance, physical dependence, and addiction. The urgency to develop novel treatments against pain while minimizing adverse effects is therefore crucial. Over the years, the delta-opioid receptor (DOP) has emerged as a promising target for the development of new pain therapies. Indeed, targeting DOP to treat chronic pain represents a timely alternative to existing drugs, given the weak unwanted effects spectrum of DOP agonists. Here, we review the current knowledge supporting a role for DOP and its agonists for the treatment of pain. More specifically, we will focus on the cellular and subcellular localization of DOP in the nervous system. We will also discuss in further detail the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in controlling the cellular trafficking of DOP, known to differ significantly from most G protein-coupled receptors. This review article will allow a better understanding of how DOP represents a promising target to develop new treatments for pain management as well as where we stand as of our ability to control its cellular trafficking and cell surface expression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Functional and Molecular Analysis of Proprioceptive Sensory Neuron Excitability in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00036</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurons located in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) are crucial for transmitting peripheral sensations such as proprioception, touch, temperature, and nociception to the spinal cord before propagating these signals to higher brain structures. To date, difficulty in identifying modality-specific DRG neurons has limited our ability to study specific populations in detail. As the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin (PV) is a neurochemical marker for proprioceptive DRG cells we used a transgenic mouse line expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) in PV positive DRGs, to study the functional and molecular properties of putative proprioceptive neurons. Immunolabeled DRGs showed a 100% overlap between GFP positive (GFP+) and PV positive cells, confirming the PVeGFP mouse accurately labeled PV neurons. Targeted patch-clamp recording from isolated GFP+ and GFP negative (GFP−) neurons showed the passive membrane properties of the two groups were similar, however, their active properties differed markedly. All GFP+ neurons fired a single spike in response to sustained current injection and their action potentials (APs) had faster rise times, lower thresholds and shorter half widths. A hyperpolarization-activated current (I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) was observed in all GFP+ neurons but was infrequently noted in the GFP− population (100% vs. 11%). For GFP+ neurons, I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; activation rates varied markedly, suggesting differences in the underlying hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (HCN) subunit expression responsible for the current kinetics. Furthermore, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) showed the HCN subunits 2, 1, and 4 mRNA (in that order) was more abundant in GFP+ neurons, while HCN 3 was more highly expressed in GFP− neurons. Likewise, immunolabeling confirmed HCN 1, 2, and 4 protein expression in GFP+ neurons. In summary, certain functional properties of GFP+ and GFP− cells differ markedly, providing evidence for modality-specific signaling between the two groups. However, the GFP+ DRG population demonstrates considerable internal heterogeneity when hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (HCN channel) properties and subunit expression are considered. We propose this heterogeneity reflects the existence of different peripheral receptors such as tendon organs, muscle spindles or mechanoreceptors in the putative proprioceptive neuron population.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Sensory Processing and Attention Profiles Among Children With Sensory Processing Disorders and Autism Spectrum Disorders</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00022</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00022</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This study explores the differences in the profile of relationships between sensory processing and attention abilities among children with sensory processing disorder (SPD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and typically developing (TD) children. The Test of Everyday Attention for Children (TEA-Ch), a performance-based measure of attention, was administered to 69 children (TD: n = 24; SPD: n = 21; ASD: n = 24), ages 6–10 years. All participants’ parents completed the Short Sensory Profile (SSP), a standardized parent-report measure of sensory-related behaviors. Discriminant analyses using the TEA-Ch and the SSP domains revealed two classification functions; the first revealed that both clinical groups significantly differed from the TD group with greater sensory processing challenges in the categories of auditory filtering, under-responsive/seeks sensation, low energy/weak, and taste/smell sensitivity subscales of the SSP. The second function discriminated between the two clinical groups, indicating that children with ASD had significantly greater control and sustained attention deficits and less sensory issues than did children with SPD. Together, the two functions correctly classified 76.8% of the participants as to their group membership. The different profiles of sensory processing and attention abilities in children with SPD and ASD may provide guidance in identifying appropriate individualized therapeutic strategies for these children.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Non-stationary Group-Level Connectivity Analysis for Enhanced Interpretability of Oddball Tasks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00446</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00446</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural responses of oddball tasks can be used as a physiological biomarker to evaluate the brain potential of information processing under the assumption that the differential contribution of deviant stimuli can be assessed accurately. Nevertheless, the non-stationarity of neural activity causes the brain networks to fluctuate hugely in time, deteriorating the estimation of pairwise synergies. To deal with the time variability of neural responses, we have developed a piecewise multi-subject analysis that is applied over a set of time intervals within the stationary assumption holds. To segment the whole stimulus-locked epoch into multiple temporal windows, we experimented with two approaches for piecewise segmentation of EEG recordings: a fixed time-window, at which the estimates of FC measures fulfill a given confidence level, and variable time-window, which is segmented at the change points of the time-varying classifier performance. Employing the weighted Phase Lock Index as a functional connectivity metric, we have presented the validation in a real-world EEG data, proving the effectiveness of variable time segmentation for connectivity extraction when combined with a supervised thresholding approach. Consequently, we performed a piecewise group-level analysis of electroencephalographic data that deals with non-stationary functional connectivity measures, evaluating more carefully the contribution of a link node-set in discriminating between the labeled oddball responses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Most Small Cerebral Cortical Veins Demonstrate Significant Flow Pulsatility: A Human Phase Contrast MRI Study at 7T</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00415</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Phase contrast MRI (pcMRI) has been used to investigate flow pulsatility in cerebral arteries, larger cerebral veins, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Such measurements of intracranial pulsatility and compliance are beginning to inform understanding of the pathophysiology of conditions including normal pressure hydrocephalus, multiple sclerosis, and dementias. We demonstrate the presence of flow pulsatility in small cerebral cortical veins, for the first time using pcMRI at 7 T, with the aim of improving our understanding of the hemodynamics of this little-studied vascular compartment. A method for establishing where venous flow is pulsatile is introduced, revealing significant pulsatility in 116 out of 146 veins, across eight healthy participants, assessed in parietal and frontal regions. Distributions of pulsatility index (PI) and pulse waveform delay were characterized, indicating a small, but statistically significant (p &amp;lt; 0.05), delay of 59 ± 41 ms in cortical veins with respect to the superior sagittal sinus, but no differences between veins draining different arterial supply territories. Measurements of pulsatility in smaller cortical veins, a hitherto unstudied compartment closer to the capillary bed, could lead to a better understanding of intracranial compliance and cerebrovascular (patho)physiology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Multi-Functionalized Self-Assembling Peptides as Reproducible 3D Cell Culture Systems Enabling Differentiation and Survival of Various Human Neural Stem Cell Lines</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural stem cells-based therapies have shown great potential for central nervous system regeneration, with three-dimensional (3D) culture systems representing a key technique for tissue engineering applications, as well as disease modeling and drug screenings. Self-assembling peptides (SAPs), providing biomimetic synthetic micro-environments regulating cellular functionality and tissue repair, constitute a suitable tool for the production of complex tissue-like structures in vitro. However, one of the most important drawbacks in 3D cultures, obtained via animal-derived substrates and serum-rich media, is the reproducibility and tunability of a standardized methodology capable to coax neural differentiation of different human cell lines. In this work we cultured four distinct human neural stem cell (hNSC) lines in 3D synthetic multifunctionalized hydrogel (named HYDROSAP) for up to 6 weeks. Three-dimensional cultures of differentiating hNSCs exhibited a progressive differentiation and maturation over time. All hNSCs-derived neurons in 3D culture system exhibited randomly organized entangled networks with increasing expression of GABAergic and glutamatergic phenotypes and presence of cholinergic ones. Oligodendrocytes formed insulating myelin sheaths positive for myelin basic protein (MBP). In summary, results demonstrated a successfully standardized and reproducible 3D cell culture system for hNSC differentiation and maturation in serum-free conditions useful for future therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Efficient Communication in Distributed Simulations of Spiking Neuronal Networks With Gap Junctions</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Investigating the dynamics and function of large-scale spiking neuronal networks with realistic numbers of synapses is made possible today by state-of-the-art simulation code that scales to the largest contemporary supercomputers. However, simulations that involve electrical interactions, also called gap junctions, besides chemical synapses scale only poorly due to a communication scheme that collects global data on each compute node. In comparison to chemical synapses, gap junctions are far less abundant. To improve scalability we exploit this sparsity by integrating an existing framework for continuous interactions with a recently proposed directed communication scheme for spikes. Using a reference implementation in the NEST simulator we demonstrate excellent scalability of the integrated framework, accelerating large-scale simulations with gap junctions by more than an order of magnitude. This allows, for the first time, the efficient exploration of the interactions of chemical and electrical coupling in large-scale neuronal networks models with natural synapse density distributed across thousands of compute nodes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Three-Dimensional Explant Platform for Studies on Choroid Plexus Epithelium</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00108</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The choroid plexus (CP) plays a major role in controlling the entry of substances and immune cells into the brain as it forms the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) in the brain ventricles. Dysregulated immune cell trafficking through the epithelial cell (EC) layer of CP is central for the pathogenesis of infectious diseases in the brain and many neurodegenerative disorders. In vitro studies elucidating the function of the CP have so far been limited to the monolayer culture of CP ECs. To mimic immune cell migration across the CP barrier, a three-dimensional model would be advantageous. Here, we present an in vitro platform for studies of the immune cell trafficking based on CP explants/organoids. The explants were generated from fragments of mouse CPs in Matrigel, where the cells formed luminal spaces and could be maintained in culture for at least 8 weeks. We demonstrate expression of the major CP markers in the explants, including transthyretin and aquaporin 1 as well as ZO1 and ICAM-1, indicating a capacity for secretion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and presence of tight junctions. CP explants displayed CP-like cell polarization and formed an intact EC barrier. We also show that the expression of transthyretin, transferrin, occludin and other genes associated with various functions of CP was maintained in the explants at similar levels as in native CP. By using dendritic cells and neutrophils, we show that the migration activity of immune cells and their interactions with CP epithelium can be monitored by microscopy. Thereby, the three-dimensional CP explant model can be used to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating immune cell migration through CP epithelium and other functions of choroid EC. We propose this platform can potentially be used in the search for therapeutic targets and intervention strategies to improve control of (drug) substances and (immune) cell entry into the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Function of P2X4 Receptors Is Directly Modulated by a 1:1 Stoichiometric Interaction With 5-HT3A Receptors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00106</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00106</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Interacting receptors at the neuronal plasma membrane represent an additional regulatory mode for intracellular transduction pathways. P2X4 receptor triggers fast neurotransmission responses via a transient increase in intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels. It has been proposed that the P2X4 receptor interacts with the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A receptor in hippocampal neurons, but their binding stoichiometry and the role of P2X4 receptor activation by ATP on this crosstalking system remains unknown. Via pull-down assays, total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy measurements of the receptors colocalization and expression at the plasma membrane, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging, we have demonstrated that P2X4/5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A receptor complexes can interact with each other in a 1:1 stoichiometric manner that is preserved after ATP binding. Also, macromolecular docking followed by 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations suggested that the interaction energy of the P2X4 receptor with 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A receptor is similar at the holo and the apo state of the P2X4 receptor, and the interacting 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A receptor decreased the ATP binding energy of P2X4 receptor. Finally, the P2X4 receptor-dependent Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; mobilization is inhibited by the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A interacting receptor. Altogether, these findings provide novel molecular insights into the allosteric regulation of P2X4/5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A receptor complex in lipid bilayers of living cells via stoichiometric association, rather than accumulation or unspecific clustering of complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Disc1 Carrier Mice Exhibit Alterations in Neural pIGF-1Rβ and Related Kinase Expression</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00094</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00094</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mutation of the disc1 gene underlies a broad range of developmental neuropsychiatric defects, including schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder. The pathophysiological phenotypes linked with disc1 mutation are due to the truncation of the DISC1 primary protein structure. This leads to a defective post-synaptic scaffolding and kinase—GSK3β and Erk1/2—signaling. As a result, synaptic function and maintenance are significantly impaired in the disc1 mutant brain. Among several other pathways, GSK3β and Erk1/2 are involved in insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1Rβ) kinase signaling. Although disc1 mutation alters these kinases, it is unclear if the mutation impacts IGF-1R expression and activity in the brain. Here, we demonstrate that the expression of active IGF-1Rβ (pIGF-1Rβ) is altered in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) of disc1 mutant mice and vary with the dose of the mutation (homozygous and heterozygous). The expression of pIGF-1Rβ decreased significantly in 129S (hom, disc1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;) brains. In contrast, 129S:B6 (het, disc1&lt;sup&gt;+/−&lt;/sup&gt;) brains were characterized by an increase in pIGF-1Rβ when compared with the C57BL/6 (disc1&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt;) level. The decrease in pIGF-1Rβ level for the 129S brains was accompanied by the loss of Akt activity (S473 pAkt) and decreased Ser9 phosphorylation of GSK3β (increased basal GSK3β). Additionally, hippocampal and cortical pErk1/2 activity increased in the 129S hippocampus and cortex. Although 129S:B6 recorded alterations in pIGF-1Rβ-pAkt-GSK3β (like 129S), there was no observable change in pErk1/2 activity for the heterozygote (disc1&lt;sup&gt;+/−&lt;/sup&gt;) mutant. In addition to GSK3β inhibition, we conclude that pIGF-1R, pAkt, and pErk1/2 are potential targets in disc1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mutant brain. On the other hand, pIGF-1R and pAkt can be further explored in disc1&lt;sup&gt;+/−&lt;/sup&gt; brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Aging Reduces Estradiol Protection Against Neural but Not Metabolic Effects of Obesity in Female 3xTg-AD Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00113</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00113</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Vulnerability to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is increased by several risk factors, including midlife obesity, female sex, and the depletion of estrogens in women as a consequence of menopause. Conversely, estrogen-based hormone therapies have been linked with protection from age-related increases in adiposity and dementia risk, although treatment efficacy appears to be affected by the age of initiation. Potential interactions between obesity, AD, aging, and estrogen treatment are likely to have significant impact on optimizing the use of hormone therapies in postmenopausal women. In the current study, we compared how treatment with the primary estrogen, 17β-estradiol (E2), affects levels of AD-like neuropathology, behavioral impairment, and other neural and systemic effects of preexisting diet-induced obesity in female 3xTg-AD mice. Importantly, experiments were conducted at chronological ages associated with both the early and late stages of reproductive senescence. We observed that E2 treatment was generally associated with significantly improved metabolic outcomes, including reductions in body weight, adiposity, and leptin, across both age groups. Conversely, neural benefits of E2 in obese mice, including decreased β-amyloid burden, improved behavioral performance, and reduced microglial activation, were observed only in the early aging group. These results are consistent with the perspective that neural benefits of estrogen-based therapies require initiation of treatment during early rather than later phases of reproductive aging. Further, the discordance between E2 protection against systemic versus neural effects of obesity across age groups suggests that pathways other than general metabolic function, perhaps including reduced microglial activation, contribute to the mechanism(s) of the observed E2 actions. These findings reinforce the potential systemic and neural benefits of estrogen therapies against obesity, while also highlighting the critical role of aging as a mediator of estrogens’ protective actions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Role of the Hippocampus During Logical Reasoning and Belief Bias in Aging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00111</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00111</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Reasoning requires initial encoding of the semantic association between premises or assumptions, retrieval of these semantic associations from memory, and recombination of information to draw a logical conclusion. Currently-held beliefs can interfere with the content of the assumptions if not congruent and inhibited. This study aimed to investigate the role of the hippocampus and hippocampal networks during logical reasoning tasks in which the congruence between currently-held beliefs and assumptions varies. Participants of younger and older age completed a series of syllogistic reasoning tasks in which two premises and one conclusion were presented and they were required to decide if the conclusion logically followed the premises. The belief load of premises was manipulated to be either congruent or incongruent with currently-held beliefs. Our whole-brain results showed that older adults recruited the hippocampus during the premise integration stage more than their younger counterparts. Functional connectivity using a hippocampal seed revealed that older, but not younger, adults recruited a hippocampal network that included anterior cingulate and inferior frontal regions when premises were believable. Importantly, this network contributed to better performance in believable inferences, only in older adults group. Further analyses suggested that, in older adults group, the integrity of the left cingulum bundle was associated with the higher rejection of believable premises more than unbelievable ones. Using multimodal imaging, this study highlights the importance of the hippocampus during premise integration and supports compensatory role of the hippocampal network during a logical reasoning task among older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Clinical Features and Experimental Models of Cerebral Small Vessel Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) refers to a group of disease conditions affecting the cerebral small vessels, which include the small arteries, arterioles, capillaries, and postcapillary venules in the brain. SVD is the primary cause of vascular cognitive impairment and gait disturbances in aged people. There are several types of SVD, though arteriolosclerosis, which is mainly associated with hypertension, aging, and diabetes mellitus, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) comprise most SVD cases. The pathology of arteriolosclerosis-induced SVD is characterized by fibrinoid necrosis and lipohyalinosis, while CAA-associated SVD is characterized by progressive deposition of amyloid beta (Aβ) protein in the cerebral vessels. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used for examination of SVD lesions; typical lesions are characterized by white matter hyperintensity, lacunar infarcts, enlargement of perivascular spaces (EPVS), microbleeds, cortical superficial siderosis (cSS), and cortical microinfarcts. The microvascular changes that occur in the small vessels are difficult to identify clearly; however, these consequent image findings can represent the SVD. There are two main strategies for prevention and treatment of SVD, i.e., pharmacotherapy and lifestyle modification. In this review, we discuss clinical features of SVD, experimental models replicating SVD, and treatments to further understand the pathological and clinical features of SVD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Clustering Analysis of Aging Diseases and Chronic Habits With Multivariate Time Series Electrocardiogram and Medical Records</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00095</guid>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;With recent technology, multivariate time-series electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis has played an important role in diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. However, discovering the association of wide range aging disease and chronic habit with ECG analysis still has room to be explored. This article mainly analyzes the possible relationship between common aging diseases or chorionic habits of medical record and ECG, such as diabetes, obesity, and hypertension, or the habit of smoking.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;In the research, we first conducted different ECG features, such as those of reduced binary pattern, waveform, and wavelet and then performed a k-means clustering analysis on the correlation between ECGs and the aforementioned diseases and habits, from which it is expected to find a firm association between them and the best characteristics that can be used for future research.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;In summary, we discovered a weak and strong evidence between ECG and medical records. For strong evidence, most patients with diabetes are always assigned into a specified group no matter the number of classes in the k-means clustering, which means we can find their association between them. For weak evidence, smokers, obesity, and hypertension have less unique ECG feature vector, enabling clustering them into specific groups, so the ECGs might be used to identify smokers, obesity, and hypertension. It is also interesting that we found obesity and hypertension, which are thought to be related to cardiovascular system. However, they are not highly correlated in our clustering analysis, which might indirectly tell us that the impact of obesity and hypertension to our body is various. In addition, the clustering effect of waveform feature is better than the other two methods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Hydrogen peroxide is the preeminent chemical weapon that organisms use for combat. Individual cells rely on conserved defenses to prevent and repair peroxide-induced damage, but whether similar defenses might be coordinated across cells in animals remains poorly understood. Here, we identify a neuronal circuit in the nematode &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; that processes information perceived by two sensory neurons to control the induction of hydrogen peroxide defenses in the organism. We found that catalases produced by &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, the nematode's food source, can deplete hydrogen peroxide from the local environment and thereby protect the nematodes. In the presence of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, the nematode's neurons signal via TGFβ-insulin/IGF1 relay to target tissues to repress expression of catalases and other hydrogen peroxide defenses. This adaptive strategy is the first example of a multicellular organism modulating its defenses when it expects to freeload from the protection provided by molecularly orthologous defenses from another species.</description>

	<description>The zebrafish was used to assess the impact of social isolation on behaviour and brain function. As in humans and other social species, early social deprivation reduced social preference in juvenile zebrafish. Whole-brain functional maps of anti-social isolated (lonely) fish were distinct from anti-social (loner) fish found in the normal population. These isolation-induced activity changes revealed profound disruption of neural activity in brain areas linked to social behaviour, social cue processing, and anxiety/stress. Several of the affected regions are modulated by serotonin, and we found that social preference in isolated fish could be rescued by acutely reducing serotonin levels.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55185</link>
	<description>Breakthroughs in anti-tumor immunity have led to unprecedented advances in immunotherapy, yet it is now clear that the tumor microenvironment (TME) restrains immunity. T cells must substantially increase nutrient uptake to mount a proper immune response and failure to obtain sufficient nutrients or engage the appropriate metabolic pathways can alter or prevent effector T cell differentiation and function. The TME, however, can be metabolically hostile due to insufficient vascular exchange and cancer cell metabolism that leads to hypoxia, depletion of nutrients, and accumulation of waste products. Further, inhibitory receptors present in the TME can inhibit T cell metabolism and alter T cell signaling both directly and through release of extracellular vesicles such as exosomes. This review will discuss the metabolic changes that drive T cells into different stages of their development and how the TME imposes barriers to the metabolism and activity of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54870</link>
	<description>Biological aging is the gradual, progressive decline in system integrity that occurs with advancing chronological age, causing morbidity and disability. Measurements of the pace of aging are needed as surrogate endpoints in trials of therapies designed to prevent disease by slowing biological aging. We report a blood-DNA-methylation measure that is sensitive to variation in pace of biological aging among individuals born the same year. We first modeled change-over-time in 18 biomarkers tracking organ-system integrity across 12 years of follow-up in n=954 members of the Dunedin Study born in 1972-1973. Rates of change in each biomarker over ages 26-38 years were composited to form a measure of aging-related decline, termed Pace-of-Aging. Elastic-net regression was used to develop a DNA-methylation predictor of Pace-of-Aging, called DunedinPoAm for Dunedin(P)ace(o)f(A)ging(m)ethylation. Validation analysis in cohort studies and the CALERIE trial provide proof-of-principle for DunedinPoAm as a single-time-point measure of a person's pace of biological aging.</description>

	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.54846</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54846</link>
	<description>We read jubmled wrods effortlessly, but the neural correlates of this remarkable ability remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that viewing a jumbled word activates a visual representation that is compared to known words. To test this hypothesis, we devised a purely visual model in which neurons tuned to letter shape respond to longer strings in a compositional manner by linearly summing letter responses. We found that dissimilarities between letter strings in this model can explain human performance on visual search, and responses to jumbled words in word reading tasks. Brain imaging revealed that viewing a string activates this letter-based code in the lateral occipital (LO) region and that subsequent comparisons to stored words are consistent with activations of the visual word form area (VWFA). Thus, a compositional neural code potentially contributes to efficient reading.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54781</link>
	<description>Cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor, also called insulin-like growth factor two receptor (CIM6P/IGF2R), plays important roles in growth and development, but is also extensively expressed in the mature nervous system, particularly in the hippocampus, where its functions are largely unknown. One of its major ligands, IGF2, is critical for long-term memory formation and strengthening. Using CIM6P/IGF2R inhibition in rats and neuron-specific knockdown in mice, here we show that hippocampal CIM6P/IGF2R is necessary for hippocampus-dependent memory consolidation, but dispensable for learning, memory retrieval, and reconsolidation. CIM6P/IGF2R controls the training-induced upregulation of &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; protein synthesis, including increase of Arc, Egr1, and c-Fos proteins, without affecting their mRNA induction. Hippocampal or systemic administration of mannose-6-phosphate, like IGF2, significantly enhances memory retention and persistence in a CIM6P/IGF2R-dependent manner. Thus, hippocampal CIM6P/IGF2R plays a critical role in memory consolidation by controlling the rate of training-regulated protein metabolism and is also a target mechanism for memory enhancement.</description>

	<title>eLife: Control of brown adipose tissue adaptation to nutrient stress by the activin receptor ALK7</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.54721</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54721</link>
	<description>Adaptation to nutrient availability is crucial for survival. Upon nutritional stress, such as during prolonged fasting or cold exposure, organisms need to balance the feeding of tissues and the maintenance of body temperature. The mechanisms that regulate the adaptation of brown adipose tissue (BAT), a key organ for non-shivering thermogenesis, to variations in nutritional state are not known. Here we report that specific deletion of the activin receptor ALK7 in BAT resulted in fasting-induced hypothermia due to exaggerated catabolic activity in brown adipocytes. After overnight fasting, BAT lacking ALK7 showed increased expression of genes responsive to nutrient stress, including the upstream regulator KLF15, aminoacid catabolizing enzymes, notably proline dehydrogenase (POX), and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), as well as markedly reduced lipid droplet size. In agreement with this, ligand stimulation of ALK7 suppressed POX and KLF15 expression in both mouse and human brown adipocytes. Treatment of mutant mice with the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486 restored KLF15 and POX expression levels in mutant BAT, suggesting that loss of BAT ALK7 results in excessive activation of glucocorticoid signaling upon fasting. These results reveal a novel signaling pathway downstream of ALK7 which regulates the adaptation of BAT to nutrient availability by limiting nutrient stress-induced overactivation of catabolic responses in brown adipocytes.</description>

	<description>Age-associated sterile inflammation can cause dysregulated choroidal neovascularization (CNV) as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Intraocular fluid screening of 234 AMD patients identified high levels of IL-4. The purpose of this study was to determine the functional role of IL-4 in CNV formation using murine CNV model. Our results indicate that the IL-4/IL-4 receptors (IL4Rs) controlled tube formation and global proangiogenic responses of bone marrow cells. CCR2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; bone marrow cells were recruited to form very early CNV lesions. IL-4 rapidly induces CCL2, which enhances recruitment of CCR2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; bone marrow cells. This in vivo communication, like quorum-sensing, was followed by the induction of IL-4 by the bone marrow cells during the formation of mature CNVs. For CNV development, IL-4 in bone marrow cells are critically required, and IL-4 directly promotes CNV formation mainly by IL-4R. The IL-4/IL-4Rα axis contributes to pathological angiogenesis through communications with bone marrow cells leading to retinal degeneration.</description>

	<title>eLife: Synergistic and antagonistic drug interactions in the treatment of systemic fungal infections</title>

	<description>Invasive fungal infections cause 1.6 million deaths annually, primarily in immunocompromised individuals. Mortality rates are as high as 90% due to limited treatments. The azole class antifungal, fluconazole, is widely available and has multi-species activity but only inhibits growth instead of killing fungal cells, necessitating long treatments. To improve treatment, we used our novel high-throughput method, the overlap&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; method (O2M) to identify drugs that interact with fluconazole, either increasing or decreasing efficacy. We identified 40 molecules that act synergistically (amplify activity) and 19 molecules that act antagonistically (decrease efficacy) when combined with fluconazole. We found that critical frontline beta-lactam antibiotics antagonize fluconazole activity. A promising fluconazole-synergizing anticholinergic drug, dicyclomine, increases fungal cell permeability and inhibits nutrient intake when combined with fluconazole. In vivo, this combination doubled the time-to-endpoint of mice with &lt;i&gt;Cryptococcus neoformans&lt;/i&gt; meningitis. Thus, our ability to rapidly identify synergistic and antagonistic drug interactions can potentially alter the patient outcomes.</description>

	<title>eLife: mRNA decapping is an evolutionarily conserved modulator of neuroendocrine signaling that controls development and ageing</title>

	<description>Eukaryotic 5’−3’ mRNA decay plays important roles during development and in response to stress, regulating gene expression post-transcriptionally. In &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, deficiency of DCAP-1/DCP1, the essential co-factor of the major cytoplasmic mRNA decapping enzyme, impacts normal development, stress survival and ageing. Here, we show that overexpression of &lt;i&gt;dcap-1&lt;/i&gt; in neurons of worms is sufficient to increase lifespan through the function of the insulin/IGF-like signaling and its effector DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor. Neuronal DCAP-1 affects basal levels of INS-7, an ageing-related insulin-like peptide, which acts in the intestine to determine lifespan. Short-lived &lt;i&gt;dcap-1&lt;/i&gt; mutants exhibit a neurosecretion-dependent upregulation of intestinal &lt;i&gt;ins-7&lt;/i&gt; transcription, and diminished nuclear localization of DAF-16/FOXO. Moreover, neuronal overexpression of DCP1 in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; confers longevity in adults, while neuronal DCP1 deficiency shortens lifespan and affects wing morphogenesis, cell non-autonomously. Our genetic analysis in two model-organisms suggests a critical and conserved function of DCAP-1/DCP1 in developmental events and lifespan modulation.</description>

	<title>eLife: Zebrafish macrophage developmental arrest underlies depletion of microglia and reveals Csf1r-independent metaphocytes</title>

	<description>Macrophages derive from multiple sources of hematopoietic progenitors. Most macrophages require colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), but some macrophages persist in the absence of CSF1R. Here, we analyzed &lt;i&gt;mpeg1&lt;/i&gt;:GFP–expressing macrophages in &lt;i&gt;csf1r&lt;/i&gt;-deficient zebrafish and report that embryonic macrophages emerge followed by their developmental arrest. In larvae, &lt;i&gt;mpeg1&lt;/i&gt;+ cell numbers then increased showing two distinct types in the skin: branched, putative Langerhans cells, and amoeboid cells. In contrast, although numbers also increased in &lt;i&gt;csf1r&lt;/i&gt;-mutants, exclusively amoeboid &lt;i&gt;mpeg1+ &lt;/i&gt;cells were present, which we showed by genetic lineage tracing to have a non-hematopoietic origin. They expressed macrophage-associated genes, but also showed decreased phagocytic gene expression and increased epithelial-associated gene expression, characteristic of metaphocytes, recently discovered ectoderm-derived cells. We further demonstrated that juvenile &lt;i&gt;csf1r&lt;/i&gt;-deficient zebrafish exhibit systemic macrophage depletion. Thus, Csf1r deficiency disrupts embryonic to adult macrophage development. Csf1r-deficient zebrafish are viable and permit analyzing the consequences of macrophage loss throughout life.</description>

	<description>The intermediate filament protein keratin 14 (K14) provides vital structural support in basal keratinocytes of epidermis. Recent studies evidenced a role for K14-dependent disulfide bonding in the organization and dynamics of keratin IFs in skin keratinocytes. Here we report that knock-in mice harboring a cysteine-to-alanine substitution at &lt;i&gt;Krt14&lt;/i&gt;'s codon 373 (C373A) exhibit alterations in disulfide-bonded K14 species and a barrier defect secondary to enhanced proliferation, faster transit time and altered differentiation in epidermis. A proteomics screen identified 14-3-3 as K14 interacting proteins. Follow-up studies showed that YAP1, a transcriptional effector of Hippo signaling regulated by 14-3-3sigma in skin keratinocytes, shows aberrant subcellular partitioning and function in differentiating &lt;i&gt;Krt14 &lt;/i&gt;C373A keratinocytes. Residue C373 in K14, which is conserved in a subset of keratins, is revealed as a novel regulator of keratin organization and YAP function in early differentiating keratinocytes, with an impact on cell mechanics, homeostasis and barrier function in epidermis.</description>

	<title>eLife: Protein phosphatase 1 activity controls a balance between collective and single cell modes of migration</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/52979</link>
	<description>Collective cell migration is central to many developmental and pathological processes. However, the mechanisms that keep cell collectives together and coordinate movement of multiple cells are poorly understood. Using the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; border cell migration model, we find that Protein phosphatase 1 (Pp1) activity controls collective cell cohesion and migration. Inhibition of Pp1 causes border cells to round up, dissociate, and move as single cells with altered motility. We present evidence that Pp1 promotes proper levels of cadherin-catenin complex proteins at cell-cell junctions within the cluster to keep border cells together. Pp1 further restricts actomyosin contractility to the cluster periphery rather than at individual internal border cell contacts. We show that the myosin phosphatase Pp1 complex, which inhibits non-muscle myosin-II (Myo-II) activity, coordinates border cell shape and cluster cohesion. Given the high conservation of Pp1 complexes, this study identifies Pp1 as a major regulator of collective versus single cell migration.</description>

	<title>eLife: Cortical excitability controls the strength of mental imagery</title>

	<description>Mental imagery provides an essential simulation tool for remembering the past and planning the future, with its strength affecting both cognition and mental health. Research suggests that neural activity spanning prefrontal, parietal, temporal, and visual areas supports the generation of mental images. Exactly how this network controls the strength of visual imagery remains unknown. Here, brain imaging and transcranial magnetic phosphene data show that lower resting activity and excitability levels in early visual cortex (V1-V3) predict stronger sensory imagery. Further, electrically decreasing visual cortex excitability using tDCS increases imagery strength, demonstrating a causative role of visual cortex excitability in controlling visual imagery. Together, these data suggest a neurophysiological mechanism of cortical excitability involved in controlling the strength of mental images.</description>

	<title>eLife: Controlling gene activation by enhancers through a drug-inducible topological insulator</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/47980</link>
	<description>While regulation of gene-enhancer interaction is intensively studied, its application remains limited. Here, we reconstituted arrays of CTCF-binding sites and devised a &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;ynthetic &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;opological &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;nsulator with &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;etO for &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;ch&lt;/span&gt;romatin-engineering (STITCH). By coupling STITCH with tetR linked to the KRAB domain to induce heterochromatin and disable the insulation, we developed a drug-inducible system to control gene activation by enhancers. In human induced pluripotent stem cells, STITCH inserted between &lt;i&gt;MYC&lt;/i&gt; and the enhancer down-regulated &lt;i&gt;MYC.&lt;/i&gt; Progressive mutagenesis of STITCH led to a preferential escalation of the gene-enhancer interaction, corroborating the strong insulation ability of STITCH. STITCH also altered epigenetic states around &lt;i&gt;MYC&lt;/i&gt;. Time-course analysis by drug induction uncovered deposition and removal of H3K27me3 repressive marks follows and reflects, but does not precede and determine, the expression change. Finally, STITCH inserted near &lt;i&gt;NEUROG2&lt;/i&gt; impaired the gene activation in differentiating neural progenitor cells. Thus, STITCH should be broadly useful for functional genetic studies.</description>

	<description>In 1982, John Hopfield published a neural network model for memory retrieval, a model that became a cornerstone in theoretical neuroscience. In a recent paper, Krotov and Hopfield built on these early studies and showed how a network that incorporates a biologically plausible learning rule governed by a Lyapunov function can effectively perform classification tasks.</description>

	<description>Weinstock et al. show that lysosomal GALC is required autonomously by Schwann cells to prevent psychosine formation, demyelination, and subsequent axonal degeneration. Macrophages independently require GALC to serve in phagocytosis and myelin turnover. HSCT likely exerts its therapeutic benefit by restoring phagocyte function rather than cross-correcting myelin cells of GALC.</description>

	<description>c9FTD/ALS and SCA36 are distinct diseases associated with similar hexanucleotide repeat expansions: G4C2 versus TG3C2. Todd et al. show that expressing these repeats in mice is sufficient to recapitulate each disease. The pathology and selective neurodegeneration characteristic of each disorder are therefore due to pathomechanisms intrinsic to each repeat sequence.</description>

In contrast to the symmetries of translation in space, rotation in space, and translation in time, the known laws of physics are not universally invariant under transformation of scale. However, a special case exists in which the action is scale invariant if it satisfies the following two constraints: 1) it must depend upon a scale-free Lagrangian, and 2) the Lagrangian must change under scale in the same way as the inverse time, 1t. Our contribution lies in the derivation of a generalised Lagrangian, in the form of a power series expansion, that satisfies these constraints. This generalised Lagrangian furnishes a normal form for dynamic causal models–state space models based upon differential equations–that can be used to distinguish scale symmetry from scale freeness in empirical data. We establish face validity with an analysis of simulated data, in which we show how scale symmetry can be identified and how the associated conserved quantities can be estimated in neuronal time series.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YizQiAJ3cF0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Christine A. Tataru, Maude M. David&lt;/p&gt;

Microbiomes are complex ecological systems that play crucial roles in understanding natural phenomena from human disease to climate change. Especially in human gut microbiome studies, where collecting clinical samples can be arduous, the number of taxa considered in any one study often exceeds the number of samples ten to one hundred-fold. This discrepancy decreases the power of studies to identify meaningful differences between samples, increases the likelihood of false positive results, and subsequently limits reproducibility. Despite the vast collections of microbiome data already available, biome-specific patterns of microbial structure are not currently leveraged to inform studies. Here, we derive microbiome-level properties by applying an embedding algorithm to quantify taxon co-occurrence patterns in over 18,000 samples from the American Gut Project (AGP) microbiome crowdsourcing effort. We then compare the predictive power of models trained using properties, normalized taxonomic count data, and another commonly used dimensionality reduction method, Principal Component Analysis in categorizing samples from individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and healthy controls. We show that predictive models trained using property data are the most accurate, robust, and generalizable, and that property-based models can be trained on one dataset and deployed on another with positive results. Furthermore, we find that properties correlate significantly with known metabolic pathways. Using these properties, we are able to extract known and new bacterial metabolic pathways associated with inflammatory bowel disease across two completely independent studies. By providing a set of pre-trained embeddings, we allow any V4 16S amplicon study to apply the publicly informed properties to increase the statistical power, reproducibility, and generalizability of analysis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/a2nNMPsolNE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

We present a flexible, open source R package designed to obtain biological and epidemiological insights from serological datasets. Characterising past exposures for multi-strain pathogens poses a specific statistical challenge: observed antibody responses measured in serological assays depend on multiple unobserved prior infections that produce cross-reactive antibody responses. We provide a general modelling framework to jointly infer infection histories and describe immune responses generated by these infections using antibody titres against current and historical strains. We do this by linking latent infection dynamics with a mechanistic model of antibody kinetics that generates expected antibody titres over time. Our aim is to provide a flexible package to identify infection histories that can be applied to a range of pathogens. We present two case studies to illustrate how our model can infer key immunological parameters, such as antibody titre boosting, waning and cross-reaction, as well as latent epidemiological processes such as attack rates and age-stratified infection risk.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fu5dew9vVUk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

It is difficult to predict how antibodies will behave when mixed together, even after each has been independently characterized. Here, we present a statistical mechanical model for the activity of antibody mixtures that accounts for whether pairs of antibodies bind to distinct or overlapping epitopes. This model requires measuring &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; individual antibodies and their n ( n - 1 ) 2 pairwise interactions to predict the 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; potential combinations. We apply this model to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies and find that the activity of antibody mixtures can be predicted without positing synergy at the molecular level. In addition, we demonstrate how the model can be used in reverse, where straightforward experiments measuring the activity of antibody mixtures can be used to infer the molecular interactions between antibodies. Lastly, we generalize this model to analyze engineered multidomain antibodies, where components of different antibodies are tethered together to form novel amalgams, and characterize how well it predicts recently designed influenza antibodies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kbknkvVoGHw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Agent-based and continuous models of hopper bands for the Australian plague locust: How resource consumption mediates pulse formation and geometry</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007820</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/Whep4EkEAXI/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrew J. Bernoff, Michael Culshaw-Maurer, Rebecca A. Everett, Maryann E. Hohn, W. Christopher Strickland, Jasper Weinburd&lt;/p&gt;

Locusts are significant agricultural pests. Under favorable environmental conditions flightless juveniles may aggregate into coherent, aligned swarms referred to as hopper bands. These bands are often observed as a propagating wave having a dense front with rapidly decreasing density in the wake. A tantalizing and common observation is that these fronts slow and steepen in the presence of green vegetation. This suggests the collective motion of the band is mediated by resource consumption. Our goal is to model and quantify this effect. We focus on the Australian plague locust, for which excellent field and experimental data is available. Exploiting the alignment of locusts in hopper bands, we concentrate solely on the density variation perpendicular to the front. We develop two models in tandem; an agent-based model that tracks the position of individuals and a partial differential equation model that describes locust density. In both these models, locust are either stationary (and feeding) or moving. Resources decrease with feeding. The rate at which locusts transition between moving and stationary (and vice versa) is enhanced (diminished) by resource abundance. This effect proves essential to the formation, shape, and speed of locust hopper bands in our models. From the biological literature we estimate ranges for the ten input parameters of our models. Sobol sensitivity analysis yields insight into how the band’s collective characteristics vary with changes in the input parameters. By examining 4.4 million parameter combinations, we identify biologically consistent parameters that reproduce field observations. We thus demonstrate that resource-dependent behavior can explain the density distribution observed in locust hopper bands. This work suggests that feeding behaviors should be an intrinsic part of future modeling efforts.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Whep4EkEAXI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Copy number variants (CNVs) are the gain or loss of DNA segments in the genome that can vary in dosage and length. CNVs comprise a large proportion of variation in human genomes and impact health conditions. To detect rare CNV associations, kernel-based methods have been shown to be a powerful tool due to their flexibility in modeling the aggregate CNV effects, their ability to capture effects from different CNV features, and their accommodation of effect heterogeneity. To perform a kernel association test, a CNV locus needs to be defined so that locus-specific effects can be retained during aggregation. However, CNV loci are arbitrarily defined and different locus definitions can lead to different performance depending on the underlying effect patterns. In this work, we develop a new kernel-based test called CONCUR (i.e., copy number profile curve-based association test) that is free from a definition of locus and evaluates CNV-phenotype associations by comparing individuals’ copy number profiles across the genomic regions. CONCUR is built on the proposed concepts of “copy number profile curves” to describe the CNV profile of an individual, and the “common area under the curve (cAUC) kernel” to model the multi-feature CNV effects. The proposed method captures the effects of CNV dosage and length, accounts for the numerical nature of copy numbers, and accommodates between- and within-locus etiological heterogeneity without the need to define artificial CNV loci as required in current kernel methods. In a variety of simulation settings, CONCUR shows comparable or improved power over existing approaches. Real data analyses suggest that CONCUR is well powered to detect CNV effects in the Swedish Schizophrenia Study and the Taiwan Biobank.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rHLtXWDqKmY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: The hydrophobic effect characterises the thermodynamic signature of amyloid fibril growth</title>

Many proteins have the potential to aggregate into amyloid fibrils, protein polymers associated with a wide range of human disorders such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. The thermodynamic stability of amyloid fibrils, in contrast to that of folded proteins, is not well understood: the balance between entropic and enthalpic terms, including the chain entropy and the hydrophobic effect, are poorly characterised. Using a combination of theory, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments, simulations of a coarse-grained protein model and meta-data analysis, we delineate the enthalpic and entropic contributions that dominate amyloid fibril elongation. Our prediction of a characteristic temperature-dependent enthalpic signature is confirmed by the performed calorimetric experiments and a meta-analysis over published data. From these results we are able to define the necessary conditions to observe cold denaturation of amyloid fibrils. Overall, we show that amyloid fibril elongation is associated with a negative heat capacity, the magnitude of which correlates closely with the hydrophobic surface area that is buried upon fibril formation, highlighting the importance of hydrophobicity for fibril stability.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0cgiOtsbdUY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Robustness and parameter geography in post-translational modification systems</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007573</guid>

Biological systems are acknowledged to be robust to perturbations but a rigorous understanding of this has been elusive. In a mathematical model, perturbations often exert their effect through parameters, so sizes and shapes of parametric regions offer an integrated global estimate of robustness. Here, we explore this “parameter geography” for bistability in post-translational modification (PTM) systems. We use the previously developed “linear framework” for timescale separation to describe the steady-states of a two-site PTM system as the solutions of two polynomial equations in two variables, with eight non-dimensional parameters. Importantly, this approach allows us to accommodate enzyme mechanisms of arbitrary complexity beyond the conventional Michaelis-Menten scheme, which unrealistically forbids product rebinding. We further use the numerical algebraic geometry tools Bertini, Paramotopy, and alphaCertified to statistically assess the solutions to these equations at ∼10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; parameter points in total. Subject to sampling limitations, we find no bistability when substrate amount is below a threshold relative to enzyme amounts. As substrate increases, the bistable region acquires 8-dimensional volume which increases in an apparently monotonic and sigmoidal manner towards saturation. The region remains connected but not convex, albeit with a high visibility ratio. Surprisingly, the saturating bistable region occupies a much smaller proportion of the sampling domain under mechanistic assumptions more realistic than the Michaelis-Menten scheme. We find that bistability is compromised by product rebinding and that unrealistic assumptions on enzyme mechanisms have obscured its parametric rarity. The apparent monotonic increase in volume of the bistable region remains perplexing because the region itself does not grow monotonically: parameter points can move back and forth between monostability and bistability. We suggest mathematical conjectures and questions arising from these findings. Advances in theory and software now permit insights into parameter geography to be uncovered by high-dimensional, data-centric analysis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2odOUeyZaqE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Many scientific disciplines rely on computational methods for data analysis, model generation, and prediction. Implementing these methods is often accomplished by researchers with domain expertise but without formal training in software engineering or computer science. This arrangement has led to underappreciation of sustainability and maintainability of scientific software tools developed in academic environments. Some software tools have avoided this fate, including the scientific library Rosetta. We use this software and its community as a case study to show how modern software development can be accomplished successfully, irrespective of subject area. Rosetta is one of the largest software suites for macromolecular modeling, with 3.1 million lines of code and many state-of-the-art applications. Since the mid 1990s, the software has been developed collaboratively by the RosettaCommons, a community of academics from over 60 institutions worldwide with diverse backgrounds including chemistry, biology, physiology, physics, engineering, mathematics, and computer science. Developing this software suite has provided us with more than two decades of experience in how to effectively develop advanced scientific software in a global community with hundreds of contributors. Here we illustrate the functioning of this development community by addressing technical aspects (like version control, testing, and maintenance), community-building strategies, diversity efforts, software dissemination, and user support. We demonstrate how modern computational research can thrive in a distributed collaborative community. The practices described here are independent of subject area and can be readily adopted by other software development communities.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-r4oTrychKM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Single-cell transcription analysis of &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium vivax&lt;/i&gt; blood-stage parasites identifies stage- and species-specific profiles of expression</title>

&lt;i&gt;Plasmodium vivax&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;falciparum&lt;/i&gt;, the parasites responsible for most human malaria worldwide, exhibit striking biological differences, which have important clinical consequences. Unfortunately, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vivax&lt;/i&gt;, unlike &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;falciparum&lt;/i&gt;, cannot be cultivated continuously in vitro, which limits our understanding of its biology and, consequently, our ability to effectively control vivax malaria. Here, we describe single-cell gene expression profiles of 9,215 &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vivax&lt;/i&gt; parasites from bloodstream infections of &lt;i&gt;Aotus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Saimiri&lt;/i&gt; monkeys. Our results show that transcription of most &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vivax&lt;/i&gt; genes occurs during short periods of the intraerythrocytic cycle and that this pattern of gene expression is conserved in other &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; species. However, we also identify a strikingly high proportion of species-specific transcripts in late schizonts, possibly associated with the specificity of erythrocyte invasion. Our findings provide new and robust markers of blood-stage parasites, including some that are specific to the elusive &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vivax&lt;/i&gt; male gametocytes, and will be useful for analyzing gene expression data from laboratory and field samples.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ssSM_xr9rPU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Different Cortical Gyrification Patterns in Alzheimer's Disease and Impact on Memory Performance</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25741?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25741?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study of cortical gyrification in Alzheimer's disease (AD) could help to further understanding of the changes undergone in the brain during neurodegeneration. Here, we aimed to study brain gyrification differences between healthy controls (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and AD patients, and explore how cerebral gyrification patterns were associated with memory and other cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We applied surface‐based morphometry techniques in 2 large, independent cross‐sectional samples, obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative project. Both samples, encompassing a total of 1,270 participants, were analyzed independently.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unexpectedly, we found that AD patients presented a more gyrificated entorhinal cortex than HC. Conversely, the insular cortex of AD patients was hypogyrificated. A decrease in the gyrification of the insular cortex was also found in older HC participants as compared with younger HC, which argues against the specificity of this finding in AD. However, an increased degree of folding of the insular cortex was specifically associated with better memory function and semantic fluency, only in AD patients. Overall, MCI patients presented an intermediate gyrification pattern. All these findings were consistently observed in the two samples.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The marked atrophy of the medial temporal lobe observed in AD patients may explain the increased folding of the entorhinal cortex. We additionally speculate regarding alternative mechanisms that may also alter its folding. The association between increased gyrification of the insular cortex and memory function, specifically observed in AD, could be suggestive of compensatory mechanisms to overcome the loss of memory function.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Premortem Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy Diagnoses in Professional Football</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25747?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25747?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American‐style football (ASF) has gained attention because of possible links between repetitive head injury and neurodegenerative diseases. Although postmortem pathologic changes consistent with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) have been reported in ASF players, there are currently no established premortem diagnostic criteria for CTE. Nevertheless, presented with symptoms of cognitive impairment, clinicians treating former players may be inclined to suggest CTE without a thorough exploration of comorbid factors that demonstrate similar clinical phenotypes to putative CTE.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A survey of 3,913 former ASF players aged 24 to 89 was conducted for those who responded by March 2019.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being a postmortem diagnosis, 108 players (2.8%) self‐reported clinician‐diagnosed CTE. The percentage of players under age 60 years reporting a CTE diagnosis was 2.3% versus 3.7% in participants age 60 or older. Comorbidities in participants self‐reporting CTE were significantly more common, including sleep apnea, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, indicators of past or current depression, hypertension, prescription pain medication use, heart conditions, and low testosterone when compared to non‐CTE respondents. Patterns of reporting for obesity, hypertension, heart conditions, or hypercholesterolemia differed between older and younger participants. Cognitive impairment symptoms were significantly higher in participants self‐reporting CTE.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some former professional football players have been clinically diagnosed with CTE, a postmortem condition. Comorbidities that can affect cognition were associated with CTE diagnoses in both older and younger players. Although underlying neuropathology cannot be ruled out, treatable conditions should be explored in former athletes demonstrating CTE‐linked clinical phenotypes or symptoms as a means of improving cognitive health in these patients.

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The sensory peripheral nervous system in the tail of a cephalochordate studied by serial blockface scanning electron microscopy&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c13914cf-e635-492c-8e6b-656c3c3af830/cne24913-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cephalochordates (amphioxus or lancelets) are basal in the phylum Chiordata and can exemplify the relatively simple developmental and anatomical starting conditions likely to have evolved into more complex vertebrate features. Here we use serial blockface scanning electron microscopy to reconstruct the sensory peripheral nervous system in the tail of a lancelet. The nerves (glial cell/neurite complexes) branch within the dermis and then exit to the epidermis to associate with the perikarya of two kinds of ciliated sensory neurons. The results indicate that cephalochordate neuroglia have an intramedullary origin. Moreover, we suggest that the peripheral nerves in the dermis are, at least in part, comparable to Rohon‐Beard cells of vertebrates, whereas, in contrast, the placode‐ and neural crest‐derived peripheral neurons of vertebrates are evolutionary novelties that appear to have supplanted the epidermal sensory receptors of cephalochordates.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serial blockface scanning electron microscopy (SBSEM) is used to describe the sensory peripheral nervous system (PNS) in the tail of a cephalochordate, &lt;i&gt;Asymmetron lucayanum&lt;/i&gt;. The reconstructed region extends from the tail tip to the origin of the most posterior peripheral nerves from the dorsal nerve cord. As peripheral nerves ramify within the dermis, all the nuclei along their course belong to glial cells. Invaginations in the glial cell cytoplasm house the neurites, an association reminiscent of the nonmyelinated Schwann cells of vertebrates. Peripheral nerves pass from the dermis to the epidermis via small fenestrae in the sub‐epidermal collagen fibril layer; most nerves exit abruptly, but a few run obliquely within the collagen fibril layer for many micrometers before exiting. Within the epidermis, each nerve begins ramifying repeatedly, but the branches are too small to be followed to their tips with SBSEM at low magnification (previous studies on other cephalochordates indicate that the branches end freely or in association with epidermal sensory cells). In &lt;i&gt;Asymmetron&lt;/i&gt;, two morphological kinds of sensory cells are scattered in the epidermis, usually singly, but sometimes in pairs, evidently the recent progeny of a single precursor cell. The discussion considers the evolution of the sensory PNS in the phylum Chordata. In cephalochordates, Retzius bipolar neurons with intramedullary perikarya likely correspond to the Rohon‐Beard cells of vertebrates. However, extramedullary neurons originating from ventral epidermis in cephalochordates (and presumably in ancestral chordates) contrast with vertebrate sensory neurons, which arise from placodes and neural crest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Mapping mesoscale cortical connectivity in monkey sensorimotor cortex with optical imaging and microstimulation&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/be792518-6c4e-471a-b15d-6b3cbe31eb1d/cne24918-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By combining intracortical electrical microstimulation (ICMS) with intrinsic optical imaging, we find that focal ICMS at single digit locations in monkey cortex (Areas 3a, 3b, 1, 2, and M1) reveals known anatomical connections. This novel method of studying cortical connections is in vivo, rapid, targeted, and mesoscale.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To map in vivo cortical circuitry at the mesoscale, we applied a novel approach to map interareal functional connectivity. Electrical intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) in conjunction with optical imaging of intrinsic signals (OIS) was used map functional connections in somatosensory cortical areas in anesthetized squirrel monkeys. ICMS produced activations that were focal and that displayed responses which were stimulation intensity dependent. ICMS in supragranular layers of Brodmann Areas 3b, 1, 2, 3a, and M1 evoked interareal activation patterns that were topographically appropriate and appeared consistent with known anatomical connectivity. Specifically, ICMS revealed Area 3b connections with Area 1; Area 1 connections with Areas 2 and 3a; Area 2 connections with Areas 1, 3a, and M1; Area 3a connections with Areas M1, 1, and 2; and M1 connections with Areas 3a, 1, and 2. These somatosensory connectivity patterns were reminiscent of feedforward patterns observed anatomically, although feedback contributions are also likely present. Further consistent with anatomical connectivity, intra‐areal and intra‐areal patterns of activation were patchy with patch sizes of 200–300 μm. In summary, ICMS with OIS is a novel approach for mapping interareal and intra‐areal connections in vivo. Comparisons with feedforward and feedback anatomical connectivity are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Gut Microbiome-Modified Polyphenolic Compounds Inhibit α-Synuclein Seeding and Spreading in α-Synucleinopathies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00398</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Misfolding, aggregation and deposition of α-synuclein (α-syn) are major pathologic characteristics of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and the related synucleinopathy, multiple system atrophy (MSA). The spread of α-syn pathology across brain regions is thought to play a key role in the onset and progression of clinical phenotypes. Thus, there is increasing interest in developing strategies that target and attenuate α-syn aggregation and spread. Recent studies of brain-penetrating polyphenolic acids, namely, 3-hydroxybenzoic acid (3-HBA), 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3,4-diHBA), and 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid (3-HPPA) that are derived from gut microbiota metabolism of dietary polyphenols, show in vitro ability to effectively modulate α-syn misfolding, oligomerization, and mediate aggregated α-syn neurotoxicity. Here we investigate whether 3-HBA, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA), 3,4-diHBA, or 3-HPPA interfere with α-syn spreading in a cell-based system. Using HEK293 cells overexpressing α-syn-A53T-CFP/YFP, we assessed α-syn seeding activity using Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) to detect and quantify α-syn aggregation. We demonstrated that 3-HPPA, 3,4-diHBA, 3-HBA, and 4-HBA significantly attenuated intracellular α-syn seeding aggregation. To determine whether our compounds could inhibit brain-derived seeding activity, we utilized insoluble α-syn extracted from post-mortem MSA or PD brain specimens. We found that 3-HPPA effectively attenuated MSA-induced aggregation of monomer into high molecular weight aggregates capable of inducing intracellular aggregation. Outcomes from our studies suggest interactions between gut microbiome and certain dietary factors may form the basis for effective therapies that modulate pathologic α-syn propagation. Collectively, our findings provide the basis for future developments of probiotic, prebiotic, or synbiotic approaches for modulating the onset and/or progression of α-synucleinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Intravascular flow stimulates PKD2 (polycystin-2) channels in endothelial cells to reduce blood pressure</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.56655</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56655</link>
	<description>PKD2 (polycystin-2, TRPP1), a TRP polycystin channel, is expressed in endothelial cells (ECs), but its physiological functions in this cell type are unclear. Here, we generated inducible, EC-specific &lt;i&gt;Pkd2&lt;/i&gt; knockout mice to examine vascular functions of PKD2. Data show that a broad range of intravascular flow rates stimulate EC PKD2 channels, producing vasodilation. Flow-mediated PKD2 channel activation leads to calcium influx that activates SK/IK channels and eNOS serine 1176 phosphorylation in ECs. These signaling mechanisms produce arterial hyperpolarization and vasodilation. In contrast, EC PKD2 channels do not contribute to acetylcholine-induced vasodilation, suggesting stimulus-specific function. EC-specific PKD2 knockout elevated blood pressure in mice without altering cardiac function or kidney anatomy. These data demonstrate that flow stimulates PKD2 channels in ECs, leading to SK/IK channel and eNOS activation, hyperpolarization, vasodilation and a reduction in systemic blood pressure. Thus, PKD2 channels are a major component of functional flow sensing in the vasculature.</description>

	<title>eLife: Parkin contributes to synaptic vesicle autophagy in Bassoon-deficient mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.56590</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56590</link>
	<description>Mechanisms regulating the turnover of synaptic vesicle (SV) proteins are not well understood. They are thought to require poly-ubiquitination and degradation through proteasome, endo-lysosomal or autophagy-related pathways. Bassoon was shown to negatively regulate presynaptic autophagy in part by scaffolding Atg5. Here, we show that increased autophagy in &lt;i&gt;Bassoon&lt;/i&gt; knockout neurons depends on poly-ubiquitination and that the loss of Bassoon leads to elevated levels of ubiquitinated synaptic proteins per se. Our data show that &lt;i&gt;Bassoon&lt;/i&gt; knockout neurons have a smaller SV pool size and a higher turnover rate as indicated by a younger pool of SV2. The E3 ligase Parkin is required for increased autophagy in &lt;i&gt;Bassoon&lt;/i&gt;-deficient neurons as the knockdown of &lt;i&gt;Parkin&lt;/i&gt; normalized autophagy and SV protein levels and rescued impaired SV recycling. These data indicate that Bassoon is a key regulator of SV proteostasis and that Parkin is a key E3 ligase in the autophagy-mediated clearance of SV proteins.</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Perceptual rivalry across animal species&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6be12f2c-add7-41b2-a269-4736b4974451/cne24939-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review in memoriam of Jack Pettigrew provides an overview of research into the phenomenon of perceptual rivalry, across a wide variety of species including insects, fish, reptiles and primates. Perceptual rivalry is characterized by spontaneous alternations in perceptual state in response to ambiguous or conflicting sensory input. We highlight several interesting commonalities across species and use a comparative approach to better understand how the brain suppresses opposing sensory signals and generates alternations in perceptual dominance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review in memoriam of Jack Pettigrew provides an overview of past and current research into the phenomenon of multistable perception across multiple animal species. Multistable perception is characterized by two or more perceptual interpretations spontaneously alternating, or rivalling, when animals are exposed to stimuli with inherent sensory ambiguity. There is a wide array of ambiguous stimuli across sensory modalities, ranging from the configural changes observed in simple line drawings, such as the famous Necker cube, to the alternating perception of entire visual scenes that can be instigated by interocular conflict. The latter phenomenon, called binocular rivalry, in particular caught the attention of the late Jack Pettigrew, who combined his interest in the neuronal basis of perception with a unique comparative biological approach that considered ambiguous sensation as a fundamental problem of sensory systems that has shaped the brain throughout evolution. Here, we examine the research findings on visual perceptual alternation and suppression in a wide variety of species including insects, fish, reptiles and primates. We highlight several interesting commonalities across species and behavioral indicators of perceptual alternation. In addition, we show how the comparative approach provides new avenues for understanding how the brain suppresses opposing sensory signals and generates alternations in perceptual dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Projections between visual cortex and pulvinar in the rat</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Projections between visual cortex and pulvinar in the rat&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/63fa418d-063f-4151-bf9e-01eee447c44d/cne24937-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the geniculocortical pathway which interconnects only between the lateral geniculate nucleus and primary visual cortex (V1), the pulvinar has long been known to interconnect with most if not all of visual cortex. Here we show that pulvinar interconnectivity is actually more dominant with higher visual cortex (V2) than with V1. Thus, the pulvinocortical pathway does not likely play as big a role in directly modulating V1 activity as previously thought.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extrageniculate visual pathway, which carries visual information from the retina through the superficial layers of the superior colliculus and the pulvinar, is poorly understood. The pulvinar is thought to modulate information flow between cortical areas, and has been implicated in cognitive tasks like directing visually guided actions. In order to better understand the underlying circuitry, we performed retrograde injections of modified rabies virus in the visual cortex and pulvinar of the Long‐Evans rat. We found a relatively small population of cells projecting to primary visual cortex (V1), compared to a much larger population projecting to higher visual cortex. Reciprocal corticothalamic projections showed a similar result, implying that pulvinar does not play as big a role in directly modulating rodent V1 activity as previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Serotonin distribution in the brain of the plainfin midshipman: substrates for vocal‐acoustic modulation and a reevaluation of the serotonergic system in teleost fishes&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/17436a0d-eb01-4635-a514-a024a7e21753/cne24938-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We comprehensively characterized 5‐HT‐immunoreactive (−ir) innervation throughout the brain of &lt;i&gt;Porichthys notatus&lt;/i&gt;, plainfin midshipman fish, including well‐delineated vocal and auditory nuclei. We report neuroanatomical heterogeneity in populations of the serotonergic raphe nuclei of the brainstem reticular formation, with three discrete subregions in the superior raphe, an intermediate 5‐HT‐ir cell cluster, and an extensive inferior raphe population. This comprehensive atlas offers new insights into the organization of 5‐HT nuclei in teleosts and provides neuroanatomical evidence for serotonin as a modulator of vocal‐acoustic circuitry and behavior in midshipman fish, consistent with findings in vocal tetrapods.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serotonin (5‐HT) is a modulator of neural circuitry underlying motor patterning, homeostatic control, and social behavior. While previous studies have described 5‐HT distribution in various teleosts, serotonergic raphe subgroups in fish are not well defined and therefore remain problematic for cross‐species comparisons. Here we used the plainfin midshipman fish, &lt;i&gt;Porichthys notatus&lt;/i&gt;, a well‐studied model for investigating the neural and hormonal mechanisms of vertebrate vocal‐acoustic communication, to redefine raphe subgroups based on both stringent neuroanatomical landmarks as well as quantitative cell measurements. In addition, we comprehensively characterized 5‐HT‐immunoreactive (−ir) innervation throughout the brain, including well‐delineated vocal and auditory nuclei. We report neuroanatomical heterogeneity in populations of the serotonergic raphe nuclei of the brainstem reticular formation, with three discrete subregions in the superior raphe, an intermediate 5‐HT‐ir cell cluster, and an extensive inferior raphe population. 5‐HT‐ir neurons were also observed within the vocal motor nucleus, forming putative contacts on those cells. In addition, three major 5‐HT‐ir cell groups were identified in the hypothalamus and one group in the pretectum. Significant 5‐HT‐ir innervation was found in components of the vocal pattern generator and cranial motor nuclei. All vocal midbrain nuclei showed considerable 5‐HT‐ir innervation, as did thalamic and hindbrain auditory and lateral line areas and vocal‐acoustic integration sites in the preoptic area and ventral telencephalon. This comprehensive atlas offers new insights into the organization of 5‐HT nuclei in teleosts and provides neuroanatomical evidence for serotonin as a modulator of vocal‐acoustic circuitry and behavior in midshipman fish, consistent with findings in vocal tetrapods.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Inference on dengue epidemics with Bayesian regime switching models</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jue Tao Lim, Borame Sue Dickens, Sun Haoyang, Ng Lee Ching, Alex Richard Cook&lt;/p&gt;

Dengue, a mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by the dengue viruses, is present in many parts of the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. All four serotypes of dengue viruses are endemic in Singapore, an equatorial city-state. Frequent outbreaks occur, sometimes leading to national epidemics. However, few studies have attempted to characterize breakpoints which precede large rises in dengue case counts. In this paper, Bayesian regime switching (BRS) models were employed to infer epidemic and endemic regimes of dengue transmissions, each containing regime specific autoregressive processes which drive the growth and decline of dengue cases, estimated using a custom built multi-move Gibbs sampling algorithm. Posterior predictive checks indicate that BRS replicates temporal trends in Dengue transmissions well and nowcast accuracy assessed using a post-hoc classification scheme showed that BRS classification accuracy is robust even under limited data with the AUC-ROC at 0.935. LASSO-based regression and bootstrapping was used to account for plausibly high dimensions of climatic factors affecting Dengue transmissions, which was then estimated using cross-validation to conduct statistical inference on long-run climatic effects on the estimated regimes. BRS estimates epidemic and endemic regimes of dengue in Singapore which are characterized by persistence across time, lasting an average of 20 weeks and 66 weeks respectively, with a low probability of transitioning away from their regimes. Climate analysis with LASSO indicates that long-run climatic effects up to 20 weeks ago do not differentiate epidemic and endemic regimes. Lastly, by fitting BRS to simulated disease data generated from a stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model, mechanistic links between infectivity and regimes classified using BRS were provided. The model proposed could be applied to other localities and diseases under minimal data requirements where transmission counts over time are collected.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/01A53YC4CA4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Intrinsic and Extrinsic Mechanisms of Thalamic Pathology in Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25743?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thalamic atrophy is among the earliest brain changes detected in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and the degree of thalamic atrophy is a strong predictor of disability progression. The causes of thalamic atrophy are not fully understood. Here, we investigate the contributions of thalamic demyelinated lesions, thalamic neuronal loss, and cerebral white matter (WM) lesions to thalamic volume.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used postmortem in situ magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 95 subjects with MS to correlate thalamic lesion volumes with global MRI metrics. We histologically characterized thalamic demyelination patterns and compared neuronal loss and neuritic pathology in the thalami with the extremes of volume.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grossly apparent thalamic discolorations in cm‐thick brain slices were T2/fluid‐attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintense, T1‐hypointense, and appeared as perivascular demyelinated lesions with dystrophic neurons/axons. Subependymal demyelinated lesions with axonal loss and microglial/macrophage activation were also observed. The 12 subjects with the least thalamic volume had a 17.6% reduction of median neuronal density in the dorsomedial/ventrolateral and pulvinar nuclei compared with the 14 subjects with the greatest thalamic volume (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03). After correcting for age, disease duration, sex, and T2 lesion volume, the total (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.20), ovoid (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.31), or subependymal (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.44) MRI thalamic lesion volumes correlated with thalamic volume. Thalamic volume correlated with cerebral T2 lesion volume (Spearman’s rho = −0.65, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001 after correcting for age, disease duration, and sex).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest the degeneration of efferent/afferent thalamic projections and/or a neurodegenerative process as greater contributors to thalamic atrophy than thalamic demyelinating lesions. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This study describes the anatomy of a cell bridge (CB) variant consisting of the fusion of the mouse nodose ganglion (NG) and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG). This anastomosis was tubular‐shaped and significantly more prevalent in the ganglionic masses from males (38%) than females (21%). It contained a mixed of vagal afferents (blue, TH‐positive and Hand2‐ and isolectin B4‐negative; purple, TH‐ and Hand2‐negative and isolectin B4‐positive; grey, TH‐ and Hand2‐ and isolectin B4‐negative) and postganglionic sympathetic neurons (green,TH‐ and Hand2‐positive). The two populations of neurons abruptly replaced each other in the middle of the cell bridge. The practical implications of our observations are discussed with respect to studies of the mouse vagal afferents, an area of research of increasing popularity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While autonomic ganglia have been extensively studied in rats instead of mice, there is renewed interest in the anatomy of the mouse autonomic nervous system. This study examined the prevalence and anatomical features of a cell bridge linking two autonomic ganglia of the neck, namely, the nodose ganglion (NG) and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) in a cohort of C57BL/6J mice. We identified a cell bridge between the NG and the cranial pole of the SCG. This cell bridge was tubular‐shaped with an average length and width of 700 and 240 μm, respectively. The cell bridge was frequently unilateral and significantly more prevalent in the ganglionic masses from males (38%) than females (21%). On each of its extremities, it contained a mixed of vagal afferents and postganglionic sympathetic neurons. The two populations of neurons abruptly replaced each other in the middle of the cell bridge. We examined the mRNA expression for selected autonomic markers in samples of the NG with or without cell bridge. Our results indicated that the cell bridge was enriched in both markers of postganglionic sympathetic and vagal afferents neurons. Lastly, using FluoroGold microinjection into the NG, we found that the existence of a cell bridge may occasionally lead to the inadvertent contamination of the SCG. In summary, this study describes the anatomy of a cell bridge variant consisting of the fusion of the mouse NG and SCG. The practical implications of our observations are discussed with respect to studies of the mouse vagal afferents, an area of research of increasing popularity.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>People organize and convey their thoughts according to narratives. However, neuroscientists are often reluctant to incorporate narrative stimuli into their experiments. We argue that narratives deserve wider adoption in human neuroscience because they tap into the brain’s native machinery for representing the world and provide rich variability for testing hypotheses.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Tracheal branching in ants is area-decreasing, violating a central assumption of network transport models</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Ian J. Aitkenhead, Grant A. Duffy, Citsabehsan Devendran, Michael R. Kearney, Adrian Neild, Steven L. Chown&lt;/p&gt;

The structure of tubular transport networks is thought to underlie much of biological regularity, from individuals to ecosystems. A core assumption of transport network models is either area-preserving or area-increasing branching, such that the summed cross-sectional area of all child branches is equal to or greater than the cross-sectional area of their respective parent branch. For insects, the most diverse group of animals, the assumption of area-preserving branching of tracheae is, however, based on measurements of a single individual and an assumption of gas exchange by diffusion. Here we show that ants exhibit neither area-preserving nor area-increasing branching in their abdominal tracheal systems. We find for 20 species of ants that the sum of child tracheal cross-sectional areas is typically less than that of the parent branch (area-decreasing). The radius, rather than the area, of the parent branch is conserved across the sum of child branches. Interpretation of the tracheal system as one optimized for the release of carbon dioxide, while readily catering to oxygen demand, explains the branching pattern. Our results, together with widespread demonstration that gas exchange in insects includes, and is often dominated by, convection, indicate that for generality, network transport models must include consideration of systems with different architectures.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VNpmP5-VtJc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Cells in microbial colonies integrate information across multiple spatial and temporal scales while sensing environmental cues. A number of photosynthetic cyanobacteria respond in a directional manner to incident light, resulting in the phototaxis of individual cells. Colonies of such bacteria exhibit large-scale changes in morphology, arising from cell-cell interactions, during phototaxis. These interactions occur through type IV pili-mediated physical contacts between cells, as well as through the secretion of complex polysaccharides (‘slime’) that facilitates cell motion. Here, we describe a computational model for such collective behaviour in colonies of the cyanobacterium &lt;i&gt;Synechocystis&lt;/i&gt;. The model is designed to replicate observations from recent experiments on the emergent response of the colonies to varied light regimes. It predicts the complex colony morphologies that arise as a result. We ask if changes in colony morphology during phototaxis can be used to infer if cells integrate information from multiple light sources simultaneously, or respond to these light sources separately at each instant of time. We find that these two scenarios cannot be distinguished from the shapes of colonies alone. However, we show that tracking the trajectories of individual cyanobacteria provides a way of determining their mode of response. Our model allows us to address the emergent nature of this class of collective bacterial motion, linking individual cell response to the dynamics of colony shape.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KpgkhEb1cf0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Insight into the protein solubility driving forces with neural attention</title>

Protein solubility is a key aspect for many biotechnological, biomedical and industrial processes, such as the production of active proteins and antibodies. In addition, understanding the molecular determinants of the solubility of proteins may be crucial to shed light on the molecular mechanisms of diseases caused by aggregation processes such as amyloidosis. Here we present SKADE, a novel Neural Network protein solubility predictor and we show how it can provide novel insight into the protein solubility mechanisms, thanks to its neural attention architecture. First, we show that SKADE positively compares with state of the art tools while using just the protein sequence as input. Then, thanks to the neural attention mechanism, we use SKADE to investigate the patterns learned during training and we analyse its decision process. We use this peculiarity to show that, while the attention profiles do not correlate with obvious sequence aspects such as biophysical properties of the aminoacids, they suggest that N- and C-termini are the most relevant regions for solubility prediction and are predictive for complex emergent properties such as aggregation-prone regions involved in beta-amyloidosis and contact density. Moreover, SKADE is able to identify mutations that increase or decrease the overall solubility of the protein, allowing it to be used to perform large scale in-silico mutagenesis of proteins in order to maximize their solubility.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/deKSGXkO29A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Inferring a simple mechanism for alpha-blocking by fitting a neural population model to EEG spectra</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Agus Hartoyo, Peter J. Cadusch, David T. J. Liley, Damien G. Hicks&lt;/p&gt;

Alpha blocking, a phenomenon where the alpha rhythm is reduced by attention to a visual, auditory, tactile or cognitive stimulus, is one of the most prominent features of human electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Here we identify a simple physiological mechanism by which opening of the eyes causes attenuation of the alpha rhythm. We fit a neural population model to EEG spectra from 82 subjects, each showing a different degree of alpha blocking upon opening of their eyes. Though it has been notoriously difficult to estimate parameters by fitting such models, we show how, by regularizing the differences in parameter estimates between eyes-closed and eyes-open states, we can reduce the uncertainties in these differences without significantly compromising fit quality. From this emerges a parsimonious explanation for the spectral differences between states: Changes to just a single parameter, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;ei&lt;/sub&gt;, corresponding to the strength of a tonic excitatory input to the inhibitory cortical population, are sufficient to explain the reduction in alpha rhythm upon opening of the eyes. We detect this by comparing the shift in each model parameter between eyes-closed and eyes-open states. Whereas changes in most parameters are weak or negligible and do not scale with the degree of alpha attenuation across subjects, the change in &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;ei&lt;/sub&gt; increases monotonically with the degree of alpha blocking observed. These results indicate that opening of the eyes reduces alpha activity by increasing external input to the inhibitory cortical population.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/o85Qi_mROIs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Extensive evidence links &lt;i&gt;Glutamate receptor&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ionotropic&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;NMDA2B&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;GRIN2B&lt;/i&gt;), encoding the GluN2B/NR2B subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), with various neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In addition, it remains unknown whether mutations in GluN2B, which starts to be expressed early in development, induces early pathophysiology that can be corrected by early treatments for long-lasting effects. We generated and characterized &lt;i&gt;Grin2b&lt;/i&gt;-mutant mice that carry a heterozygous, ASD-risk C456Y mutation (&lt;i&gt;Grin2b&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/C456Y&lt;/sup&gt;). In &lt;i&gt;Grin2b&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/C456Y&lt;/sup&gt; mice, GluN2B protein levels were strongly reduced in association with decreased hippocampal NMDAR currents and NMDAR-dependent long-term depression (LTD) but unaltered long-term potentiation, indicative of mutation-induced protein degradation and LTD sensitivity. Behaviorally, &lt;i&gt;Grin2b&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/C456Y&lt;/sup&gt; mice showed normal social interaction but exhibited abnormal anxiolytic-like behavior. Importantly, early, but not late, treatment of young &lt;i&gt;Grin2b&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/C456Y&lt;/sup&gt; mice with the NMDAR agonist D-cycloserine rescued NMDAR currents and LTD in juvenile mice and improved anxiolytic-like behavior in adult mice. Therefore, GluN2B-C456Y haploinsufficiency decreases GluN2B protein levels, NMDAR-dependent LTD, and anxiety-like behavior, and early activation of NMDAR function has long-lasting effects on adult mouse behavior.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/p73rXGnuhRM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Left Prefrontal Connectivity Links Subthalamic Stimulation with Depressive Symptoms</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25734?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25734?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN‐DBS) in Parkinson's disease (PD) not only stimulates focal target structures but also affects distributed brain networks. The impact this network modulation has on non‐motor DBS effects is not well‐characterized. By focusing on the affective domain, we systematically investigate the impact of electrode placement and associated structural connectivity on changes in depressive symptoms following STN‐DBS, which have been reported to improve, worsen, or remain unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depressive symptoms before and after STN‐DBS surgery were documented in 116 patients with PD from 3 DBS centers (Berlin, Queensland, and Cologne). Based on individual electrode reconstructions, the volumes of tissue activated (VTAs) were estimated and combined with normative connectome data to identify structural connections passing through VTAs. Berlin and Queensland cohorts formed a training and cross‐validation dataset used to identify structural connectivity explaining change in depressive symptoms. The Cologne data served as the test‐set for which depressive symptom change was predicted.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structural connectivity was linked to depressive symptom change under STN‐DBS. An optimal connectivity map trained on the Berlin cohort could predict changes in depressive symptoms in Queensland patients and vice versa. Furthermore, the joint training‐set map predicted changes in depressive symptoms in the independent test‐set. Worsening of depressive symptoms was associated with left prefrontal connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fibers connecting the electrode with left prefrontal areas were associated with worsening of depressive symptoms. Our results suggest that for the left STN‐DBS lead, placement impacting fibers to left prefrontal areas should be avoided to maximize improvement of depressive symptoms.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Neurosurgical Intervention for Supratentorial Intracerebral Hemorrhage</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25732?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25732?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect of surgical treatment for supratentorial spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and whether it is modified by key baseline characteristics and timing remains uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed a systematic review and meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials of surgical treatment of supratentorial spontaneous ICH aimed at clot removal. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases up to February 21, 2019. Primary outcome was good functional outcome at follow‐up; secondary outcomes were death and serious adverse events. We analyzed all types of surgery combined and minimally invasive approaches separately. We pooled risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals and assessed the modifying effect of age, Glasgow Coma Scale, hematoma volume, and timing of surgery with meta‐regression analysis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We included 21 studies with 4,145 patients; 4 (19%) were of the highest quality. Risk ratio of good functional outcome after any type of surgery was 1.40 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.22–1.60, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; = 46%, 20 studies), and after minimally invasive surgery it was 1.47 (95% CI = 1.26–1.72, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; = 47%, 12 studies). For death, the risk ratio for any type of surgery was 0.77 (95% CI = 0.68–0.85, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; = 23%, 21 studies), and for minimally invasive surgery it was 0.68 (95% CI = 0.56–0.83, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; = 14%, 13 studies). Serious adverse events were reported infrequently. Surgery seemed more effective when performed sooner after symptom onset (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04, 12 studies). Age, Glasgow Coma Scale, and hematoma volume did not modify the effect of surgery.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surgical treatment of supratentorial spontaneous ICH may be beneficial, in particular with minimally invasive procedures and when performed soon after symptom onset. Further well‐designed randomized trials are needed to demonstrate whether (minimally invasive) surgery improves functional outcome after ICH and to determine the optimal time window of the treatment after symptom onset.

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The connectome of the Caenorhabditis elegans pharynx&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/56074481-229f-4d5a-8192-33e658af7a07/cne24932-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detailed anatomical maps of individual organs and entire animals have served as invaluable entry points for ensuing dissection of their evolution, development, and function. The pharynx of the nematode &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; is a simple neuromuscular organ with a self‐contained, autonomously acting nervous system, composed of 20 neurons that fall into 14 anatomically distinct types. Using serial EM reconstruction, we re‐evaluate here the connectome of the pharyngeal nervous system, providing a novel and more detailed view of its structure and predicted function. Contrasting the previous classification of pharyngeal neurons into distinct inter‐ and motor neuron classes, we provide evidence that most pharyngeal neurons are also likely sensory neurons and most, if not all, pharyngeal neurons also classify as motor neurons. Together with the extensive cross‐connectivity among pharyngeal neurons, which is more widespread than previously realized, the sensory‐motor characteristics of most neurons define a shallow network architecture of the pharyngeal connectome. Network analysis reveals that the patterns of neuronal connections are organized into putative computational modules that reflect the known functional domains of the pharynx. Compared to the somatic nervous system, pharyngeal neurons both physically associate with a larger fraction of their neighbors and create synapses with a greater proportion of their neighbors. We speculate that the overall architecture of the pharyngeal nervous system may be reminiscent of the architecture of ancestral, primitive nervous systems.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal hippocampal cultures are simple and valuable models for studying neuronal function. While embryonic cultures are widely used for different applications, mouse postnatal cultures are still challenging, lack reproducibility and/or exhibit inappropriate neuronal activity. Yet, postnatal cultures have major advantages such as allowing genotyping of pups before culture and reducing the number of experimental animals. Herein we describe a simple and fast protocol for culturing and genetically manipulating hippocampal neurons from P0 to P3 mice. This protocol provides reproducible cultures exhibiting a consistent neuronal development, normal excitatory over inhibitory neuronal ratio and a physiological neuronal activity. We also describe simple and efficient procedures for genetic manipulation of neurons using transfection reagent or lentiviral particles. Overall, this method provides a detailed and validated protocol allowing to explore cellular mechanisms and neuronal activity in postnatal hippocampal neurons in culture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Autaptic Cultures: Methods and Applications</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurons typically form daisy chains of synaptic connections with other neurons, but they can also form synapses with themselves. Although such self-synapses, or autapses, are comparatively rare in vivo, they are surprisingly common in dissociated neuronal cultures. At first glance, autapses in culture seem like a mere curiosity. However, by providing a simple model system in which a single recording electrode gives simultaneous access to the pre- and postsynaptic compartments, autaptic cultures have proven to be invaluable in facilitating important and elegant experiments in the area of synaptic neuroscience. Here, I provide detailed protocols for preparing and recording from autaptic cultures (also called micro-island or microdot cultures). Variations on the basic procedure are presented, as well as practical tips for optimizing the outcomes. I also illustrate the utility of autaptic cultures by reviewing the types of experiments that have used them over the past three decades. These examples serve to highlight the power and elegance of this simple model system, and will hopefully inspire new experiments for the interrogation of synaptic function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Synaptic Plasticity on Motoneurons After Axotomy: A Necessary Change in Paradigm</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Motoneurons axotomized by peripheral nerve injuries experience profound changes in their synaptic inputs that are associated with a neuroinflammatory response that includes local microglia and astrocytes. This reaction is conserved across different types of motoneurons, injuries, and species, but also displays many unique features in each particular case. These reactions have been amply studied, but there is still a lack of knowledge on their functional significance and mechanisms. In this review article, we compiled data from many different fields to generate a comprehensive conceptual framework to best interpret past data and spawn new hypotheses and research. We propose that synaptic plasticity around axotomized motoneurons should be divided into two distinct processes. First, a rapid cell-autonomous, microglia-independent shedding of synapses from motoneuron cell bodies and proximal dendrites that is reversible after muscle reinnervation. Second, a slower mechanism that is microglia-dependent and permanently alters spinal cord circuitry by fully eliminating from the ventral horn the axon collaterals of peripherally injured and regenerating sensory Ia afferent proprioceptors. This removes this input from cell bodies and throughout the dendritic tree of axotomized motoneurons as well as from many other spinal neurons, thus reconfiguring ventral horn motor circuitries to function after regeneration without direct sensory feedback from muscle. This process is modulated by injury severity, suggesting a correlation with poor regeneration specificity due to sensory and motor axons targeting errors in the periphery that likely render Ia afferent connectivity in the ventral horn nonadaptive. In contrast, reversible synaptic changes on the cell bodies occur only while motoneurons are regenerating. This cell-autonomous process displays unique features according to motoneuron type and modulation by local microglia and astrocytes and generally results in a transient reduction of fast synaptic activity that is probably replaced by embryonic-like slow GABA depolarizations, proposed to relate to regenerative mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Day-to-Day Test-Retest Reliability of EEG Profiles in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder and Typical Development</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Biomarker development is currently a high priority in neurodevelopmental disorder research. For many types of biomarkers (particularly biomarkers of diagnosis), reliability over short periods is critically important. In the field of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), resting electroencephalography (EEG) power spectral densities (PSD) are well-studied for their potential as biomarkers. Classically, such data have been decomposed into pre-specified frequency bands (e.g., delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma). Recent technical advances, such as the Fitting Oscillations and One-Over-F (FOOOF) algorithm, allow for targeted characterization of the features that naturally emerge within an EEG PSD, permitting a more detailed characterization of the frequency band-agnostic shape of each individual’s EEG PSD. Here, using two resting EEGs collected a median of 6 days apart from 22 children with ASD and 25 typically developing (TD) controls during the Feasibility Visit of the Autism Biomarkers Consortium for Clinical Trials, we estimate test-retest reliability based on the characterization of the PSD shape in two ways: (1) Using the FOOOF algorithm we estimate six parameters (offset, slope, number of peaks, and amplitude, center frequency and bandwidth of the largest alpha peak) that characterize the shape of the EEG PSD; and (2) using nonparametric functional data analyses, we decompose the shape of the EEG PSD into a reduced set of basis functions that characterize individual power spectrum shapes. We show that individuals exhibit idiosyncratic PSD signatures that are stable over recording sessions using both characterizations. Our data show that EEG activity from a brief 2-min recording provides an efficient window into characterizing brain activity at the single-subject level with desirable psychometric characteristics that persist across different analytical decomposition methods. This is a necessary step towards analytical validation of biomarkers based on the EEG PSD and provides insights into parameters of the PSD that offer short-term reliability (and thus promise as potential biomarkers of trait or diagnosis) vs. those that are more variable over the short term (and thus may index state or other rapidly dynamic measures of brain function). Future research should address the longer-term stability of the PSD, for purposes such as monitoring development or response to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Paired Trial Classification: A Novel Deep Learning Technique for MVPA</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00417</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many recent developments in machine learning have come from the field of “deep learning,” or the use of advanced neural network architectures and techniques. While these methods have produced state-of-the-art results and dominated research focus in many fields, such as image classification and natural language processing, they have not gained as much ground over standard multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) techniques in the classification of electroencephalography (EEG) or other human neuroscience datasets. The high dimensionality and large amounts of noise present in EEG data, coupled with the relatively low number of examples (trials) that can be reasonably obtained from a sample of human subjects, lead to difficulty training deep learning models. Even when a model successfully converges in training, significant overfitting can occur despite the presence of regularization techniques. To help alleviate these problems, we present a new method of “paired trial classification” that involves classifying pairs of EEG recordings as coming from the same class or different classes. This allows us to drastically increase the number of training examples, in a manner akin to but distinct from traditional data augmentation approaches, through the combinatorics of pairing trials. Moreover, paired trial classification still allows us to determine the true class of a novel example (trial) via a “dictionary” approach: compare the novel example to a group of known examples from each class, and determine the final class via summing the same/different decision values within each class. Since individual trials are noisy, this approach can be further improved by comparing a novel individual example with a “dictionary” in which each entry is an average of several examples (trials). Even further improvements can be realized in situations where multiple samples from a single unknown class can be averaged, thus permitting averaged signals to be compared with averaged signals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Electric stimulators with precise and reliable outputs are an indispensable part of electrophysiological research. From single cells to deep brain or neuromuscular tissue, there are diverse targets for electrical stimulation. Even though commercial systems are available, we state the need for a low-cost, high precision, functional, and modular (hardware, firmware, and software) current stimulation system with the capacity to generate stable and complex waveforms for pre-clinical research. The system presented in this study is a USB controlled 4-channel modular current stimulator that can be expanded and generate biphasic arbitrary waveforms with 16-bit resolution, high temporal precision (μs), and passive charge balancing: the NES STiM (Neuro Electronic Systems Stimulator). We present a detailed description of the system’s structural design, the controlling software, reliability test, and the pre-clinical studies [deep brain stimulation (DBS) in hemi-PD rat model] in which it was utilized. The NES STiM has been tested with MacOS and Windows operating systems. Interfaces to MATLAB source codes are provided. The system is inexpensive, relatively easy to build and can be assembled quickly. We hope that the NES STiM will be used in a wide variety of neurological applications such as Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES), DBS and closed loop neurophysiological research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent types of cancers worldwide and yet, its pathophysiology is poorly understood. Single-cell electrophysiological studies have provided evidence that membrane depolarization is implicated in the proliferation and metastasis of breast cancer. However, metastatic breast cancer cells are highly dynamic microscopic systems with complexities beyond a single-cell level. There is an urgent need for electrophysiological studies and technologies capable of decoding the intercellular signaling pathways and networks that control proliferation and metastasis, particularly at a population level. Hence, we present for the first time non-invasive in vitro electrical recordings of strongly metastatic MDA-MB-231 and weakly/non-metastatic MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. To accomplish this, we fabricated an ultra-low noise sensor that exploits large-area electrodes, of 2 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which maximizes the double-layer capacitance and concomitant detection sensitivity. We show that the current recorded after adherence of the cells is dominated by the opening of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs), confirmed by application of the highly specific inhibitor, tetrodotoxin (TTX). The electrical activity of MDA-MB-231 cells surpasses that of the MCF-7 cells, suggesting a link between the cells’ bioelectricity and invasiveness. We also recorded an activity pattern with characteristics similar to that of Random Telegraph Signal (RTS) noise. RTS patterns were less frequent than the asynchronous VGSC signals. The RTS noise power spectral density showed a Lorentzian shape, which revealed the presence of a low-frequency signal across MDA-MB-231 cell populations with propagation speeds of the same order as those reported for intercellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; waves. Our recording platform paves the way for real-time investigations of the bioelectricity of cancer cells, their ionic/pharmacological properties and relationship to metastatic potential.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Serial Dopamine Transporter Imaging of Nigrostriatal Function in Parkinson’s Disease With Probable REM Sleep Behavior Disorder</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The current study aimed to confirm whether probable rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (pRBD) is associated with a specific pattern of striatal dopamine depletion in an international, multicenter, prospective cohort of patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Two hundred and seventy de novo, drug-naïve patients with PD underwent dopamine transporter (DAT) single photon emission computed tomography with &lt;sup&gt;123&lt;/sup&gt;I-FP-CIT at baseline and 1, 2, and 4 years after the initial scan. The diagnosis of pRBD was based on the 10-item RBD Screening Questionnaire. Striatal DAT binding levels and their rates of decline were compared between patients with pRBD and those without. At baseline, patients in the PD-pRBD+ group showed lower striatal DAT binding in the caudate (which was more pronounced in the less-affected hemisphere) and in the putamen. During the 4-year follow-up, patients in the PD-pRBD+ group consistently exhibited greater DAT loss than patients in the PD-pRBD− group with comparable disease duration in all four striatal subregions. These patients also exhibited a more rapid decrease in DAT binding in the caudate and a less prominent interhemispheric asymmetry in the putamen. The distinct pattern of striatal DAT depletion may contribute to a more malignant phenotype of PD associated with RBD, specifically faster progression of motor symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Correcting Task fMRI Signals for Variability in Baseline CBF Improves BOLD-Behavior Relationships: A Feasibility Study in an Aging Model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00336</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00336</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) functional MRI is a complex neurovascular signal whose magnitude depends on baseline physiological factors such as cerebral blood flow (CBF). Because baseline CBF varies across the brain and is altered with aging, the interpretation of stand-alone aging-related BOLD changes can be misleading. The primary objective of this study was to develop a methodology that combines task fMRI and arterial spin labeling (ASL) techniques to sensitize task-induced BOLD activity by covarying out the baseline physiology (i.e., CBF) in an aging model. We recruited 11 younger and 13 older healthy participants who underwent ASL and an overt language fMRI task (semantic category member generation). We measured in-scanner language performance to investigate the effect of BOLD sensitization on BOLD-behavior relationships. The results demonstrate that our correction approach is effective at enhancing the specificity and sensitivity of the BOLD signal in both groups. In addition, the correction strengthens the statistical association between task BOLD activity and behavioral performance. Although CBF has inherent age dependence, our results show that retaining the age factor within CBF aides in greater sensitization of task fMRI signals. From a cognitive standpoint, compared to young adults, the older participants showed a delayed domain-general language-related task activity possibly due to compromised vessel compliance. Further, assessment of functional evolution of corrected BOLD activity revealed biphasic BOLD dynamics in both groups where BOLD deactivation may reflect greater semantic demand or increased premium on domain general executive functioning in response to task difficulty. Although it was promising to note that the predictability of behavior using the proposed methodology outperforms other methodologies (i.e., no correction and normalization by division), and provides moderate stability and adequate power, further work with a larger cohort and other task designs is necessary to improve the stability of predicting associated behavior. In summary, we recommend correction of task fMRI signals by covarying out baseline CBF especially when comparing groups with different neurovascular properties. Given that ASL and BOLD fMRI are well established and widely employed techniques, our proposed multi-modal methodology can be readily implemented into data processing pipelines to obtain more accurate BOLD activation maps.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nanotechnology utilizes engineered materials and devices which function with biological systems at the molecular level and could transform the management of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) by provoking, reacting to, and intermingling with target sites to stimulate physiological responses while minimizing side effects. Blood–brain barrier (BBB) protects the brain from harmful agents, and transporting drugs across the BBB is a major challenge for diagnosis, targeting, and treatment of NDs. The BBB provides severe limitations for diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and various other neurological diseases. Conventional drug delivery systems generally fail to cross the BBB, thus are inefficient in treatment. Although gradual development through research is ensuring the progress of nanotheranostic approaches from animal to human modeling, aspects of translational applicability and safety are a key concern. This demands a deep understanding of the interaction of body systems with nanomaterials. There are various plant-based nanobioactive compounds which are reported to have applicability in the diagnosis and treatment of these NDs. This review article provides an overview of applications of nanotheranostics in AD and PD. The review also discusses nano-enabled drug delivery systems and their current and potential applications for the treatment of various NDs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM), also known as cervical spondylotic myelopathy is the leading cause of spinal cord compression in adults. The mainstay of treatment is surgical decompression, which leads to partial recovery of symptoms, however, long term prognosis of the condition remains poor. Despite advances in treatment methods, the underlying pathobiology is not well-known. A better understanding of the disease is therefore required for the development of treatments to improve outcomes following surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: To systematically evaluate the pathophysiology of DCM and the mechanism underlying recovery following decompression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A total of 13,808 published articles were identified in our systematic search of electronic databases (PUBMED, WEB OF SCIENCE). A total of 51 studies investigating the secondary injury mechanisms of DCM or physiology of recovery in animal models of disease underwent comprehensive review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Forty-seven studies addressed the pathophysiology of DCM. Majority of the studies demonstrated evidence of neuronal loss following spinal cord compression. A number of studies provided further details of structural changes in neurons such as myelin damage and axon degeneration. The mechanisms of injury to cells included direct apoptosis and increased inflammation. Only four papers investigated the pathobiological changes that occur in spinal cords following decompression. One study demonstrated evidence of axonal plasticity following decompressive surgery. Another study demonstrated ischaemic-reperfusion injury following decompression, however this phenomenon was worse when decompression was delayed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: In preclinical studies, the pathophysiology of DCM has been poorly studied and a number of questions remain unanswered. The physiological changes seen in the decompressed spinal cord has not been widely investigated and it is paramount that researchers investigate the decompressed spinal cord further to enable the development of therapeutic tools, to enhance recovery following surgery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: EEG Signal Reconstruction Using a Generative Adversarial Network With Wasserstein Distance and Temporal-Spatial-Frequency Loss</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Applications based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals suffer from the mutual contradiction of high classification performance vs. low cost. The nature of this contradiction makes EEG signal reconstruction with high sampling rates and sensitivity challenging. Conventional reconstruction algorithms lead to loss of the representative details of brain activity and suffer from remaining artifacts because such algorithms only aim to minimize the temporal mean-squared-error (MSE) under generic penalties. Instead of using temporal MSE according to conventional mathematical models, this paper introduces a novel reconstruction algorithm based on generative adversarial networks with the Wasserstein distance (WGAN) and a temporal-spatial-frequency (TSF-MSE) loss function. The carefully designed TSF-MSE-based loss function reconstructs signals by computing the MSE from time-series features, common spatial pattern features, and power spectral density features. Promising reconstruction and classification results are obtained from three motor-related EEG signal datasets with different sampling rates and sensitivities. Our proposed method significantly improves classification performances of EEG signals reconstructions with the same sensitivity and the average classification accuracy improvements of EEG signals reconstruction with different sensitivities. By introducing the WGAN reconstruction model with TSF-MSE loss function, the proposed method is beneficial for the requirements of high classification performance and low cost and is convenient for the design of high-performance brain computer interface systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Role of Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide (PACAP) Signaling in the Hippocampal Dentate Gyrus</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP, ADCYAP1) dysregulation has been associated with multiple stress-related psychopathologies that may be related to altered hippocampal function. In coherence, PACAP- and PAC1 receptor (ADCYAP1R1)-null mice demonstrate changes in hippocampal-dependent behavioral responses, implicating the PACAPergic system function in this structure. Within the hippocampus, the dentate gyrus (DG) may play an important role in discerning the differences between similar contexts, and DG granule cells appear to both highly express PAC1 receptors and receive inputs from PACAP-expressing terminals. Here, we review the evidence from our laboratories and others that PACAP is an important regulator of activity within hippocampal circuits, particularly within the DG. These data are consistent with an increasing literature implicating PACAP circuits in stress-related pathologies such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and implicate the hippocampus, and in particular the DG, as a critical site in which PACAP dysregulation can alter stress-related behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Does Antenatal Betamethasone Alter White Matter Brain Development in Growth Restricted Fetal Sheep?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00100</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is a common complication of pregnancy often associated with neurological impairments. Currently, there is no treatment for FGR, hence it is likely these babies will be delivered prematurely, thus being exposed to antenatal glucocorticoids. While there is no doubt that antenatal glucocorticoids reduce neonatal mortality and morbidities, their effects on the fetal brain, particularly in FGR babies, are less well recognized. We investigated the effects of both short- and long-term exposure to antenatal betamethasone treatment in both FGR and appropriately grown fetal sheep brains. Surgery was performed on pregnant Border-Leicester Merino crossbred ewes at 105–110 days gestation (term ~150 days) to induce FGR by single umbilical artery ligation (SUAL) or sham surgery. Ewes were then treated with a clinical dose of betamethasone (11.4 mg intramuscularly) or saline at 113 and 114 days gestation. Animals were euthanized at 115 days (48 h following the initial betamethasone administration) or 125 days (10 days following the initial dose of betamethasone) and fetal brains collected for analysis. FGR fetuses were significantly smaller than controls (115 days: 1.68 ± 0.11 kg vs. 1.99 ± 0.11 kg, 125 days: 2.70 ± 0.15 kg vs. 3.31 ± 0.20 kg, P &amp;lt; 0.001) and betamethasone treatment reduced body weight in both control (115 days: 1.64 ± 0.10 kg, 125 days: 2.53 ± 0.10 kg) and FGR fetuses (115 days: 1.41 ± 0.10 kg, 125 days: 2.16 ± 0.17 kg, P &amp;lt; 0.001). Brain: body weight ratios were significantly increased with FGR (P &amp;lt; 0.001) and betamethasone treatment (P = 0.002). Within the fetal brain, FGR reduced CNPase-positive myelin staining in the subcortical white matter (SCWM; P = 0.01) and corpus callosum (CC; P = 0.01), increased GFAP staining in the SCWM (P = 0.02) and reduced the number of Olig2 cells in the periventricular white matter (PVWM; P = 0.04). Betamethasone treatment significantly increased CNPase staining in the external capsule (EC; P = 0.02), reduced GFAP staining in the CC (P = 0.03) and increased Olig2 staining in the SCWM (P = 0.04). Here we show that FGR has progressive adverse effects on the fetal brain, particularly within the white matter. Betamethasone exacerbated growth restriction in the FGR offspring, but betamethasone did not worsen white matter brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Secreting L-Cells Coupled to Sensory Nerves Translate Microbial Signals to the Host Rat Nervous System</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;An intact gut epithelium preserves the immunological exclusion of “non-self” entities in the external environment of the gut lumen. Nonetheless, information flows continuously across this interface, with the host immune, endocrine, and neural systems all involved in monitoring the luminal environment of the gut. Both pathogenic and commensal gastrointestinal (GI) bacteria can modulate centrally-regulated behaviors and brain neurochemistry and, although the vagus nerve has been implicated in the microbiota-gut-brain signaling axis, the cellular and molecular machinery that facilitates this communication is unclear. Studies were carried out in healthy Sprague–Dawley rats to understand cross-barrier communication in the absence of disease. A novel colonic-nerve electrophysiological technique was used to examine gut-to-brain vagal signaling by bacterial products. Calcium imaging and immunofluorescent labeling were used to explore the activation of colonic submucosal neurons by bacterial products. The findings demonstrate that the neuromodulatory molecule, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), secreted by colonic enteroendocrine L-cells in response to the bacterial metabolite, indole, stimulated colonic vagal afferent activity. At a local level indole modified the sensitivity of submucosal neurons to GLP-1. These findings elucidate a cellular mechanism by which sensory L-cells act as cross-barrier signal transducers between microbial products in the gut lumen and the host peripheral nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Opposite Roles of δ- and μ-Opioid Receptors in BACE1 Regulation and Alzheimer’s Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00088</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Substantial evidence for AD pathogenesis suggests that β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and γ-secretase enzyme initiate the amyloidogenic pathway and produces toxic Aβ peptides that prone to aggregate in the brain. Therefore, the inhibition of BACE1 expression and function is an attractive strategy for AD therapy. In the present work, we made the first finding that activating δ-opioid receptors (DOR) with a specific DOR agonist significantly attenuated BACE1 expression and activity in the highly differentiated PC12 cells with mimicked AD injury, while the application of DOR inhibitor naltrindole reversed the UFP-512 effects, and even caused a major increase in BACE1 expression and activity as well as Aβ42 production in physiological conditions. Knocking-down DOR also enhanced BACE1 protein expression and its activity for APP processing, associating with a significant increase in Aβ42 production. In sharp contrast, activation of μ-opioid receptor (MOR) with DAMGO greatly promoted BACE1 expression and activity with an acceleration of APP cleavage, thus contributing to increased Aβ42 production. DADLE, a less selective DOR agonist that may bind to MOR, had no stable inhibitory effect on BACE1. Similar results were also found in APP mutant (APPswe) SH-SY5Y cell line, providing further validation of the DOR action on BACE1 regulation. Our novel data demonstrated entirely different roles of DOR and MOR in the regulation of BACE1 expression and activity with DOR being neuroprotective against AD injury. These findings provided a novel clue for new strategies of AD therapy via targeting endogenous opioid receptors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS) has been linked to demyelination and remyelination. Using zebrafish and mouse models of demyelination and remyelination, Cunha et al. now describe a novel role for myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) signaling in supporting remyelination by promoting myeloid cell-mediated inflammatory responses via TNF-α, which are essential for phagocytic myelin debris clearance and for oligodendrogenesis.</description>

	<description>Artificial intelligence advances have led to robots endowed with increasingly sophisticated social abilities. These machines speak to our innate desire to perceive social cues in the environment, as well as the promise of robots enhancing our daily lives. However, a strong mismatch still exists between our expectations and the reality of social robots. We argue that careful delineation of the neurocognitive mechanisms supporting human–robot interaction will enable us to gather insights critical for optimising social encounters between humans and robots.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Inferring the immune response from repertoire sequencing</title>

High-throughput sequencing of B- and T-cell receptors makes it possible to track immune repertoires across time, in different tissues, and in acute and chronic diseases or in healthy individuals. However, quantitative comparison between repertoires is confounded by variability in the read count of each receptor clonotype due to sampling, library preparation, and expression noise. Here, we present a general Bayesian approach to disentangle repertoire variations from these stochastic effects. Using replicate experiments, we first show how to learn the natural variability of read counts by inferring the distributions of clone sizes as well as an explicit noise model relating true frequencies of clones to their read count. We then use that null model as a baseline to infer a model of clonal expansion from two repertoire time points taken before and after an immune challenge. Applying our approach to yellow fever vaccination as a model of acute infection in humans, we identify candidate clones participating in the response.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WuV350R5zIY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Uncertainty in the structure and parameters of networks is ubiquitous across computational biology. In constraint-based reconstruction and analysis of metabolic networks, this uncertainty is present both during the reconstruction of networks and in simulations performed with them. Here, we present Medusa, a Python package for the generation and analysis of ensembles of genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions. Medusa builds on the COBRApy package for constraint-based reconstruction and analysis by compressing a set of models into a compact ensemble object, providing functions for the generation of ensembles using experimental data, and extending constraint-based analyses to ensemble scale. We demonstrate how Medusa can be used to generate ensembles and perform ensemble simulations, and how machine learning can be used in conjunction with Medusa to guide the curation of genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions. Medusa is available under the permissive MIT license from the Python Packaging Index (https://pypi.org) and from github (https://github.com/opencobra/Medusa), and comprehensive documentation is available at https://medusa.readthedocs.io/en/latest.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AD9jIGbNviM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: An electrodiffusive, ion conserving Pinsky-Rinzel model with homeostatic mechanisms</title>

In most neuronal models, ion concentrations are assumed to be constant, and effects of concentration variations on ionic reversal potentials, or of ionic diffusion on electrical potentials are not accounted for. Here, we present the electrodiffusive Pinsky-Rinzel (edPR) model, which we believe is the first multicompartmental neuron model that accounts for electrodiffusive ion concentration dynamics in a way that ensures a biophysically consistent relationship between ion concentrations, electrical charge, and electrical potentials in both the intra- and extracellular space. The edPR model is an expanded version of the two-compartment Pinsky-Rinzel (PR) model of a hippocampal CA3 neuron. Unlike the PR model, the edPR model includes homeostatic mechanisms and ion-specific leakage currents, and keeps track of all ion concentrations (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), electrical potentials, and electrical conductivities in the intra- and extracellular space. The edPR model reproduces the membrane potential dynamics of the PR model for moderate firing activity. For higher activity levels, or when homeostatic mechanisms are impaired, the homeostatic mechanisms fail in maintaining ion concentrations close to baseline, and the edPR model diverges from the PR model as it accounts for effects of concentration changes on neuronal firing. We envision that the edPR model will be useful for the field in three main ways. Firstly, as it relaxes commonly made modeling assumptions, the edPR model can be used to test the validity of these assumptions under various firing conditions, as we show here for a few selected cases. Secondly, the edPR model should supplement the PR model when simulating scenarios where ion concentrations are expected to vary over time. Thirdly, being applicable to conditions with failed homeostasis, the edPR model opens up for simulating a range of pathological conditions, such as spreading depression or epilepsy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HWagifW_BaU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;GABAergic medium spiny neurons are the main neuronal population in the striatum. Calbindin is preferentially expressed in medium spiny neurons involved in the indirect pathway.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GABAergic medium spiny neurons are the main neuronal population in the striatum. Calbindin is preferentially expressed in medium spiny neurons involved in the indirect pathway. The aim of the present work is to analyze the effect of perinatal asphyxia on different subpopulations of GABAergic neurons in the striatum and to assess the outcome of deep therapeutic hypothermia. The uterus of pregnant rats was removed by cesarean section and the fetuses were exposed to hypoxia by immersion in water (19 min) at 37°C (perinatal asphyxia). The hypothermic group was exposed to 10°C during 30 min after perinatal asphyxia. The rats were euthanized at the age of one month (adolescent/adult rats), their brains were dissected out and coronal sections were immunolabeled for calbindin, calretinin, NeuN, and reelin. Reelin+ cells showed no staining in the striatum besides subventricular zone. The perinatal asphyxia (PA) group showed a significant decrease in calbindin neurons and a paradoxical increase in neurons estimated by NeuN staining. Moreover, calretinin+ cells, a specific subpopulation of GABAergic neurons, showed an increase caused by PA. Deep hypothermia reversed most of these alterations probably by protecting calbindin neurons. Similarly, there was a reduction of the diameter of the anterior commissure produced by the asphyxia that was prevented by hypothermic treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Bridging therapy or IV thrombolysis in minor stroke with large vessel occlusion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25756?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25756?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether bridging therapy (intravenous thrombolysis [IVT] followed by endovascular treatment) is superior to IVT alone in minor stroke with large vessel occlusion (LVO) is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multicentric retrospective observational study including, in intention‐to‐treat, consecutive IVT‐treated minor strokes (NIHSS≤5) with LVO, with or without additional mechanical thrombectomy. Propensity‐score (inverse probability of treatment weighting) was used to reduce baseline between‐groups differences. The primary outcome was excellent outcome, &lt;i&gt;i.e&lt;/i&gt;., modified Rankin score 0‐1 at 3 months follow‐up.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, 598 patients were included (214 and 384 in the bridging therapy and IVT groups, respectively). Following propensity‐score weighting, the distribution of baseline clinical and radiological variables was similar across the two patient groups. Compared with IVT alone, bridging therapy was not associated with excellent outcome (OR=0.96; 95%CI=0.75‐1.24; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;=0.76), but was associated with symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (OR=3.01; 95%CI=1.77‐5.11; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). Occlusion site was a strong modifier of the effect of bridging therapy on outcome (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;interaction&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001), with bridging therapy associated with higher odds of excellent outcome in proximal M1 (OR=3.26; 95%CI=1.67‐6.35; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;=0.0006) and distal M1 (OR=1.69; 95%CI=1.01‐2.82; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;=0.04) occlusions, but with lower odds of excellent outcome for M2 (OR=0.53; 95%CI=0.38‐0.75; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;=0.0003) occlusions. Bridging therapy was associated with higher rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in M2 occlusions only (OR=4.40; 95%CI=2.20‐8.83; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although overall outcomes were similar in intended bridging therapy as compared to intended IVT alone in minor strokes with LVO, our results suggest that intended bridging therapy may be beneficial in M1 occlusions, while the benefit‐risk profile may favor IVT alone in M2 occlusions.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Motor learning and adaptation are important functions of the nervous system. Classical studies have characterized how humans adapt to changes in the environment during tasks such as reaching, and have documented improvements in behavior across movements. However, little is known about how quickly the nervous system adapts to such disturbances. In particular, recent work has suggested that adaptation could be sufficiently fast to alter the control strategies of an ongoing movement. To further address the possibility that learning occurred within a single movement, we designed a series of human reaching experiments to extract from muscles recordings the latency of feedback adaptation. Our results confirmed that participants adapted their feedback responses to unanticipated force fields applied randomly. In addition, our analyses revealed that the feedback response was specifically and finely tuned to the ongoing perturbation not only across trials with the same force field, but also across different kinds of force fields. Finally, changes in muscle activity consistent with feedback adaptation occurred in ~250 ms following reach onset. The adaptation that we observed across trials presented in a random context was similar to the one observed when the force fields could be anticipated, suggesting that these two adaptive processes may be closely linked to each other. In such case, our measurement of 250 ms may correspond to the latency of motor adaptation in the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that is caused by a mutation in either &lt;i&gt;TSC1&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;TSC2&lt;/i&gt;. TSC affects multiple systems of the body, and patients with TSC display a range of neurologic and behavioral manifestations including seizures, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, and mood disorders. Whereas behavioral phenotypes of many mouse models have been studied, the effects of sex have, for the most part, not been explored. We studied adult male and female &lt;i&gt;Tsc2&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous and control mice to investigate the influence of sex and genotype on behavior. On a test of social preference, &lt;i&gt;Tsc2&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mice, regardless of sex, demonstrated lower preference for the stranger mouse than control mice. In the open field, &lt;i&gt;Tsc2&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous males and control females habituated to the open field with decreasing anxiety-like behavior over time, whereas &lt;i&gt;Tsc2&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous females did not show habituation to the open field environment. We did not find any statistically significant effects of genotype on open field activity, learning and memory or motor function. Our results highlight phenotype differences in &lt;i&gt;Tsc2&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mice, some of which are influenced by sex. A consideration of how sex influences the behavioral phenotypes of TSC is critical to develop a more complete understanding of the disorder and better target future pharmacological treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients often suffer from sleep disturbances. Alterations in sleep, especially rapid eye movement sleep (REMS), can precede the onset of dementia. To accurately characterize the sleep impairments accompanying AD and their underlying mechanisms using animal models, it is crucial to use models in which brain areas are affected in a manner similar to that observed in the actual patients. Here, we focused on &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-G-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice, in which expression levels and patterns of mutated amyloid precursor protein (APP) follow the endogenous patterns. We characterized the sleep architecture of male &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-G-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; homozygous and heterozygous mice at two ages (six and 12 months). At six months, homozygous mice exhibited reduced REMS, which was further reduced at 12 months together with a slight reduction in non-REMS (NREMS). By contrast, heterozygous mice exhibited an overall normal sleep architecture. Homozygous mice also exhibited decreased electroencephalogram  to  power ratio during REMS from six months, resembling the electroencephalogram slowing phenomenon observed in preclinical or early stages of AD. In addition, homozygous mice showed learning and memory impairments in the trace fear conditioning (FC) at both ages, and task performance strongly correlated with REMS amount at 12 months. Finally, histologic analyses revealed that amyloid-β accumulation in the pontine tegmental area and ventral medulla followed a course similar to that of the REMS reduction. These findings support the notion that changes in REMS are an early marker of AD and provide a starting point to address the mechanism of sleep deficits in AD and the effects on cognition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: Hypothalamic MCH Neuron Activity Dynamics during Cataplexy of Narcolepsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/2/ENEURO.0017-20.2020?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hypothalamic orexin (hypocretin, HCRT) deficiency causes sleep disorder narcolepsy with cataplexy in humans and murine. As another integral group of sleep/wake-regulating neurons in the same brain area, the melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons’ involvement in cataplexy remains ambiguous. Here we used the live animal deep-brain calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) imaging tool to record MCH neuron dynamics during cataplexy by expressing calcium sensor GCaMP6s into genetically defined MCH neurons in orexin knock-out mice, which are a model of human narcolepsy. Similar to wild-type mice, MCH neurons of the narcoleptic mice displayed significantly higher Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transient fluorescent intensity during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and active waking (AW) episodes compared with non-REM (NREM) sleep. Moreover, MCH neurons displayed significantly lower Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals during cataplexy. Importantly, a pre-cataplexy elevation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals from MCH neurons was not a prerequisite for cataplexy initiation. Our results demonstrated the inactivation status of MCH neurons during cataplexy and suggested that MCH neurons are not involved in the initiation and maintenance of cataplexy in orexin knock-out mice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Post‐Traumatic Stress Disorder is Associated with further Increased Parkinson's Disease Risk in Veterans with Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25726?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25726?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determining if traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are risk factors for Parkinson's disease (PD). This constitutes a research priority for the Veterans Administration (VA) with implications for screening policy and prevention.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Population‐based, matched case‐control study among veterans using VA health care facilities from October 1, 1999, to September 30, 2013. We identified 176,871 PD cases and 707,484 randomly selected PD‐free matched controls. PD, TBI, and PTSD were ascertained by validated International Classification of Disease 9th revision (ICD)‐9 code‐based algorithms. We examined the association between both risk factors and PD using race‐adjusted conditional logistic regression.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall study cohort prevalence for TBI&lt;sub&gt;mild&lt;/sub&gt;, TBI&lt;sub&gt;non‐mild&lt;/sub&gt;, and PTSD was 0.65%, 0.69%, and 5.5%, respectively. Both TBI and PTSD were significantly associated with PD in single‐risk factor race‐adjusted analyses (conditional odds ratio [cOR] = 2.99; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.69–3.32), 3.82 (95% CI: 3.67–3.97), and 2.71 (95% CI: 2.66–2.77) for TBI&lt;sub&gt;mild&lt;/sub&gt;, TBI&lt;sub&gt;non‐mild&lt;/sub&gt;, and PTSD, respectively). There was suggestive positive interaction observed with comorbid PTSD/TBI in dual‐risk factor analyses, with significant 2.69‐fold and 3.70‐fold excess relative PD risk in veterans with TBI&lt;sub&gt;mild&lt;/sub&gt; and TBI&lt;sub&gt;non‐mild&lt;/sub&gt; versus those without TBI when PTSD was present versus 2.17‐fold and 2.80‐fold excess risk when PTSD was absent.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study was the first to demonstrate that both TBI and PTSD are independently associated with increased relative PD risk in a diverse nationwide cohort of military service veterans, and the first to suggest a potential modest synergistic excess risk in those with comorbid TBI/PTSD. Longitudinal research is needed to confirm these suggestive findings. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Multiple Network Disconnection in Anosognosia for Hemiplegia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00021</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00021</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Anosognosia for hemiplegia (AHP) is a complex syndrome whose neural correlates are still under investigation. One hypothesis, mainly based on lesion mapping studies, is that AHP reflects a breakdown of neural systems of the right hemisphere involved in motor function. However, more recent theories have suggested that AHP may represent a disorder of cognitive systems involved in belief updating, self-referential or body processing. Two recent studies, using a method to estimate the degree of white matter disconnection from lesions, have indeed shown that patients with AHP suffer from damage of several long-range white matter pathways in association cortex. Here, we use a similar indirect disconnection approach to study a group of patients with motor deficits without anosognosia (hemiparesis or hemiplegia, HP, n = 35), or motor deficits with AHP (n = 28). The HP lesions came from a database of stroke patients, while cases of AHP were selected from the published literature. Lesions were traced into an atlas from illustrations of the publications using a standard method. There was no region in the brain that was more damaged in AHP than HP. In terms of structural connectivity, AHP patients had a similar pattern of disconnection of motor pathways to HP patients. However, AHP patients also showed significant disconnection of the right temporo-parietal junction, right insula, right lateral and medial prefrontal cortex. These associative cortical regions were connected through several white matter tracts, including superior longitudinal fasciculus III, arcuate, fronto-insular, frontal inferior longitudinal, and frontal aslant. These tracts connected regions of different cognitive networks: default, ventral attention, and cingulo-opercular. These results were not controlled for clinical variables as concomitant symptoms and other disorders of body representation were not always available for co-variate analysis. In conclusion, we confirm recent studies of disconnection demonstrating that AHP is not limited to dysfunction of motor systems, but involves a much wider set of large-scale cortical networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Cortical Circuit Dysfunction as a Potential Driver of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that affects selected cortical and spinal neuronal populations, leading to progressive paralysis and death. A growing body of evidences suggests that the disease may originate in the cerebral cortex and propagate in a corticofugal manner. In particular, transcranial magnetic stimulation studies revealed that ALS patients present with early cortical hyperexcitability arising from a combination of increased excitability and decreased inhibition. Here, we discuss the possibility that initial cortical circuit dysfunction might act as the main driver of ALS onset and progression, and review recent functional, imaging and transcriptomic studies conducted on ALS patients, along with electrophysiological, pathological and transcriptomic studies on animal and cellular models of the disease, in order to evaluate the potential cellular and molecular origins of cortical hyperexcitability in ALS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: RAGE Silencing Ameliorates Neuroinflammation by Inhibition of p38-NF-κB Signaling Pathway in Mouse Model of Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00353</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00353</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Accumulating evidence suggested that neuroinflammation played a crucial role in dopaminergic neuronal death in Parkinson’s disease (PD). The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), a multi-ligand receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily, has been proposed as a key molecule in the onset and sustainment of the inflammatory response. Engagement of RAGE contributed to neuroinflammation by upregulating nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) as well as cytokines. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of RAGE in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated mice and elucidate the RAGE signal pathway involved in the inflammation. Results showed that RAGE protein and pro-inflammatory cytokines cyclooxygenase type 2 (COX-2) were upregulated in MPTP-treated mice. Further experiments showed that RAGE ablation inhibited phosphorylation of IκB and p38 and protected nigral dopaminergic neurons against cell death in the substantia nigra (SN). These results suggested that RAGE participated in the pathogenesis of PD by neuroinflammation and p38MAPK-NFκB signal pathway may be involved in the process. Moreover, interfering with RAGE signaling pathway may be a reasonable therapeutic option in slowing PD development and progression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The neurovascular unit (NVU), composed of vascular cells, glial cells, and neurons, is the minimal functional unit of the brain. The NVU maintains integrity of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and regulates supply of the cerebral blood flow (CBF), both of which are keys to maintaining normal brain function. BBB dysfunction and a decreased CBF are early pathophysiological changes in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In this review, we primarily focus on the NVU in AD as much research has been performed on the connection between NVU dysfunction and AD. We also discuss the role of NVU dysfunction in the pathophysiological mechanisms of PD and ALS. As most neurodegenerative diseases are difficult to treat, we discuss several potential drug targets that focus on the NVU that may inform novel vascular-targeted therapies for AD, PD, and ALS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: BraTS Toolkit: Translating BraTS Brain Tumor Segmentation Algorithms Into Clinical and Scientific Practice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00125</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite great advances in brain tumor segmentation and clear clinical need, translation of state-of-the-art computational methods into clinical routine and scientific practice remains a major challenge. Several factors impede successful implementations, including data standardization and preprocessing. However, these steps are pivotal for the deployment of state-of-the-art image segmentation algorithms. To overcome these issues, we present BraTS Toolkit. BraTS Toolkit is a holistic approach to brain tumor segmentation and consists of three components: First, the BraTS Preprocessor facilitates data standardization and preprocessing for researchers and clinicians alike. It covers the entire image analysis workflow prior to tumor segmentation, from image conversion and registration to brain extraction. Second, BraTS Segmentor enables orchestration of BraTS brain tumor segmentation algorithms for generation of fully-automated segmentations. Finally, Brats Fusionator can combine the resulting candidate segmentations into consensus segmentations using fusion methods such as majority voting and iterative SIMPLE fusion. The capabilities of our tools are illustrated with a practical example to enable easy translation to clinical and scientific practice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Is the Blood Oxygenation Level-Dependent fMRI Response to Motor Tasks Altered in Children After Neonatal Stroke?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00154</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00154</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Functional MRI is increasingly being used in the assessment of brain activation and connectivity following stroke. Many of these studies rely on the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) contrast. However, the stability, as well as the accuracy of the BOLD response to motor task in the ipsilesional hemisphere, remains ambiguous. In this work, the BOLD signal acquired from both healthy and affected hemispheres was analyzed in 7-year-old children who sustained a Neonatal Arterial Ischemic Stroke (NAIS). Accordingly, a repetitive motor task of the contralesional and the ipsilesional hands was performed by 33 patients with unilateral lesions. These patients were divided into two groups: those without cerebral palsy (NAIS), and those with cerebral palsy (CP). The BOLD signal time course was obtained from distinctly defined regions of interest (ROIs) extracted from the functional activation maps of 30 healthy controls with similar age and demographic characteristics as the patients. An ROI covering both the primary motor cortex (M1) and the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) was also tested. Compared with controls, NAIS patients without CP had similar BOLD amplitude variation for both the contralesional and the ipsilesional hand movements. However, in the case of NAIS patients with CP, a significant difference in the averaged BOLD amplitude was found between the healthy and affected hemisphere. In both cases, no progressive attenuation of the BOLD signal amplitude was observed throughout the task epochs. Besides, results also showed a correlation between the BOLD signal percentage variation of the lesioned hemisphere and the dexterity level. These findings suggest that for patients who sustained a NAIS with no extensive permanent motor impairment, BOLD signal-based data analysis can be a valuable tool for the evaluation of functional brain networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Novelty Manipulations, Memory Performance, and Predictive Coding: the Role of Unexpectedness</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Novelty is central to the study of memory, but the wide range of experimental manipulations aimed to reveal its effects on learning produced inconsistent results. The novelty/encoding hypothesis suggests that novel information undergoes enhanced encoding and thus leads to benefits in memory, especially in recognition performance; however, recent studies cast doubts on this assumption. On the other hand, data from animal studies provided evidence on the robust effects of novelty manipulations on the neurophysiological correlates of memory processes. Conceptualizations and operationalizations of novelty are remarkably variable and were categorized into different subtypes, such as stimulus, context, associative or spatial novelty. Here, we summarize previous findings about the effects of novelty on memory and suggest that predictive coding theories provide a framework that could shed light on the differential influence of novelty manipulations on memory performance. In line with predictive coding theories, we emphasize the role of unexpectedness as a crucial property mediating the behavioral and neural effects of novelty manipulations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Changes in the Effective Connectivity of the Social Brain When Making Inferences About Close Others vs. the Self</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00151</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00151</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Previous research showed that the ability to make inferences about our own and other’s mental states rely on common brain pathways; particularly in the case of close relationships (e.g., romantic relationships). Despite the evidence for shared neural representations of self and others, less is known about the distributed processing within these common neural networks, particularly whether there are specific patterns of internode communication when focusing on other vs. self. This study aimed to characterize context-sensitive coupling among social brain regions involved in self and other understanding. Participants underwent an fMRI while watching emotional video vignettes of their romantic partner and elaborated on their partner’s (other-condition) or on their own experience (self-condition). We used dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to quantify the associated changes in effective connectivity (EC) in a network of brain regions involved in social cognition including the temporoparietal junction (TPJ), the posterior cingulate (PCC)/precuneus and middle temporal gyrus (MTG). DCM revealed that: the PCC plays a central coordination role within this network, the bilateral MTG receives driving inputs from other nodes suggesting that social information is first processed in language comprehension regions; the right TPJ evidenced a selective increase in its sensitivity when focusing on the other’s experience, relative to focusing on oneself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Including Measures of High Gamma Power Can Improve the Decoding of Natural Speech From EEG</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The human auditory system is highly skilled at extracting and processing information from speech in both single-speaker and multi-speaker situations. A commonly studied speech feature is the amplitude envelope which can also be used to determine which speaker a listener is attending to in those multi-speaker situations. Non-invasive brain imaging (electro-/magnetoencephalography [EEG/MEG]) has shown that the phase of neural activity below 16 Hz tracks the dynamics of speech, whereas invasive brain imaging (electrocorticography [ECoG]) has shown that such processing is strongly reflected in the power of high frequency neural activity (around 70-150 Hz; known as high gamma). The first aim of this study was to determine if high gamma power scalp recorded EEG carries useful stimulus-related information, despite its reputation for having a poor signal to noise ratio. Specifically, linear regression was used to investigate speech envelope and attention decoding in low frequency EEG, high gamma power EEG, and in both EEG signals combined. The second aim was to assess whether the information reflected in high gamma power EEG may be complementary to that reflected in well-established low frequency EEG indices of speech processing. Exploratory analyses were also completed to examine how low frequency and high gamma power EEG may be sensitive to different features of the speech envelope. While low frequency speech tracking was evident for almost all subjects as expected, high gamma power also showed robust speech tracking in some subjects. This same pattern was true for attention decoding using a separate group of subjects who participated in a cocktail party attention experiment. For the subjects who showed speech tracking in high gamma power EEG, the spatiotemporal characteristics of that high gamma tracking differed from that of low-frequency EEG. Furthermore, combining the two neural measures led to improved measures of speech tracking for several subjects. Our results indicated that high gamma power EEG can carry useful information regarding speech processing and attentional selection in some subjects. Combining high gamma power and low frequency EEG can improve the mapping between natural speech and the resulting neural responses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Longitudinal Morphological and Functional Assessment of RGC Neurodegeneration After Optic Nerve Crush in Mouse</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00109</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The mouse optic nerve crush (ONC) model has been widely used to study optic neuropathies and central nervous system (CNS) axon injury and repair. Previous histological studies of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) somata in retina and axons in ON demonstrate significant neurodegeneration after ONC, but longitudinal morphological and functional assessment of RGCs in living animals is lacking. It is essential to establish these assays to provide more clinically relevant information for early detection and monitoring the progression of CNS neurodegeneration. Here, we present in vivo data gathered by scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and pattern electroretinogram (PERG) at different time points after ONC in mouse eyes and corresponding histological quantification of the RGC somata and axons. Not surprisingly, direct visualization of RGCs by SLO fundus imaging correlated best with histological quantification of RGC somata and axons. Unexpectedly, OCT did not detect obvious retinal thinning until late time points (14 and 28-days post ONC) and instead detected significant retinal swelling at early time points (1–5 days post-ONC), indicating a characteristic initial retinal response to ON injury. PERG also demonstrated an early RGC functional deficit in response to ONC, before significant RGC death, suggesting that it is highly sensitive to ONC. However, the limited progression of PERG deficits diminished its usefulness as a reliable indicator of RGC degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Baseline White Matter Is Associated With Physical Fitness Change in Preclinical Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;White matter (WM) microstructure is a sensitive marker to distinguish individuals at risk of Alzheimer’s disease. The association of objective physical fitness (PF) measures and WM microstructure has not been explored and mixed results reported with physical activity (PA). Longitudinal studies of WM with PA and PF measures have had limited investigation. This study explored the relationship between objective PF measures over 24-months with “normal-appearing” WM microstructure. Data acquired on magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure “normal-appearing” WM microstructure at baseline and 24-months. Clinical variables such as cognitive and blood-based measures were collected longitudinally. Also, as part of the randomized controlled trial of a PA, extensive measures of PA and fitness were obtained over the 24 months. Bilateral corticospinal tracts (CST) and the corpus callosum showed a significant association between PF performance over 24-months and baseline WM microstructural measures. There was no significant longitudinal effect of the intervention or PF performance over 24-months. Baseline WM microstructural measures were significantly associated with PF performance over 24-months in this cohort of participants with vascular risk factors and at risk of Alzheimer’s disease with distinctive patterns for each PF test.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Channelrhodopsin Excitation Contracts Brain Pericytes and Reduces Blood Flow in the Aging Mouse Brain in vivo</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00108</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brains depend on blood flow for the delivery of oxygen and nutrients essential for proper neuronal and synaptic functioning. French physiologist Rouget was the first to describe pericytes in 1873 as regularly arranged longitudinal amoeboid cells on capillaries that have a muscular coat, implying that these are contractile cells that regulate blood flow. Although there have been &amp;gt;30 publications from different groups, including our group, demonstrating that pericytes are contractile cells that can regulate hemodynamic responses in the brain, the role of pericytes in controlling cerebral blood flow (CBF) has not been confirmed by all studies. Moreover, recent studies using different optogenetic models to express light-sensitive channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) cation channels in pericytes were not conclusive; one, suggesting that pericytes expressing ChR2 do not contract after light stimulus, and the other, demonstrating contraction of pericytes expressing ChR2 after light stimulus. Since two-photon optogenetics provides a powerful tool to study mechanisms of blood flow regulation at the level of brain capillaries, we re-examined the contractility of brain pericytes in vivo using a new optogenetic model developed by crossing our new inducible pericyte-specific CreER mouse line with ChR2 mice. We induced expression of ChR2 in pericytes with tamoxifen, excited ChR2 by 488 nm light, and monitored pericyte contractility, brain capillary diameter changes, and red blood cell (RBC) velocity in aged mice by in vivo two-photon microscopy. Excitation of ChR2 resulted in pericyte contraction followed by constriction of the underlying capillary leading to approximately an 8% decrease (p = 0.006) in capillary diameter. ChR2 excitation in pericytes substantially reduced capillary RBC flow by 42% (p = 0.03) during the stimulation period compared to the velocity before stimulation. Our data suggests that pericytes contract in vivo and regulate capillary blood flow in the aging mouse brain. By extension, this might have implications for neurological disorders of the aging human brain associated with neurovascular dysfunction and pericyte loss such as stroke and Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Lineage tracing involves the identification of all ancestors and descendants of a given cell, and is an important tool for studying biological processes such as development and disease progression. However, in many settings, controlled time-course experiments are not feasible, for example when working with tissue samples from patients. Here we present ImageAEOT, a computational pipeline based on autoencoders and optimal transport for predicting the lineages of cells using time-labeled datasets from different stages of a cellular process. Given a single-cell image from one of the stages, ImageAEOT generates an artificial lineage of this cell based on the population characteristics of the other stages. These lineages can be used to connect subpopulations of cells through the different stages and identify image-based features and biomarkers underlying the biological process. To validate our method, we apply ImageAEOT to a benchmark task based on nuclear and chromatin images during the activation of fibroblasts by tumor cells in engineered 3D tissues. We further validate ImageAEOT on chromatin images of various breast cancer cell lines and human tissue samples, thereby linking alterations in chromatin condensation patterns to different stages of tumor progression. Our results demonstrate the promise of computational methods based on autoencoding and optimal transport principles for lineage tracing in settings where existing experimental strategies cannot be used.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/P97F_QvFAac&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Efficient and flexible representation of higher-dimensional cognitive variables with grid cells</title>

We shed light on the potential of entorhinal grid cells to efficiently encode variables of dimension greater than two, while remaining faithful to empirical data on their low-dimensional structure. Our model constructs representations of high-dimensional inputs through a combination of low-dimensional random projections and “classical” low-dimensional hexagonal grid cell responses. Without reconfiguration of the recurrent circuit, the same system can flexibly encode multiple variables of different dimensions while maximizing the coding range (per dimension) by automatically trading-off dimension with an exponentially large coding range. It achieves high efficiency and flexibility by combining two powerful concepts, modularity and mixed selectivity, in what we call “mixed modular coding”. In contrast to previously proposed schemes, the model does not require the formation of higher-dimensional grid responses, a cell-inefficient and rigid mechanism. The firing fields observed in flying bats or climbing rats can be generated by neurons that combine activity from multiple grid modules, each representing higher-dimensional spaces according to our model. The idea expands our understanding of grid cells, suggesting that they could implement a general circuit that generates on-demand coding and memory states for variables in high-dimensional vector spaces.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JtlFgqKoNz0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The mechanisms underlying virus emergence are rarely well understood, making the appearance of outbreaks largely unpredictable. Bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV-8), an arthropod-borne virus of ruminants, emerged in livestock in northern Europe in 2006, spreading to most European countries by 2009 and causing losses of billions of euros. Although the outbreak was successfully controlled through vaccination by early 2010, puzzlingly, a closely related BTV-8 strain re-emerged in France in 2015, triggering a second outbreak that is still ongoing. The origin of this virus and the mechanisms underlying its re-emergence are unknown. Here, we performed phylogenetic analyses of 164 whole BTV-8 genomes sampled throughout the two outbreaks. We demonstrate consistent clock-like virus evolution during both epizootics but found negligible evolutionary change between them. We estimate that the ancestor of the second outbreak dates from the height of the first outbreak in 2008. This implies that the virus had not been replicating for multiple years prior to its re-emergence in 2015. Given the absence of any known natural mechanism that could explain BTV-8 persistence over this long period without replication, we hypothesise that the second outbreak could have been initiated by accidental exposure of livestock to frozen material contaminated with virus from approximately 2008. Our work highlights new targets for pathogen surveillance programmes in livestock and illustrates the power of genomic epidemiology to identify pathways of infectious disease emergence.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/qHT7Q40nPnc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Randomized Clinical Trial of First‐Line Genome Sequencing in Pediatric White Matter Disorders</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25757?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genome sequencing (GS) is promising for unsolved leukodystrophies, but its efficacy has not been prospectively studied.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prospective time‐delayed cross‐over design trial of GS to assess the efficacy of GS as a first‐line diagnostic tool for genetic white matter disorders took place between 12/01/2015 – 09/27/2017. Patients were randomized to receive GS immediately with concurrent standard of care (SoC) testing, or to receive SoC testing for four months followed by GS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;34 individuals were assessed at interim review&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; The genetic origin of two patient's leukoencephalopathy was resolved before randomization. Nine patients stratified to the immediate intervention group and 23 patients to the delayed‐GS arm. The efficacy of GS was significant relative to SoC in the Immediate (5 of 9 [56%] vs. 0 of 9 [0%]; Wild‐Seber p &amp;lt; 0.005) and Delayed (control) arms (14 of 23 [61%] vs 5 of 23 [22%]; Wild‐Seber p &amp;lt; 0.005). The time to diagnosis was significantly shorter in the immediate‐GS group (log rank test, p=0.04). The overall diagnostic efficacy of combined GS and SoC approaches was 26 of 34 (76.5% [95% CI = 58.8% to 89.3%]) in less than 4 months, greater than historical norms of less than 50% over 5 years. Owing to loss of clinical equipoise, the trial design was altered to a single‐arm observational study.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, first‐line GS provided earlier and greater diagnostic efficacy in white matter disorders. We provide an evidence‐based diagnostic testing algorithm to enable appropriate clinical GS utilization in this population.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Region‐ and neuronal‐subtype‐specific expression of Na,K‐ATPase alpha and beta subunit isoforms in the mouse brain</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Region‐ and neuronal‐subtype‐specific expression of Na,K‐ATPase alpha and beta subunit isoforms in the mouse brain&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/bde1d677-be62-4389-bc1d-4ce3e4a27c1f/cne24924-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na,K‐ATPase comprises α (&lt;i&gt;Atp1a&lt;/i&gt;), β (&lt;i&gt;Atp1b&lt;/i&gt;), and FXYD subunits, and each subunit has isoforms. In situ hybridization for α and β subunit isoforms revealed regional‐ and neuronal‐subtype‐specific expression of the isoforms in the mouse brain. The photograph shows &lt;i&gt;Atp1a1&lt;/i&gt; (red) and &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt; (green) expression in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (stained with DAPI, blue).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na,K‐ATPase is a ubiquitous molecule contributing to the asymmetrical distribution of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions across the plasma membrane and maintenance of the membrane potential, a prerequisite of neuronal activity. Na,K‐ATPase comprises three subunits (α, β, and FXYD). The α subunit has four isoforms in mice, with three of them (α1, α2, and α3) expressed in the brain. However, the functional and biological significances of the different brain isoforms remain to be fully elucidated. Recent studies have revealed the association of &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt;, a gene encoding α3 subunit, with neurological disorders. To map the cellular distributions of the α subunit isoforms and their coexpression patterns, we evaluated the mRNA expression of &lt;i&gt;Atp1a1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Atp1a2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt; by in situ hybridization in the mouse brain. &lt;i&gt;Atp1a1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt; were expressed in neurons, whereas &lt;i&gt;Atp1a2&lt;/i&gt; was almost exclusively expressed in glial cells. Most neurons coexpressed &lt;i&gt;Atp1a1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt;, with highly heterogeneous expression levels across the brain regions and neuronal subtypes. We identified parvalbumin (PV)‐expressing GABAergic neurons in the hippocampus, somatosensory cortex, and retrosplenial cortex as an example of a neuronal subtype expressing low &lt;i&gt;Atp1a1&lt;/i&gt; and high &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt;. The expression of &lt;i&gt;Atp1b&lt;/i&gt; isoforms was also heterogeneous across brain regions and cellular subtypes. The PV‐expressing neurons expressed a high level of &lt;i&gt;Atp1b1&lt;/i&gt; and a low level of &lt;i&gt;Atp1b2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Atp1b3&lt;/i&gt;. These findings provide basic information on the region‐ and neuronal‐subtype‐dependent expression of Na,K‐ATPase α and β subunit isoforms, as well as a rationale for the selective involvement of neurons expressing high levels of &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt; in neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Occipital alpha is a prominent rhythm (~10 Hz) detected in electroencephalography (EEG) during wakeful relaxation with closed eyes. The rhythm is generated by a subclass of thalamic pacemaker cells that burst at the alpha frequency, orchestrated by the interplay of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCN) and calcium channels in response to elevated levels of ambient acetylcholine (ACh). These oscillations are known to have a lower peak frequency and coherence in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Interestingly, calcium signaling, HCN channel expression and ACh signaling, crucial for orchestrating the alpha rhythm, are also known to be aberrational in AD. In a biophysically detailed network model of the thalamic circuit, we investigate the changes in molecular signaling and the causal relationships between them that lead to a disrupted thalamic alpha in AD. Our simulations show that lowered HCN expression leads to a slower thalamic alpha, which can be rescued by increasing ACh levels, a common therapeutic target of AD drugs. However, this rescue is possible only over a limited range of reduced HCN expression. The model predicts that lowered HCN expression can modify the network activity in the thalamic circuit leading to increased GABA release in the thalamus and disrupt the calcium homeostasis. The changes in calcium signaling make the network more susceptible to noise, causing a loss in rhythmic activity. Based on our results, we propose that reduced frequency and coherence of the occipital alpha rhythm seen in AD may result from downregulated HCN expression, rather than modified cholinergic signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The specific mechanisms underlying compulsive behavior in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are unknown. It has been suggested that such compulsivity may have its origin in cognitive dysfunction such as impaired processing of feedback information, received after the completion of goal-directed actions. The signal attenuation (SA) task models such a processing deficit in animals by attenuating the association strength between food reward and audiovisual feedback (signal) presented after performance of an operant response. The compulsive-like responding resulting from SA is well characterized in rats, but was so far not established in mice, a species for which powerful genetic OCD models exist. Thus, first, we demonstrate that the SA task can be implemented in mice and show that attenuation of reward-associated response feedback produces similar behavior in C57BL/6 mice as previously reported in rats. Second, we tested the hypothesis that &lt;i&gt;SAPAP3&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mice (SAPAP3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;), prone to exhibit several OCD-like abnormalities including excessive grooming, show enhanced compulsive-like behavior in the SA task compared with their wild-type (WT) littermates. However, task-related compulsivity measures in SAPAP3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; and WT did not yield significant differences, neither following SA nor during &quot;regular&quot; extinction of operant behavior. Thus, compulsive-like instrumental behavior following feedback distortion was not potentiated in compulsively grooming mice, implicating specifically that (1) a general deficit in feedback processing is not related to excessive grooming in SAPAP3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; and (2) different manifestations of compulsivity may be driven by independent mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Perineuronal nets and subtypes of GABAergic cells differentiate auditory and multisensory nuclei in the intercollicular area of the midbrain</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Perineuronal nets and subtypes of GABAergic cells differentiate auditory and multisensory nuclei in the intercollicular area of the midbrain&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/942f7ffe-bb84-48c6-945b-0a74d40c61d2/cne24926-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intercollicular region, which lies between the inferior and superior colliculi in the midbrain, contains neurons that respond to auditory, visual, and somatosensory stimuli. Golgi studies have been used to parse this region into three distinct nuclei: the intercollicular tegmentum (ICt), the rostral pole of the inferior colliculus (ICrp), and the nucleus of the brachium of the IC (NBIC). Few reports have focused on these nuclei, especially the ICt and the ICrp, possibly due to lack of a marker that distinguishes these areas and is compatible with modern methods. Here, we show that staining for GABAergic cells (magenta) and perineuronal nets (green) differentiates these intercollicular nuclei in guinea pigs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intercollicular region, which lies between the inferior and superior colliculi in the midbrain, contains neurons that respond to auditory, visual, and somatosensory stimuli. Golgi studies have been used to parse this region into three distinct nuclei: the intercollicular tegmentum (ICt), the rostral pole of the inferior colliculus (ICrp), and the nucleus of the brachium of the IC (NBIC). Few reports have focused on these nuclei, especially the ICt and the ICrp, possibly due to lack of a marker that distinguishes these areas and is compatible with modern methods. Here, we found that staining for GABAergic cells and perineuronal nets differentiates these intercollicular nuclei in guinea pigs. Further, we found that the proportions of four subtypes of GABAergic cells differentiate intercollicular nuclei from each other and from adjacent inferior collicular subdivisions. Our results support earlier studies that suggest distinct morphology and functions for intercollicular nuclei, and provide staining methods that differentiate intercollicular nuclei and are compatible with most modern techniques. We hope that this will help future studies to further characterize the intercollicular region.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Is Associated with Faster and Specific Retinal Layer Atrophy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25738?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25738?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic development in progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS) has been hampered by a lack of reliable biomarkers to monitor neurodegeneration. Optical coherence tomography (OCT)‐derived retinal measures have been proposed as promising biomarkers to fulfill this role. However, it is unclear whether retinal atrophy persists in PMS, exceeds normal aging, or can be distinguished from relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;178 RRMS, 186 PMS, and 66 control participants were followed with serial OCT for a median follow‐up of 3.7 years.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estimated proportion of peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) and macular ganglion cell + inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thinning in multiple sclerosis (MS) attributable to normal aging increased from 42.7% and 16.7% respectively at age 25 years, to 83.7% and 81.1% at age 65 years. However, independent of age, PMS was associated with faster pRNFL (−0.34 ± 0.09%/yr, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and GCIPL (−0.27 ± 0.07%/yr, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) thinning, as compared to RRMS. In both MS and controls, higher baseline age was associated with faster inner nuclear layer (INL) and outer nuclear layer (ONL) thinning. INL and ONL thinning were independently faster in PMS, as compared to controls (INL:−0.09 ± 0.04%/yr, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03; ONL:−0.12 ± 0.06%/yr, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04), and RRMS (INL:−0.10 ± 0.04%/yr, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.01; ONL:−0.13 ± 0.05%/yr, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.01), whereas they were similar in RRMS and controls. Unlike RRMS, disease‐modifying therapies (DMTs) did not impact rates of retinal layer atrophy in PMS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PMS is associated with faster retinal atrophy independent of age. INL and ONL measures may be novel biomarkers of neurodegeneration in PMS that appear to be unaffected by conventional DMTs. The effects of aging on rates of retinal layer atrophy should be considered in clinical trials incorporating OCT outcomes. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Toll‐like receptor 4 differentially regulates adult hippocampal neurogenesis in an age‐ and sex‐dependent manner</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23209?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23209?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toll‐like receptor 4 (TLR4) is primarily responsible for initiating an immune response following pathogen recognition. However, TLR4 is also expressed on neural progenitor cells and has been reported to regulate hippocampal neurogenesis as young male TLR4 knockout mice show increases in cell proliferation and doublecortin positive cells. Whether these effects occur in both sexes and are sustained with normal aging is currently unknown. The present study evaluated whether TLR4 deficiency alters adult hippocampal neurogenesis in young (3–4 months) and aged (18–20 months), male and female, TLR4 deficient (TLR4−/−; B6.B10ScN‐Tlr4lps‐del/JthJ) and wild type (WT) mice. Additionally, neurogenesis within the dorsal and the ventral hippocampal subdivisions was evaluated to determine if TLR4 has differential effects across the hippocampus. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was administered to quantify new cell survival as well as cell differentiation. Ki‐67 was measured to evaluate cell proliferation. Results show that young TLR4−/− females had higher rates of proliferation and neuronal differentiation in both the dorsal and ventral hippocampus relative to WT females. Young TLR4−/− males show elevated proliferation and neuronal differentiation mainly in the ventral hippocampus. While young TLR4−/− mice show enhanced neurogenesis compared to young WT mice, the increase was not apparent in the aged TLR4−/− mice. Both aged WT and TLR4−/− mice showed a decrease in proliferation, new cell survival, and neuronal differentiation compared to young WT and TLR4−/− mice. The data collectively indicate that TLR4 regulates hippocampal neurogenesis in young adults, but that these effects are region‐specific in males and that females show broader changes in neurogenesis throughout the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Conditional and biased regeneration of cone photoreceptor types in the zebrafish retina</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Conditional and biased regeneration of cone photoreceptor types in the zebrafish retina&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/48318b9f-0de7-4bd2-8243-5a706d307920/cne24933-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major challenge in regenerative medicine is replacing cells lost through injury or disease. While significant progress has been made, much remains unknown about the accuracy of native regenerative programs in cell replacement. Here, we capitalized on the regenerative capacity and stereotypic retinal organization of zebrafish to determine the specificity with which retinal Müller glial cells replace lost neuronal cell types. By utilizing a targeted genetic ablation technique, we restricted death to all or to distinct cone photoreceptor types (red, blue or UV‐sensitive cones), enabling us to compare the composition of cones that are regenerated. We found that Müller glia produce cones of all types upon non‐discriminate ablation of these photoreceptors, or upon selective ablation of red or UV cones. Pan‐ablation of cones led to regeneration of the various cone types in relative abundances that resembled those of non‐ablated controls, i.e. red&amp;gt;green&amp;gt;UV ~ blue cones. Moreover, selective loss of red or UV cones biased production toward the cone type that was ablated. In contrast, ablation of blue cones alone largely failed to induce cone production at all, although it did induce cell division in Müller glia. The failure to produce cones upon selective elimination of blue cones may be due to their low abundance compared to other cone types. Alternatively, it may be that blue cone death alone does not trigger a change in progenitor competency to support cone genesis. Our findings add to the growing notion that cell replacement during regeneration does not perfectly mimic programs of cell generation during development.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Sequences of Reverse Transcribed Brain DNA Are Modified by Learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00057</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00057</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain metabolic DNA (BMD) is continuously synthesized by reverse transcription in presynaptic synaptosomes and astroglia, and is partly transferred to nuclei after acquiring the double stranded configuration. Synthesis and turnover of BMD are markedly dependent on brain activity, as shown by circadian oscillations, environmental enrichment and impoverishment, and a variety of learning protocols. In rodents learning a two-way active avoidance task, BMD synthesis doubles, thus raising the possibility that sequences of learning BMD may differ from control BMD. The hypothesis has now been examined by sequencing cytoplasmic BMD. The present data indicate that most high-quality mapped BMD fragments hosting more than seven sequences are present in all mice. Three of them are exclusively present in learning BMD and four in control BMD. In addition, the annotated genes closest to them are mostly involved in modulating synaptic activity. The data support the conclusion that learning BMD sequences encode brain responses to the modified environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Opioid analgesics represent a critical treatment for chronic pain in the analgesic ladder of the World Health Organization. However, their use can result in a number of unwanted side-effects including incomplete efficacy, constipation, physical dependence, and overdose liability. Cannabinoids enhance the pain-relieving effects of opioids in preclinical studies and dampen unwanted side-effects resulting from excessive opioid intake. We recently reported that a CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; positive allosteric modulator (PAM) exhibits antinociceptive efficacy in models of pathological pain and lacks the adverse side effects of direct CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor activation. In the present study, we evaluated whether a CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; PAM would enhance morphine’s therapeutic efficacy in an animal model of chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain and characterized its impact on unwanted side-effects associated with chronic opioid administration. In paclitaxel-treated mice, both the CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; PAM GAT211 and the opioid analgesic morphine reduced paclitaxel-induced behavioral hypersensitivities to mechanical and cold stimulation in a dose-dependent manner. Isobolographic analysis revealed that combinations of GAT211 and morphine resulted in anti-allodynic synergism. In paclitaxel-treated mice, a sub-threshold dose of GAT211 prevented the development of tolerance to the anti-allodynic effects of morphine over 20 days of once daily dosing. However, GAT211 did not reliably alter somatic withdrawal signs (i.e., jumps, paw tremors) in morphine-dependent neuropathic mice challenged with naloxone. In otherwise naïve mice, GAT211 also prolonged antinociceptive efficacy of morphine in the tail-flick test and reduced the overall right-ward shift in the ED&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; for morphine to produce antinociception in the tail-flick test, consistent with attenuation of morphine tolerance. Pretreatment with GAT211 did not alter somatic signs of μ opioid receptor dependence in mice rendered dependent upon morphine via subcutaneous implantation of a morphine pellet. Moreover, GAT211 did not reliably alter μ-opioid receptor-mediated reward as measured by conditioned place preference to morphine. Our results suggest that a CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; PAM may be beneficial in enhancing and prolonging the therapeutic properties of opioids while potentially sparing unwanted side-effects (e.g., tolerance) that occur with repeated opioid treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: A Treatment Option for Symptomatic Chronic Complete Internal Carotid Artery Occlusion: Hybrid Surgery</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Internal carotid artery occlusion (ICAO) is a relatively uncommon but important cause of transient ischemic attack and cerebral infarction. The majority of cases of symptomatic ICAO requires surgical treatment. In this study we performed an investigation of the efficacy and safety of hybrid surgery which is a surgical method for symptomatic chronic complete ICAO.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Fifty-five patients with symptomatic chronic ICAO treated by hybrid surgery from 2016 to 2019 were included. We recorded and analyzed the patients’ clinical characteristics, angiographic data, recanalization rate, complications, and outcomes. Catheter angiography or computed tomography angiography was used to assess the patency of the recanalized ICA during follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The total success rate of recanalization was 78.2% (43/55). The occlusions were significantly shorter in the success than failure group (5.40 ± 1.50 vs. 7.56 ± 0.99 cm, respectively; P &amp;lt; 0.001). The median duration of ICA occlusion was significantly shorter in the success than failure group (90 vs. 200 days, respectively). The success rates of distal ICA recanalization at the petrous segment or below, cavernous segment, and clinoid segment or above were 100, 33.3, and 14.3%, respectively (P &amp;lt; 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that the level of distal ICA reconstitution was the only factor affecting the recanalization success rate. Periprocedural complications included hyperperfusion syndrome (n = 1) and laryngeal nerve injury (n = 1). ICA reocclusion occurred in one patient (2.3%). Significant postoperative improvement in symptoms was observed in the success group, with a median modified Rankin scale score of 0 at the 3-month follow-up compared with before recanalization (median, 1) (P&amp;lt;0.001).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Hybrid surgery might be safe and effective for patients with symptomatic chronic complete ICAO. The level of distal ICA reconstitution is a predictor of successful recanalization in hybrid operations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Multiple-Hit Hypothesis in Parkinson’s Disease: LRRK2 and Inflammation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00376</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The multiple hit hypothesis for Parkinson’s disease (PD) suggests that an interaction between multiple (genetic and/or environmental) risk factors is needed to trigger the pathology. Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) is an interesting protein to study in this context and is the focus of this review. More than 15 years of intensive research have identified several cellular pathways in which LRRK2 is involved, yet its exact physiological role or contribution to PD is not completely understood. Pathogenic mutations in LRRK2 are the most common genetic cause of PD but most likely require additional triggers to develop PD, as suggested by the reduced penetrance of the LRRK2 G2019S mutation. LRRK2 expression is high in immune cells such as monocytes, neutrophils, or dendritic cells, compared to neurons or glial cells and evidence for a role of LRRK2 in the immune system is emerging. This has led to the hypothesis that an inflammatory trigger is needed for pathogenic LRRK2 mutations to induce a PD phenotype. In this review, we will discuss the link between LRRK2 and inflammation and how this could play an active role in PD etiology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Alterations of the Motor and Olfactory Functions Related to Parkinson’s Disease in Transgenic Mice With a VMAT2-Deficiency in Dopaminergic Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00356</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, with approximately six million people affected worldwide. Vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) dysfunction has recently become a hot topic in the pathophysiology of PD, and the advent of transgenic mice has also accelerated the development of behavioral studies in animal models. However, there are only a few systematic behavioral tests that embrace abundant motor and non-motor performance in a unique mutant mouse model which correspond to the varied symptoms observed in human PD. The aim of this study is to evaluate the responsibility of the unique reduction of dopamine in the varied motor and non-motor symptoms of PD via a transgenic mice model. We analyzed neurotransmitter concentrations in the brain tissue of 18-month-old mutant mice, with selective inactivation of one allele of Vmat2 in dopaminergic neurons (VMAT2&lt;sup&gt;DATcre&lt;/sup&gt;-HET) to confirm the selective reduction of dopamine, and then examined behavioral functions. Neurochemical tests showed lower dopamine concentrations in specific brain regions of VMAT2&lt;sup&gt;DATcre&lt;/sup&gt;-HET mice, especially the ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra and striatum, together with relatively unchanging concentrations of norepinephrine and serotonin, demonstrating the dopaminergic specificity of this mouse model. Behavioral tasks showed impairments in several motor functions and major defects in olfactory abilities in the VMAT2&lt;sup&gt;DATcre&lt;/sup&gt;-HET mice. However, no significant changes were found in the majority of non-motor tests, such as emotional performance and sleep patterns. We concluded from this study that the selective inactivation of one allele of the Vmat2 gene in dopaminergic neurons was related to dopamine reduction, resulting in phenotypes resembling some of the major deficits in PD, especially those of motor symptoms and olfactory functions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Toward the Understanding of Topographical and Spectral Signatures of Infant Movement Artifacts in Naturalistic EEG</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Electroencephalography (EEG) is perhaps the most widely used brain-imaging technique for pediatric populations. However, EEG signals are prone to distortion by motion. Compared to adults, infants’ motion is both more frequent and less stereotypical yet motion effects on the infant EEG signal are largely undocumented. Here, we present a systematic assessment of naturalistic motion effects on the infant EEG signal. EEG recordings were performed with 14 infants (12 analyzed) who passively watched movies whilst spontaneously producing periods of bodily movement and rest. Each infant produced an average of 38.3 s (SD = 14.7 s) of rest and 18.8 s (SD = 17.9 s) of single motion segments for the final analysis. Five types of infant motions were analyzed: Jaw movements, and Limb movements of the Hand, Arm, Foot, and Leg. Significant movement-related distortions of the EEG signal were detected using cluster-based permutation analysis. This analysis revealed that, relative to resting state, infants’ Jaw and Arm movements produced significant increases in beta (∼15 Hz) power, particularly over peripheral sites. Jaw movements produced more anteriorly located effects than Arm movements, which were most pronounced over posterior parietal and occipital sites. The cluster analysis also revealed trends toward decreased power in the theta and alpha bands observed over central topographies for all motion types. However, given the very limited quantity of infant data in this study, caution is recommended in interpreting these findings before subsequent replications are conducted. Nonetheless, this work is an important first step to inform future development of methods for addressing EEG motion-related artifacts. This work also supports wider use of naturalistic paradigms in social and developmental neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: 3D-BoxSup: Positive-Unlabeled Learning of Brain Tumor Segmentation Networks From 3D Bounding Boxes</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Accurate segmentation is an essential task when working with medical images. Recently, deep convolutional neural networks achieved a state-of-the-art performance for many segmentation benchmarks. Regardless of the network architecture, the deep learning-based segmentation methods view the segmentation problem as a supervised task that requires a relatively large number of annotated images. Acquiring a large number of annotated medical images is time consuming, and high-quality segmented images (i.e., strong labels) crafted by human experts are expensive. In this paper, we have proposed a method that achieves competitive accuracy from a “weakly annotated” image where the weak annotation is obtained via a 3D bounding box denoting an object of interest. Our method, called “3D-BoxSup,” employs a positive-unlabeled learning framework to learn segmentation masks from 3D bounding boxes. Specially, we consider the pixels outside of the bounding box as positively labeled data and the pixels inside the bounding box as unlabeled data. Our method can suppress the negative effects of pixels residing between the true segmentation mask and the 3D bounding box and produce accurate segmentation masks. We applied our method to segment a brain tumor. The experimental results on the BraTS 2017 dataset (Menze et al., 2015; Bakas et al., 2017a,b,c) have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: An Augmented-Reality fNIRS-Based Brain-Computer Interface: A Proof-of-Concept Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00346</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Augmented reality (AR) enhances the user’s environment by projecting virtual objects into the real world in real-time. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are systems that enable users to control external devices with their brain signals. BCIs can exploit AR technology to interact with the physical and virtual world and to explore new ways of displaying feedback. This is important for users to perceive and regulate their brain activity or shape their communication intentions while operating in the physical world. In this study, twelve healthy participants were introduced to and asked to choose between two motor-imagery tasks: mental drawing and interacting with a virtual cube. Participants first performed a functional localizer run, which was used to select a single fNIRS channel for decoding their intentions in eight subsequent choice-encoding runs. In each run participants were asked to select one choice of a six-item list. A rotating AR cube was displayed on a computer screen as the main stimulus, where each face of the cube was presented for 6 s and represented one choice of the six-item list. For five consecutive trials, participants were instructed to perform the motor-imagery task when the face of the cube that represented their choice was facing them (therewith temporally encoding the selected choice). In the end of each run, participants were provided with the decoded choice based on a joint analysis of all five trials. If the decoded choice was incorrect, an active error-correction procedure was applied by the participant. The choice list provided in each run was based on the decoded choice of the previous run. The experimental design allowed participants to navigate twice through a virtual menu that consisted of four levels if all choices were correctly decoded. Here we demonstrate for the first time that by using AR feedback and flexible choice encoding in form of search trees, we can increase the degrees of freedom of a BCI system. We also show that participants can successfully navigate through a nested menu and achieve a mean accuracy of 74% using a single motor-imagery task and a single fNIRS channel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Critical Review of Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation: Challenges for Translation to Clinical Practice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00284</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00284</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Several studies have illustrated that transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) can elicit therapeutic effects that are similar to those produced by its invasive counterpart, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). VNS is an FDA-approved therapy for the treatment of both depression and epilepsy, but it is limited to the management of more severe, intervention-resistant cases as a second or third-line treatment option due to perioperative risks involved with device implantation. In contrast, tVNS is a non-invasive technique that involves the application of electrical currents through surface electrodes at select locations, most commonly targeting the auricular branch of the vagus nerve (ABVN) and the cervical branch of the vagus nerve in the neck. Although it has been shown that tVNS elicits hypo- and hyperactivation in various regions of the brain associated with anxiety and mood regulation, the mechanism of action and influence of stimulation parameters on clinical outcomes remains predominantly hypothetical. Suppositions are largely based on correlations between the neurobiology of the vagus nerve and its effects on neural activity. However, tVNS has also been investigated for several other disorders, including tinnitus, migraine and pain, by targeting the vagus nerve at sites in both the ear and the neck. As most of the described methods differ in the parameters and protocols applied, there is currently no firm evidence on the optimal location for tVNS or the stimulation parameters that provide the greatest therapeutic effects for a specific condition. This review presents the current status of tVNS with a focus on stimulation parameters, stimulation sites, and available devices. For tVNS to reach its full potential as a non-invasive and clinically relevant therapy, it is imperative that systematic studies be undertaken to reveal the mechanism of action and optimal stimulation modalities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Quantitative assessment of tissue microstructure is important in studying human brain diseases and disorders. Ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data obtained using a multi-echo gradient echo sequence have been shown to contain information on myelin, axonal, and extracellular compartments in tissue. Quantitative assessment of water fraction, relaxation time (T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;*), and frequency shift using multi-compartment models has been shown to be useful in studying white matter properties via specific tissue parameters. It remains unclear how tissue parameters vary with model selection based on 7T multiple echo time gradient-recalled echo (GRE) MRI data. We applied existing signal compartment models to the corpus callosum and investigated whether a three-compartment model can be reduced to two compartments and still resolve white matter parameters [i.e., myelin water fraction (MWF) and g-ratio]. We show that MWF should be computed using a three-compartment model in the corpus callosum, and the g-ratios obtained using three compartment models are consistent with previous reports. We provide results for other parameters, such as signal compartment frequency shifts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder Using Central-Moment Features From Low- and High-Order Dynamic Resting-State Functional Connectivity Networks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00258</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The sliding-window-based dynamic functional connectivity networks (D-FCNs) derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) are effective methods for diagnosing various neurological diseases, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, traditional D-FCNs are low-order networks based on pairwise correlation between brain regions, thus overlooking high-level interactions across multiple regions of interest (ROIs). Moreover, D-FCNs suffer from the temporal mismatching issue, i.e., subnetworks in the same temporal window do not have temporal correspondence across different subjects. To address the above problems, we first construct a novel high-order D-FCNs based on the principle of “correlation’s correlation” to further explore the higher level and more complex interaction relationships among multiple ROIs. Furthermore, we propose to use a central-moment method to extract temporal-invariance properties contained in either low- or high-order D-FCNs. Finally, we design and train an ensemble classifier by fusing the features extracted from conventional FCN, low-order D-FCNs, and high-order D-FCNs for the diagnosis of ASD and normal control subjects. Our method achieved the best ASD classification accuracy (83%), and our results revealed the features extracted from different networks fingerprinting the autistic brain at different connectional levels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Non-human primate models are widely used in studying the brain mechanism underlying brain development, cognitive functions, and psychiatric disorders. Neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging, play an important role in the examinations of brain structure and functions. As an indispensable tool for brain imaging data analysis, brain atlases have been extensively investigated, and a variety of versions constructed. These atlases diverge in the criteria based on which they are plotted. The criteria range from cytoarchitectonic features, neurotransmitter receptor distributions, myelination fingerprints, and transcriptomic patterns to structural and functional connectomic profiles. Among them, brainnetome atlas is tightly related to brain connectome information and built by parcellating the brain on the basis of the anatomical connectivity profiles derived from structural neuroimaging data. The pipeline for building the brainnetome atlas has been published as a toolbox named ATPP (A Pipeline for Automatic Tractography-Based Brain Parcellation). In this paper, we present a variation of ATPP, which is dedicated to monkey brain parcellation, to address the significant differences in the process between the two species. The new toolbox, MonkeyCBP, has major alterations in three aspects: brain extraction, image registration, and validity indices. By parcellating two different brain regions (posterior cingulate cortex) and (frontal pole) of the rhesus monkey, we demonstrate the efficacy of these alterations. The toolbox has been made public (https://github.com/bheAI/MonkeyCBP_CLI, https://github.com/bheAI/MonkeyCBP_GUI). It is expected that the toolbox can benefit the non-human primate neuroimaging community with high-throughput computation and low labor involvement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Cortical Activation Patterns of Different Masking Noises and Correlation With Their Masking Efficacy, Determined by Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Acoustic therapy in tinnitus treatment is poorly characterized, and efficacy assessment depends on subjective descriptions. Narrow-band noise, notched sound, and white noise have positive therapeutic effects on monotonous tinnitus. Considering the tonotopic characteristics of the auditory system and the spectral characteristics of these three masking sounds, the activation pattern of the auditory cortex and the mechanism of inhibiting tinnitus may be different. This study aimed to compare the activation patterns of three spectrally different masking noises and study the correlation between the masking effects and variational amplitude of oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) in the corresponding cortical regions. We also assessed near-infrared spectroscopy brain function imaging (NIRS) as an objective assessment tool in acoustic therapy. Patients with persistent non-pulsatile tinnitus and control volunteers without tinnitus were enrolled in this study. The subjects were seated in a sound-proof room, with two optode arrays covering the bilateral temporal lobe. Auditory stimuli were presented; stimulation sequences followed the block design: different noises appeared randomly and repeated in five cycles. Tinnitus match and residual inhibition were performed in the tinnitus group. The data analyses were conducted using the NIRS_SPM toolbox. The group analysis results showed that the narrow-band noise caused a marginally significant decrease in HbO signal in the Brodmann 21 region (BA21), while white noise caused a significant increase in HbO signal in BA21. Notched sound did not cause significant changes in the HbO signal in the temporal cortex. And none of the three masking noises caused significant changes in the HbR signal in the temporal cortex. The depth of residual inhibition induced by the narrow-band noise and white noise significantly correlated with ΔHbO in the region of interest (ROI). However, neither the depth nor duration of the residual inhibition induced by notched sound correlated with the ΔHbO. Thus, NIRS showed three cortical activation patterns induced by three different masking noises, and correlations between residual inhibition effects and change of HbO amplitude were found. NIRS could therefore be applied in objective assessment of acoustic therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Functional Use of Directional Local Field Potentials in the Subthalamic Nucleus Deep Brain Stimulation</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Directional deep brain stimulation (DBS) technology aims to address the limitations, such as stimulation-induced side effects, by delivering selective, focal modulation via segmented contacts. However, DBS programming becomes more complex and time-consuming for clinical feasibility. Local field potentials (LFPs) might serve a functional role in guiding clinical programming.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;In this pilot study, we investigated the spectral dynamics of directional LFPs in subthalamic nucleus (STN) and their relationship to motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We recorded intraoperative STN-LFPs from 8-contact leads (Infinity-6172, Abbott Laboratories, Illinois, United States) in 8 PD patients at rest. Directional LFPs were referenced to their common average and time-frequency analysis was computed using a modified Welch periodogram method. The beta band (13–35 Hz) features were extracted and their correlation to preoperative UPDRS-III scores were assessed.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Normalized beta power (13–20 Hz) and normalized peak power (13–35 Hz) were found to be higher in anterior direction despite lack of statistical significance (p &amp;gt; 0.05). Results of the Spearman correlation analysis demonstrated positive trends with bradykinesia/rigidity in dorsoanterior direction (r = 0.659, p = 0.087) and with axial scores in the dorsomedial direction (r = 0.812, p = 0.072).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Given that testing all possible combinations of contact pairs and stimulation parameters is not feasible in a single clinic visit, spatio-spectral LFP dynamics obtained from intraoperative recordings might be used as an initial marker to select optimal contact(s).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: This study evaluated the bibliometric data of the most common publication types of the neuroimaging literature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: PubMed was searched to identify all published papers with “neuroimaging” as their MeSH Major Topics, and they were further searched by the following publication types: case report, clinical trial, comparative study, editorial, evaluation study, guideline, meta-analysis, multicenter study, randomized controlled trial, review, technical report, and validation study. The proportion of papers belonging to each publication type published in neuroimaging journals was calculated. Year-adjusted mean citation counts for each publication type were computed using data from Web of Science. Publication trend and its correlation with citation performance were assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Review and comparative study were the most common publication types. Publication types with the highest proportion in neuroimaging journals were guideline, validation study, and technical reports. Since the year 2000, multicenter study, review, and meta-analysis showed the strongest linear increase in annual publication count. These publication types also had the highest year-adjusted citation counts (4.7–10.0). Publication types with the lowest year-adjusted citation counts were editorial and case report (0.5–1.0). It was estimated that 12.5% of the publications labeled as case reports were incorrectly labeled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Neuroimaging literature has been expanding with papers of higher levels of evidence, such as meta-analyses, multicenter studies, and randomized controlled trials.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neural Dynamics of Karaoke-Like Voice Imitation in Singing Performance</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Beyond normal and non-imitative singing, the imitation of the timbre of another singer’s voice, such as in Karaoke singing, involves the demanding reproduction of voice quality features and strongly depends on singing experience and practice. We show that precise voice imitation in a highly proficient and experienced vocal imitator, even in the absence of external auditory voice feedback, largely drew on internal cortico-subcortical auditory resources to control voicing errors based on imagined voice performance. Compared to the experienced vocal imitator, singers of a control group without experience in voice imitation used only sensorimotor feedback and demanding monitoring resources for imitation in the absence of voice feedback, a neural strategy that led, however, to a significantly poorer vocal performance. Thus, only long-term vocal imitation experience allows for the additional use of internal auditory brain resources, which result from training-induced brain plasticity, and which enable accurate vocal performance even under difficult performance conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Decreased Functional Connectivity Between the Left Amygdala and Frontal Regions Interferes With Reading, Emotional, and Executive Functions in Children With Reading Difficulties</title>

	<description>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Dyslexia is a reading disorder characterized by significant difficulty in reading, as well as reports of altered executive functions (EF). Children with reading difficulties (RD) experience a broad range of social and emotional problems. Recently it was suggested that children with RD have altered functional connections within the amygdala, which is related to emotional processing. Altered brain laterality related to reading was previously reported in children with RD. Hence, we sought to determine the differences in functional connectivity between the right and left emotional network as related to emotional challenges and the other reported difficulties in reading and EF in children with RD compared to typical readers.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Sixty-four 8 to 12 year old children, 27 children with RD and 37 age-matched typical readers, participated in the study. Reading, emotional, and EF abilities were assessed. Global efficiency of the emotional network was calculated and compared between the groups, and left vs. right functional connectivity of the amygdala was tested using the CONN toolbox. Functional connectivity measures were then associated with measures of reading, emotional, and EF abilities.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Children with RD showed significantly decreased emotional and EF abilities compared to typical readers. A negative correlation between reading, emotional, and EF abilities was determined in both groups. Neuroimaging results showed decreased global efficiency measures within the emotional network in children with RD, who also showed lower functional connectivity between the amygdala and the left and right frontal pole regions. Results also indicated increased functional connectivity of the right vs. left amygdala with left and right pre-central and post-central gyri regions, which were related to decreased reading, emotional, and EF abilities in both typical readers and children with RD.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The positive relationship between EF and emotional abilities in children with RD strengthens the relationship between EF difficulties and emotional stress, which in turn may lower EF abilities (monitoring, inhibition, and attention) as well as decreased reading abilities. The emotional challenges in children with RD were associated with decreased functional connectivity of the left amygdala with pre/post central gyrus and cognitive-control regions. These findings suggest that although the right hemisphere is thought to be related to emotional stress, it was the decreased control of the left hemisphere that was related to emotional disturbance in children with RD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Photoreceptor Disc Enclosure Occurs in the Absence of Normal Peripherin-2/rds Oligomerization</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00092</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mutations in the peripherin-2 gene (PRPH2, also known as rds) cause a heterogeneous range of autosomal dominant retinal diseases. PRPH2 encodes a photoreceptor-specific tetraspanin protein, PRPH2, that is a main structural component of the photoreceptor outer segment. PRPH2 distributes to the rims of outer segment disc membranes as they undergo the process of disc membrane enclosure. Within these rims, PRPH2 exists in homo-oligomeric form or as a hetero-oligomer with another tetraspanin protein, ROM1. While complete loss of PRPH2 prevents photoreceptor outer segment formation, mutations affecting the state of its oligomerization, including C150S, C213Y and Y141C, produce outer segment structural defects. In this study, we addressed whether any of these mutations also affect disc enclosure. We employed recently developed methodology for ultrastructural analysis of the retina, involving tissue processing with tannic acid, to assess the status of disc enclosure in knockin mouse models bearing either one or two alleles of the C150S, C213Y and Y141C PRPH2 mutations. While varying degrees of outer segment structural abnormalities were observed in each of these mouse models, they contained both newly forming “open” discs and mature “enclosed” discs. These data demonstrate that normal PRPH2 oligomerization is not essential for photoreceptor disc enclosure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Critical Components for Spontaneous Activity and Rhythm Generation in Spinal Cord Circuits in Culture</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00081</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal excitability contributes to rhythm generation in central pattern generating networks (CPGs). In spinal cord CPGs, such intrinsic excitability partly relies on persistent sodium currents (I&lt;sub&gt;NaP&lt;/sub&gt;), whereas respiratory CPGs additionally depend on calcium-activated cation currents (I&lt;sub&gt;CAN&lt;/sub&gt;). Here, we investigated the contributions of I&lt;sub&gt;NaP&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;CAN&lt;/sub&gt; to spontaneous rhythm generation in neuronal networks of the spinal cord and whether they mainly involve Hb9 neurons. We used cultures of ventral and transverse slices from the E13–14 embryonic rodent lumbar spinal cord on multielectrode arrays (MEAs). All cultures showed spontaneous bursts of network activity. Blocking synaptic excitation with the AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX suppressed spontaneous network bursts and left asynchronous intrinsic activity at about 30% of the electrodes. Such intrinsic activity was completely blocked at all electrodes by both the I&lt;sub&gt;NaP&lt;/sub&gt; blocker riluzole as well as by the I&lt;sub&gt;CAN&lt;/sub&gt; blocker flufenamic acid (FFA) and the more specific TRPM4 channel antagonist 9-phenanthrol. All three antagonists also suppressed spontaneous bursting completely and strongly reduced stimulus-evoked bursts. Also, FFA reduced repetitive spiking that was induced in single neurons by injection of depolarizing current pulses to few spikes. Other antagonists of unspecific cation currents or calcium currents had no suppressing effects on either intrinsic activity (gadolinium chloride) or spontaneous bursting (the TRPC channel antagonists clemizole and ML204 and the T channel antagonist TTA-P2). Combined patch-clamp and MEA recordings showed that Hb9 interneurons were activated by network bursts but could not initiate them. Together these findings suggest that both I&lt;sub&gt;NaP&lt;/sub&gt; through Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-channels and I&lt;sub&gt;CAN&lt;/sub&gt; through putative TRPM4 channels contribute to spontaneous intrinsic and repetitive spiking in spinal cord neurons and thereby to the generation of network bursts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;In this study, we assessed plasma biomarkers to identify cognitive impairment in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients by applying ultra-sensitive immunomagnetic reduction-based immunoassay (IMR).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The study enrolled 60 PD patients and 28 age- and sex-matched normal controls. Complete cognitive function assessments were performed on participants using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating. PD patients with an MMSE score of ≦26 were defined as having cognitive impairment. Meanwhile, a 99mTc-TRODAT-1 scan was performed and plasma levels of Aβ-40, Aβ-42, T-tau, and α-synuclein were evaluated using IMR, subsequent correlation analyses were then performed.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared with normal adults, PD patients have higher plasma levels of α-synuclein and T-tau, and a lower level of Aβ-40 (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Plasma levels of α-synuclein (r = −0.323, p = 0.002), Aβ-40 (r = 0.276, p = 0.01), and T-tau (r = −0.322, p = 0.002) are significantly correlated with MMSE scores. The TRODAT scan results, including visual inspection and quantification, revealed significant correlations between Aβ-40 and PD. Multiple regression analysis showed that the plasma levels of Aβ-40 (OR = 0.921, 95% CI = 0.879–0.962), α-synuclein (OR = 3.016, 95% CI = 1.703–5.339), and T-tau (OR = 1.069, 95% CI = 1.026–1.115) were independently associated with PD patients with cognitive impairment. The cutoff values for predicting cognitive deficits in PD patients were 45.101 pg/ml of Aβ-40, (Area under curve (AUC) = 0.791), 0.389 pg/ml of α-synuclein, (AUC = 0.790), and 30.555 pg/ml of T-tau (AUC = 0.726).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Plasma levels of α-synuclein, Aβ-40, and T-tau are potential biomarkers to detect cognitive impairment in PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Get Moving! Increases in Physical Activity Are Associated With Increasing Functional Connectivity Trajectories in Typically Aging Adults</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00104</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00104</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Physical activity closely relates to cognition and brain structure as we age. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this relationship in humans remain less clear. Functional connectivity (FC), measured by task-free functional MRI (tf-fMRI) is a dynamic marker of network activity and may be a sensitive indicator of the brain’s response to exercise over time. We aimed to test the longitudinal relationship between physical activity and FC trajectories in functionally normal older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Two hundred and twelve functionally normal, longitudinally-followed older adults completed the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) and tf-fMRI scans at each visit [mean = 1.5 visits (range:1–3)]. We studied FC of the default mode network (DMN), frontal-parietal (FP), subcortical networks (SubCort), and frontal-subcortical inter-network connectivity (FS), given that previous studies implicate these regions in age-related changes. Linear mixed-effects models examined the relationship between within-person changes in PASE and FC (in SD units), covarying for age, sex, education and systemic cardiovascular risk factors (heart rate, BMI and systolic blood pressure). We additionally examined models covarying for DTI fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) of tracts underlying networks of interest, as a marker of cerebrovascular disease. Furthermore, we examined the longitudinal relationship between PASE and neuropsychological trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In our first model, within-subject increases in physical activity tracked with increasing SubCort (β = 0.33, p = 0.007) and FS inter-network (β = 0.27, p = 0.03) synchrony, while between-subject parameters did not reach significance (β = −0.042 to −0.07, ps &amp;gt; 0.37). No significant longitudinal associations were observed between PASE and DMN (β = −0.02 p = 0.89) or FP networks (β = 0.15, p = 0.23). Adjusting for markers of cerebrovascular health (FA/MD) did not change estimated effects (SubCort: β = 0.31, p = 0.01, FS inter-network: β = 0.28, p = 0.03). Associations between changes in physical activity and neuropsychological trajectories were small (β = −0.14 to 0.002) and did not reach statistical significance (p-values &amp;gt;0.42).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our findings suggest that changes in exercise over time are specifically associated with frontal-subcortical processes in older adults. This relationship appears to be independent of cardio- or cerebrovascular disease, possibly driven by a more direct neural response to exercise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Insula and Amygdala Atrophy Are Associated With Functional Impairment in Subjects With Presbycusis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hearing loss is an important risk factor for dementia. However, the mechanisms that relate these disorders are still unknown. As a proxy of this relationship, we studied the structural brain changes associated with functional impairment in activities of daily living in subjects with age related hearing loss, or presbycusis. One hundred eleven independent, non-demented subjects older than 65 years recruited in the ANDES cohort were evaluated using a combined approach including (i) audiological tests: hearing thresholds and cochlear function measured by pure tone averages and the distortion product otoacoustic emissions respectively; (ii) behavioral variables: cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and functional impairment in activities of daily living measured by validated questionnaires; and (iii) structural brain imaging—assessed by magnetic resonance imaging at 3 Tesla. The mean age of the recruited subjects (69 females) was 73.95 ± 5.47 years (mean ± SD) with an average educational level of 9.44 ± 4.2 years of schooling. According to the audiometric hearing thresholds and presence of otoacoustic emissions, we studied three groups: controls with normal hearing (n = 36), presbycusis with preserved cochlear function (n = 33), and presbycusis with cochlear dysfunction (n = 38). We found a significant association (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.17) between the number of detected otoacoustic emissions and apathy symptoms. The presbycusis with cochlear dysfunction group had worse performance than controls in global cognition, language and executive functions, and severe apathy symptoms than the other groups. The neuropsychiatric symptoms and language deficits were the main determinants of functional impairment in both groups of subjects with presbycusis. Atrophy of insula, amygdala, and other temporal areas were related with functional impairment, apathy, and language deficits in the presbycusis with cochlear dysfunction group. We conclude that (i) the neuropsychiatric symptoms had a major effect on functional loss in subjects with presbycusis, (ii) cochlear dysfunction is relevant for the association between hearing loss and behavioral impairment, and (iii) atrophy of the insula and amygdala among other temporal areas are related with hearing loss and behavioral impairment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Freezing phenomenon is a striking feature of Parkinson’s disease. However, it has never been studied in people with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). We designed a freezing of speech single questionnaire (FOSSQ) and investigated the frequency and association of freezing of speech (FOS) in patients with DLB and other types of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;This is a retrospective analysis of data from the project of history-based artificial intelligent computerized dementia diagnostic system. We compared the frequencies of FOS among non-demented (ND) participants, patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), and DLB. Further, we explored the association factors of FOS in all the participants.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We enrolled 666 individuals with the following disease distribution: 190, ND; 230, AD; 183, VaD; and 63, DLB. Compared to individuals with ND (2.1%), patients with AD (6.1%), or VaD (18.0%), DLB (54.0%) showed a significantly higher frequency of positive FOS (all p &amp;lt; 0.001). The association factors of FOS were older age, more severe dementia, more severe motor dysfunction, fluctuating cognition, visual hallucinations, parkinsonism, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, attention, mental manipulation, and language.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our study showed that the informant-based FOSSQ may be a practical screening tool for discriminating DLB from individuals with ND or other forms of dementia. The FOSSQ can be applied in clinical practice as well as on the artificial intelligent platform.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Allison Jevitt, Deeptiman Chatterjee, Gengqiang Xie, Xian-Feng Wang, Taylor Otwell, Yi-Chun Huang, Wu-Min Deng&lt;/p&gt;

Oogenesis is a complex developmental process that involves spatiotemporally regulated coordination between the germline and supporting, somatic cell populations. This process has been modeled extensively using the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; ovary. Although different ovarian cell types have been identified through traditional means, the large-scale expression profiles underlying each cell type remain unknown. Using single-cell RNA sequencing technology, we have built a transcriptomic data set for the adult &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; ovary and connected tissues. Using this data set, we identified the transcriptional trajectory of the entire follicle-cell population over the course of their development from stem cells to the oogenesis-to-ovulation transition. We further identify expression patterns during essential developmental events that take place in somatic and germline cell types such as differentiation, cell-cycle switching, migration, symmetry breaking, nurse-cell engulfment, egg-shell formation, and corpus luteum signaling. Extensive experimental validation of unique expression patterns in both ovarian and nearby, nonovarian cells also led to the identification of many new cell type–and stage-specific markers. The inclusion of several nearby tissue types in this data set also led to our identification of functional convergence in expression between distantly related cell types such as the immune-related genes that were similarly expressed in immune cells (hemocytes) and ovarian somatic cells (stretched cells) during their brief phagocytic role in nurse-cell engulfment. Taken together, these findings provide new insight into the temporal regulation of genes in a cell-type specific manner during oogenesis and begin to reveal the relatedness in expression between cell and tissues types.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/_4UTqoDvHbw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Operant conditioning (OC) is a classical paradigm and a standard technique used in experimental psychology in which animals learn to perform an action to achieve a reward. By using this paradigm, it is possible to extract learning curves and measure accurately reaction times (RTs). Both these measurements are proxy of cognitive capabilities and can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions in mouse models of disease. Here, we describe a fully 3D printable device that is able to perform OC on freely moving mice, while performing real-time tracking of the animal position. We successfully trained six mice, showing stereotyped learning curves that are highly reproducible across mice and reaching &amp;gt;70% of accuracy after 2 d of conditioning. Different products for OC are commercially available, though most of them do not provide customizable features and are relatively expensive. This data demonstrate that this system is a valuable alternative to available state-of-the-art commercial devices, representing a good balance between performance, cost, and versatility in its use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Behavioral studies have shown that the human motor system recycles motor parameters of previous actions, such as movement amplitude, when programming new actions. Shifting motor plans toward a new action forms a particularly severe problem for patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD), a disorder that, in its early stage, is dominated by basal ganglia dysfunction. Here, we test whether this action selection deficit in Parkinson’s patients arises from an impaired ability to recycle motor parameters shared across subsequent actions. Parkinson’s patients off dopaminergic medication (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 16) and matched healthy controls (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 16) performed a task that involved moving a handheld dowel over an obstacle in the context of a sequence of aiming movements. Consistent with previous research, healthy participants continued making unnecessarily large hand movements after clearing the obstacle (defined as &quot;hand path priming effect&quot;), even after switching movements between hands. In contrast, Parkinson’s patients showed a reduced hand path priming effect, i.e., they performed biomechanically more efficient movements than controls, but only when switching movements between hands. This effect correlated with disease severity, such that patients with more severe motor symptoms had a smaller hand path priming effect. We propose that the basal ganglia mediate recycling of movement parameters across subsequent actions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The pond snail &lt;i&gt;Lymnaea stagnalis&lt;/i&gt; learns conditioned taste aversion (CTA) and consolidates it into long-term memory (LTM). One-day food-deprived snails (day 1 snails) show the best CTA learning and memory, whereas more severely food-deprived snails (5 d) do not express good memory. However, previous studies showed that CTA-LTM was indeed formed in 5-d food-deprived snails (day 5 snails), but its recall was prevented by the effects of food deprivation. CTA-LTM recall in day 5 snails was expressed following 7 d of feeding and then 1 d of food deprivation (day 13 snails). In the present study, we thus hypothesized that memory recall occurs because day 13 snails are in an optimal internal state. One day of food deprivation before the memory test in day 13 snails increased the mRNA level of molluscan insulin-related peptide (MIP) in the CNS. Thus, we further hypothesized that an injection of insulin into day 5 snails following seven additional days with access to food (day 12 snails) activates CTA neurons and mimics the food deprivation state before the memory test in day 13 snails. Day 12 snails injected with insulin could recall the memory. In addition, the simultaneous injection of an anti-insulin receptor antibody and insulin into day 12 snails did not allow memory recall. Insulin injection also decreased the hemolymph glucose concentration. Together, the results suggest that an optimal internal state (i.e., a spike in insulin release and specific glucose levels) are necessary for LTM recall following CTA training in snails.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this study is to investigate how the activation location of persistent inward current (PIC) over motoneuron dendrites is linked to motor output in the closed-loop motor unit. Here, a physiologically realistic model of a motor unit including afferent inputs from muscle spindles was comprehensively analyzed under intracellular stimulation at the soma and synaptic inputs over the dendrites during isometric contractions over a full physiological range of muscle lengths. The motor output of the motor unit model was operationally assessed by evaluating the rate of force development, the degree of force potentiation and the capability of self-sustaining force production. Simulations of the model motor unit demonstrated a tendency for a faster rate of force development, a greater degree of force potentiation, and greater capacity for self-sustaining force production under both somatic and dendritic stimulation of the motoneuron as the PIC channels were positioned farther from the soma along the path of motoneuron dendrites. Interestingly, these effects of PIC activation location on force generation significantly differed among different states of muscle length. The rate of force development and the degree of force potentiation were systematically modulated by the variation of PIC channel location for shorter-than-optimal muscles but not for optimal and longer-than-optimal muscles. Similarly, the warm-up behavior of the motor unit depended on the interplay between PIC channel location and muscle length variation. These results suggest that the location of PIC activation over motoneuron dendrites may be distinctively reflected in the motor performance during shortening muscle contractions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: Reduced TUBA1A Tubulin Causes Defects in Trafficking and Impaired Adult Motor Behavior</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Newly born neurons express high levels of TUBA1A α-tubulin to assemble microtubules for neurite extension and to provide tracks for intracellular transport. In the adult brain, &lt;i&gt;Tuba1a&lt;/i&gt; expression decreases dramatically. A mouse that harbors a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding TUBA1A (&lt;i&gt;Tuba1a&lt;sup&gt;ND/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) allows us to ask whether TUBA1A is important for the function of mature neurons. α-Tubulin levels are about half of wild type in juvenile &lt;i&gt;Tuba1a&lt;sup&gt;ND/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; brains, but are close to normal in older animals. In postnatal day (P)0 cultured neurons, reduced TUBA1A allows for assembly of less microtubules in axons resulting in more pausing during organelle trafficking. While &lt;i&gt;Tuba1a&lt;sup&gt;ND/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mouse behavior is indistinguishable from wild-type siblings at weaning, &lt;i&gt;Tuba1a&lt;sup&gt;ND/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice develop adult-onset ataxia. Neurons important for motor function in &lt;i&gt;Tuba1a&lt;sup&gt;ND/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; remain indistinguishable from wild-type with respect to morphology and number and display no evidence of axon degeneration. &lt;i&gt;Tuba1a&lt;sup&gt;ND/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; neuromuscular junction (NMJ) synapses are the same size as wild-type before the onset of ataxia, but are reduced in size in older animals. Together, these data indicate that the TUBA1A-rich microtubule tracks that are assembled during development are essential for mature neuron function and maintenance of synapses over time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
