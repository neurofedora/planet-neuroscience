	<description>&lt;p&gt;We first review traditional approaches to memory storage and formation,
drawing on the literature of quantitative neuroscience as well as statistical
physics. These have generally focused on the fast dynamics of neurons; however,
there is now an increasing emphasis on the slow dynamics of synapses, whose
weight changes are held to be responsible for memory storage. An important
first step in this direction was taken in the context of Fusi's cascade model,
where complex synaptic architectures were invoked, in particular, to store
long-term memories. No explicit synaptic dynamics were, however, invoked in
that work. These were recently incorporated theoretically using the techniques
used in agent-based modelling, and subsequently, models of competing and
cooperating synapses were formulated. It was found that the key to the storage
of long-term memories lay in the competitive dynamics of synapses. In this
review, we focus on models of synaptic competition and cooperation, and look at
the outstanding challenges that remain.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Our eyes sample a disproportionately large amount of information at the
centre of gaze with increasingly sparse sampling into the periphery. This
sampling scheme is widely believed to be a wiring constraint whereby high
resolution at the centre is achieved by sacrificing spatial acuity in the
periphery. Here we propose that this sampling scheme may be optimal for object
recognition because the relevant spatial content is dense near an object and
sparse in the surrounding vicinity. We tested this hypothesis by training deep
convolutional neural networks on full-resolution and foveated images. Our main
finding is that networks trained on images with foveated sampling show better
object classification compared to networks trained on full resolution images.
Importantly, blurring images according to the human blur function yielded the
best performance compared to images with shallower or steeper blurring. Taken
together our results suggest that, peripheral blurring in our eyes may have
evolved for optimal object recognition, rather than merely to satisfy wiring
constraints.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper outlines the implications of neural-level accounts of insight, and
models of the conceptual interactions that underlie creativity, for a theory of
cultural evolution. Since elements of human culture exhibit cumulative,
adaptive, open-ended change, it seems reasonable to view culture as an
evolutionary process, one fueled by creativity. Associative memory models of
creativity and mathematical models of how concepts combine and transform
through interaction with a context, support a view of creativity that is
incompatible with a Darwinian (selectionist) framework for cultural evolution,
but compatible with a non-Darwinian (Self-Other Reorganization) framework. A
theory of cultural evolution in which creativity is centre stage could provide
the kind of integrative framework for the behavioral sciences that Darwin
provided for the life sciences.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal network dynamics depends on network structure. It is often assumed
that neurons are connected at random when their actual connectivity structure
is unknown. Such models are then often approximated by replacing the random
network by an all-to-all network, where every neuron is connected to all other
neurons. This mean-field approximation is a common approach in statistical
physics. In this paper we show that such approximation can be invalid. We solve
analytically a neuronal network model with binary-state neurons in both random
and all-to-all networks. We find strikingly different phase diagrams
corresponding to each network structure. Neuronal network dynamics is not only
different within certain parameter ranges, but it also undergoes different
bifurcations. Our results therefore suggest cautiousness when using mean-field
models based on all-to-all network topologies to represent random networks.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Estimation of mutual information between random variables has become crucial
in a range of fields, from physics to neuroscience to finance. Estimating
information accurately over a wide range of conditions relies on the
development of flexible methods to describe statistical dependencies among
variables, without imposing potentially invalid assumptions on the data. Such
methods are needed in cases that lack prior knowledge of their statistical
properties and that have limited sample numbers. Here we propose a powerful and
generally applicable information estimator based on non-parametric copulas.
This estimator, called the non-parametric copula-based estimator (NPC), is
tailored to take into account detailed stochastic relationships in the data
independently of the data's marginal distributions. The NPC estimator can be
used both for continuous and discrete numerical variables and thus provides a
single framework for the mutual information estimation of both continuous and
discrete data. By extensive validation on artificial samples drawn from various
statistical distributions, we found that the NPC estimator compares well
against commonly used alternatives. Unlike methods not based on copulas, it
allows an estimation of information that is robust to changes of the details of
the marginal distributions. Unlike parametric copula methods, it remains
accurate regardless of the precise form of the interactions between the
variables. In addition, the NPC estimator had accurate information estimates
even at low sample numbers, in comparison to alternative estimators. The NPC
estimator therefore provides a good balance between general applicability to
arbitrarily shaped statistical dependencies in the data and shows accurate and
robust performance when working with small sample sizes.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A marginalized two-part Beta regression model for microbiome compositional data</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006329</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Haitao Chai, Hongmei Jiang, Lu Lin, Lei Liu&lt;/p&gt;

In microbiome studies, an important goal is to detect differential abundance of microbes across clinical conditions and treatment options. However, the microbiome compositional data (quantified by relative abundance) are highly skewed, bounded in [0, 1), and often have many zeros. A two-part model is commonly used to separate zeros and positive values explicitly by two submodels: a logistic model for the probability of a specie being present in Part I, and a Beta regression model for the relative abundance conditional on the presence of the specie in Part II. However, the regression coefficients in Part II cannot provide a marginal (unconditional) interpretation of covariate effects on the microbial abundance, which is of great interest in many applications. In this paper, we propose a marginalized two-part Beta regression model which captures the zero-inflation and skewness of microbiome data and also allows investigators to examine covariate effects on the marginal (unconditional) mean. We demonstrate its practical performance using simulation studies and apply the model to a real metagenomic dataset on mouse skin microbiota. We find that under the proposed marginalized model, without loss in power, the likelihood ratio test performs better in controlling the type I error than those under conventional methods.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PdhaI1pPOFI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Recent work suggests that the brain represents probability distributions and performs Bayesian integration during sensorimotor learning. However, our understanding of the neural representation of this learning remains limited. To begin to address this, we performed two experiments. In the first experiment, we replicated the key behavioral findings of Körding and Wolpert (2004), demonstrating that humans can perform in a Bayes-optimal manner by combining information about their own sensory uncertainty and a statistical distribution of lateral shifts encountered in a visuomotor adaptation task. In the second experiment, we extended these findings by testing whether visuomotor learning occurring during the same task generalizes from one limb to the other, and relatedly, whether this learning is represented in an extrinsic or intrinsic reference frame. We found that the learned mean of the distribution of visuomotor shifts generalizes to the opposite limb only when the perturbation is congruent in extrinsic coordinates, indicating that the underlying representation of learning acquired during training is available to the untrained limb and is coded in an extrinsic reference frame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Generalization provides unique insights into the motor learning process. However, this type of learning has typically been investigated using fixed or deterministic perturbations and noise-free feedback information, which are not naturalistic. Here we replicate important findings indicating that information is integrated in a Bayes-optimal manner during sensorimotor learning under uncertainty. We then extend these findings by showing that this learning generalises to the opposite limb. These results have implications for our understanding of the neural mechanisms of motor learning as well as practical application to the contexts of sport training and motor rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Both the function of hippocampal neurons and hippocampus-dependent behaviors are dependent on changes in gene expression, but the specific mechanisms that regulate gene expression in hippocampus are not yet fully understood. The stable, activity-dependent transcription factor FosB plays a role in various forms of hippocampal-dependent learning and in structural plasticity of synapses onto CA1 neurons. The authors examined the consequences of viral-mediated overexpression or inhibition of FosB on the function of adult mouse hippocampal CA1 neurons using &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; slice whole-cell physiology. We found that overexpression of FosB decreased excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons, while inhibition increased excitability. Interestingly, these manipulations did not affect resting membrane potential or spike frequency adaptation, but FosB overexpression reduced hyperpolarization-activated current. Both FosB overexpression and inhibition decreased spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents, while only FosB inhibition affected AMPA/NMDA ratio which was mediated by decreased NMDA receptor current, suggesting complex effects on synaptic inputs to CA1 that may be driven by homeostatic cell-autonomous or network-driven adaptations to the changes in CA1 cell excitability. Because FosB is induced in hippocampus by drugs of abuse, stress, or antidepressant treatment, these results suggest that FosB-driven changes in hippocampal cell excitability may be critical for learning and, in maladaptive states, are key drivers of aberrant hippocampal function in diseases such as addiction and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Memory consolidation is a key component of adaptive learned behavior which can be disrupted in psychiatric conditions, and regulated gene expression in hippocampus is critical for learning and memory. FosB is a highly stable, activity-dependent transcription factor that regulates hippocampus-dependent memory, yet its specific role in hippocampal neuronal function is unclear. The authors use whole-cell slice electrophysiology to uncover a novel role for FosB in regulating neuronal excitability in the CA1 region of hippocampus. These findings suggest that FosB-driven changes in gene expression drive intrinsic excitability of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, potentially regulating learning, antidepressant responses, and psychiatric diseases such as drug addiction and depression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;A developing brain shows intense re-organization and heightened neuronal plasticity allowing for environmental modulation of its development. During early life, maternal care is a key factor of this environment and defects in this care can derail adaptive brain development and may result in susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which those maternal interactions immediately impact the offspring’s brain activity to initiate the pathway to pathology are not well understood. We do know that multiple neurotransmitter systems are involved, including the serotonergic system, a key neuromodulator involved in brain development and emotional regulation. We tested the importance of the serotonergic system and pups’ immediate neural response to maternal presence using wireless electrophysiological recordings, a novel approach allowing us to record neural activity during pups’ interactions with their mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that maternal contact modulates the P10-P12 rat pups’ anterior cingulate cortex activity by notably increasing local field potential power in low-frequency bands. We demonstrated, by blocking serotonergic receptors, that this increase is mediated through 5-HT2 receptors. Finally, we showed in isolated pups that enhancing serotonergic transmission, using a selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitor, is sufficient to enhance local field potential power in low frequency bands in a pattern similar to that observed when the mother is in the nest. Our results highlight a significant contribution of the serotonergic system in mediating changes of cortical activity in pups related to maternal presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Maternal care is a major environmental factor influencing brain development and deficits in this care can result in maladaptive behaviors in the offspring. While maternal interaction is crucial, little is known about the underlying mechanisms by which it modulates infant/pup brain activity. In this study, using wireless electrophysiological recordings, we show that the mother’s contact regulates the activity of key prefrontal regions of 10-12 D-old rat pups. Regarding mechanisms, we found that the serotonergic system contributes to this modulation, notably through 5HT2 receptors. These results suggest maternal care affects serotonergic neural activity during early life and provide key insights into how maternal care affects the adaptive/maladaptive development of brain circuits implicated in adult pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: From intuitive altruism to rational deliberations - a neuroscience view on the learning process in game theory experiments. (arXiv:1807.07866v1 [physics.soc-ph])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07866</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07866</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;What is intuitive: pro-social or anti-social behaviour? To answer this
fundamental question, recent studies analyse decision times in game theory
experiments under the assumption that intuitive decisions are fast and that
deliberation is slow. Lacking any knowledge of the underlying dynamics, such
simplistic approach might however lead to erroneous interpretations. Here we
model the cognitive basis of strategic cooperative decision making using the
Drift Diffusion Model to discern between deliberation and intuition and
describe the evolution of the decision making in iterated Prisoner's Dilemma
experiments. We find that rational deliberation quickly becomes dominant over
an initial intuitive bias towards cooperation, which is fostered by positive
interactions as much as frustrated by a negative one. However, this initial
pro-social tendency is resilient, as after a pause it resets to the same
initial value. These results illustrate the new insight that can be achieved
thanks to a quantitative modelling of human behavior.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Influence of Neighborhood SES on Functional Brain Network Development. (arXiv:1807.07687v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07687</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07687</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Higher socioeconomic status (SES) in childhood is associated with increased
cognitive abilities, higher academic achievement, and decreased incidence of
mental illness later in development. Accumulating evidence suggests that these
effects may be due to changes in brain development induced by environmental
factors. While prior work has mapped the associations between neighborhood SES
and brain structure, little is known about the relationship between SES and
intrinsic neural dynamics. Here, we capitalize upon a large community-based
sample (Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, ages 8-22 years, n=1012) to
examine developmental changes in functional brain network topology as estimated
from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data. We
quantitatively characterize this topology using a local measure of network
segregation known as the clustering coefficient, and find that it accounts for
a greater degree of SES-associated variance than meso-scale segregation
captured by modularity. While whole-brain clustering increased with age,
high-SES youth displayed faster increases in clustering than low-SES youth, and
this effect was most pronounced for regions in the limbic, somatomotor, and
ventral attention systems. The effect of SES on developmental increases in
clustering was strongest for connections of intermediate physical length,
consistent with faster decreases in local connectivity in these regions in
low-SES youth, and tracked changes in BOLD signal complexity in the form of
regional homogeneity. Our findings suggest that neighborhood SES may
fundamentally alter intrinsic patterns of inter-regional interactions in the
human brain in a manner that is consistent with greater segregation of
information processing in late childhood and adolescence.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Modelling of consciousness and interpretation of quantum mechanics. (arXiv:1807.07669v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07669</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07669</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;I start from the fundamental principles of non-relativistic quantum
mechanics, without probability, and interpret them using the notion of
coexistence: a quantum state can be read, not uniquely, as a coexistence of
other quantum states, which are pairwise orthogonal. In this formalism, I prove
that a conscious observer is necessarily a physical object that can memorize
local events by setting one of its parts in an exactly specified constant
quantum state (hypotheses H1, H2 and H3). Then I define the probability of a
future event as the proportion of initial observers, all identical, who will
actually experience that event. It then becomes possible to establish the usual
results of quantum mechanics. Furthermore, I detail the link between
probabilities and relative frequencies. Additionally, I study the biological
feasibility of this modelling of observer's mind.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of this paper completes the neuronal description of the mind
functions, based on current neuroscientific knowledge. It provides a model that
is compatible with the assumptions of the first part and consistent with our
daily conscious experience. In particular, it develops a model of
self-consciousness based on an explicit use of the random component of neuron
behaviour; according to the first part, that random is in fact the coexistence
of a multiplicity of possibilities. So, when the mind measures the random part
of certain neurons in the brain, he goes himself within each of these
possibilities. The mind has a decision-making component that is active in this
situation, appearing then as the cause of the choice of this possibility among
all the others. This models the self-consciousness which then ensures the unity
of our conscious experience by equating this experience with ``what the ego is
conscious about''. The conclusion details the points that remain to be
developed.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Critique of the Fox-Lu model for Hodgkin-Huxley fluctuations in neuron ion channels. (arXiv:1807.07632v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07632</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07632</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Using a well known result that every FP equation has an antecedent Langevin
equation LE Fox and Lu proposed such a description for ion channels in 1994.
Their contraction followed the works of van Kampen and of T. Kurtz. The
contraction produces a diffusion term with a state dependent diffusion matrix,
D, that arises from the coupling matrix, S, in the LE. This S connected the
noise terms to the channel subunit variables in the LE. Fox and Lu and many
others later on observed that SS = D. Since D was determined by the contraction
of the MC equations into the FP equation, this left the problem of determining
the square root matrix, S, for every time step of the simulation. Since this is
time consuming, Fox and Lu introduced simplified models not requiring the
square root of a matrix. Subsequently, numerous studies were published that
showed the several shortcomings of these simplified models. In 2011, Goldwyn et
al. [6] rediscovered the overlooked original matrix dependent approach in the
Fox-Lu 1994 paper. They showed that it produced results in very good agreement
with the MC results. In 1991, Fox and Keizer [7] wrote a paper on an unrelated
topic that utilized the work of van Kampen and of Kurtz. In that work the
connection between D and S is SST = D. ST is the adjoint (transpose) of S. D
remains a positive definite symmetric matrix but S need not be. Fox has
reproduced the 2012 results of Orio and Soudry for potassium channels and has
also found in closed form the solution for the more complicated sodium
channels. The square root problem generally must be done numerically, but the
Cholesky is always doable in closed form. Thereby the S matrix for sodium is
given explicitly for the first time in this paper

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We present a complete wireless neural stimulation system consisting of a 2.2
mm3 wireless, batteryless, leadless implantable stimulator implant (the
&quot;mote&quot;), an ultrasonic wireless link for power and bi-directional
communication, and a hand-held external transceiver. The mote consists of a
stimulator integrated circuit (IC), which performs high-efficiency ultrasonic
power harvesting, decodes stimulation parameter downlink data, and generates
current-controlled stimulation pulses. Stimulation parameters are time-encoded
on the fly through the wireless link rather than being programmed and stored on
the mote, enabling complex stimulation protocols with precise timing and
closed-loop capability and without the need for on-chip memory and power
consumption. Uplink data indicates whether or not the mote is currently
stimulating and is encoded by the mote via backscatter modulation and
demodulated at the external receiver. We characterize system power, stimulation
performance, and acoustic link robustness under misalignment. We implant the
mote on the sciatic nerve of anesthetized rats and investigate the full range
of physiological responses achievable with the wireless system.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Psychiatric symptoms of schizophrenia suggest alteration of cerebral neurons.
However, the physical basis of the schizophrenia symptoms has not been
delineated at the cellular level. Here we report nanometer-scale
three-dimensional analysis of brain tissues of schizophrenia and control cases.
Structures of cerebral tissues of the anterior cingulate cortex were visualized
with synchrotron radiation nanotomography. Tissue constituents observed in the
three-dimensional images were traced to build Cartesian coordinate models of
neurons. The obtained Cartesian coordinates were used for calculating curvature
and torsion of neurites. The geometric analyses indicated that the curvature of
neurites is significantly different between schizophrenia and control cases.
The mean curvature of distal neurites of the schizophrenia cases was
approximately 1.5 times higher than that of the controls. A schizophrenia case
carrying a frame shift mutation in the GLO1 gene showed the highest neurite
curvature, suggesting that oxidative stress due to the GLO1 mutation caused the
structural alteration of the neurites. The differences in the neurite curvature
result in differences in the spatial trajectory and hence alter neuronal
circuits. We suggest that the structural alteration of neurons in the
schizophrenia cases should reflect psychiatric symptoms of schizophrenia.

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Gating mechanisms during actin filament elongation by formins</title>

	<description>Formins play an important role in the polymerization of unbranched actin filaments, and particular formins slow elongation by 5–95%. We studied the interactions between actin and the FH2 domains of formins Cdc12, Bni1 and mDia1 to understand the factors underlying their different rates of polymerization. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations revealed two factors that influence actin filament elongation and correlate with the rates of elongation. First, FH2 domains can sterically block the addition of new actin subunits. Second, FH2 domains flatten the helical twist of the terminal actin subunits, making the end less favorable for subunit addition. Coarse-grained simulations over longer time scales support these conclusions. The simulations show that filaments spend time in states that either allow or block elongation. The rate of elongation is a time-average of the degree to which the formin compromises subunit addition rather than the formin-actin complex literally being in ‘open’ or ‘closed’ states.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Dkk2 promotes neural crest specification by activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling in a GSK3β independent manner</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34404</link>
	<description>Neural crest progenitors are specified through the modulation of several signaling pathways, among which the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by Wnt8 is especially critical. Glycoproteins of the Dickkopf (Dkk) family are important modulators of Wnt signaling acting primarily as Wnt antagonists. Here we report that Dkk2 is required for neural crest specification functioning as a positive regulator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Dkk2 depletion in &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; embryos causes a loss of neural crest progenitors, a phenotype that is rescued by expression of Lrp6 or β-catenin. Dkk2 overexpression expands the neural crest territory in a pattern reminiscent of Wnt8, Lrp6 and β-catenin gain-of-function phenotypes. Mechanistically, we show that Dkk2 mediates its neural crest-inducing activity through Lrp6 and β-catenin, however unlike Wnt8, in a GSK3β independent manner. These findings suggest that Wnt8 and Dkk2 converge on β-catenin using distinct transduction pathways both independently required to activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling and induce neural crest cells.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Improving Whole-Brain Neural Decoding of fMRI with Domain Adaptation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/375030v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>In neural decoding, there has been a growing interest in machine learning on whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, the massive size discrepancy between the feature space and the training set poses serious challenges. Simply increasing the number of training examples is infeasible and costly. In this paper, we proposed a domain adaptation framework for whole-brain fMRI (DawfMRI) to improve whole-brain neural decoding on target data leveraging pre-existing source data. DawfMRI consists of three steps: 1) feature extraction from whole-brain fMRI, 2) source and target feature adaptation, and 3) source and target classifier adaptation. We evaluated its eight possible variations, including two non-adaptation and six adaptation algorithms, using a collection of seven task-based fMRI datasets (129 unique subjects and 11 cognitive tasks in total) from the OpenNeuro project. The results demonstrated that appropriate source domain can help improve neural decoding accuracy for challenging classification tasks. The best-case improvement is 8.94% (from 78.64% to 87.58%). Moreover, we discovered a plausible relationship between psychological similarity and adaptation effectiveness. Finally, visualizing and interpreting voxel weights showed that the adaptation can provide additional insights into neural decoding.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Individual differences in cortical processing speed predict cognitive abilities: a model-based cognitive neuroscience account</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/374827v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/374827v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Previous research has shown that individuals with greater cognitive abilities display a greater speed of higher-order cognitive processing. These results suggest that speeded neural information-processing may facilitate evidence accumulation during decision making and memory updating and thus yield advantages in general cognitive abilities. We used a hierarchical Bayesian cognitive modeling approach to test the hypothesis that individual differences in the velocity of evidence accumulation mediate the relationship between neural processing speed and cognitive abilities. We found that a higher neural speed predicted both the velocity of evidence accumulation across behavioral tasks as well as cognitive ability test scores. However, only a small part of the association between neural processing speed and cognitive abilities was mediated by individual differences in the velocity of evidence accumulation. The model demonstrated impressive forecasting abilities by predicting 36% of individual variation in cognitive ability test scores in an entirely new sample solely based on their electrophysiological and behavioral data. Our results suggest that individual differences in neural processing speed might affect a plethora of higher-order cognitive processes, that only in concert explain the large association between neural processing speed and cognitive abilities, instead of the effect being entirely explained by differences in evidence accumulation speeds.</description>

	<description>Analysis of entire transparent rodent bodies could provide holistic information on biological systems in health and disease. However, it has been challenging to reliably image and quantify signal from endogenously expressed fluorescent proteins in large cleared mouse bodies due to the low signal contrast. Here, we devised a pressure driven, nanobody based whole-body immunolabeling technology to enhance the signal of fluorescent proteins by up to two orders of magnitude. This allowed us to image subcellular details in transparent mouse bodies through bones and highly autofluorescent tissues, and perform quantifications. We visualized for the first-time whole-body neuronal connectivity of an entire adult mouse and discovered that brain trauma induces degeneration of peripheral axons. We also imaged meningeal lymphatic vessels and immune cells through the intact skull and vertebra in naive animals and trauma models. Thus, our new approach can provide an unbiased holistic view of biological events affecting the nervous system and the rest of the body.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Incomplete information about the partner affects the development of collaborative strategies in joint action</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/374769v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Physical interaction with a partner plays an essential role in our life experience and is the basis of many daily activities. When two physically coupled humans have different and partly conflicting goals, they face the challenge of negotiating some type of collaboration. This requires that both subjects understand their opponent's state and current actions. But, how would the collaboration be affected if information about their opponent were unreliable or incomplete? Here we show that incomplete information about the partner affects not only the speed at which a collaborative strategy is achieved (less information, slower learning), but also the modality of the collaboration. In particular, incomplete or unreliable information leads to an interaction strategy characterized by alternating leader-follower roles. In contrast, more reliable information leads to a more synchronous behavior, in which no specific roles can be identified. Simulations based on a combination of game theory and Bayesian estimation suggested that synchronous behaviors denote optimal interaction (Nash equilibrium). Roles emerge as sub-optimal forms of interaction, which minimize the need to know about the partner. These findings suggest that physical interaction strategies are shaped by the trade-off of between the task requirements and the uncertainty of the information available about the opponent.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Sulci of the canine brain: a review of terminology</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/374744v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/374744v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Over the last decades there have been several publications of anatomical and neurological textbooks, which include descriptions about the dogs' brain. However, the terminology used is inconsistent, partly due to individual differences in neocortical gyration and partly due to the common practice of adapting terms from human and murine anatomy. In order to identify such incongruences, in Study 1, we reviewed the existing literature and identified the common terms used as well as any discrepancies between textbooks. Three main forms of inconsistencies were found; a) the use of terms that are not included in the Nomina Anatomica Veterinaria (NAV), b) the inclusion of structures that are listed as not canine-specific, and c) the use of similar names to identify potentially different anatomical structures. To address these issues, in Study 2 we investigated the consistency in appearance of the cerebral sulci, performing a macroscopical examination on 79 canine brains obtained through the Canine Brain and Tissue Bank (CBTB). We then evaluated whether sulci on the frontal regions of brachycephalic breeds differed from those of mesocephalic and dolichocephalic groups, as frontal and olfactory regions are subjected to the most extreme modifications following the shortening of the skull. The statistical analysis showed no difference across the skull length types regarding the occurrence of these sulci, although furrows on the lateral side of the brain proved to be more stable than those on the medial side. In Study 3, we summarized the findings in accordance with the NAV to produce a definitive index of the terms that we recommend be used for each identified sulci. Such an index is beneficial for educational, clinical use, and research (e.g. neuroscience) purposes. The dog is emerging as a pioneering and exceptional model in comparative neuroscience, and therefore the implications for canine neuroscience research should not be underestimated.</description>

	<description>Schizophrenia is a highly heritable disorder for which anatomical brain alterations have been repeatedly reported in clinical samples. Unaffected at-risk groups have also been studied in an attempt to identify brain changes that do not reflect reverse causation or treatment effects. However, no robust associations have been observed between neuroanatomical phenotypes and known genetic risk factors for SZ. We tested subcortical brain volume differences between 49 unaffected participants carrying at least one of the 12 copy number variants associated with schizophrenia in UK Biobank with 9,291 individuals who did not carry any of the 93 copy number variants reported to be pathogenic. Our results show that the carriers have reduced volume in some of the subcortical structures previously shown to be reduced in schizophrenia. Moreover, these associations partially accounted for the association between pathogenic CNVs and poor performance of tests of fluid intelligence, which is one of the features of schizophrenia.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Perineuronal nets set the strength of thalamic recruitment of interneurons in the adult visual cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/374587v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/374587v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>In the neocortex, the closure of critical periods (CPs) of plasticity is paralleled by the accumulation of perineuronal nets (PNNs) around parvalbumin (PV)-positive inhibitory interneurons. Accordingly, PNN degradation in adult mammals re-opens cortical plasticity. However, how PNNs tune cortical function and plasticity is unknown. We found that PNNs modulated the gain of visual responses in the adult mouse visual cortex in vivo. Removal of PNNs in adult V1 strongly increased thalamic neurotransmission selectively on layer 4 PV cells. This produced a differential gating of feed-forward inhibition on principal neurons and other PV cells, with no alterations of unitary inhibitory synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability. These effects depended on visual input, as they were strongly attenuated by monocular deprivation in PNN-depleted adult mice. Thus, PNNs control visual processing and plasticity by selectively setting the strength of thalamic recruitment of PV cells. We conclude that PNN accumulation during circuit maturation likely prevents excessive thalamic excitation of PV cells at the expense of cortical plasticity.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Dynamic functional connectivity changes in dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer\'s disease</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/374538v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>We studied the dynamic functional connectivity profile of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the relationship between dynamic connectivity and the temporally transient symptoms of cognitive fluctuations and visual hallucinations in DLB. Resting state fMRI data from 31 DLB, 29 AD, and 31 healthy control participants were analysed using dual regression to determine between-network functional connectivity. We used a sliding window approach followed by k-means clustering and dynamic network analyses to study dynamic functional connectivity changes associated with AD and DLB. Network measures that showed significant group differences were tested for correlations with clinical symptom severity. AD and DLB patients spent more time than controls in sparse connectivity configurations with absence of strong positive and negative connections and a relative isolation of motor networks from other networks. Additionally, DLB patients spent less time in a more strongly connected state and the variability of global brain network efficiency was reduced in DLB compared to controls. However, there were no significant correlations between dynamic connectivity measures and clinical scores. The loss of global efficiency variability in DLB might indicate the presence of an abnormally rigid brain network and the lack of economical dynamics, factors which could contribute to an inability to respond appropriately to situational demands. However, the absence of significant clinical correlations indicates that the severity of transient cognitive symptoms such as cognitive fluctuations and visual hallucinations might not be directly related to these dynamic connectivity changes observed during a short resting state scan.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A Sensory Processing Hierarchy for Thermal Touch: Thermal Adaptation Occurs Prior to Thermal-Tactile Integration</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/374447v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/374447v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The brain consistently faces a challenge of whether and how to combine the available information sources to estimate the properties of an object explored by hand. Thermal referral (TR) is a phenomenon that demonstrates how thermal and tactile modalities coordinate to resolve inconsistencies in spatial and thermal information. When the middle three fingers of one hand are thermally stimulated, but only the outer two fingers are heated (or cooled), thermal uniformity is perceived across three fingers. This illusory experience of thermal uniformity in TR compensates for the discontinuity in the thermal sensation across the sites in contact. The neural loci of TR is unclear. While TR reflects the diffuse nature of the thermoceptive system, its similarities to perceptual filling-in and its facilitative role in object perception also suggest that TR might involve inference processes associated with object perception. To clarify the positioning of this thermo-tactile interaction in the sensory processing hierarchy, we used perceptual adaptation and Bayesian decision modelling techniques. Our results indicate that TR adaptation takes place at a peripheral stage where information about temperature inputs are still preserved for each finger, and that the thermal-tactile interaction occurs after this stage. We also show that the temperature integration across three fingers in TR is consistent with precision weighted averaging effect - Bayesian cue combination. Altogether, our findings suggest that for the sensory processing hierarchy of thermal touch, thermal adaptation occurs prior to thermo-tactile integration, which combines thermal and tactile information to give a unified percept to facilitate object recognition.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Basal Forebrain Deep Brain Stimulation Impacts the Regulation of Extracellular Vesicle Related Proteins in the Rat Brain</title>

	<description>Extracellular vesicle (EV) signaling has attracted considerable attention in recent years because EVs play a key role in long distance cellular communication functions. EV studies have begun to reveal aspects of physiological and physiopathological regulation in numerous applications, although many areas remain to date largely unexplored. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has shown remarkable therapeutic benefits of patients with neuropsychiatric disorders, but despite of the long and successful history of use, the mechanisms of action on neural ensemble activity are not yet fully understood. Here we explore how DBS of the basal forebrain impacts EV signaling in the rat brain. We employed differential centrifugations to isolate the EVs prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus and striatum. We then performed quantitative analysis of EV-associated proteins using an MS-based proteomics method. We identified a considerable number of EV-associated proteins are modulated by DBS in three brain regions, some of which have been previously linked with central nervous system disorders. Particularly, neurofilament proteins NFL and NFM were both significantly changed in EVs of PFC, hippocampus and striatum after DBS stimulation compared with controls. The SOD1 protein, associated previously with neurodegenerative diseases, was significantly increased only in PFC. Our study is the first, to our knowledge, to use EV protein analysis to examine DBS effects on brain physiological regulation. Our findings open an entirely new perspective on brain area specific DBS effects.</description>

	<description>Optical and electron microscopy have made tremendous inroads in understanding the complexity of the brain, but the former offers insufficient resolution to reveal subcellular details and the latter lacks the throughput and molecular contrast to visualize specific molecular constituents over mm-scale or larger dimensions. We combined expansion microscopy and lattice light sheet microscopy to image the nanoscale spatial relationships between proteins across the thickness of the mouse cortex or the entire Drosophila brain, including synaptic proteins at dendritic spines, myelination along axons, and presynaptic densities at dopaminergic neurons in every fly neuropil domain. The technology should enable statistically rich, large scale studies of neural development, sexual dimorphism, degree of stereotypy, and structural correlations to behavior or neural activity, all with molecular contrast.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Addressing challenges of high spatial resolution, UHF field fMRI for group analysis of higher-order cognitive tasks; an inter-sensory task directing attention between visual and somatosensory domains.</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/373977v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Functional MRI at ultra-high field (UHF, [≥]7T) provides significant increases in BOLD contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) compared with conventional field strength (3T), and has been exploited for reduced field-of-view, high spatial resolution mapping of primary sensory areas. Applying these high spatial resolution methods to investigate whole brain functional responses to higher-order cognitive tasks leads to a number of challenges, in particular how to perform robust group-level statistical analyses. This study addresses these challenges using an inter-sensory cognitive task which modulates top-down attention at graded levels between the visual and somatosensory domains. At the individual level, highly focal functional activation to the task and task difficulty (modulated by attention levels) were detectable due to the high CNR at UHF. However, to assess group level effects, both anatomical and functional variability must be considered during analysis. We demonstrate the importance of surface over volume normalization and the requirement of no spatial smoothing when assessing highly focal activity. Using novel group analysis on anatomically parcellated brain regions, we show that in higher cognitive areas (parietal and dorsal-lateral-prefrontal cortex) fMRI responses to graded attention levels were modulated quadratically, whilst in visual cortex and VIP, responses were modulated linearly. These group fMRI responses were not seen clearly using conventional second-level GLM analyses, illustrating the limitations of a conventional approach when investigating such focal responses in higher cognitive regions which are more anatomically variable. The approaches demonstrated here complement other advanced analysis methods such as multi-variate pattern analysis, allowing UHF to be fully exploited in cognitive neuroscience.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Radial F-actin Organization During Early Neuronal Development</title>

	<description>The centrosome is thought to be the major neuronal microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) in early neuronal development, producing microtubules with a radial organization. In addition, albeit in vitro, recent work showed that isolated centrosomes could serve as an actin-organizing center, raising the possibility that neuronal development may in addition require a centrosome-based actin radial organization. Here we report, using super-resolution microscopy and live-cell imaging, F-actin organization around the centrosome with dynamic F-actin aster-like structures with filaments extending and retracting actively. Photoconversion experiments and molecular manipulations of F-actin stability reveal a robust flux of somatic F-actin towards the cell periphery. Finally, we show that somatic F-actin intermingles with centrosomal PCM-1 satellites. Knockdown of PCM-1 and disruption of centrosomal activity not only affect F-actin dynamics near the centrosome, but also in distal growth cones. Collectively the data show a radial F-actin organization during early neuronal development, which might be a cellular mechanism for providing peripheral regions with a fast and continuous source of actin polymers; hence sustaining initial neuronal development.</description>

	<description>We built a rig to perform patch-clamp and extracellular recordings from the same neuron in vivo. In this setup, the axes of two micromanipulators are precisely aligned and their relative position tracked in real-time, allowing us to accurately target patch-clamp recordings to neurons near an extracellular probe. We used this setup to generate a publicly-available dataset where a cortical neuron's spiking activity is recorded next to a dense CMOS Neuropixels probe. Ground-truth datasets of this kind are rare but valuable to the neuroscience community, as they power the development and improvement of spike-sorting and analysis algorithms, tethering them to empirical observations. In this article, we describe our approach and report exploratory and descriptive analysis on the resulting dataset. We study the detectability of patch-clamp spikes on the extracellular probe, within-unit reliability of spike features and spatiotemporal dynamics of the action potential waveform. We open discussion and collaboration on this dataset through an online repository, with a view to producing follow-up publications.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Two central pattern generators from the crab, Cancer borealis, respond robustly and differentially to extreme extracellular pH</title>

	<description>Most animals and their neuronal circuits must maintain function despite significant environmental fluctuations. The Jonah crab, Cancer borealis, experiences daily changes in ocean temperature and pH which are becoming more extreme as rises in atmospheric carbon dioxide continue to increase ocean temperature and contribute to ocean acidification. Here, we describe the effects of extreme changes in extracellular pH on two central pattern generating networks of the stomatogastric (STG) and cardiac (CG) ganglia of C. borealis. We examined the activity of the pyloric rhythm of the STG and the cardiac rhythm of the CG using extracellular and intracellular electrodes as bath superfused saline was shifted from pH 5.9 to pH 11.0. Given that the physiological properties of ion channels are known to be sensitive to pH within the range tested, it is surprising that the pyloric rhythm generally remained robust from pH 6.4 up to pH 9.6. Intracellular recordings of two of the pyloric neurons, the Lateral Pyloric and Pyloric Dilator, revealed depolarization of the membrane potential in extreme pH. Similarly, the cardiac rhythm retained robust activity across nearly the entire range of pH. Surprisingly, the STG was more sensitive to acid and the CG was more sensitive to base. We reveal considerable animal-to-animal variability in response to extreme perturbations, likely a consequence of the fact that similar network performance can arise from variable sets of underlying conductances. Together, these results illustrate the potential difficulty in generalizing the effects of environmental perturbation across circuits, even within the same animal.</description>

	<description>A neuronal population encodes information most efficiently when its activity is uncorrelated and high-dimensional, but correlated lower-dimensional codes provide robustness against noise. Here, we analyzed the correlation structure of natural image coding, in large visual cortical populations recorded from awake mice. Evoked population activity was high dimensional, with correlations obeying an unexpected power-law: the n-th principal component variance scaled as 1/n. This was not inherited from the 1/f spectrum of natural images, because it persisted after stimulus whitening. We proved mathematically that the variance spectrum must decay at least this fast if a population code is smooth, i.e. if small changes in input cannot dominate population activity. The theory also predicted larger power-law exponents for lower-dimensional stimulus ensembles, which we validated experimentally. These results suggest that coding smoothness represents a fundamental constraint governing correlations in neural population codes.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Components of Executive Function Predict Regional Prefrontal Volumes</title>

	<description>Objective: Designed to measure a diversity of executive functioning (EF) through classical neuropsychological tests, the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function Scale (D-KEFS) allows for the investigation of the neural architecture of EF. We examined how the D-KEFS Tower, Verbal Fluency, Design Fluency, Color-Word Interference, and Trail Making Test tasks related to regional frontal lobe volumes, quantifying how components of EF were represented in disparate neural networks. Method: Adults from the Nathan Kline Institute - Rockland Sample (NKI-RS), an open-access community study of brain development, with complete MRI (3T scanner) and D-KEFS data were selected for analysis (N = 478; ages 20-85). In a mixed-effects model predicting volume, D-KEFS task, D-KEFS score, region of interest (ROI; 13 frontal, 1 occipital control), were entered as fixed effects with intercepts for participants as random effects. Results: Unitary EF (average of D-KEFS scores) was positively associated with superior frontal, rostral middle frontal, and lateral orbitofrontal volumes; a negative association was observed with frontal pole volume (| z-score slope | range = 0.040 to 0.051). Diverse EF skills (individual D-KEFS task scores) were differentially associated with two or three ROIs, respectively, but to a stronger extent (| z-score slope | range = 0.053 to 0.103). Conclusions: The neural correlates found for the D-KEFS support the prefrontal modularity of EF at both the unitary (aspects of EF ability common to all tasks) and task (diverse EF skills) levels. The separation of task-general variance in neurocognition from task-specific variance can further evaluate neuropsychological tests as indices of brain integrity.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Spectral fingerprints or spectral tilt? Evidence for distinct oscillatory signatures of memory formation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/373514v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/373514v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Decreases in low frequency power (2-30 Hz) alongside high frequency power increases (&amp;gt;40 Hz) have been demonstrated to predict successful memory formation. Parsimoniously this change in the frequency spectrum can be explained by one factor, a change in the tilt of the power spectrum (from steep to flat) indicating engaged brain regions. A competing view is that the change in the power spectrum contains several distinct brain oscillatory fingerprints, each serving different computations. Here, we contrast these two theories in a parallel MEG-intracranial EEG study where healthy participants and epilepsy patients, respectively, studied either familiar verbal material, or unfamiliar faces. We investigated whether modulations in specific frequency bands can be dissociated in time, space and by experimental manipulation. Both, MEG and iEEG data, show that decreases in alpha/beta power specifically predicted the encoding of words, but not faces, whereas increases in gamma power and decreases in theta power predicted memory formation irrespective of material. Critically, these different oscillatory signatures of memory encoding were evident in different brain regions. Moreover, high frequency gamma power increases occurred significantly earlier compared to low frequency theta power decreases. These results speak against a 'spectral tilt' and demonstrate that brain oscillations in different frequency bands serve different functions for memory encoding.</description>

How this map forms when animals are exposed to novel environments has been the subject of a great deal of research. Numerous technical advances over the past decade greatly increased our understanding of the precise mechanisms underlying place field formation. In particular, it is now possible to connect cellular and circuit mechanisms of integration, firing, and plasticity discovered in brain slices, to processes taking place &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; as animals learn and encode novel environments. Here, we focus on recent results and describe the dendritic mechanisms most likely responsible for the formation of place fields. We also discuss key open questions that are likely to be answered in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Utilizing common resources is always a dilemma for community members. While cooperator players restrain themselves and consider the proper state of resources, defectors demand more than their supposed share for a higher payoff. To avoid the tragedy of the common state, punishing the latter group seems to be an adequate reaction. This conclusion, however, is less straightforward when we acknowledge the fact that resources are finite and even a renewable resource has limited growing capacity. To clarify the possible consequences, we consider a coevolutionary model where beside the payoff-driven competition of cooperator and defector players the level of a renewable resource depends sensitively on the fraction of cooperators and the total consumption of all players. The applied feedback-evolving game reveals that beside a delicately adjusted punishment it is also fundamental that cooperators should pay special attention to the growing capacity of renewable resources. Otherwise, even the usage of tough punishment cannot save the community from an undesired end.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2SnwQ8vO1ew&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

In mating fission yeast cells, sensing and response to extracellular pheromone concentrations occurs through an exploratory Cdc42 patch that stochastically samples the cell cortex before stabilizing towards a mating partner. Active Ras1 (Ras1-GTP), an upstream regulator of Cdc42, and Gap1, the GTPase-activating protein for Ras1, localize at the patch. We developed a reaction-diffusion model of Ras1 patch appearance and disappearance with a positive feedback by a Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF) and Gap1 inhibition. The model is based on new estimates of Ras1-GDP, Ras1-GTP and Gap1 diffusion coefficients and rates of cytoplasmic exchange studied by FRAP. The model reproduces exploratory patch behavior and lack of Ras1 patch in cells lacking Gap1. Transition to a stable patch can occur by change of Gap1 rates constants or local increase of the positive feedback rate constants. The model predicts that the patch size and number of patches depend on the strength of positive and negative feedbacks. Measurements of Ras1 patch size and number in cells overexpressing the Ras1 GEF or Gap1 are consistent with the model.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ekpK2OCnuMg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The evolutionary dynamics of metabolic protocells</title>

Protocell multilevel selection models have been proposed to study the evolutionary dynamics of vesicles encapsulating a set of replicating, competing and mutating sequences. The frequency of the different sequence types determines protocell survival through a fitness function. One of the defining features of these models is the genetic load generated when the protocell divides and its sequences are assorted between the offspring vesicles. However, these stochastic assortment effects disappear when the redundancy of each sequence type is sufficiently high. The fitness dependence of the vesicle with its sequence content is usually defined without considering a realistic account on how the lower level dynamics would specify the protocell fitness. Here, we present a protocell model with a fitness function determined by the output flux of a simple metabolic network with the aim of understanding how the evolution of both kinetic and topological features of metabolism would have been constrained by the particularities of the protocell evolutionary dynamics. In our model, the sequences inside the vesicle are both the carriers of information and Michaelis-Menten catalysts exhibiting saturation. We found that the saturation of the catalysts controlling the metabolic fluxes, achievable by modifying the kinetic or stoichiometric parameters, provides a mechanism to ameliorate the assortment load by increasing the redundancy of the catalytic sequences required to achieve the maximum flux. Regarding the network architecture, we conclude that combinations of parallel network motifs and bimolecular catalysts are a robust way to increase the complexity of the metabolism enclosed by the protocell.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/50Cx1p0DxGg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Ligand discrimination and gating in cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels from apo and partial agonist-bound cryo-EM structures</title>

	<description>Cyclic nucleotide-modulated channels have important roles in visual signal transduction and pacemaking. Binding of cyclic nucleotides (cAMP/cGMP) elicits diverse functional responses in different channels within the family despite their high sequence and structure homology. The molecular mechanisms responsible for ligand discrimination and gating are unknown due to lack of correspondence between structural information and functional states. Using single particle cryo-electron microscopy and single-channel recording, we assigned functional states to high-resolution structures of SthK, a prokaryotic cyclic nucleotide-gated channel. The structures for apo, cAMP-bound, and cGMP-bound SthK in lipid nanodiscs, correspond to no, moderate, and low single-channel activity, respectively, consistent with the observation that all structures are in resting, closed states. The similarity between apo and ligand-bound structures indicates that ligand-binding domains are strongly coupled to pore and SthK gates in an allosteric, concerted fashion. The different orientations of cAMP and cGMP in the 'resting' and 'activated' structures suggest a mechanism for ligand discrimination.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Parvovirus Minute Virus of Mice Interacts with Sites of Cellular DNA Damage to Establish and Amplify its Lytic Infection</title>

	<description>We have developed a generally adaptable, novel high-throughput Viral Chromosome Conformation Capture assay (V3C-seq) for use in &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; that allows genome-wide identification of the direct interactions of a lytic virus genome with distinct regions of the cellular chromosome. Upon infection, we found that the parvovirus Minute Virus of Mice (MVM) genome initially associated with sites of cellular DNA damage that in mock-infected cells also exhibited DNA damage as cells progressed through S-phase. As infection proceeded, new DNA damage sites were induced, and virus subsequently also associated with these. Sites of association identified biochemically were confirmed microscopically and MVM could be targeted specifically to artificially induced sites of DNA damage. Thus, MVM established replication at cellular DNA damage sites, which provide replication and expression machinery, and as cellular DNA damage accrued, virus spread additionally to newly damaged sites to amplify infection. MVM-associated sites overlap significantly with previously identified topologically-associated domains (TADs).</description>

	<description>Cytokinesis, the physical division of one cell into two, is powered by constriction of an actomyosin contractile ring. It has long been assumed that all animal cells divide by a similar molecular mechanism, but growing evidence suggests that cytokinetic regulation in individual cell types has more variation than previously realized. In the four-cell &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; embryo, each blastomere has a distinct cell fate, specified by conserved pathways. Using fast-acting temperature-sensitive mutants and acute drug treatment, we identified cell-type-specific variation in the cytokinetic requirement for a robust formin&lt;sup&gt;CYK-1&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent filamentous-actin (F-actin) cytoskeleton. In one cell (P2), this cytokinetic variation is cell-intrinsically regulated, whereas in another cell (EMS) this variation is cell-extrinsically regulated, dependent on both Src&lt;sup&gt;SRC-1&lt;/sup&gt; signaling and direct contact with its neighbor cell, P2. Thus, both cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanisms control cytokinetic variation in individual cell types and can protect against division failure when the contractile ring is weakened.</description>

	<description>Protein kinase D (PKD) is a family of serine/threonine kinases that is required for the structural integrity and function of the Golgi complex. Despite its importance in the regulation of Golgi function, the molecular mechanisms regulating PKD activity are still incompletely understood. Using the genetically encoded PKD activity reporter G-PKDrep we now uncover a Rho signaling network comprising GEF-H1, the RhoGAP DLC3, and the Rho effector PLCe that regulate the activation of PKD at trans-Golgi membranes. We further show that this molecular network coordinates the formation of TGN-derived Rab6-positive transport carriers delivering cargo for localized exocytosis at focal adhesions.</description>

	<description>We use the myotendinous junction of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; flight muscles to explore why many integrin associated proteins (IAPs) are needed and how their function is coordinated. These muscles revealed new functions for IAPs not required for viability: Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK), RSU1, tensin and vinculin. Genetic interactions demonstrated a balance between positive and negative activities, with vinculin and tensin positively regulating adhesion, while FAK inhibits elevation of integrin activity by tensin, and RSU1 keeps PINCH activity in check. The molecular composition of myofibril termini resolves into 4 distinct layers, one of which is built by a mechanotransduction cascade: vinculin facilitates mechanical opening of filamin, which works with the Arp2/3 activator WASH to build an actin-rich layer positioned between integrins and the first sarcomere. Thus, integration of IAP activity is needed to build the complex architecture of the myotendinous junction, linking the membrane anchor to the sarcomere.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Impaired spatial memory codes in a mouse model of Rett syndrome</title>

	<description>The &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mouse model recapitulates many phenotypes of patients with Rett syndrome (RTT), including learning and memory deficits. It is unknown, however, how the disease state alters memory circuit functions in vivo in RTT mice. Here we recorded from hippocampal place cells, which are thought to encode spatial memories, in freely moving RTT mice and littermate controls. We found that place cells in RTT mice are impaired in their experience-dependent increase of spatial information. This impairment is accompanied by an enhanced baseline firing synchrony of place cells within ripple oscillations during rest, which consequently occludes the increase in synchrony after a novel experience. Behaviorally, contextual memory is normal at short but not long time scale in RTT mice. Our results suggest that hypersynchrony interferes with memory consolidation and leads to impaired spatial memory codes in RTT mice, providing a possible circuit mechanism for memory deficits in Rett Syndrome.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Unidirectional monosynaptic connections from auditory areas to the primary visual cortex in the marmoset monkey</title>

	<description>Until the late 20th Century, it was believed that different sensory modalities were processed by largely independent pathways in the primate cortex, with cross-modal integration only occurring in specialized polysensory areas. This model was challenged by the finding that the peripheral representation of the primary visual cortex (V1) receives monosynaptic connections from areas of the auditory cortex in the macaque. However, auditory projections to V1 have not been reported in other primates. We investigated the existence of direct interconnections between V1 and auditory areas in the marmoset, a New World monkey. Labelled neurons in auditory cortex were observed following 4 out of 10 retrograde tracer injections involving V1. These projections to V1 originated in the caudal subdivisions of auditory cortex (primary auditory cortex, caudal belt and parabelt areas), and targeted parts of V1 that represent parafoveal and peripheral vision. Injections near the representation of the vertical meridian of the visual field labelled few or no cells in auditory cortex. We also placed 8 retrograde tracer injections involving core, belt and parabelt auditory areas, none of which revealed direct projections from V1. These results confirm the existence of a direct, nonreciprocal projection from auditory areas to V1 in a different primate species, which has evolved separately from the macaque for over 30 million years. The essential similarity of these observations between marmoset and macaque indicate that early-stage audiovisual integration is a shared characteristic of primate sensory processing.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: 5-HAYED peptide can protect AD brain by scavenging the redundant iron ions and the catalyzed radicals</title>

	<description>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by memory and cognitive decline. It is incurable currently and places a great burden on the caregivers of patients. Iron is rich in the brain of AD suffers. It catalyzes radicals which impairs neurons. Therefore, reducing the redundant brain iron is pressing to ease AD. To scavenge the excessive brain iron catalyzed radical, thus protect the brain and decrease the incidence of AD. We synthesized a soluble iron-pro 5-HAYED peptide. By injecting 5-HAYED to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the AD mouse, we observed that the 5-HAYED is able to decrease the brain iron and radical level, which behaving neurons protection, and can ameliorate the cognition status for AD mouse. Further, 5-HAYED can decreased the AD incidence and can reverse the AD associated anemia and inflammation without hurt kidney and liver.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A minimally invasive neurostimulation method for controlling abnormal synchronisation in the neuronal activity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006296</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Malbor Asllani, Paul Expert, Timoteo Carletti&lt;/p&gt;

Many collective phenomena in Nature emerge from the -partial- synchronisation of the units comprising a system. In the case of the brain, this self-organised process allows groups of neurons to fire in highly intricate partially synchronised patterns and eventually lead to high level cognitive outputs and control over the human body. However, when the synchronisation patterns are altered and hypersynchronisation occurs, undesirable effects can occur. This is particularly striking and well documented in the case of epileptic seizures and tremors in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease. In this paper, we propose an innovative, minimally invasive, control method that can effectively desynchronise misfiring brain regions and thus mitigate and even eliminate the symptoms of the diseases. The control strategy, grounded in the Hamiltonian control theory, is applied to ensembles of neurons modelled via the Kuramoto or the Stuart-Landau models and allows for heterogeneous coupling among the interacting unities. The theory has been complemented with dedicated numerical simulations performed using the small-world Newman-Watts network and the random Erdős-Rényi network. Finally the method has been compared with the gold-standard Proportional-Differential Feedback control technique. Our method is shown to achieve equivalent levels of desynchronisation using lesser control strength and/or fewer controllers, being thus minimally invasive.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HZMLntdffDE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Correction of copy number induced false positives in CRISPR screens</title>

Cell autonomous cancer dependencies are now routinely identified using CRISPR loss-of-function viability screens. However, a bias exists that makes it difficult to assess the true essentiality of genes located in amplicons, since the entire amplified region can exhibit lethal scores. These false-positive hits can either be discarded from further analysis, which in cancer models can represent a significant number of hits, or methods can be developed to rescue the true-positives within amplified regions. We propose two methods to rescue true positive hits in amplified regions by correcting for this copy number artefact. The Local Drop Out (LDO) method uses the relative lethality scores within genomic regions to assess true essentiality and does not require additional orthogonal data (e.g. copy number value). LDO is meant to be used in screens covering a dense region of the genome (e.g. a whole chromosome or the whole genome). The General Additive Model (GAM) method models the screening data as a function of the known copy number values and removes the systematic effect from the measured lethality. GAM does not require the same density as LDO, but does require prior knowledge of the copy number values. Both methods have been developed with single sample experiments in mind so that the correction can be applied even in smaller screens. Here we demonstrate the efficacy of both methods at removing the copy number effect and rescuing hits from some of the amplified regions. We estimate a 70–80% decrease of false positive hits with either method in regions of high copy number compared to no correction.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HKcn4ktDbyU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Mature microRNAs (miRNAs) are processed from primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs), and their expression is controlled at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. However, how regulation at multiple levels achieves precise control remains elusive. Using published and new datasets, we profile a time course of mature and pri-miRNAs in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; embryos and reveal the dynamics of miRNA production and degradation as well as dynamic changes in pri-miRNA isoform selection. We found that 5' nucleotides influence stability of mature miRNAs. Furthermore, distinct half-lives of miRNAs from the &lt;i&gt;mir-309&lt;/i&gt; cluster shape their temporal expression patterns, and the importance of rapid degradation of the miRNAs in gene regulation is detected as distinct evolutionary signatures at the target sites in the transcriptome. Finally, we show that rapid degradation of miR-3/-309 may be important for regulation of the planar cell polarity pathway component Vang. Altogether, the results suggest that complex mechanisms regulate miRNA expression to support normal development.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Inhibiting the integrated stress response pathway prevents aberrant chondrocyte differentiation thereby alleviating chondrodysplasia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.37673</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37673</link>
	<description>The integrated stress response (ISR) is activated by diverse forms of cellular stress, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and is associated with diseases. However, the molecular mechanism(s) whereby the ISR impacts on differentiation is incompletely understood. Here, we exploited a mouse model of Metaphyseal Chondrodysplasia type Schmid (MCDS) to provide insight into the impact of the ISR on cell fate. We show the protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) pathway that mediates preferential synthesis of ATF4 and CHOP, dominates in causing dysplasia by reverting chondrocyte differentiation via ATF4-directed transactivation of &lt;i&gt;Sox9&lt;/i&gt;. Chondrocyte survival is enabled, cell autonomously, by CHOP and dual CHOP-ATF4 transactivation of &lt;i&gt;Fgf21.&lt;/i&gt; Treatment of mutant mice with a chemical inhibitor of PERK signaling prevents the differentiation defects and ameliorates chondrodysplasia. By preventing aberrant differentiation, titrated inhibition of the ISR emerges as a rationale therapeutic strategy for stress-induced skeletal disorders.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: PDF-1 neuropeptide signaling regulates sexually dimorphic gene expression in shared sensory neurons of C. elegans</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36547</link>
	<description>Sexually dimorphic behaviors are a feature common to species across the animal kingdom, however how such behaviors are generated from mostly sex-shared nervous systems is not well understood. Building on our previous work which described the sexually dimorphic expression of a neuroendocrine ligand, DAF-7, and its role in behavioral decision-making in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; (Hilbert and Kim, 2017), we show here that sex-specific expression of &lt;i&gt;daf-7&lt;/i&gt; is regulated by another neuroendocrine ligand, Pigment Dispersing Factor (PDF-1), which has previously been implicated in regulating male-specific behavior (Barrios et al., 2012). Our analysis revealed that PDF-1 signaling acts sex- and cell-specifically in the ASJ neurons to regulate the expression of &lt;i&gt;daf-7,&lt;/i&gt; and we show that differences in PDFR-1 receptor activity account for the sex-specific effects of this pathway. Our data suggest that modulation of the sex-shared nervous system by a cascade of neuroendocrine signals can shape sexually dimorphic behaviors.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Coevolution-based inference of amino acid interactions underlying protein function</title>

	<description>Protein function arises from a poorly understood pattern of energetic interactions between amino acid residues. Sequence-based strategies for deducing this pattern have been proposed, but lack of benchmark data has limited experimental verification. Here, we extend deep-mutation technologies to enable measurement of many thousands of pairwise amino acid couplings in several homologs of a protein family - a deep coupling scan (DCS). The data show that cooperative interactions between residues are loaded in a sparse, evolutionarily conserved, spatially contiguous network of amino acids. The pattern of amino acid coupling is quantitatively captured in the coevolution of amino acid positions, especially as indicated by the statistical coupling analysis (SCA), providing experimental confirmation of the key tenets of this method. This work exposes the collective nature of physical constraints on protein function and clarifies its link with sequence analysis, enabling a general practical approach for understanding the structural basis for protein function.</description>

	<description>Molecular tension sensors have contributed to a growing understanding of mechanobiology. However, the limited dynamic range and inability to specify the mechanical sensitivity of these sensors has hindered their widespread use in diverse contexts. Here, we systematically examine the components of tension sensors that can be altered to improve their functionality. Guided by the development of a first principles model describing the mechanical behavior of these sensors, we create a collection of sensors that exhibit predictable sensitivities and significantly improved performance &lt;i&gt;in cellulo&lt;/i&gt;. Utilized in the context of vinculin mechanobiology, a trio of these new biosensors with distinct force- and extension-sensitivities reveal that an extension-based control paradigm regulates vinculin loading in a variety of mechanical contexts. To enable the rational design of molecular tension sensors appropriate for diverse applications, we predict the mechanical behavior, in terms of force and extension, of additional 1020 distinct designs.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: The major β-catenin/E-cadherin junctional binding site is a primary molecular mechano-transductor of differentiation in vivo</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/33381</link>
	<description>&lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt;, the primary molecular mechanotransductive events mechanically initiating cell differentiation remain unknown. Here we find the molecular stretching of the highly conserved Y654-β-catenin-D665-E-cadherin binding site as mechanically induced by tissue strain. It triggers the increase of accessibility of the Y654 site, target of the Src42A kinase phosphorylation leading to irreversible unbinding. Molecular dynamics simulations of the β-catenin/E-cadherin complex under a force mimicking a 6 pN physiological mechanical strain predict a local 45% stretching between the two α-helices linked by the site and a 15% increase in accessibility of the phosphorylation site. Both are quantitatively observed using FRET lifetime imaging and non-phospho Y654 specific antibody labelling, in response to the mechanical strains developed by endogenous and magnetically mimicked early mesoderm invagination of gastrulating &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; embryos. This is followed by the predicted release of 16% of β-catenin from junctions, observed in FRAP, which initiates the mechanical activation of the β-catenin pathway process.</description>

	<description>Hearing loss in mammals is an irreversible process caused by degeneration of the hair cells of the inner ear. Current therapies for hearing loss include hearing aids and cochlear implants that provide substantial benefits to most patients, but also have several shortcomings. There is great interest in the development of regenerative therapies to treat deafness in the future. Cell-based therapies, based either on adult, multipotent stem, or other types of pluripotent cells, offer promise for generating differentiated cell types to replace lost or damaged hair cells of the inner ear.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Stochastic resonance enhances the rate of evidence accumulation during combined brain stimulation and perceptual decision-making</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006301</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Onno van der Groen, Matthew F. Tang, Nicole Wenderoth, Jason B. Mattingley&lt;/p&gt;

Perceptual decision-making relies on the gradual accumulation of noisy sensory evidence. It is often assumed that such decisions are degraded by adding noise to a stimulus, or to the neural systems involved in the decision making process itself. But it has been suggested that adding an optimal amount of noise can, under appropriate conditions, enhance the quality of subthreshold signals in nonlinear systems, a phenomenon known as &lt;i&gt;stochastic resonance&lt;/i&gt;. Here we asked whether perceptual decisions made by human observers obey these stochastic resonance principles, by adding noise directly to the visual cortex using transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) while participants judged the direction of coherent motion in random-dot kinematograms presented at the fovea. We found that adding tRNS bilaterally to visual cortex enhanced decision-making when stimuli were just below perceptual threshold, but not when they were well below or above threshold. We modelled the data under a drift diffusion framework, and showed that bilateral tRNS selectively increased the drift rate parameter, which indexes the rate of evidence accumulation. Our study is the first to provide causal evidence that perceptual decision-making is susceptible to a stochastic resonance effect induced by tRNS, and to show that this effect arises from selective enhancement of the rate of evidence accumulation for sub-threshold sensory events.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hJxUrn196_0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A biophysically detailed computational model of bladder small DRG neuron soma</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Darshan Mandge, Rohit Manchanda&lt;/p&gt;

Bladder small DRG neurons, which are putative nociceptors pivotal to urinary bladder function, express more than a dozen different ionic membrane mechanisms: ion channels, pumps and exchangers. Small-conductance Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (SK&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;) channels which were earlier thought to be gated solely by intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration ([Ca]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) have recently been shown to exhibit inward rectification with respect to membrane potential. The effect of SK&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; inward rectification on the excitability of these neurons is unknown. Furthermore, studies on the role of K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; channels in repetitive firing and their contributions to different types of afterhyperpolarization (AHP) in these neurons are lacking. In order to study these phenomena, we first constructed and validated a biophysically detailed single compartment model of bladder small DRG soma constrained by physiological data. The model includes twenty-two major known membrane mechanisms along with intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics comprising Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion, cytoplasmic buffering, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial mechanisms. Using modelling studies, we show that inward rectification of SK&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; is an important parameter regulating neuronal repetitive firing and that its absence reduces action potential (AP) firing frequency. We also show that SK&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; is more potent in reducing AP spiking than the large-conductance K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; channel (BK&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;) in these neurons. Moreover, BK&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; was found to contribute to the fast AHP (fAHP) and SK&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; to the medium-duration (mAHP) and slow AHP (sAHP). We also report that the slow inactivating A-type K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel (slow K&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;) current in these neurons is composed of 2 components: an initial fast inactivating (time constant ∼ 25-100 ms) and a slow inactivating (time constant ∼ 200-800 ms) current. We discuss the implications of our findings, and how our detailed model can help further our understanding of the role of C-fibre afferents in the physiology of urinary bladder as well as in certain disorders.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/w7djXqEISFc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The mammalian visual system consists of several anatomically distinct areas, layers, and cell types. To understand the role of these subpopulations in visual information processing, we analyzed neural signals recorded from excitatory neurons from various anatomical and functional structures. For each of 186 mice, one of six genetically tagged cell types and one of six visual areas were targeted while the mouse was passively viewing various visual stimuli. We trained linear classifiers to decode one of six visual stimulus categories with distinct spatiotemporal structures from the population neural activity. We found that neurons in both the primary visual cortex and secondary visual areas show varying degrees of stimulus-specific decodability, and neurons in superficial layers tend to be more informative about the stimulus categories. Additional decoding analyses of directional motion were consistent with these findings. We observed synergy in the population code of direction in several visual areas suggesting area-specific organization of information representation across neurons. These differences in decoding capacities shed light on the specialized organization of neural information processing across anatomically distinct subpopulations, and further establish the mouse as a model for understanding visual perception.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Addiction is characterized by a profound intersubject (phenotypic) variability in the expression of addictive symptomatology and propensity to relapse following treatment. However, laboratory investigations have primarily focused on common neural substrates in addiction and have not yet been able to identify mechanisms that can account for the multifaceted phenotypic behaviors reported in the literature. To fill this knowledge gap theoretically, here we simulated phenotypic variations in addiction symptomology and responses to putative treatments, using both a neural model, based on cortico-striatal circuit dynamics, and an algorithmic model of reinforcement learning (RL). These simulations rely on the widely accepted assumption that both the ventral, model-based, goal-directed system and the dorsal, model-free, habitual system are vulnerable to extra-physiologic dopamine reinforcements triggered by addictive rewards. We found that endophenotypic differences in the balance between the two circuit or control systems resulted in an inverted-U shape in optimal choice behavior. Specifically, greater unbalance led to a higher likelihood of developing addiction and more severe drug-taking behaviors. Furthermore, endophenotypes with opposite asymmetrical biases among cortico-striatal circuits expressed similar addiction behaviors, but responded differently to simulated treatments, suggesting personalized treatment development could rely on endophenotypic rather than phenotypic differentiations. We propose our simulated results, confirmed across neural and algorithmic levels of analysis, inform on a fundamental and, to date, neglected quantitative method to characterize clinical heterogeneity in addiction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Eye Movement-Related Confounds in Neural Decoding of Visual Working Memory Representations</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;A relatively new analysis technique, known as neural decoding or multivariate pattern analysis, has become increasingly popular for cognitive neuroimaging studies over recent years. These techniques promise to uncover the representational contents of neural signals, as well as the underlying code and the dynamic profile thereof. A field in which these techniques have led to novel insights in particular is that of visual working memory (VWM). In the present study we subjected human volunteers to a combined VWM/imagery task while recording their neural signals using MEG. We applied multivariate decoding analyses to uncover the temporal profile underlying the neural representations of the memorized item. Analysis of gaze position however revealed that our results were contaminated by systematic eye movements, suggesting that the MEG decoding results from our originally planned analyses were confounded. In addition to the eye movement analyses, we also present the original analyses to highlight how these might have readily led to invalid conclusions. Finally, we demonstrate a potential remedy, whereby we train the decoders on a functional localizer that was specifically designed to target bottom-up sensory signals and as such avoids eye movements. We conclude by arguing for more awareness of the potentially pervasive and ubiquitous effects of eye movement-related confounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Neural decoding is an important and relatively novel technique that has opened up new avenues for cognitive neuroscience research. However, with its promises also come potential caveats. In this study we show that neural decoding may be susceptible to confounds induced by small task- and stimulus-specific eye movements in the context of a visual working memory task. Such eye movements during working memory tasks have been reported before, and may in fact be a common phenomenon. Given the widespread use of neural decoding and the potentially contaminating effects of eye movements, we therefore believe that our results are of significant relevance for the field.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of nicotine dependence is higher than that for any other substance abuse disorder; still, the underlying mechanisms are not fully established. To this end, we studied acute effects by nicotine on neurotransmission in the dorsolateral striatum, a key brain region with respect to the formation of habits. Electrophysiological recordings in acutely isolated brain slices from rodent showed that nicotine (10 nm to 10 μm) produced an LTD of evoked field potentials. Current-clamp recordings revealed no significant effect by nicotine on membrane voltage or action potential frequency, indicating that the effect by nicotine is primarily synaptic. Nicotine did not modulate sIPSCs, or the connectivity between fast-spiking interneurons and medium spiny neurons, as assessed by whole-cell recordings combined with optogenetics. However, the frequency of sEPSCs was significantly depressed by nicotine. The effect by nicotine was mimicked by agonists targeting α7- or α4-containing nAChRs and blocked in slices pretreated with a mixture of antagonists targeting these receptor subtypes. Nicotine-induced LTD was furthermore inhibited by dopamine D2 receptor antagonist and occluded by D2 receptor agonist. In addition, modulation of cholinergic neurotransmission suppressed the responding to nicotine, which might reflect upon the postulated role for nAChRs as a presynaptic filter to differentially govern dopamine release depending on neuronal activity. Nicotine-induced suppression of excitatory inputs onto medium spiny neurons may promote nicotine-induced locomotor stimulation and putatively initiate neuroadaptations that could contribute to the transition toward compulsive drug taking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; To decrease smoking, prevalence factors that may contribute to the development of nicotine addiction need to be identified. The data presented here show that nicotine suppresses striatal neurotransmission by selectively reducing the frequency of excitatory inputs to medium spiny neurons (MSNs) while rendering excitability, inhibitory neurotransmission, and fast-spiking interneuron-MSN connectivity unaltered. In addition, we show that the effect displayed by nicotine outlasts the presence of the drug, which could be fundamental for the addictive properties of nicotine. Considering the inhibitory tone displayed by MSNs on dopaminergic cell bodies and local terminals, nicotine-induced long-lasting depression of striatal output could play a role in behavioral transformations associated with nicotine use, and putatively elicit neuroadaptations underlying compulsive drug-seeking habits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Axonal Ensheathment in the Nervous System of Lamprey: Implications for the Evolution of Myelinating Glia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/29/6586?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the nervous system, myelination of axons enables rapid impulse conduction and is a specialized function of glial cells. Myelinating glia are the last cell type to emerge in the evolution of vertebrate nervous systems, presumably in ancient jawed vertebrates (gnathostomata) because jawless vertebrates (agnathans) lack myelin. We have hypothesized that, in these unmyelinated species, evolutionary progenitors of myelinating cells must have existed that should still be present in contemporary agnathan species. Here, we used advanced electron microscopic techniques to reveal axon–glia interactions in the sea lamprey &lt;i&gt;Petromyzon marinus&lt;/i&gt;. By quantitative assessment of the spinal cord and the peripheral lateral line nerve, we observed a marked maturation-dependent growth of axonal calibers. In peripheral nerves, all axons are ensheathed by glial cells either in bundles or, when larger than the threshold caliber of 3 μm, individually. The ensheathing glia are covered by a basal lamina and express &lt;i&gt;SoxE&lt;/i&gt;-transcription factors, features of mammalian Remak-type Schwann cells. In larval lamprey, the ensheathment of peripheral axons leaves gaps that are closed in adults. CNS axons are also covered to a considerable extent by glial processes, which contain a high density of intermediate filaments, glycogen particles, large lipid droplets, and desmosomes, similar to mammalian astrocytes. Indeed, by &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization, these glial cells express the astrocyte marker &lt;i&gt;Aldh1l1&lt;/i&gt;. Specimens were of unknown sex. Our observations imply that radial sorting, ensheathment, and presumably also metabolic support of axons are ancient functions of glial cells that predate the evolutionary emergence of myelin in jawed vertebrates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We used current electron microscopy techniques to examine axon–glia units in a nonmyelinated vertebrate species, the sea lamprey. In the PNS, lamprey axons are fully ensheathed either individually or in bundles by cells ortholog to Schwann cells. In the CNS, axons associate with astrocyte orthologs, which contain glycogen and lipid droplets. We suggest that ensheathment, radial sorting, and metabolic support of axons by glial cells predate the evolutionary emergence of myelin in ancient jawed vertebrates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: lncRNA TNXA-PS1 Modulates Schwann Cells by Functioning As a Competing Endogenous RNA Following Nerve Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/29/6574?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;As the major glia in PNS, Schwann cells play a critical role in peripheral nerve injury repair. Finding an efficient approach to promote Schwann cell activation might facilitate peripheral nerve repair. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to regulate gene expression and take part in many biological processes. However, the role of lncRNAs in peripheral nerve regeneration is not fully understood. In this study, we obtained a global lncRNA portrayal following sciatic nerve injury in male rats using microarray and further investigated one of these dys-regulated lncRNAs, TNXA-PS1, confirming its vital role in regulating Schwann cells. Silencing TNAX-PS1 could promote Schwann cell migration and mechanism analyses showed that TNXA-PS1 might exert its regulatory role by sponging miR-24–3p/miR-152–3p and affecting dual specificity phosphatase 1 (Dusp1) expression. Systematic lncRNA expression profiling of sciatic nerve segments following nerve injury in rats suggested lncRNA TNXA-PS1 as a key regulator of Schwann cell migration, providing a potential therapeutic target for nerve injury repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The PNS has an intrinsic regeneration capacity after injury in which Schwann cells play a crucial role. Therefore, further exploration of functional molecules in the Schwann cell phenotype modulation is of great importance. We have identified a set of dys-regulated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in rats following sciatic nerve injury and found that the expression of TNXA-PS1 was significantly downregulated. Mechanically analyses showed that TNXA-PS1 might act as a competing endogenous RNA to affect dual specificity phosphatase 1 (Dusp1) expression, regulating migration of Schwann cells. This study provides for the first time a global landscape of lncRNAs following sciatic nerve injury in rats and broadens the known functions of lncRNA during nerve injury. The investigation of TNXA-PS1 might facilitate the development of novel targets for nerve injury therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Distinct Populations of Motor Thalamic Neurons Encode Action Initiation, Action Selection, and Movement Vigor</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/29/6563?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Motor thalamus (Mthal) comprises the ventral anterior, ventral lateral, and ventral medial thalamic nuclei in rodents. This subcortical hub receives input from the basal ganglia (BG), cerebellum, and reticular thalamus in addition to connecting reciprocally with motor cortical regions. Despite the central location of Mthal, the mechanisms by which it influences movement remain unclear. To determine its role in generating ballistic, goal-directed movement, we recorded single-unit Mthal activity as male rats performed a two-alternative forced-choice task. A large population of Mthal neurons increased their firing briefly near movement initiation and could be segregated into functional groups based on their behavioral correlates. The activity of &quot;initiation&quot; units was more tightly locked to instructional cues than movement onset, did not predict which direction the rat would move, and was anticorrelated with reaction time (RT). Conversely, the activity of &quot;execution&quot; units was more tightly locked to movement onset than instructional cues, predicted which direction the rat would move, and was anticorrelated with both RT and movement time. These results suggest that Mthal influences choice RT performance in two stages: short latency, nonspecific action initiation followed by action selection/invigoration. We discuss the implications of these results for models of motor control incorporating BG and cerebellar circuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Motor thalamus (Mthal) is a central node linking subcortical and cortical motor circuits, though its precise role in motor control is unclear. Here, we define distinct populations of Mthal neurons that either encode movement initiation, or both action selection and movement vigor. These results have important implications for understanding how basal ganglia, cerebellar, and motor cortical signals are integrated. Such an understanding is critical to defining the pathophysiology of a range of BG- and cerebellum-linked movement disorders, as well as refining pharmacologic and neuromodulatory approaches to their treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dysregulation of NAD+ Metabolism Induces a Schwann Cell Dedifferentiation Program</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/29/6546?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Schwann cell (SC) is the major component of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) that provides metabolic and functional support for peripheral axons. The emerging roles of SC mitochondrial function for PNS development and axonal stability indicate the importance of SC metabolism in nerve function and in peripheral neuropathies associated with metabolic disorders. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) is a crucial molecule in the regulation of cellular metabolism and redox homeostasis. Here, we investigated the roles of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; metabolism in SC functions &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; by mutating NAMPT, the rate-limiting enzyme of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; biosynthesis, specifically in SCs. NAMPT SC knock-out male and female mice (NAMPT SCKO mice) had delayed SC maturation in development and developed hypomyelinating peripheral neuropathy without axon degeneration or decreased SC survival. JUN, a master regulator of SC dedifferentiation, is elevated in NAMPT SCKO SCs, suggesting that decreased NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; levels cause them to arrest at an immature stage. Nicotinic acid administration rescues the NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; decline and reverses the SC maturation defect and the development of peripheral neuropathy, indicating the central role of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in PNS development. Upon nicotinic acid withdrawal in adulthood, NAMPT SCKO mice showed rapid and severe peripheral neuropathy and activation of ERK/MEK/JUN signaling, which in turn promotes SC dedifferentiation. These data demonstrate the importance of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; metabolism in SC maturation and nerve development and maintenance and suggest that altered SC NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; metabolism could underlie neuropathies associated with diabetes and aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In this study, we showed that Schwann cell differentiation status is critically dependent on NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis. Aberrant regulation of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; biosynthesis via NAMPT deletion results in a blockade of Schwann cell maturation during development and severe peripheral neuropathy without significant axon loss. The phenotype can be rescued by supplementation with nicotinic acid; however, withdrawal of nicotinic acid leads to Schwann cell dedifferentiation, myelination defects, and death. These results provide new therapeutic possibilities for peripheral neuropathies associated with NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; decline during aging or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Acute Complement Inhibition Potentiates Neurorehabilitation and Enhances tPA-Mediated Neuroprotection</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/29/6527?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Because complement activation in the subacute or chronic phase after stroke was recently shown to stimulate neural plasticity, we investigated how complement activation and complement inhibition in the acute phase after murine stroke interacts with subsequent rehabilitation therapy to modulate neuroinflammation and neural remodeling. We additionally investigated how complement and complement inhibition interacts with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), the other standard of care therapy for stroke, and a U.S. Food and Drug Administration preclinical requirement for translation of an experimental stroke therapy. CR2fH, an injury site-targeted inhibitor of the alternative complement pathway, significantly reduced infarct volume, hemorrhagic transformation, and mortality and significantly improved long-term motor and cognitive performance when administered 1.5 or 24 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion. CR2fH interrupted a poststroke inflammatory process and significantly reduced inflammatory cytokine release, microglial activation, and astrocytosis. Rehabilitation alone showed mild anti-inflammatory effects, including reduced complement activation, but only improved cognitive recovery. CR2fH combined with rehabilitation significantly potentiated cognitive and motor recovery compared with either intervention alone and was associated with higher growth factor release and enhanced rehabilitation-induced neuroblast migration and axonal remodeling. Similar outcomes were seen in adult, aged, and female mice. Using a microembolic model, CR2fH administered in combination with acute tPA therapy improved overall survival and enhanced the neuroprotective effects of tPA, extending the treatment window for tPA therapy. A human counterpart of CR2fH has been shown to be safe and nonimmunogenic in humans and we have demonstrated robust deposition of C3d, the CR2fH targeting epitope, in ischemic human brains after stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Complement inhibition is a potential therapeutic approach for stroke, but it is not known how complement inhibition would interact with current standards of care. We show that, after murine ischemic stroke, rehabilitation alone induced mild anti-inflammatory effects and improved cognitive, but not motor recovery. However, brain-targeted and specific inhibition of the alternative complement pathway, when combined with rehabilitation, significantly potentiated cognitive and motor recovery compared with either intervention alone via mechanisms involving neuroregeneration and enhanced brain remodeling. Further, inhibiting the alternative pathway of complement significantly enhanced the neuroprotective effects of thrombolytic therapy and markedly expanded the therapeutic window for thrombolytic therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Constitutive and Synaptic Activation of GIRK Channels Differentiates Mature and Newborn Dentate Granule Cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/29/6513?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/29/6513?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sparse neural activity in the dentate gyrus is enforced by powerful networks of inhibitory GABAergic interneurons in combination with low intrinsic excitability of the principal neurons, the dentate granule cells (GCs). Although the cellular and circuit properties that dictate synaptic inhibition are well studied, less is known about mechanisms that confer low GC intrinsic excitability. Here we demonstrate that intact G protein-mediated signaling contributes to the characteristic low resting membrane potential that differentiates mature dentate GCs from CA1 pyramidal cells and developing adult-born GCs. In mature GCs from male and female mice, intact G protein signaling robustly reduces intrinsic excitability, whereas deletion of G protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium channel 2 (GIRK2) increases excitability and blocks the effects of G protein signaling on intrinsic properties. Similarly, pharmacological manipulation of GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs) or GIRK channels alters intrinsic excitability and GC spiking behavior. However, adult-born new GCs lack functional GIRK activity, with phasic and constitutive GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R-mediated GIRK signaling appearing after several weeks of maturation. Phasic activation is interneuron specific, arising primarily from nNOS-expressing interneurons rather than parvalbumin- or somatostatin-expressing interneurons. Together, these results demonstrate that G protein signaling contributes to the intrinsic excitability that differentiates mature and developing dentate GCs and further suggest that late maturation of GIRK channel activity is poised to convert early developmental functions of GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor signaling into GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R-mediated inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The dentate gyrus exhibits sparse neural activity that is essential for the computational function of pattern separation. Sparse activity is ascribed to strong local inhibitory circuits in combination with low intrinsic excitability of the principal neurons, the granule cells. Here we show that constitutive activity of G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channels (GIRKs) underlies to the hallmark low resting membrane potential and input resistance of mature dentate neurons. Adult-born neurons initially lack functional GIRK channels, with constitutive and phasic GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-mediated GIRK inhibition developing in tandem after several weeks of maturation. Our results reveal that GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;/GIRK activity is an important determinant of low excitability of mature dentate granule cells that may contribute to sparse DG activity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Stimulation of the Prefrontal Cortex Reduces Intentions to Commit Aggression: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Stratified, Parallel-Group Trial</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/29/6505?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/29/6505?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although prefrontal brain impairments are one of the best-replicated brain imaging findings in relation to aggression, little is known about the causal role of this brain region. This study tests whether stimulating the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) reduces the likelihood of engaging in aggressive acts, and the mechanism underlying this relationship. In a double-blind, stratified, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomized trial, 81 human adults (36 males, 45 females) were randomly assigned to an active (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 39) or placebo (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 42) condition, and then followed up 1 d after the experiment session. Intentions to commit aggressive acts and behavioral aggression were assessed using hypothetical vignettes and a behavioral task, respectively. The secondary outcome was the perception of the moral wrongfulness of the aggressive acts. Compared with the sham controls, participants who received anodal stimulation reported being less likely to commit physical and sexual assault (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). They also judged aggressive acts as more morally wrong (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Perceptions of greater moral wrongfulness regarding the aggressive acts accounted for 31% of the total effect of tDCS on intentions to commit aggression. Results provide experimental evidence that increasing activity in the prefrontal cortex can reduce intentions to commit aggression and enhance perceptions of the moral wrongfulness of the aggressive acts. Findings shed light on the biological underpinnings of aggression and theoretically have the potential to inform future interventions for aggression and violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Aggressive behaviors pose significant public health risks. Understanding the etiology of aggression is paramount to violence reduction. Investigations of the neural basis of aggression have largely supported correlational, rather than causal, interpretations, and the mediating processes underlying the prefrontal–aggression relationship remain to be well elucidated. Through a double-blind, stratified, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomized trial, this study tested whether upregulation of the prefrontal cortex reduces the likelihood of engaging in aggression. Results provide experimental evidence that increasing prefrontal cortical activity can reduce intent to commit aggressive acts. They also shed light on moral judgment as one mechanism that may link prefrontal deficits to aggression and, in theory, have the potential to inform future approaches toward reducing aggression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Oligodendroglia Are Particularly Vulnerable to Oxidative Damage after Neurotrauma In Vivo</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/29/6491?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Loss of function following injury to the CNS is worsened by secondary degeneration of neurons and glia surrounding the injury and is initiated by oxidative damage. However, it is not yet known which cellular populations and structures are most vulnerable to oxidative damage &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Using Nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS), oxidative damage was semiquantified within cellular subpopulations and structures of optic nerve vulnerable to secondary degeneration, following a partial transection of the optic nerve in adult female PVG rats. Simultaneous assessment of cellular subpopulations and structures revealed oligodendroglia as the most vulnerable to DNA oxidation following injury. 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) was used to label cells that proliferated in the first 3 d after injury. Injury led to increases in DNA, protein, and lipid damage in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and mature oligodendrocytes at 3 d, regardless of proliferative state, associated with a decline in the numbers of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells at 7 d. O4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; preoligodendrocytes also exhibited increased lipid peroxidation. Interestingly, EdU&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; mature oligodendrocytes derived after injury demonstrated increased early susceptibility to DNA damage and lipid peroxidation. However, EdU&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; mature oligodendrocytes with high 8-hydroxyguanosine immunoreactivity were more likely to be caspase3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. By day 28, newly derived mature oligodendrocytes had significantly reduced myelin regulatory factor gene mRNA, indicating that the myelination potential of these cells may be reduced. The proportion of caspase3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; oligodendrocytes remained higher in EdU&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; cells. Innovative use of NanoSIMS together with traditional immunohistochemistry and &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization have enabled the first demonstration of subpopulation specific oligodendroglial vulnerability to oxidative damage, due to secondary degeneration &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Injury to the CNS is characterized by oxidative damage in areas adjacent to the injury. However, the cellular subpopulations and structures most vulnerable to this damage remain to be elucidated. Here we use powerful NanoSIMS techniques to show increased oxidative damage in oligodendroglia and axons and to demonstrate that cells early in the oligodendroglial lineage are the most vulnerable to DNA oxidation. Further immunohistochemical and &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization investigation reveals that mature oligodendrocytes derived after injury are more vulnerable to oxidative damage than their counterparts existing at the time of injury and have reduced myelin regulatory factor gene mRNA, yet preexisting oligodendrocytes are more likely to die.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cellular Effects of Repetition Priming in the Aplysia Feeding Network Are Suppressed during a Task-Switch But Persist and Facilitate a Return to the Primed State</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/29/6475?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/29/6475?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many neural networks are multitasking and receive modulatory input, which configures activity. As a result, these networks can enter a relatively persistent state in which they are biased to generate one type of output as opposed to another. A question we address is as follows: what happens to this type of state when the network is forced to task-switch? We address this question in the feeding system of the mollusc &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt;. This network generates ingestive and egestive motor programs. We focus on an identified neuron that is selectively active when programs are ingestive. Previous work has established that the increase in firing frequency observed during ingestive programs is at least partially mediated by an excitability increase. Here we identify the underlying cellular mechanism as the induction of a cAMP-dependent inward current. We ask how this current is impacted by the subsequent induction of egestive activity. Interestingly, we demonstrate that this task-switch does not eliminate the inward current but instead activates an outward current. The induction of the outward current obviously reduces the net inward current in the cell. This produces the decrease in excitability and firing frequency required for the task-switch. Importantly, however, the persistence of the inward current is not impacted. It remains present and coexists with the outward current. Consequently, when effects of egestive priming and the outward current dissipate, firing frequency and excitability remain above baseline levels. This presumably has important functional implications in that it will facilitate a return to ingestive activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Under physiological conditions, an animal generating a particular type of motor activity can be forced to at least briefly task-switch. In some circumstances, this involves the temporary induction of an &quot;antagonistic&quot; or incompatible motor program. For example, ingestion can be interrupted by a brief period of egestive activity. In this type of situation, it is often desirable for behavioral switching to occur rapidly and efficiently. In this report, we focus on a particular aspect of this type of task-switch. We determine how the priming that occurs when a multitasking network repeatedly generates one type of motor activity can be retained during the execution of an incompatible motor program.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The anterior insula has repeatedly been linked to the experience of aversive stimuli, such as pain. Previously, we showed that the anterior insula is involved in the integration of pain intensity and its prior expectation. However, it is unclear whether this integration occurs by a pain-specific expectation or a more general expectation of an aversive event. To dissociate these possibilities, we conducted an experiment using painful stimuli and aversive pictures with three levels of aversiveness on human male volunteers. Stimuli were preceded by a probabilistic, combined modality and intensity cue in a full factorial design. Subjective ratings of pain intensity and skin conductance responses were best explained by a combination of actual pain intensity and expected pain intensity. In addition, using fMRI, we investigated the neuronal implementation of the integration of prior expectation and pain intensity. Similar to subjective ratings and autonomic responses, the dorsal anterior insula represented pain intensity and expectations. The ventral anterior insula additionally represented the absolute difference of the two terms (i.e., the prediction error). The posterior insula only represented pain intensity. Importantly, the pattern observed in the anterior insula was only present if the cued modality was correct (i.e., expect pain); in case of an incorrect modality cue (i.e., expect aversive picture), the ventral anterior insula simply represented pain intensity. The stimulus expectation and prediction error specificity in the ventral anterior insula indicates the integration of expectation with painful stimuli in this area. Importantly, this pattern cannot be explained by aversiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The anterior insula has been shown to integrate pain intensity and their expectation. However, it is unclear whether this integration is pain-specific or related more generally to an aversive event. To address this, we combined painful stimuli and aversive pictures with three levels of aversiveness. The ventral anterior insula represented pain intensity, expectation, and their absolute difference (i.e., the prediction error). Importantly, this pattern was only observed if the cued modality was correct. In case of an incorrect modality cue, this area simply represented as pain intensity. The stimulus expectation and prediction error specificity in the ventral anterior insula indicates the integration of expectation with painful stimuli in this area. Importantly, this pattern cannot be explained by aversiveness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Postsynaptic FMRP Regulates Synaptogenesis In Vivo in the Developing Cochlear Nucleus</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A global loss of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP; encoded by the Fmr1 gene) leads to sensory dysfunction and intellectual disabilities. One underlying mechanism of these phenotypes is structural and functional deficits in synapses. Here, we determined the autonomous function of postsynaptic FMRP in circuit formation, synaptogenesis, and synaptic maturation. In normal cochlea nucleus, presynaptic auditory axons form large axosomatic endbulb synapses on cell bodies of postsynaptic bushy neurons. I&lt;i&gt;n ovo&lt;/i&gt; electroporation of drug-inducible Fmr1-shRNA constructs produced a mosaicism of FMRP expression in chicken (either sex) bushy neurons, leading to reduced FMRP levels in transfected, but not neighboring nontransfected, neurons. Structural analyses revealed that postsynaptic FMRP reduction led to smaller size and abnormal morphology of individual presynaptic endbulbs at both early and later developmental stages. We further examined whether FMRP reduction affects dendritic development, as a potential mechanism underlying defective endbulb formation. Normally, chicken bushy neurons grow extensive dendrites at early stages and retract these dendrites when endbulbs begin to form. Neurons transfected with Fmr1 shRNA exhibited a remarkable delay in branch retraction, failing to provide necessary somatic surface for timely formation and growth of large endbulbs. Patch-clamp recording verified functional consequences of dendritic and synaptic deficits on neurotransmission, showing smaller amplitudes and slower kinetics of spontaneous and evoked EPSCs. Together, these data demonstrate that proper levels of postsynaptic FMRP are required for timely maturation of somatodendritic morphology, a delay of which may affect synaptogenesis and thus contribute to long-lasting deficits of excitatory synapses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) regulates a large variety of neuronal activities. A global loss of FMRP affects neural circuit development and synaptic function, leading to fragile X syndrome (FXS). Using temporally and spatially controlled genetic manipulations, this study provides the first &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; report that autonomous FMRP regulates multiple stages of dendritic development, and that selective reduction of postsynaptic FMRP leads to abnormal development of excitatory presynaptic terminals and compromised neurotransmission. These observations demonstrate secondary influence of developmentally transient deficits in neuronal morphology and connectivity to the development of long-lasting synaptic pathology in FXS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The BRAIN Initiative arose from a grand challenge to &quot;accelerate the development and application of new technologies that will enable researchers to produce dynamic pictures of the brain that show how individual brain cells and complex neural circuits interact at the speed of thought.&quot; The BRAIN Initiative is a public-private effort focused on the development and use of powerful tools for acquiring fundamental insights about how information processing occurs in the central nervous system (CNS). As the Initiative enters its fifth year, NIH has supported &amp;gt;500 principal investigators, who have answered the Initiative's challenge via hundreds of publications describing novel tools, methods, and discoveries that address the Initiative's seven scientific priorities. We describe scientific advances produced by individual laboratories, multi-investigator teams, and entire consortia that, over the coming decades, will produce more comprehensive and dynamic maps of the brain, deepen our understanding of how circuit activity can produce a rich tapestry of behaviors, and lay the foundation for understanding how its circuitry is disrupted in brain disorders. Much more work remains to bring this vision to fruition, and the National Institutes of Health continues to look to the diverse scientific community, from mathematics, to physics, chemistry, engineering, neuroethics, and neuroscience, to ensure that the greatest scientific benefit arises from this unique research Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Dynamic reshaping of functional brain networks during visual object recognition. (arXiv:1807.06398v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Emerging evidence shows that the modular organization of the human brain
allows for better and efficient cognitive performance. Many of these cognitive
functions are very fast and occur in subsecond time scale such as the visual
object recognition. Here, we investigate brain network modularity while
controlling stimuli meaningfulness and measuring participant reaction time. We
particularly raised two questions: i) does the dynamic brain network modularity
change during the recognition of meaningful and meaningless visual images? And
ii) is there a correlation between network modularity and the reaction time of
participants? To tackle these issues, we collected dense electroencephalography
(EEG, 256 channels) data from 20 healthy human subjects performing a cognitive
task consisting of naming meaningful (tools, animals) and meaningless
(scrambled) images. Functional brain networks in both categories were estimated
at subsecond time scale using the EEG source connectivity method. By using
multislice modularity algorithms, we tracked the reconfiguration of functional
networks during the recognition of both meaningful and meaningless images.
Results showed a difference in the module characteristics of both conditions in
term of integration (interactions between modules) and occurrence (probability
on average of any two brain regions to fall in the same module during the
task). Integration and occurrence were greater for meaningless than for
meaningful images. Our findings revealed also that the occurrence within the
right frontal regions and the left occipito-temporal can help to predict the
ability of the brain to rapidly recognize and name visual stimuli. We speculate
that these observations are applicable not only to other fast cognitive
functions but also to detect fast disconnections that can occur in some brain
disorders.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Penalized matrix decomposition for denoising, compression, and improved demixing of functional imaging data. (arXiv:1807.06203v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Calcium imaging has revolutionized systems neuroscience, providing the
ability to image large neural populations with single-cell resolution. The
resulting datasets are quite large, which has presented a barrier to routine
open sharing of this data, slowing progress in reproducible research. State of
the art methods for analyzing this data are based on non-negative matrix
factorization (NMF); these approaches solve a non-convex optimization problem,
and are effective when good initializations are available, but can break down
in low-SNR settings where common initialization approaches fail. Here we
introduce an approach to compressing and denoising functional imaging data. The
method is based on a spatially-localized penalized matrix decomposition (PMD)
of the data to separate (low-dimensional) signal from (temporally-uncorrelated)
noise. This approach can be applied in parallel on local spatial patches and is
therefore highly scalable, does not impose non-negativity constraints or
require stringent identifiability assumptions (leading to significantly more
robust results compared to NMF), and estimates all parameters directly from the
data, so no hand-tuning is required. We have applied the method to a wide range
of functional imaging data (including one-photon, two-photon, three-photon,
widefield, somatic, axonal, dendritic, calcium, and voltage imaging datasets):
in all cases, we observe ~2-4x increases in SNR and compression rates of
20-300x with minimal visible loss of signal, with no adjustment of
hyperparameters; this in turn facilitates the process of demixing the observed
activity into contributions from individual neurons. We focus on two
challenging applications: dendritic calcium imaging data and voltage imaging
data in the context of optogenetic stimulation. In both cases, we show that our
new approach leads to faster and much more robust extraction of activity from
the data.

	<description>Accumulating evidence indicates that the lysosomal Ragulator complex is essential for full activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Abnormal mTORC1 activation has been implicated in several developmental neurological disorders, including Angelman syndrome (AS), which is caused by maternal deficiency of the ubiquitin E3 ligase UBE3A. Here we report that Ube3a regulates mTORC1 signaling by targeting p18, a subunit of the Ragulator. Ube3a ubiquinates p18, resulting in its proteasomal degradation, and Ube3a deficiency in the hippocampus of AS mice induces increased lysosomal localization of p18 and other members of the Ragulator-Rag complex, and increased mTORC1 activity. P18 knockdown in hippocampal CA1 neurons of AS mice reduces elevated mTORC1 activity and improves dendritic spine maturation, long-term potentiation (LTP), as well as learning performance. Our results indicate that Ube3a-mediated regulation of p18 and subsequent mTORC1 signaling is critical for typical synaptic plasticity, dendritic spine development, and learning and memory.</description>

	<description>Human vestibular sensory epithelia in explant culture were incubated in gentamicin to ablate hair cells. Subsequent transduction of supporting cells with &lt;i&gt;ATOH1&lt;/i&gt; using an Ad-2 viral vector resulted in generation of highly significant numbers of cells expressing the hair cell marker protein myosin VIIa. Cells expressing myosin VIIa were also generated after blocking the Notch signalling pathway with TAPI-1 but less efficiently. Transcriptomic analysis following &lt;i&gt;ATOH1&lt;/i&gt; transduction confirmed up-regulation of 335 putative hair cell marker genes, including several downstream targets of &lt;i&gt;ATOH1&lt;/i&gt;. Morphological analysis revealed numerous cells bearing dense clusters of microvilli at the apical surfaces which showed some hair cell-like characteristics confirming a degree of conversion of supporting cells. However, no cells bore organised hair bundles and several expected hair cell markers genes were not expressed suggesting incomplete differentiation. Nevertheless, the results show a potential to induce conversion of supporting cells in the vestibular sensory tissues of humans.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Noncoding RNA-nucleated heterochromatin spreading is intrinsically labile and requires accessory elements for epigenetic stability.</title>

	<description>The heterochromatin spreading reaction is a central contributor to the formation of gene-repressive structures, which are re-established with high positional precision, or fidelity, following replication. How the spreading reaction contributes to this fidelity is not clear. To resolve the origins of stable inheritance of repression, we probed the intrinsic character of spreading events in fission yeast using a system that quantitatively describes the spreading reaction in live single cells. We show that spreading triggered by noncoding RNA-nucleated elements is stochastic, multimodal, and fluctuates dynamically across time. This lack of stability correlates with high histone turnover. At the mating type locus, this unstable behavior is restrained by an accessory &lt;i&gt;cis-&lt;/i&gt;acting element &lt;i&gt;REIII&lt;/i&gt;, which represses histone turnover. Further, &lt;i&gt;REIII &lt;/i&gt;safeguards epigenetic memory against environmental perturbations. Our results suggest that the most prevalent type of spreading, driven by noncoding RNA-nucleators, is epigenetically unstable and requires collaboration with accessory elements to achieve high fidelity.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A quantitative physical model of the TMS-induced discharge artifacts in EEG</title>

The combination of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) with Electroencephalography (EEG) exposes the brain’s global response to localized and abrupt stimulations. However, large electric artifacts are induced in the EEG by the TMS, obscuring crucial stages of the brain’s response. Artifact removal is commonly performed by data processing techniques. However, an experimentally verified physical model for the origin and structure of the TMS-induced discharge artifacts, by which these methods can be justified or evaluated, is still lacking. We re-examine the known contribution of the skin in creating the artifacts, and outline a detailed model for the relaxation of the charge accumulated at the electrode-gel-skin interface due to the TMS pulse. We then experimentally validate implications set forth by the model. We find that the artifacts decay like a power law in time rather than the commonly assumed exponential. In fact, the skin creates a power-law decay of order 1 at each electrode, which is turned into a power law of order 2 by the reference electrode. We suggest an artifact removal method based on the model which can be applied from times after the pulse as short as 2 milliseconds onwards to expose the full EEG from the brain. The method can separate the capacitive discharge artifacts from those resulting from cranial muscle activation, demonstrating that the capacitive effect dominates at short times. Overall, our insight into the physical process allows us to accurately access TMS-evoked EEG responses that directly follow the TMS pulse, possibly opening new opportunities in TMS-EEG research.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EXQCGpRf8hI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Two Sides of the Same Coin: Distinct Sub-Bands in the Alpha Rhythm Reflect Facilitation and Suppression Mechanisms during Auditory Anticipatory Attention</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Anticipatory attention results in enhanced response to task-relevant stimulus, and reduced processing of unattended input, suggesting the deployment of distinct facilitatory and suppressive mechanisms. Alpha oscillations are a suitable candidate for supporting these mechanisms. We aimed to examine the role of alpha oscillations, with a special focus on peak frequencies, in facilitatory and suppressive mechanisms during auditory anticipation, within the auditory and visual regions. MEG data were collected from fourteen healthy young human adults (8 female) performing an auditory task in which spatial attention to sounds was manipulated by visual cues, either informative or not of the target side. By incorporating uninformative cues, we could delineate facilitating and suppressive mechanisms. During anticipation of a visually-cued auditory target, we observed a decrease in alpha power around 9Hz in the auditory cortices; and an increase around 13 Hz in the visual regions. Only this power increase in high alpha significantly correlated with behavior. Importantly, within the right auditory cortex, we showed a larger increase in high alpha power when attending an ipsilateral sound; and a stronger decrease in low alpha power when attending a contralateral sound. In summary, we found facilitatory and suppressive attentional mechanisms with distinct timing in task-relevant and task-irrelevant brain areas, differentially correlated to behavior and supported by distinct alpha sub-bands. We provide new insight into the role of the alpha peak-frequency by showing that anticipatory attention is supported by distinct facilitatory and suppressive mechanisms, mediated in different low and high sub-bands of the alpha rhythm, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; We investigated the role of alpha oscillations, with a special focus on peak frequencies, in facilitatory and suppressive mechanisms during anticipation, using MEG data collected during an auditory spatial attention task. We show, during anticipation of a visually-cued auditory target, a decrease in alpha power around 9Hz in the auditory cortices, simultaneous to an increase around 13 Hz in in the visual regions, the latter significantly correlated with behavioral performances. Within the right auditory cortex, we show a larger increase in high alpha when attending an ipsilateral sound; and a stronger decrease in low alpha when attending a contralateral sound. Therefore, anticipatory attention would be supported by distinct facilitatory and suppressive mechanisms, mediated in different low and high alpha sub-bands, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Estradiol Drives the Anorexigenic Activity of Proopiomelanocortin Neurons in Female Mice</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Energy balance is regulated by anorexigenic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and orexigenic neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide (NPY/AgRP) neurons of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus. POMC neurons make extensive projections and are thought to release both amino acid and peptide neurotransmitters. However, whether they communicate directly with NPY/AgRP neurons is debated. Initially, using single cell RT-PCR, we determined that mouse POMC&lt;sup&gt;eGFP&lt;/sup&gt; neurons express &lt;i&gt;Slc17a6&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Vglut2&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;Slc18a2&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Vmat2&lt;/i&gt;), but not &lt;i&gt;Slc31a1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Vgat&lt;/i&gt;) mRNA, suggesting glutamate and non-canonical GABA release. Quantitative RT-PCR of POMC&lt;sup&gt;eGFP&lt;/sup&gt; cells revealed that &lt;i&gt;Vglut2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Vmat2&lt;/i&gt; expression was significantly increased in E2- vs. oil-treated, ovariectomized (OVX) female mice. Since 17β-estradiol (E2) is anorexigenic, we hypothesized that an underlying mechanism was enhancement of POMC signaling. Therefore, we optogenetically stimulated POMC neurons in hypothalamic slices to examine evoked release of neurotransmitters onto NPY/AgRP neurons. Using brief light pulses we primarily observed glutamatergic currents and, based on the paired pulse ratio, determined that release probability was higher in E2- vs oil-treated, OVX female, congruent with increased &lt;i&gt;Vlgut2&lt;/i&gt; expression. Moreover, bath perfusion of the Gq-coupled membrane estrogen receptor agonist STX recapitulated the effects of E2 treatment. In addition, high frequency (20 Hz) stimulation generated a slow outward current that reversed near E&lt;sub&gt;k+&lt;/sub&gt; and was antagonized by naloxone, indicative of β-endorphin release. Furthermore, individual NPY/AgRP neurons were found to express &lt;i&gt;Oprm1,&lt;/i&gt; the transcript for μ-opioid receptor, and DAMGO, a selective agonist, elicited an outward current. Therefore, POMC excitability and neurotransmission are enhanced by E2, which would facilitate decreased food consumption through marked inhibition of NPY/AgRP neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus sense the energy state of an animal and regulate satiety to maintain homeostasis. Neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide (NPY/AgRP) neurons also participate in energy balance, but instead drive hunger. Disruptions in this circuit can promote the development of obesity, which frequently occurs during menopause due to the loss of estrogens. The primary female sex hormone, 17β-estradiol (E2) exerts an anorexigenic effect, decreasing food intake and increasing activity. These behavioral changes are mediated, in part, through inhibition of NPY/AgRP and potentiation of POMC signaling. For the first time we report that POMC neurons provide direct input to NPY/AgRP neurons primarily through glutamate and β-endorphin release. Furthermore, E2 enhances POMC neurotransmission to inhibit NPY/AgRP neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Functional Connectivity of Chronic Cocaine Use Reveals Progressive Neuroadaptations in Neocortical, Striatal and Limbic Networks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0081-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Brain imaging studies indicate that chronic cocaine users display altered functional connectivity between prefrontal cortical, thalamic, striatal, and limbic regions; however, the use of cross-sectional designs in these studies precludes measuring baseline brain activity prior to cocaine use. Animal studies can circumvent this limitation by comparing functional connectivity between baseline and various time points after chronic cocaine use. In the present study, adult male Long-Evans rats were trained to self-administer cocaine intravenously for 6-hour daily sessions over 14 consecutive days. Two additional groups serving as controls underwent sucrose self-administration or exposure to the test chambers alone. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was conducted before self-administration and after 1 and 14 days of abstinence (1d and 14d Abs). At 1d Abs from cocaine, there was increased clustering coefficient in brain areas involved in reward seeking, learning, memory, and autonomic and affective processing, including amygdala, hypothalamus, striatum, hippocampus and thalamus. Similar changes in clustering coefficient after 1d Abs from sucrose were evident in predominantly thalamic brain regions. Notably, there were no changes in strength of functional connectivity at 1d or 14d after either cocaine or sucrose self-administration. The results suggest that cocaine and sucrose can change the arrangement of functional connectivity of brain regions involved in cognition and emotion, but that these changes dissipate across the early stages of abstinence. The study also emphasizes the importance of including baseline measures in longitudinal functional neuroimaging designs seeking to assess functional connectivity in the context of substance use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Although human neuroimaging studies have been invaluable in understanding the relationship between cocaine use and brain functional connectivity, they inherently lack pre-drug baseline information important to establish how cocaine use alters regional interactions. Coupling neuroimaging with rodent models of cocaine self-administration circumvents this issue by controlling variables that can confound human studies and providing pre-drug baseline information. Using such an approach, this study reveals that after cocaine use, functional connectivity patterns change as a function of abstinence duration and that these changes are observed in networks supporting reward and emotion-related cognition and behavior. These findings highlight the importance of using multiple timepoints in preclinical models of substance use to assess effects on functional connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Surge release of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) is essential in the activation of pituitary gonadal unit at proestrus afternoon preceded by the rise of serum 17β-estradiol level during positive feedback period. Here we describe a mechanism of positive estradiol feedback regulation acting directly on GnRH-GFP neurons of mice. Whole cell clamp and loose patch recordings revealed that a high physiological dose of estradiol (200 pM), significantly increased firing rate at proestrus afternoon. The mPSC frequency at proestrus afternoon also increased, whereas decreased it at metestrus afternoon, and had no effect at proestrus morning. Inhibition of the estrogen receptor beta (ERβ), intracellular blockade of the Src kinase and PI3K and scavenge of nitric oxide inside GnRH neurons prevented the facilitatory estradiol effect indicating involvement of the ERβ/Src/PI3K/Akt/nNOS pathway in this fast, direct stimulatory effect. Immunohistochemistry localized soluble guanylate cyclase, the main nitric oxide receptor, in both glutamatergic and GABAergic terminals innervating GnRH neurons. Accordingly, estradiol facilitated neurotransmissions to GnRH neurons via both GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;-R and glutamate/AMPA/kainate-R. These results indicate that estradiol acts directly on GnRH neurons via the ERβ/Akt/nNOS pathway at proestrus afternoon generating nitric oxide that retrogradely accelerates GABA and glutamate release from the presynaptic terminals contacting GnRH neurons. The newly explored mechanism might contribute to the regulation of the GnRH surge, a fundamental prerequisite of the ovulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; One of the major reasons of infertility is the failure in ovulation. Therefore, understanding of the neuronal processes resulting in proper ovulation is indispensable. Although hypothalamic GnRH neurons are regarded the master-neurons orchestrating reproduction, most of the relevant papers have suggested so far, that the estradiol positive feedback (indispensable for ovulation) acts in these neurons mostly indirectly, via hypothalamic nuclei free of GnRH neurons. Now we have presented strong evidence that estradiol exerts fast direct stimulatory action in GnRH neurons during the positive feedback, by activating retrograde nitric-oxide signaling to accelerate excitatory synaptic inputs to GnRH neurons. In addition, we suggest a putative mechanism, whereby indirect and direct actions of estradiol can work in concert regulating GnRH neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Characterization of Tissue Plasminogen Activator Expression and Trafficking in the Adult Murine Brain</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is an immediate-early gene important for regulating physiological processes like synaptic plasticity and neurovascular coupling. It has also been implicated in several pathological processes including blood-brain barrier permeability, seizure progression, and stroke. These varied reports suggest that tPA is a pleiotropic mediator whose actions are highly compartmentalized in space and time. The specific localization of tPA, therefore, can provide useful information about its function. Accordingly, the goal of this study was to provide a detailed characterization of tPA’s regional, cellular, and subcellular localization in the brain. To achieve this, two new transgenic mouse lines were utilized: (1) a PlatβGAL reporter mouse, which houses the β-galactosidase gene in the tPA locus and (2) a tPA&lt;sup&gt;BAC&lt;/sup&gt;-Cerulean mouse, which has a cerulean-fluorescent protein fused in-frame to the tPA C-terminus. Using these two transgenic reporters, we show that while tPA is expressed throughout most regions of the adult murine brain, it appears to be preferentially targeted to fiber tracts in the limbic system. In the hippocampus, confocal microscopy revealed tPA-Cerulean (tPA-Cer) puncta localized to giant mossy fiber boutons and astrocytes in stratum lucidum. With amplification of the tPA-Cer signal, somatically localized tPA was also observed in the stratum oriens/alveus layer of both CA1 and CA3 subfields. Co-immunostaining of tPA-Cer and interneuronal markers indicates that these tPA-positive cell bodies belong to a subclass of somatostatin/oriens-lacunosum moleculare interneurons. Together, these data imply that tPA’s localization is differentially regulated, suggesting that its neuromodulatory effects may be compartmentalized and specialized to cell-type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The serine protease tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has been shown to modulate numerous neurologic processes including synaptic plasticity and neurodegeneration. Many of the functional conclusions drawn about tPA activity, however, have not been affirmed by high-resolution, imaging analysis of tPA localization. To address these shortcomings, we used two new transgenic reporter mice to provide a detailed characterization of tPA expression in the adult murine brain. A comparison of these reporter mice demonstrates a differential expression pattern between the sites of tPA synthesis and its targeted localization in the hippocampus, amygdala, and basal ganglia. Moreover, colocalization and co-expression analysis reveals that tPA is primarily trafficked to pre-synaptic structures and that it’s predominant somatic and/or axonal localization is cell-type specific.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>A majority of emerging infectious diseases in humans are zoonoses. Understanding factors that influence the emergence and transmission of zoonoses is pivotal for their prevention and control. Toxoplasma gondii is one of the most widespread zoonotic pathogens known today. Whereas only a few genotypes of T. gondii dominate in the...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/BEn8igcImNc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Weeds, which have been the bane of agriculture since the beginning of civilization, are managed manually, mechanically, and, more recently, by chemicals. However, chemical control options are rapidly shrinking due to the recent rise in the number of herbicide-resistant weeds in crop fields, with few alternatives on the horizon. Therefore,...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/4YuK95gA_eU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>N-acyl amino acids (NAAs) are a structurally diverse class of bioactive signaling lipids whose endogenous functions have largely remained uncharacterized. To clarify the physiologic roles of NAAs, we generated mice deficient in the circulating enzyme peptidase M20 domain-containing 1 (PM20D1). Global PM20D1-KO mice have dramatically reduced NAA hydrolase/synthase activities in...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/dQppU1t_mvc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Exosomes, abundant in blood, deliver various molecules to recipient cells. Endothelial cells are directly exposed to circulating substances. However, how endothelial cells respond to serum exosomes (SExos) and the implications in diabetes-associated vasculopathy have never been explored.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal and glial cells release diverse proteoglycans and glycoproteins,
which aggregate in the extracellular space and form the extracellular matrix
(ECM) that may in turn regulate major cellular functions. Brain cells also
release extracellular proteases that may degrade the ECM, and both synthesis
and degradation of ECM are activity-dependent. In this study we introduce a
mathematical model describing population dynamics of neurons interacting with
ECM molecules over extended timescales. It is demonstrated that depending on
the prevalent biophysical mechanism of ECM-neuronal interactions, different
dynamical regimes of ECM activity can be observed, including bistable states
with stable stationary levels of ECM molecule concentration, spontaneous ECM
oscillations, and coexistence of ECM oscillations and a stationary state,
allowing dynamical switches between activity regimes.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: True Contextuality Beats Direct Influences in Human Decision Making. (arXiv:1807.05684v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In quantum physics there are well-known situations when measurements of the
same property in different contexts (under different conditions) have the same
probability distribution, but cannot be represented by one and the same random
variable. Such systems of random variables are called contextual. More
generally, true contextuality is observed when different contexts force
measurements of the same property (in psychology, responses to the same
question) to be more dissimilar random variables than warranted by the
difference of their distributions. The difference in distributions is itself a
form of context-dependence, but of another nature: it is attributable to direct
causal influences exerted by contexts upon the random variables. We present a
series of crowdsourcing experiments that reveal true contextuality in human
decision making. Their analysis is based on the Contextuality-by-Default (CbD)
theory, one that allows one to separate true contextuality from direct
influences in the overall context-dependence. The design of our experiments is
an elaboration of one introduced in the &quot;Snow Queen&quot; experiment (Decision 5,
193-204, 2018), where contextuality was for the first time demonstrated
unequivocally. The CbD analysis of many previous attempts to demonstrate
contextuality in human judgments shows that they were unsuccessful because
direct influences in them were all one needed to account for
context-dependence.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human-machine interactions are being increasingly explored to create
alternative ways of communication and to improve our daily life. Based on a
classification of the user's intention from the user's underlying neural
activity, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow direct interactions with the
external environment while bypassing the traditional effector of the
musculoskeletal system. Despite the enormous potential of BCIs, there are still
a number of challenges that limit their societal impact, ranging from the
correct decoding of a human's thoughts, to the application of effective
learning strategies. Despite several important engineering advances, the basic
neuroscience behind these challenges remains poorly explored. Indeed, BCIs
involve complex dynamic changes related to neural plasticity at a diverse range
of spatiotemporal scales. One promising antidote to this complexity lies in
network science, which provides a natural language in which to model the
organizational principles of brain architecture and function as manifest in its
interconnectivity. Here, we briefly review the main limitations currently
affecting BCIs, and we offer our perspective on how they can be addressed by
means of network theoretic approaches. We posit that the emerging field of
network neuroscience will prove to be an effective tool to unlock human-machine
interactions.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Towards Modeling the Interaction of Spatial-Associative Neural Network Representations for Multisensory Perception. (arXiv:1807.05222v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Our daily perceptual experience is driven by different neural mechanisms that
yield multisensory interaction as the interplay between exogenous stimuli and
endogenous expectations. While the interaction of multisensory cues according
to their spatiotemporal properties and the formation of multisensory
feature-based representations have been widely studied, the interaction of
spatial-associative neural representations has received considerably less
attention. In this paper, we propose a neural network architecture that models
the interaction of spatial-associative representations to perform causal
inference of audiovisual stimuli. We investigate the spatial alignment of
exogenous audiovisual stimuli modulated by associative congruence. In the
spatial layer, topographically arranged networks account for the interaction of
audiovisual input in terms of population codes. In the associative layer,
congruent audiovisual representations are obtained via the experience-driven
development of feature-based associations. Levels of congruency are obtained as
a by-product of the neurodynamics of self-organizing networks, where the amount
of neural activation triggered by the input can be expressed via a nonlinear
distance function. Our novel proposal is that activity-driven levels of
congruency can be used as top-down modulatory projections to spatially
distributed representations of sensory input, e.g. semantically related
audiovisual pairs will yield a higher level of integration than unrelated
pairs. Furthermore, levels of neural response in unimodal layers may be seen as
sensory reliability for the dynamic weighting of crossmodal cues. We describe a
series of planned experiments to validate our model in the tasks of
multisensory interaction on the basis of semantic congruence and unimodal cue
reliability.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The human brain is capable of diverse feats of intelligence. A particularly
salient example is the ability to deduce structure from time-varying auditory
and visual stimuli, enabling humans to master the rules of language and to
build rich expectations of their physical environment. The broad relevance of
this ability for human cognition motivates the need for a first-principles
model explicating putative mechanisms. Here we propose a general framework for
structural learning in the brain, composed of an evolving, high-dimensional
dynamical system driven by external stimuli or internal processes. We
operationalize the scenario in which humans learn the rules that generate a
sequence of stimuli, rather than the exemplar stimuli themselves. We model
external stimuli as seemingly disordered chaotic time series generated by
complex dynamical systems; the underlying structure being deduced is then that
of the corresponding chaotic attractor. This approach allows us to demonstrate
and theoretically explain the emergence of five distinct phenomena reminiscent
of cognitive functions: (i) learning the structure of a chaotic system purely
from time series, (ii) generating new streams of stimuli from a chaotic system,
(iii) switching stream generation among multiple learned chaotic systems,
either spontaneously or in response to external perturbations, (iv) inferring
missing data from sparse observations of the chaotic system, and (v)
deciphering superimposed input from different chaotic systems. Numerically, we
show that these phenomena emerge naturally from a recurrent neural network of
Erdos-Renyi topology in which the synaptic strengths adapt in a Hebbian-like
manner. Broadly, our work blends chaotic theory and artificial neural networks
to answer the long standing question of how neural systems can learn the
structure underlying temporal sequences of stimuli.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Duc Do, Serdar Bozdag&lt;/p&gt;

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) inhibit expression of target genes by binding to their RNA transcripts. It has been recently shown that RNA transcripts targeted by the same miRNA could “compete” for the miRNA molecules and thereby indirectly regulate each other. Experimental evidence has suggested that the aberration of such miRNA-mediated interaction between RNAs—called competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) interaction—can play important roles in tumorigenesis. Given the difficulty of deciphering context-specific miRNA binding, and the existence of various gene regulatory factors such as DNA methylation and copy number alteration, inferring context-specific ceRNA interactions accurately is a computationally challenging task. Here we propose a computational method called Cancerin to identify cancer-associated ceRNA interactions. Cancerin incorporates DNA methylation, copy number alteration, gene and miRNA expression datasets to construct cancer-specific ceRNA networks. We applied Cancerin to three cancer datasets from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. Our results indicated that ceRNAs were enriched with cancer-related genes, and ceRNA modules in the inferred ceRNA networks were involved in cancer-associated biological processes. Using LINCS-L1000 shRNA-mediated gene knockdown experiment in breast cancer cell line to assess accuracy, Cancerin was able to predict expression outcome of ceRNA genes with high accuracy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/blL43-YkQ6E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The Band 3 (AE1, SLC4A1) membrane protein is found in red blood cells and in kidney where it functions as an electro-neutral chloride/bicarbonate exchanger. In this study, we have used molecular dynamics simulations to provide the first realistic model of the dimeric membrane domain of human Band 3 in an asymmetric lipid bilayer containing a full complement of phospholipids, including phosphatidylinositol 4,5–bisphosphate (PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and cholesterol, and its partner membrane protein Glycophorin A (GPA). The simulations show that the annular layer in the inner leaflet surrounding Band 3 was enriched in phosphatidylserine and PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules. Cholesterol was also enriched around Band 3 but also at the dimer interface. The interaction of these lipids with specific sites on Band 3 may play a role in the folding and function of this anion transport membrane protein. GPA associates with Band 3 to form the Wright (Wr) blood group antigen, an interaction that involves an ionic bond between Glu658 in Band 3 and Arg61 in GPA. We were able to recreate this complex by performing simulations to allow the dimeric transmembrane portion of GPA to interact with Band 3 in a model membrane. Large-scale simulations showed that the GPA dimer can bridge Band 3 dimers resulting in the dynamic formation of long strands of alternating Band 3 and GPA dimers.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Kfh8ScEBncs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The incidence of cardiac arrhythmias is known to be associated with tissue heterogeneities including fibrosis. However, the impact of microscopic structural heterogeneities on conduction in excitable tissues remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated how acellular microheterogeneities affect macroscopic conduction under conditions of normal and reduced excitability by utilizing a novel platform of paired &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; studies to examine the mechanisms of conduction. Regular patterns of nonconductive micro-obstacles were created in confluent monolayers of the previously described engineered-excitable Ex293 cell line. Increasing the relative ratio of obstacle size to intra-obstacle strand width resulted in significant conduction slowing up to 23.6% and a significant increase in wavefront curvature anisotropy, a measure of spatial variation in wavefront shape. Changes in bulk electrical conductivity and in path tortuosity were insufficient to explain these observed macroscopic changes. Rather, microscale behaviors including local conduction slowing due to microscale branching, and conduction acceleration due to wavefront merging were shown to contribute to macroscopic phenomena. Conditions of reduced excitability led to further conduction slowing and a reversal of wavefront curvature anisotropy due to spatially non-uniform effects on microscopic slowing and acceleration. This unique experimental and computation platform provided critical mechanistic insights in the impact of microscopic heterogeneities on macroscopic conduction, pertinent to settings of fibrotic heart disease.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-2oVZ0teIoQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The neurodegenerative Huntington’s disease (HD) is caused by a polyglutamine (polyQ) amplification in the huntingtin protein (HTT). Currently there is no effective therapy available for HD; however, several efforts are directed to develop and optimize HTT lowering methods to improve HD phenotypes. To validate these approaches, there is an immediate need for reliable, sensitive and easily accessible methods to quantify HTT expression. Using the AlphaLISA platform we developed two novel sensitive and robust assays for quantification of HTT in biological samples using commercially available antibodies. The first, a polyQ independent assay, measures the total pool of HTT; whilst the second, a polyQ dependent assay, preferentially detects the mutant form of HTT. Using purified HTT protein standards and brain homogenates from an HD mouse model, we determine a lower limit of quantification of 1 and 3 pM and optimal reproducibility with CV values lower than 7% for intra- and 20% for inter-assay. In addition, we used the assays to quantify HTT in neural stem cells generated from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and in human brain tissue lysates. Finally, we could detect changes in HTT levels in a mouse model where mutant HTT was conditionally deleted in neural tissue, verifying the potential to monitor the outcome of HTT lowering strategies. This analytical platform is ideal for high-throughput screens and thus has an added value for the HD community as a tool to optimize novel therapeutic approaches aimed at modulating HTT protein levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The HTT lowering approaches are widely investigated as possible therapies for HD. to support these strategies, there is a high need for reproducible and sensitive assays able to quantify HTT protein. In this study we describe two robust and sensitive assays based on the AlphaLISA platform, which are able to measure either the pool of wild-type and mutant HTT, polyQ independent assay, or preferentially mutant HTT, polyQ dependent assay, in biological samples. These assays constitute a very valuable tool for HD research as they apply readily accessible antibodies and have a simple implementation. Furthermore, the HTT AlphaLISA assays are suitable for use in high throughput studies and potentially could be multiplexed to monitor simultaneously different forms of HTT.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Individual Differences in Motor Noise and Adaptation Rate Are Optimally Related</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Individual variations in motor adaptation rate were recently shown to correlate with movement variability or &quot;motor noise&quot; in a forcefield adaptation task. However, this finding could not be replicated in a meta-analysis of adaptation experiments. Possibly, this inconsistency stems from noise being composed of distinct components which relate to adaptation rate in different ways. Indeed, previous modeling and electrophysiological studies have suggested that motor noise can be factored into planning noise, originating from the brain, and execution noise, stemming from the periphery. Were the motor system optimally tuned to these noise sources, planning noise would correlate positively with adaptation rate and execution noise would correlate negatively with adaptation rate, a phenomenon familiar in Kalman filters. To test this prediction, we performed a visuomotor adaptation experiment in 69 subjects. Using a novel Bayesian fitting procedure, we succeeded in applying the well-established state-space model of adaptation to individual data. We found that adaptation rate correlates positively with planning noise (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;  =  0.44; 95%HDI=[0.27 0.59]) and negatively with execution noise (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; = -0.39; 95%HDI=[-0.50 -0.30]). In addition, the steady-state Kalman gain calculated from planning and execution noise correlated positively with adaptation rate (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.54; 95%HDI = [0.38 0.66]). These results suggest that motor adaptation is tuned to approximate optimal learning, consistent with the &quot;optimal control&quot; framework that has been used to explain motor control. Since motor adaptation is thought to be a largely cerebellar process, the results further suggest the sensitivity of the cerebellum to both planning noise and execution noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Our study shows that the adaptation rate is optimally tuned to planning noise and execution noise across individuals. This suggests that motor adaptation is tuned to approximate optimal learning, consistent with &quot;optimal control&quot; approaches to understanding the motor system. In addition, our results imply sensitivity of the cerebellum to both planning noise and execution noise, an idea not previously considered. Finally, our Bayesian statistical approach represents a powerful, novel method for fitting the well-established state-space models that could have an influence on the methodology of the field.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Heterogeneous inputs to central pattern generators can shape insect gaits. (arXiv:1807.05142v1 [math.DS])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05142</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05142</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In our previous work, we studied an interconnected bursting neuron model for
insect locomotion, and its corresponding phase oscillator model, which at high
speed can generate stable tripod gaits with three legs off the ground
simultaneously in swing, and at low speed can generate stable tetrapod gaits
with two legs off the ground simultaneously in swing. However, at low speed
several other stable locomotion patterns, that are not typically observed as
insect gaits, may coexist. In the present paper, by adding heterogeneous
external input to each oscillator, we modify the bursting neuron model so that
its corresponding phase oscillator model produces only one stable gait at each
speed, specifically: a unique stable tetrapod gait at low speed, a unique
stable tripod gait at high speed, and a unique branch of stable transition
gaits connecting them. This suggests that control signals originating in the
brain and central nervous system can modify gait patterns.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Local learning rules to attenuate forgetting in neural networks. (arXiv:1807.05097v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05097</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05097</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hebbian synaptic plasticity inevitably leads to interference and forgetting
when different, overlapping memory patterns are sequentially stored in the same
network. Recent work on artificial neural networks shows that an
information-geometric approach can be used to protect important weights to slow
down forgetting. This strategy however is biologically implausible as it
requires knowledge of the history of previously learned patterns. In this work,
we show that a purely local weight consolidation mechanism, based on estimating
energy landscape curvatures from locally available statistics, prevents pattern
interference. Exploring a local calculation of energy curvature in the
sparse-coding limit, we demonstrate that curvature-aware learning rules reduce
forgetting in the Hopfield network. We further show that this method connects
information-geometric global learning rules based on the Fisher information to
local spike-dependent rules accessible to biological neural networks. We
conjecture that, if combined with other learning procedures, it could provide a
building-block for content-aware learning strategies that use only quantities
computable in biological neural networks to attenuate pattern interference and
catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, this work clarifies how global
information-geometric structure in a learning problem can be exposed in local
model statistics, building a deeper theoretical connection between the
statistics of single units in a network, and the global structure of the
collective learning space.

To study synaptic plasticity in human neuronal circuits poses a huge challenge, since live human neurons and synapses are not readily accessible. Despite this, various lines of research have provided insights in properties of adult human synapses and their plasticity both &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;, with some unexpected surprises. We first discuss the experimental approaches to study activity-dependent plasticity of adult human synapses, and then highlight rules and mechanisms of Hebbian spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) found in these synapses. Finally, we conclude with thoughts on how these synaptic principles can underlie human learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: miRAW: A deep learning-based approach to predict microRNA targets by analyzing whole microRNA transcripts</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006185</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Albert Pla, Xiangfu Zhong, Simon Rayner&lt;/p&gt;

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by binding to partially complementary regions within the 3’UTR of their target genes. Computational methods play an important role in target prediction and assume that the miRNA “seed region” (nt 2 to 8) is required for functional targeting, but typically only identify ∼80% of known bindings. Recent studies have highlighted a role for the entire miRNA, suggesting that a more flexible methodology is needed. We present a novel approach for miRNA target prediction based on Deep Learning (DL) which, rather than incorporating any knowledge (such as seed regions), investigates the entire miRNA and 3’TR mRNA nucleotides to learn a uninhibited set of feature descriptors related to the targeting process. We collected more than 150,000 experimentally validated homo sapiens miRNA:gene targets and cross referenced them with different CLIP-Seq, CLASH and iPAR-CLIP datasets to obtain ∼20,000 validated miRNA:gene exact target sites. Using this data, we implemented and trained a deep neural network—composed of autoencoders and a feed-forward network—able to automatically learn features describing miRNA-mRNA interactions and assess functionality. Predictions were then refined using information such as site location or site accessibility energy. In a comparison using independent datasets, our DL approach consistently outperformed existing prediction methods, recognizing the seed region as a common feature in the targeting process, but also identifying the role of pairings outside this region. Thermodynamic analysis also suggests that site accessibility plays a role in targeting but that it cannot be used as a sole indicator for functionality.

	<title>RSS PAP: Selective Effects of the Loss of NMDA or mGluR5 Receptors in the Reward System on Adaptive Decision-Making</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Selecting the most advantageous actions in a changing environment is a central feature of adaptive behavior. The midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons along with the major targets of their projections, including dopaminoceptive neurons in the frontal cortex and basal ganglia, play a key role in this process. Here, we investigate the consequences of a selective genetic disruption of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and metabotropic glutamate 5 (mGluR5) receptors in the DA system on adaptive choice behavior, in mice. We tested the effects of the mutation on performance in the probabilistic reinforcement learning and probability discounting tasks. In case of the probabilistic choice, both the loss of NMDA receptors in dopaminergic neurons or loss mGluR5 receptors in D1 receptor-expressing dopaminoceptive neurons reduced the probability of selecting the more rewarded alternative and lowered the likelihood of returning to the previously rewarded alternative (win-stay). When observed behavior was fitted to reinforcement learning models, we found that these two mutations were associated with reduced effect of expected outcome on choice, i.e. more random choices. None of the mutations affected probability discounting, which indicates that all animals had normal ability to assess probability. However, in both behavioral tasks animals with targeted loss of NMDA receptors in dopaminergic neurons or mGluR5 receptors in D1 neurons were significantly slower to perform choices. In conclusion, these results show that glutamate receptor-dependent signaling in the DA system is essential for the speed and accuracy of choices, but at the same time probably not critical for correct estimation of probable outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; We investigated the role of glutamate signaling in the brain’s reward system in adaptive decision-making. We used genetically modified mice with disruption of glutamate signaling, that was caused by deletion of glutamate receptors in dopamine-producing and dopamine-sensitive neurons. When mutant mice were offered a choice between two alternatives with varying chances of being rewarded, the mutations decreased the probability of selecting the more often rewarded alternative, and the likelihood of repeating previously rewarded choice. Moreover, mutant animals were much slower in performing choices. Our results show that when glutamate signaling in the reward system is disrupted, it causes an impairment in decision-making, by increasing randomness and reducing the speed of decision-making process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Conflicted between Goal-Directed and Habitual Control - an fMRI Investigation</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;&quot;Slips of action&quot; occur in everyday life when we momentarily lose sight of a goal (for example when in a rush or distracted). Associative models propose that these habitual responses can be activated via a direct stimulus-response mechanism, regardless of the current hedonic value of the outcome. The slips-of-action task (SOAT) has been extensively used in both healthy and pathological populations to measure habit tendencies – the likelihood of making erroneous responses for devalued outcomes. Inspection of behavioral performance does not reveal, however, whether the impairments were due to impaired goal-directed control or aberrantly strong habit formation. In the current study we used functional MRI while human participants performed both the instrumental training and SOAT test phases, to elucidate the relative contributions of these mechanisms to performance on the SOAT. On trials in which conflict arises between competing goal-directed and habitual responses we observed increased activation across areas including the anterior cingulate cortex, paracingulate gyrus, lateral OFC, insula and inferior frontal gyrus. Responding for devalued outcomes was related to increased activation in the premotor cortex and cerebellum – implicating these regions in habitual responding. Increased activation in the caudate, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and frontal pole during training was associated with better performance during the test phase, indicative of goal-directed action control. These results endorse interpretation of the SOAT in terms of competing goal-directed and habitual mechanisms and highlight that cognitive control processes present an additional bottleneck for successful performance on this task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Imagine that you step in the car intending to drive to your new office but distracted, end up driving the route to your old office instead. We are all familiar with the feeling that results from inadvertently carrying out a previously valid behavior, even if we no longer desire the consequence. In the current study we examined how the brain reacts to cues that signal a previously rewarded response whose outcome value has now changed. We were also able to identify the brain regions that were activated when participants made an erroneous (habitual) response under time-pressure. These results give us a richer sense of how the brain acts to control behavior when goal-directed processes are otherwise engaged.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Sequential sampling models have provided a dominant theoretical framework guiding computational and neurophysiological investigations of perceptual decision-making. While these models share the basic principle that decisions are formed by accumulating sensory evidence to a bound, they come in many forms that can make similar predictions of choice behaviour despite invoking fundamentally different mechanisms. The identification of neural signals that reflect some of the core computations underpinning decision formation offers new avenues for empirically testing and refining key model assumptions.</description>

	<description>The central nervous system is not a static, hard-wired organ. Examples of neuroplasticity, whether at the level of the synapse, the cell, or within and between circuits, can be found during development, throughout the progression of disease, or after injury. One essential component of the molecular, anatomical, and functional changes associated with neuroplasticity is the spinal interneuron (SpIN). Here, we draw on recent multidisciplinary studies to identify and interrogate subsets of SpINs and their roles in locomotor and respiratory circuits.</description>

Direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) for hepatitis C treatment tend to fare better in individuals who are also likely to respond well to interferon-alpha (IFN), a surprising correlation given that DAAs target specific viral proteins whereas IFN triggers a generic antiviral immune response. Here, we posit a causal relationship between IFN-responsiveness and DAA treatment outcome. IFN-responsiveness restricts viral replication, which would prevent the growth of viral variants resistant to DAAs and improve treatment outcome. To test this hypothesis, we developed a multiscale mathematical model integrating IFN-responsiveness at the cellular level, viral kinetics and evolution leading to drug resistance at the individual level, and treatment outcome at the population level. Model predictions quantitatively captured data from over 50 clinical trials demonstrating poorer response to DAAs in previous non-responders to IFN than treatment-naïve individuals, presenting strong evidence supporting the hypothesis. Model predictions additionally described several unexplained clinical observations, viz., the percentages of infected individuals who 1) spontaneously clear HCV, 2) get chronically infected but respond to IFN-based therapy, and 3) fail IFN-based therapy but respond to DAA-based therapy, resulting in a comprehensive understanding of HCV infection and treatment. An implication of the causal relationship is that failure of DAA-based treatments may be averted by adding IFN, a strategy of potential use in settings with limited access to DAAs. A second, wider implication is that individuals with greater IFN-responsiveness would require shorter DAA-based treatment durations, presenting a basis and a promising population for response-guided therapy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-YZvCWuoO10&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Functional Recovery of a Locomotor Network after Injury: Plasticity beyond the Central Nervous System</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Many animals depend on descending information from the brain for the initiation and proper execution of locomotion. Interestingly, after injury and the loss of such inputs, locomotor function can sometimes be regained without the regrowth of central connections. In the medicinal leech, &lt;i&gt;Hirudo verbana&lt;/i&gt;, we have shown that crawling reemerges after removal of descending inputs. Here, we studied the mechanisms underlying this return of locomotion by asking if central pattern generators (CPGs) in crawl-recovered leeches are sufficient to produce crawl-specific intersegmental coordination. From recovered animals, we treated isolated chains of ganglia with dopamine to activate the crawl CPGs (one crawl CPG per ganglion) and observed fictive crawl-like bursting in the dorsal-longitudinal-excitor motoneuron (DE-3), an established crawl-monitor neuron. However, these preparations did not exhibit crawl-specific coordination across the CPGs. Although the crawl CPGs always generated bidirectional activation of adjacent CPGs, we never observed crawl-appropriate intersegmental phase delays. Because central circuits alone were unable to organize crawl-specific coordination, we tested the coordinating role of the peripheral nervous system. In transected leeches normally destined for recovery, we removed afferent information to the anterior-most (lead) ganglion located below the nerve-cord transection site. In these dually treated animals, overt crawling was greatly delayed or prevented. After filling the peripheral nerves with Neurobiotin tracer distal to the nerve-root lesion, we found a perfect correlation between regrowth of peripheral neuronal fibers and crawl recovery. Our study establishes that during recovery after injury, crawl-specific intersegmental coordination switches to a new dependence on afferent information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Our understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of learning and behavior relies on the use of invasive techniques, which necessitate the use of animal models. However, when different species learn the same task, to what degree are they actually producing the same behavior and engaging homologous neural circuitry? This question has received virtually no recent attention, even as the most powerful new methodologies for measuring and perturbing the nervous system have become increasingly dependent on the use of murine species. Here, we test humans, rats, monkeys, and an evolutionarily intermediate species, tree shrews, on a three alternative, forced choice, visual contrast discrimination task. As anticipated, learning rate, peak performance, and transfer across contrasts was lower in the rat compared to the other species. More interestingly, rats exhibited two major behavioral peculiarities: while monkeys and tree shrews based their choices largely on visual information, rats tended to base their choices on past reward history. Furthermore, as the task became more difficult, rats largely disengaged from the visual stimulus, reverting to innate spatial predispositions in order to collect rewards near chance probability. Our findings highlight the limitation of muridae as models for translational research, at least in the area of visually based decision making.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Genetic Control of Myelin Plasticity after Chronic Psychosocial Stress</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Anxiety disorders often manifest in genetically susceptible individuals after psychosocial stress, but the mechanisms underlying these gene-environment interactions are largely unknown. We used the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) mouse model to study resilience and susceptibility to chronic psychosocial stress. We identified a strong genetic background effect in CSDS-induced social avoidance (SA) using four inbred mouse strains: 69% of C57BL/6NCrl (B6), 23% of BALB/cAnNCrl, 19% of 129S2/SvPasCrl, and 5% of DBA/2NCrl (D2) mice were stress resilient. Furthermore, different inbred mouse strains responded differently to stress, suggesting they use distinct coping strategies. To identify biological pathways affected by CSDS, we used RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of three brain regions of two strains, B6 and D2: medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), ventral hippocampus (vHPC), and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). We discovered overrepresentation of oligodendrocyte (OLG)-related genes in the differentially expressed gene population. Because OLGs myelinate axons, we measured myelin thickness and found significant region and strain-specific differences. For example, in resilient D2 mice, mPFC axons had thinner myelin than controls, whereas susceptible B6 mice had thinner myelin than controls in the vHPC. Neither myelin-related gene expression in several other regions nor corpus callosum thickness differed between stressed and control animals. Our unbiased gene expression experiment suggests that myelin plasticity is a substantial response to chronic psychosocial stress, varies across brain regions, and is genetically controlled. Identification of genetic regulators of the myelin response will provide mechanistic insight into the molecular basis of stress-related diseases, such as anxiety disorders, a critical step in developing targeted therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Synaptic Mechanisms for Bandwidth Tuning in Awake Mouse Primary Auditory Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy165</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Spatial size tuning in the visual cortex has been considered as an important neuronal functional property for sensory perception. However, an analogous mechanism in the auditory system has remained controversial. In the present study, cell-attached recordings in the primary auditory cortex (A1) of awake mice revealed that excitatory neurons can be categorized into three types according to their bandwidth tuning profiles in response to band-passed noise (BPN) stimuli: nonmonotonic (NM), flat, and monotonic, with the latter two considered as non-tuned for bandwidth. The prevalence of bandwidth-tuned (i.e., NM) neurons increases significantly from layer 4 to layer 2/3. With sequential cell-attached and whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from the same neurons, we found that the bandwidth preference of excitatory neurons is largely determined by the excitatory synaptic input they receive, and that the bandwidth selectivity is further enhanced by flatly tuned inhibition observed in all cells. The latter can be attributed at least partially to the flat tuning of parvalbumin inhibitory neurons. The tuning of auditory cortical neurons for bandwidth of BPN may contribute to the processing of complex sounds.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Heritability of Regional Brain Volumes in Large-Scale Neuroimaging and Genetic Studies</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Brain genetics is an active research area. The degree to which genetic variants impact variations in brain structure and function remains largely unknown. We examined the heritability of regional brain volumes (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; ~ 100) captured by single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in UK Biobank (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; ~ 9000). We found that regional brain volumes are highly heritable in this study population and common genetic variants can explain up to 80% of their variabilities (median heritability 34.8%). We observed omnigenic impact across the genome and examined the enrichment of SNPs in active chromatin regions. Principal components derived from regional volume data are also highly heritable, but the amount of variance in brain volume explained by the component did not seem to be related to its heritability. Heritability estimates vary substantially across large-scale functional networks, exhibit a symmetric pattern across left and right hemispheres, and are consistent in females and males (correlation = 0.638). We repeated the main analysis in Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; ~ 1100), Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; ~ 600), and Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; ~ 500) datasets, which demonstrated that more stable estimates can be obtained from the UK Biobank.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Open Access: Audio-Tactile and Peripersonal Space Processing Around the Trunk in Human Parietal and Temporal Cortex: An Intracranial EEG Study</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Interactions with the environment happen within one’s peripersonal space (PPS)—the space surrounding the body. Studies in monkeys and humans have highlighted a multisensory distributed cortical network representing the PPS. However, knowledge about the temporal dynamics of PPS processing around the trunk is lacking. Here, we recorded intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) in humans while administering tactile stimulation (T), approaching auditory stimuli (A), and the 2 combined (AT). To map PPS, tactile stimulation was delivered when the sound was far, intermediate, or close to the body. The 19% of the electrodes showed AT multisensory integration. Among those, 30% showed a PPS effect, a modulation of the response as a function of the distance between the sound and body. AT multisensory integration and PPS effects had similar spatiotemporal characteristics, with an early response (~50 ms) in the insular cortex, and later responses (~200 ms) in precentral and postcentral gyri. Superior temporal cortex showed a different response pattern with AT multisensory integration at ~100 ms without a PPS effect. These results, represent the first iEEG delineation of PPS processing in humans and show that PPS and multisensory integration happen at similar neural sites and time periods, suggesting that PPS representation is based on a spatial modulation of multisensory integration.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Anterior Thalamic Excitation and Feedforward Inhibition of Presubicular Neurons Projecting to Medial Entorhinal Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/28/6411?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The presubiculum contains head direction cells that are crucial for spatial orientation. Here, we examined the connectivity and strengths of thalamic inputs to presubicular layer 3 neurons projecting to the medial entorhinal cortex in the mouse. We recorded pairs of projection neurons and interneurons while optogenetically stimulating afferent fibers from the anterior thalamic nuclei. Thalamic input differentially affects presubicular neurons: layer 3 pyramidal neurons and fast-spiking parvalbumin-expressing interneurons are directly and monosynaptically activated, with depressing dynamics, whereas somatostatin-expressing interneurons are indirectly excited, during repetitive anterior thalamic nuclei activity. This arrangement ensures that the thalamic excitation of layer 3 cells is often followed by disynaptic inhibition. Feedforward inhibition is largely mediated by parvalbumin interneurons, which have a high probability of connection to presubicular pyramidal cells, and it may enforce temporally precise head direction tuning during head turns. Our data point to the potential contribution of presubicular microcircuits for fine-tuning thalamic head direction signals transmitted to medial entorhinal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; How microcircuits participate in shaping neural inputs is crucial to understanding information processing in the brain. Here, we show how the presubiculum may process thalamic head directional information before transmitting it to the medial entorhinal cortex. Synaptic inputs from the anterior thalamic nuclei excite layer 3 pyramidal cells and parvalbumin interneurons, which mediate disynaptic feedforward inhibition. Somatostatin interneurons are excited indirectly. Presubicular circuits may switch between two regimens depending on the angular velocity of head movements. During immobility, somatostatin-pyramidal cell interactions could support maintained head directional firing with attractor-like dynamics. During rapid head turns, in contrast, parvalbumin-mediated feedforward inhibition may act to tune the head direction signal transmitted to medial entorhinal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Network Controllability in the Inferior Frontal Gyrus Relates to Controlled Language Variability and Susceptibility to TMS</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/28/6399?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In language production, humans are confronted with considerable word selection demands. Often, we must select a word from among similar, acceptable, and competing alternative words to construct a sentence that conveys an intended meaning. In recent years, the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) has been identified as being critical to this ability. Despite a recent emphasis on network approaches to understanding language, how the LIFG interacts with the brain's complex networks to facilitate controlled language performance remains unknown. Here, we take a novel approach to understanding word selection as a network control process in the brain. Using an anatomical brain network derived from high-resolution diffusion spectrum imaging, we computed network controllability underlying the site of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in the LIFG between administrations of language tasks that vary in response (cognitive control) demands: open-response tasks (word generation) versus closed response tasks (number naming). We found that a statistic that quantifies the LIFG's theoretically predicted control of communication across modules in the human connectome explains TMS-induced changes in open-response language task performance only. Moreover, we found that a statistic that quantifies the LIFG's theoretically predicted control of difficult-to-reach states explains vulnerability to TMS in the closed-ended (but not open-ended) response task. These findings establish a link among network controllability, cognitive function, and TMS effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This work illustrates that network control statistics applied to anatomical connectivity data demonstrate relationships with cognitive variability during controlled language tasks and TMS effects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: {alpha}2{delta}-1 Is Essential for Sympathetic Output and NMDA Receptor Activity Potentiated by Angiotensin II in the Hypothalamus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/28/6388?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Both the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system are critically involved in hypertension development. Although angiotensin II (Ang II) stimulates hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) neurons to increase sympathetic vasomotor tone, the molecular mechanism mediating this action remains unclear. The glutamate NMDAR in the PVN controls sympathetic outflow in hypertension. In this study, we determined the interaction between α2-1 (encoded by &lt;i&gt;Cacna2d1&lt;/i&gt;), commonly known as a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel subunit, and NMDARs in the hypothalamus and its role in Ang II-induced synaptic NMDAR activity in PVN presympathetic neurons. Coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that α2-1 interacted with the NMDAR in the hypothalamus of male rats and humans (both sexes). Ang II increased the prevalence of synaptic α2-1–NMDAR complexes in the hypothalamus. Also, Ang II increased presynaptic and postsynaptic NMDAR activity via AT1 receptors, and such effects were abolished either by treatment with pregabalin, an inhibitory α2-1 ligand, or by interrupting the α2-1–NMDAR interaction with an α2-1 C terminus-interfering peptide. In &lt;i&gt;Cacna2d1&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mice (both sexes), Ang II failed to affect the presynaptic and postsynaptic NMDAR activity of PVN neurons. In addition, the α2-1 C terminus-interfering peptide blocked the sympathoexcitatory response to microinjection of Ang II into the PVN. Our findings indicate that Ang II augments sympathetic vasomotor tone and excitatory glutamatergic input to PVN presympathetic neurons by stimulating α2-1-bound NMDARs at synapses. This information extends our understanding of the molecular basis for the interaction between the sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin systems and suggests new strategies for treating neurogenic hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Although both the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin system are closely involved in hypertension development, the molecular mechanisms mediating this involvement remain unclear. We showed that α2-1, previously known as a calcium channel subunit, interacts with NMDARs in the hypothalamus of rodents and humans. Angiotensin II (Ang II) increases the synaptic expression level of α2-1–NMDAR complexes. Furthermore, inhibiting α2-1, interrupting the α2-1–NMDAR interaction, or deleting α2-1 abolishes the potentiating effects of Ang II on presynaptic and postsynaptic NMDAR activity in the hypothalamus. In addition, the sympathoexcitatory response to Ang II depends on α2-1-bound NMDARs. Thus, α2-1–NMDAR complexes in the hypothalamus serve as an important molecular substrate for the interaction between the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system. This evidence suggests that α2-1 may be a useful target for the treatment neurogenic hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This process, called arealization, depends on the graded expression of transcription factors in neocortical progenitors and postmitotic neurons prenatally, and on external activity-dependent cues driven by thalamocortical axons during postnatal stages. Thalamic inputs are guided within an intrinsically determined genetic framework to selectively target and innervate layer 4 (L4) cortical neurons in a somatotopic manner. L4 spiny stellate neurons are excitatory locally projecting neurons, which undergo a drastic dendrite remodeling during the first postnatal week and represent the principal sensory gateway to the neocortex. In this review, we will discuss the way intrinsic cortical gene regulation and extrinsic activity-dependent inputs instruct the cellular reorganization of L4 spiny stellate neurons, necessary for proper formation of the barrel cortex during the development of primary somatosensory maps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>In this issue of Neuron, Cagnetta et al. (2018) describe a novel method to identify, in an unbiased manner, newly synthesized axonal proteins in response to axon guidance cues. They find that axons stimulated by different guidance cues (Netrin-1, BDNF, and Sema3A) show distinct and common signatures.</description>

Many species rely on olfaction to navigate towards food sources or mates. Olfactory navigation is a challenging task since odor environments are typically turbulent. While time-averaged odor concentration varies smoothly with the distance to the source, instaneous concentrations are intermittent and obtaining stable averages takes longer than the typical intervals between animals’ navigation decisions. How to effectively sample from the odor distribution to determine sampling location is the focus in this article. To investigate which sampling strategies are most informative about the location of an odor source, we recorded three naturalistic stimuli with planar lased-induced fluorescence and used an information-theoretic approach to quantify the information that different sampling strategies provide about sampling location. Specifically, we compared multiple sampling strategies based on a fixed number of coding bits for encoding the olfactory stimulus. When the coding bits were all allocated to representing odor concentration at a single sensor, information rapidly saturated. Using the same number of coding bits in two sensors provides more information, as does coding multiple samples at different times. When accumulating multiple samples at a fixed location, the temporal sequence does not yield a large amount of information and can be averaged with minimal loss. Furthermore, we show that histogram-equalization is not the most efficient way to use coding bits when using the olfactory sample to determine location.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zIMMO9rrGJQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Phase-lags in large scale brain synchronization: Methodological considerations and in-silico analysis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Spase Petkoski, J. Matias Palva, Viktor K. Jirsa&lt;/p&gt;

Architecture of phase relationships among neural oscillations is central for their functional significance but has remained theoretically poorly understood. We use phenomenological model of delay-coupled oscillators with increasing degree of topological complexity to identify underlying principles by which the spatio-temporal structure of the brain governs the phase lags between oscillatory activity at distant regions. Phase relations and their regions of stability are derived and numerically confirmed for two oscillators and for networks with randomly distributed or clustered bimodal delays, as a first approximation for the brain structural connectivity. Besides in-phase, clustered delays can induce anti-phase synchronization for certain frequencies, while the sign of the lags is determined by the natural frequencies and by the inhomogeneous network interactions. For in-phase synchronization faster oscillators always phase lead, while stronger connected nodes lag behind the weaker during frequency depression, which consistently arises for in-silico results. If nodes are in anti-phase regime, then a distance &lt;i&gt;π&lt;/i&gt; is added to the in-phase trends. The statistics of the phases is calculated from the phase locking values (PLV), as in many empirical studies, and we scrutinize the method’s impact. The choice of surrogates do not affects the mean of the observed phase lags, but higher significance levels that are generated by some surrogates, cause decreased variance and might fail to detect the generally weaker coherence of the interhemispheric links. These links are also affected by the non-stationary and intermittent synchronization, which causes multimodal phase lags that can be misleading if averaged. Taken together, the results describe quantitatively the impact of the spatio-temporal connectivity of the brain to the synchronization patterns between brain regions, and to uncover mechanisms through which the spatio-temporal structure of the brain renders phases to be distributed around 0 and &lt;i&gt;π&lt;/i&gt;.

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Examining the Reversibility of Long-Term Behavioral Disruptions in Progeny of Maternal SSRI Exposure</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Serotonergic dysregulation is implicated in numerous psychiatric disorders. Serotonin plays widespread trophic roles during neurodevelopment; thus perturbations to this system during development may increase risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. Epidemiological studies have examined association between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment during pregnancy and increased autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk in offspring. It is unclear from these studies whether ASD susceptibility is purely related to maternal psychiatric diagnosis, or if treatment poses additional risk. We sought to determine whether maternal SSRI treatment alone or in combination with genetically vulnerable background was sufficient to induce offspring behavior disruptions relevant to ASD. We exposed C57BL/6J or &lt;i&gt;Celf6&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt; mouse dams to fluoxetine (FLX) during different periods of gestation and lactation and characterized offspring on tasks assessing social communicative interaction and repetitive behavior patterns including sensory sensitivities. We demonstrate robust reductions in pup ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) and alterations in social hierarchy behaviors, as well as perseverative behaviors and tactile hypersensitivity. &lt;i&gt;Celf6&lt;/i&gt; mutant mice demonstrate social communicative deficits and perseverative behaviors, without further interaction with FLX. FLX re-exposure in adulthood ameliorates the tactile hypersensitivity yet exacerbates the dominance phenotype. This suggests acute deficiencies in serotonin levels likely underlie the abnormal responses to sensory stimuli, while the social alterations are instead due to altered development of social circuits. These findings indicate maternal FLX treatment, independent of maternal stress, can induce behavioral disruptions in mammalian offspring, thus contributing to our understanding of the developmental role of the serotonin system and the possible risks to offspring of SSRI treatment during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: NMDA Receptor-Mediated Motor Cortex Plasticity After 20 Hz Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy160</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy160/5051079?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has been shown to modulate neural oscillations and excitability levels in the primary motor cortex (M1). These effects can last for more than an hour and an involvement of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;-methyl-&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) mediated synaptic plasticity has been suggested. However, to date the cortical mechanisms underlying tACS after-effects have not been explored. Here, we applied 20 Hz beta tACS to M1 while participants received either the NMDAR antagonist dextromethorphan or a placebo and the effects on cortical beta oscillations and excitability were explored. When a placebo medication was administered, beta tACS was found to increase cortical excitability and beta oscillations for at least 60 min, whereas when dextromethorphan was administered, these effects were completely abolished. These results provide the first direct evidence that tACS can induce NMDAR-mediated plasticity in the motor cortex, which contributes to our understanding of tACS-induced influences on human motor cortex physiology.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Microglia: An Intrinsic Component of the Proliferative Zones in the Fetal Rhesus Monkey (Macaca mulatta) Cerebral Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy145</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy145/5051089?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Microglial cells are increasingly recognized as modulators of brain development. We previously showed that microglia colonize the cortical proliferative zones in the prenatal brain and regulate the number of precursor cells through phagocytosis. To better define cellular interactions between microglia and proliferative cells, we performed lentiviral vector-mediated intraventricular gene transfer to induce enhanced green fluorescent protein expression in fetal cerebrocortical cells. Tissues were collected and counterstained with cell-specific markers to label microglial cells and identify other cortical cell types. We found that microglial cells intimately interact with the radial glial scaffold and make extensive contacts with neural precursor cells throughout the proliferative zones, particularly in the rhesus monkey fetus when compared to rodents. We also identify a subtype of microglia, which we term ‘periventricular microglia’, that interact closely with mitotic precursor cells in the ventricular zone. Our data suggest that microglia are structural modulators that facilitate remodeling of the proliferative zones as precursor cells migrate away from the ventricle and may facilitate the delamination of precursor cells. Taken together, these results indicate that microglial cells are an integral component of cortical proliferative zones and contribute to the interactive milieu in which cortical precursor cells function.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Differential roles of sleep spindles and sleep slow oscillations in memory consolidation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006322</guid>

Sleep plays an important role in the consolidation of recent memories. However, the cellular and synaptic mechanisms of consolidation during sleep remain poorly understood. In this study, using a realistic computational model of the thalamocortical network, we tested the role of Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep in memory consolidation. We found that sleep spindles (the hallmark of N2 stage sleep) and slow oscillations (the hallmark of N3 stage sleep) both promote replay of the spike sequences learned in the awake state and replay was localized at the trained network locations. Memory performance improved after a period of NREM sleep but not after the same time period in awake. When multiple memories were trained, the local nature of the spike sequence replay during spindles allowed replay of the distinct memory traces independently, while slow oscillations promoted competition that could prevent replay of the weak memories in a presence of the stronger memory traces. This could lead to extinction of the weak memories unless when sleep spindles (N2 sleep) preceded slow oscillations (N3 sleep), as observed during the natural sleep cycle. Our study presents a mechanistic explanation for the role of sleep rhythms in memory consolidation and proposes a testable hypothesis how the natural structure of sleep stages provides an optimal environment to consolidate memories.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jzS-ldh1Muw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The importance of mechanical constraints for proper polarization and psuedo-cleavage furrow generation in the early &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; embryo</title>

Intracellular polarization, where a cell specifies a spatial axis by segregation of specific factors, is a fundamental biological process. In the early embryo of the nematode worm &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans)&lt;/i&gt;, polarization is often accompanied by deformations of the cortex, a highly contractile structure consisting of actin filaments cross-linked by the motor protein myosin (actomyosin). It has been suggested that the eggshell surrounding the early embryo plays a role in polarization although its function is not understood. Here we develop a mathematical model which couples a reaction-diffusion model of actomyosin dynamics with a phase field model of the cell cortex to implicitly track cell shape changes in the early &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; embryo. We investigate the potential rigidity effect of the geometric constraint imposed by the presence and size of the eggshell on polarization dynamics. Our model suggests that the geometric constraint of the eggshell is essential for proper polarization and the size of the eggshell also affects the dynamics of polarization. Therefore, we conclude that geometric constraint on a cell might affect the dynamics of a biochemical process.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/S0GKlDO6sm0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Gain control with A-type potassium current: &lt;i&gt;IA&lt;/i&gt; as a switch between divisive and subtractive inhibition</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006292</guid>

Neurons process and convey information by transforming barrages of synaptic inputs into spiking activity. Synaptic inhibition typically suppresses the output firing activity of a neuron, and is commonly classified as having a &lt;i&gt;subtractive&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;divisive&lt;/i&gt; effect on a neuron’s output firing activity. Subtractive inhibition can narrow the range of inputs that evoke spiking activity by eliminating responses to non-preferred inputs. Divisive inhibition is a form of gain control: it modifies firing rates while preserving the range of inputs that evoke firing activity. Since these two “modes” of inhibition have distinct impacts on neural coding, it is important to understand the biophysical mechanisms that distinguish these response profiles. In this study, we use simulations and mathematical analysis of a neuron model to find the specific conditions (parameter sets) for which inhibitory inputs have subtractive or divisive effects. Significantly, we identify a novel role for the A-type Potassium current (&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;). In our model, this fast-activating, slowly-inactivating outward current acts as a switch between subtractive and divisive inhibition. In particular, if &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is strong (large maximal conductance) and fast (activates on a time-scale similar to spike initiation), then inhibition has a subtractive effect on neural firing. In contrast, if &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is weak or insufficiently fast-activating, then inhibition has a divisive effect on neural firing. We explain these findings using dynamical systems methods (plane analysis and fast-slow dissection) to define how a spike threshold condition depends on synaptic inputs and &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;. Our findings suggest that neurons can “self-regulate” the gain control effects of inhibition via combinations of synaptic plasticity and/or modulation of the conductance and kinetics of A-type Potassium channels. This novel role for &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; would add flexibility to neurons and networks, and may relate to recent observations of divisive inhibitory effects on neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FDIMHtgjtOc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Divergent Solutions to Visual Problem Solving across Mammalian Species</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Our understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of learning and behavior relies on the use of invasive techniques, which necessitate the use of animal models. However when different species learn the same task, to what degree are they actually producing the same behavior and engaging homologous neural circuitry? This question has received virtually no recent attention, even as the most powerful new methodologies for measuring and perturbing the nervous system have become increasingly dependent on the use of murine species. Here we test Humans, Rats, Monkeys, and an evolutionarily intermediate species, Tree Shrews, on a three alternative, forced choice, visual contrast discrimination task. As anticipated, learning rate, peak performance and transfer across contrasts was lower in the rat compared to the other species. More interestingly, Rats exhibited two major behavioral peculiarities: While Monkeys and Tree Shrews based their choices largely on visual information, Rats tended to base their choices on past reward history. Furthermore, as the task became more difficult, Rats largely disengaged from the visual stimulus, reverting to innate spatial predispositions in order to collect rewards near chance probability. Our findings highlight the limitation of muridae as models for translational research, at least in the area of visually based decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Research into the biology of cognition and behavior increasingly relies on studies performed in murine species (mice and rats). This is due to the explosion of powerful new, murine specific, genetic tools allowing for unprecedented control in imaging and manipulation of neural circuit elements. Lacking, are concomitant comparative behavioral studies necessary toward translating these exciting results to other species, particularly humans. We show here that, unlike primates, muridae incorporate species-specific predispositions and bias into their behavioral strategy toward the solution of a simple visual task, and are therefore engaging specific circuits not used by primates during task performance. This contradicts the long held idea that learning abolishes species-specific predispositions, and highlights the importance of comparative behavioral studies in translational neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
