	<title>ScienceDirect Publication: Current Opinion in Neurobiology: Rejuvenation of plasticity in the brain: opening the critical period</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: February 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 54&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Mary H Patton, Jay A Blundon, Stanislav S Zakharenko&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortical circuits are particularly sensitive to incoming sensory information during well-defined intervals of postnatal development called ‘critical periods’. The critical period for cortical plasticity closes in adults, thus restricting the brain’s ability to indiscriminately store new sensory information. For example, children acquire language in an exposure-based manner, whereas learning language in adulthood requires more effort and attention. It has been suggested that pairing sounds with the activation of neuromodulatory circuits involved in attention reopens this critical period. Here, we review two critical period hypotheses related to neuromodulation: cortical disinhibition and thalamic adenosine. We posit that these mechanisms co-regulate the critical period for auditory cortical plasticity. We also discuss ways to reopen this period and rejuvenate cortical plasticity in adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Two types of slow waves in anesthetized and sleeping brains. (arXiv:1810.00816v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00816</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00816</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep sleep and anesthesia have contrasting effects on memory, yet at the
microscopic scale they appear to produce similar neural network dynamics
consisting of slow waves associated with alternating transients of high
activity (UP states) and silence (DOWN states). Here, UP and DOWN state
dynamics are analyzed in cortical recordings from human, monkey, and rat and
found to be robustly different between deep sleep and anesthesia. We found that
the temporal statistics of UP and DOWN states is robustly different in natural
slow-wave sleep compared to the slow-waves of anesthesia. Computational models
predict that an interplay between noise and spike-frequency adaptation can
yield a transition from sleep-like to anesthesia-like slow-wave dynamics. These
predictions were confirmed by pharmacological manipulations in vitro, inducing
a switch between the two types of slow-waves. The results show that the strong
adaptation found in anesthesia, but not in sleep, can produce a different type
of slow oscillations, less sensitive to external inputs, that may prevent
memory formation.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Simplistic estimation of neural connectivity in MEEG sensor space is
impossible due to volume conduction. The only viable alternative is to carry
out connectivity estimation in source space. Among the neuroscience community
this is claimed to be impossible or misleading due to Leakage: linear mixing of
the reconstructed sources. To address this problematic we propose a novel
solution method that caulks the Leakage in MEEG source activity and
connectivity estimates: BC-VARETA. It is based on a joint estimation of source
activity and connectivity in the frequency domain representation of MEEG time
series. To achieve this, we go beyond current methods that assume a fixed
gaussian graphical model for source connectivity. In contrast we estimate this
graphical model in a Bayesian framework by placing priors on it, which allows
for highly optimized computations of the connectivity, via a new procedure
based on the local quadratic approximation under quite general prior models. A
further contribution of this paper is the rigorous definition of leakage via
the Spatial Dispersion Measure and Earth Movers Distance based on the geodesic
distances over the cortical manifold. Both measures are extended for the first
time to quantify Connectivity Leakage by defining them on the cartesian product
of cortical manifolds. Using these measures, we show that BC-VARETA outperforms
most state of the art inverse solvers by several orders of magnitude.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMIs) have recently emerged as a clinically viable
option to restore voluntary movements after paralysis. These devices are based
on the ability to extract information about movement intent from neural signals
recorded using multi-electrode arrays chronically implanted in the motor
cortices of the brain. However, the inherent loss and turnover of recorded
neurons requires repeated recalibrations of the interface, which can
potentially alter the day-to-day user experience. The resulting need for
continued user adaptation interferes with the natural, subconscious use of the
BMI. Here, we introduce a new computational approach that decodes movement
intent from a low-dimensional latent representation of the neural data. We
implement various domain adaptation methods to stabilize the interface over
significantly long times. This includes Canonical Correlation Analysis used to
align the latent variables across days; this method requires prior
point-to-point correspondence of the time series across domains. Alternatively,
we match the empirical probability distributions of the latent variables across
days through the minimization of their Kullback-Leibler divergence. These two
methods provide a significant and comparable improvement in the performance of
the interface. However, implementation of an Adversarial Domain Adaptation
Network trained to match the empirical probability distribution of the
residuals of the reconstructed neural signals outperforms the two methods based
on latent variables, while requiring remarkably few data points to solve the
domain adaptation problem.

	<description>The C-cluster of the enzyme carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) is a structurally distinctive Ni-Fe-S cluster employed to catalyze the reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO as part of the Wood-Ljungdahl carbon fixation pathway. Using X-ray crystallography, we have observed unprecedented conformational dynamics in the C-cluster of the CODH from &lt;i&gt;Desulfovibrio vulgaris&lt;/i&gt;, providing the first view of an oxidized state of the cluster. Combined with supporting spectroscopic data, our structures reveal that this novel, oxidized cluster arrangement plays a role in avoiding irreversible oxidative degradation at the C-cluster. Furthermore, mutagenesis of a conserved cysteine residue that binds the C-cluster in the oxidized state but not in the reduced state suggests that the oxidized conformation could be important for proper cluster assembly, in particular Ni incorporation. Together, these results lay a foundation for future investigations of C-cluster activation and assembly, and contribute to an emerging paradigm of metallocluster plasticity.</description>

	<description>Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating neurological condition for which there are currently no effective treatment options to restore function. A major obstacle to the development of new therapies is our fragmentary understanding of the coordinated pathophysiological processes triggered by damage to the human spinal cord. Here, we describe a systems biology approach to integrate decades of small-scale experiments with unbiased, genome-wide gene expression from the human spinal cord, revealing a gene regulatory network signature of the pathophysiological response to SCI. Our integrative analyses converge on an evolutionarily conserved gene subnetwork enriched for genes associated with the response to SCI by small-scale experiments, and whose expression is upregulated in a severity-dependent manner following injury and downregulated in functional recovery. We validate the severity-dependent upregulation of this subnetwork in rodents in primary transcriptomic and proteomic studies. Our analysis provides a systems-level view of the coordinated molecular processes activated in response to SCI.</description>

	<description>Control of DNA copy number is essential to maintain genome stability and ensure proper cell and tissue function. In Drosophila polyploid cells, the SNF2-domain-containing SUUR protein inhibits replication fork progression within specific regions of the genome to promote DNA underreplication. While dissecting the function of SUUR's SNF2 domain, we identified an interaction between SUUR and Rif1. Rif1 has many roles in DNA metabolism and regulates the replication timing program. We demonstrate that repression of DNA replication is dependent on Rif1. Rif1 localizes to active replication forks in a partially SUUR-dependent manner and directly regulates replication fork progression. Importantly, SUUR associates with replication forks in the absence of Rif1, indicating that Rif1 acts downstream of SUUR to inhibit fork progression. Our findings uncover an unrecognized function of the Rif1 protein as a regulator of replication fork progression.</description>

	<description>Binary fission has been well studied in rod-shaped bacteria, but the mechanisms underlying cell division in spherical bacteria are poorly understood. Rod-shaped bacteria harbor regulatory proteins that place and remodel the division machinery during cytokinesis. In the spherical human pathogen &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, we found that the essential protein GpsB localizes to mid-cell during cell division and co-constricts with the division machinery. Depletion of GpsB arrested cell division and led to cell lysis, whereas overproduction of GpsB inhibited cell division and led to the formation of enlarged cells. We report that &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; GpsB, unlike other &lt;i&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/i&gt; GpsB orthologs, directly interacts with the core divisome component FtsZ. GpsB bundles and organizes FtsZ filaments and also stimulates the GTPase activity of FtsZ. We propose that GpsB orchestrates the initial stabilization of the Z-ring at the onset of cell division and participates in the subsequent remodeling of the divisome during cytokinesis.</description>

	<description>Developed areas are thought to have low species diversity, low animal abundance, few native predators, and thus low resilience and ecological function. Working with citizen scientist volunteers to survey mammals at 1427 sites across two development gradients (wild-rural-exurban-suburban-urban) and four plot types (large forests, small forest fragments, open areas and residential yards) in the eastern US, we show that developed areas actually had significantly higher or statistically similar mammalian occupancy, relative abundance, richness and diversity compared to wild areas. However, although some animals can thrive in suburbia, conservation of wild areas and preservation of green space within cities are needed to protect sensitive species and to give all species the chance to adapt and persist in the Anthropocene.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34081</link>
	<description>Transcription of protein coding genes is accompanied by recruitment of COMPASS to promoter-proximal chromatin, which methylates histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) to form H3K4me1, H3K4me2 and H3K4me3. Here, we determine the importance of COMPASS in maintaining gene expression across lifespan in budding yeast. We find that COMPASS mutations reduce replicative lifespan and cause expression defects in almost 500 genes. Although H3K4 methylation is reported to act primarily in gene repression, particularly in yeast, repressive functions are progressively lost with age while hundreds of genes become dependent on H3K4me3 for full expression. Basal and inducible expression of these genes is also impaired in young cells lacking COMPASS components Swd1 or Spp1. Gene induction during ageing is associated with increasing promoter H3K4me3, but H3K4me3 also accumulates in non-promoter regions and the ribosomal DNA. Our results provide clear evidence that H3K4me3 is required to maintain normal expression of many genes across organismal lifespan.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Robust and sensitive GFP-based cGMP sensor for real time imaging in intact Caenorhabditis elegans</title>

	<description>cGMP is a ubiquitous second messenger that plays a role in sensory signaling and plasticity through its regulation of ion channels and kinases. Previous studies that primarily used genetic and biochemical tools suggest that cGMP is spatiotemporally regulated in multiple sensory modalities, including light, heat, gases, salt and odor. FRET- and GFP-based cGMP sensors were developed to visualize cGMP in primary cell culture and Caenorhabditis elegans to corroborate these findings. While a FRET-based sensor has been used in an intact animal to visualize cGMP, the requirement of a multiple emission system limits its ability to be used on its own as well as with other sensors and fluorescent markers. Here, we demonstrate that WincG2, a codon-optimized version of the cpEGFP-based cGMP sensor FlincG3, can be used in C. elegans to visualize rapidly changing cGMP levels in living, behaving animals using a single fluorophore. We coexpressed the sensor with the blue light-activated guanylyl cyclases BeCyclOp and bPGC in body wall muscles and found that the rate of WincG2 fluorescence correlated with the rate of cGMP production by each cyclase. Furthermore, we show that WincG2 responds linearly upon NaCl concentration changes and SDS presentation in the cell bodies of the gustatory neuron ASER and the nociceptive phasmid neuron PHB, respectively. Intriguingly, WincG2 fluorescence in the ASER cell body decreased in response to a NaCl concentration downstep and either stopped decreasing or increased in response to a NaCl concentration upstep, which is opposite in sign to previously published calcium recordings. These results illustrate that WincG2 can be used to report rapidly changing cGMP levels in an intact animal and that the reporter can potentially reveal unexpected spatiotemporal landscapes of cGMP in response to stimuli.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Common and dissociable contributions of alexithymia and autism to domain-specific interoceptive dysregulations - a dimensional neuroimaging approach</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/432971v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Alexithymia represents a transdiagnostic marker across psychiatric entities associated with emotional impairments, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Accumulating evidence suggests that interoceptive dysfunctions that underpin the core symptomatic emotion recognition and empathy deficits in ASD may be contributed to by high levels of alexithymia rather than autistic symptoms per se. However, previous findings are hampered by generally elevated alexithymia in ASD patients, and thus were not able to differentiate common and distinct contributions across the entire spectrum of variations of autism and alexithymia. Moreover, the multi-factorial nature of the domains affected, such as distinct neural reactivity towards perceiving physical and affective pain, has not been accounted for. Against this background the present fMRI study employed a dimensional trait approach in n = 242 healthy subjects to determine common and distinct associations between both traits and pain empathic responses towards physical and affective pain. Higher levels of alexithymia associated with increased left anterior insula pain empathic reactivity. Disentangling these effects revealed a positive association during perceived physical pain, but a negative one during affective pain. No significant associations with trait autism were found, but an interaction effect between the trait dimensions was observed in the mid-cingulate cortex. Moderation analysis demonstrated that trait autism only impacted mid-cingulate reactivity towards physical pain in high alexithymia subjects, whereas reactivity towards affective pain was specifically associated with trait autism in low alexithymia subjects. Findings confirm previous patient studies suggesting that alexithymia rather than autism per se may drive altered insula pain empathic reactivity. Importantly, the present approach allowed for the first time to demonstrate that the impact of alexithymia on insula reactivity varies as a function of the pain empathic domain and that effects on other core empathy nodes evolve in interaction with trait autism.</description>

	<description>Over forty years have passed since the first evidence showing the unbalanced attentional allocation of humans across the two visual fields, and since then, a wealth of behavioral, neurophysiological, and clinical data increasingly showed a right hemisphere dominance for orienting of attention. However, inconsistent evidence exists regarding the right-hemisphere dominance for executive control of attention, possibly due to a lack of consideration of its dynamics with the alerting and orienting functions. In this study, we used a version of the Attentional Network Test with lateralized presentation of the stimuli to the left visual field (processed by the right hemisphere, RH) and right visual field (processed by the left hemisphere, LH) to examine visual field differences in executive control of attention under conditions of alerting or orienting. Analyses of behavioral performance (reaction time and error rate) showed a more efficient executive control (reduced conflict effect) in the RH compared to the LH for the reaction time, under conditions of increased alerting and of informative spatial orienting. These results demonstrate the right-hemisphere superiority for executive control, and that this effect depends on the activation of the alerting and orienting functions.</description>

Beaumont, Wayne N. Frankel, Slavé Petrovski, Andrew S. Allen, Michael J. Boland, David B. Goldstein, Stephen J. Eglen&lt;/p&gt;

Here we present an open-source R package ‘meaRtools’ that provides a platform for analyzing neuronal networks recorded on Microelectrode Arrays (MEAs). Cultured neuronal networks monitored with MEAs are now being widely used to characterize &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; models of neurological disorders and to evaluate pharmaceutical compounds. meaRtools provides core algorithms for MEA spike train analysis, feature extraction, statistical analysis and plotting of multiple MEA recordings with multiple genotypes and treatments. meaRtools functionality covers novel solutions for spike train analysis, including algorithms to assess electrode cross-correlation using the spike train tiling coefficient (STTC), mutual information, synchronized bursts and entropy within cultured wells. Also integrated is a solution to account for bursts variability originating from mixed-cell neuronal cultures. The package provides a statistical platform built specifically for MEA data that can combine multiple MEA recordings and compare extracted features between different genetic models or treatments. We demonstrate the utilization of meaRtools to successfully identify epilepsy-like phenotypes in neuronal networks from &lt;i&gt;Celf4&lt;/i&gt; knockout mice. The package is freely available under the GPL license (GPL&amp;gt; = 3) and is updated frequently on the CRAN web-server repository. The package, along with full documentation can be downloaded from: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/meaRtools/.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pDffSPfFxsQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Vaccination is an effective method to protect against infectious diseases. An important consideration in any vaccine formulation is the inoculum dose, i.e., amount of antigen or live attenuated pathogen that is used. Higher levels generally lead to better stimulation of the immune response but might cause more severe side effects and allow for less population coverage in the presence of vaccine shortages. Determining the optimal amount of inoculum dose is an important component of rational vaccine design. A combination of mathematical models with experimental data can help determine the impact of the inoculum dose. We illustrate the concept of using data and models to inform inoculum dose determination for vaccines, wby fitting a mathematical model to data from influenza A virus (IAV) infection of mice and human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) infection of cotton rats at different inoculum doses. We use the model to map inoculum dose to the level of immune protection and morbidity and to explore how such a framework might be used to determine an optimal inoculum dose. We show how a framework that combines mathematical models with experimental data can be used to study the impact of inoculum dose on important outcomes such as immune protection and morbidity. Our findings illustrate that the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity can depend on the specific pathogen and that both protection and morbidity do not necessarily increase monotonically with increasing inoculum dose. Once vaccine design goals are specified with required levels of protection and acceptable levels of morbidity, our proposed framework can help in the rational design of vaccines and determination of the optimal amount of inoculum.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tR55K82RYTM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Collective cell migration in cohesive units is vital for tissue morphogenesis, wound repair, and immune response. While the fundamental driving forces for collective cell motion stem from contractile and protrusive activities of individual cells, it remains unknown how their balance is optimized to maintain tissue cohesiveness and the fluidity for motion. Here we present a cell-based computational model for collective cell migration during wound healing that incorporates mechanochemical coupling of cell motion and adhesion kinetics with stochastic transformation of active motility forces. We show that a balance of protrusive motility and actomyosin contractility is optimized for accelerating the rate of wound repair, which is robust to variations in cell and substrate mechanical properties. This balance underlies rapid collective cell motion during wound healing, resulting from a tradeoff between tension mediated collective cell guidance and active stress relaxation in the tissue.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jnAyESMj4zg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Many research questions in visual perception involve determining whether stimulus properties are represented and processed independently. In visual neuroscience, there is great interest in determining whether important object dimensions are represented independently in the brain. For example, theories of face recognition have proposed either completely or partially independent processing of identity and emotional expression. Unfortunately, most previous research has only vaguely defined what is meant by “independence,” which hinders its precise quantification and testing. This article develops a new quantitative framework that links signal detection theory from psychophysics and encoding models from computational neuroscience, focusing on a special form of independence defined in the psychophysics literature: perceptual separability. The new theory allowed us, for the first time, to precisely define separability of neural representations and to theoretically link behavioral and brain measures of separability. The framework formally specifies the relation between these different levels of perceptual and brain representation, providing the tools for a truly integrative research approach. In particular, the theory identifies exactly what valid inferences can be made about independent encoding of stimulus dimensions from the results of multivariate analyses of neuroimaging data and psychophysical studies. In addition, commonly used operational tests of independence are re-interpreted within this new theoretical framework, providing insights on their correct use and interpretation. Finally, we apply this new framework to the study of separability of brain representations of face identity and emotional expression (neutral/sad) in a human fMRI study with male and female participants.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qnPjy-Per_4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

For encapsulated bacteria such as &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;, asymptomatic carriage is more common and longer in duration than disease, and hence is often a more convenient endpoint for clinical trials of vaccines against these bacteria. However, using a carriage endpoint entails specific challenges. Carriage is almost always measured as prevalence, whereas the vaccine may act by reducing incidence or duration. Thus, to determine sample size requirements, its impact on prevalence must first be estimated. The relationship between incidence and prevalence (or duration and prevalence) is convex, saturating at 100% prevalence. For this reason, the proportional effect of a vaccine on prevalence is typically less than its proportional effect on incidence or duration. This relationship is further complicated in the presence of multiple pathogen strains. In addition, host immunity to carriage accumulates rapidly with frequent exposures in early years of life, creating potentially complex interactions with the vaccine’s effect. We conducted a simulation study to predict the impact of an inactivated whole cell pneumococcal vaccine—believed to reduce carriage duration—on carriage prevalence in different age groups and trial settings. We used an individual-based model of pneumococcal carriage that incorporates relevant immunological processes, both vaccine-induced and naturally acquired. Our simulations showed that for a wide range of vaccine efficacies, sampling time and age at vaccination are important determinants of sample size. There is a window of favorable sampling times during which the required sample size is relatively low, and this window is prolonged with a younger age at vaccination, and in a trial setting with lower transmission intensity. These results illustrate the ability of simulation studies to inform the planning of vaccine trials with carriage endpoints, and the methods we present here can be applied to trials evaluating other pneumococcal vaccine candidates or comparing alternative dosing schedules for the existing conjugate vaccines.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/c40RPkVFr3Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Cocaine Exposure Modulates Perineuronal Nets and Synaptic Excitability of Fast-spiking Interneurons in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;We previously reported that perineuronal nets (PNNs) are required for cocaine-associated memories. Perineuronal nets are extracellular matrix that primarily surrounds parvalbumin (PV)-containing, GABAergic fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Here we measured the impact of acute (1 day) or repeated (5 days) cocaine exposure on PNNs and PV cells within the prelimbic and infralimbic regions of the mPFC. Adult rats were exposed to 1 day or 5 days of cocaine and stained for PNNs (using &lt;i&gt;Wisteria floribunda&lt;/i&gt; agglutinin, WFA) and PV intensity 2 h or 24 h later. In the prelimbic and infralimbic PFC, PNN staining intensity decreased 2 hr after 1 day of cocaine but increased after 5 days of cocaine. Cocaine also produced changes in PV intensity, which generally lagged behind that of PNNs. In the prelimbic PFC, both 1 and 5 days of cocaine increased GAD65/67 puncta near PNN-surrounded PV cells, with an increase in the ratio of GAD65/67:VGluT1 puncta after 5 days of cocaine exposure. In the prelimbic PFC, slice electrophysiology studies in FSIs surrounded by PNNs revealed that both 1 and 5 days of cocaine reduced the number of action potentials 2 h later. Synaptic changes demonstrated that 5 d cocaine increased inhibition of FSIs, potentially reducing the inhibition of pyramidal neurons and contributing to their hyperexcitability during relapse behavior. These early and rapid responses to cocaine may alter network stability of PV FSIs that partially mediate the persistent and chronic nature of drug addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Parvalbumin-containing, FSIs control the inhibitory:excitatory balance in the adult CNS, and the majority of these are surrounded by PNNs. The mPFC is critical to relapse in cocaine addiction, yet few studies have focused on the impact of cocaine exposure on PV interneurons that profoundly control output of the mPFC. Our studies highlight the impact of cocaine on PV and PNN levels and intrinsic and synaptic properties of PNN-surrounded FSIs in the mPFC. These findings point to a key upstream mechanism by which FSIs may contribute to the consistently observed increase in mPFC excitatory output of pyramidal neurons that contribute to cocaine reinstatement, and they have broader implications for understanding how PNN-surrounded neurons may control aberrant learning processes involved in addiction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Simultaneous assessment of homonymous and heteronymous monosynaptic reflex excitability in the adult rat</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;In order to successfully produce motor tasks such as locomotion, the central nervous system must coordinate contractions of antagonistic and synergistic muscles across multiple joints. This coordination is largely dependent upon the function of proprioceptive afferents, which make monosynaptic connections with homonymous motoneurons. Homonymous pathways have been well studied in both health and disease but their collateral fibres projecting to heteronymous, synergistic muscles receive relatively less attention. This is surprising given that proprioceptive afferent collaterals have significant effects on the excitability of heteronymous motoneurons, and that their synaptic terminal density is activity dependent. It is likely that the relative lack of literature is due to the lack of a preparation which allows synergistic heteronymous pathways to be assessed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Here we describe a method to simultaneously evoke homonymous and heteronymous (synergistic) monosynaptic reflexes and study their modulation by descending pathways in adult rats. Through stimulation of the medial plantar nerve, we were able to produce an H reflex in the intrinsic foot muscles of the hind paw with a latency of 10.52 ± 3.8 ms. Increasing the stimulus intensity evoked a robust signal with a monosynaptic latency (11.32 ± 0.35 ms), recorded in the ipsilateral gastrocnemius. Our subsequent analyses suggest that gastrocnemius motoneurons were activated via heteronymous afferent collaterals from the medial plantar nerve. These reflexes could be evoked bilaterally and were modulated by conditioning stimuli to the cortex and reticular formation. Interestingly, cortical stimulation was equally efficient at modulating both ipsilateral and contralateral reflexes, indicating that cortical modulation of lumbar sensory afferents lacks the laterality demonstrated by studies of cortical muscle activation. This technique represents a novel, relatively simple way to assess heteronymous afferent pathways in normal motor control as well as in models of motor disorders where adaptive and maladaptive plasticity of proprioceptive afferents and descending systems affects functional outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; This study describes a method for simultaneously recording bilateral homonymous and heteronymous proprioceptive afferent reflexes in rodents. Bilateral stimulation of the medial plantar nerve produced homonymous H reflexes in intrinsic foot muscles of both hind paws as well as heteronymous monosynaptic reflexes in the gastrocnemius muscles. We used this technique to assess cortical and reticular modulation of homonymous and heteronymous reflexes. Surprisingly, cortical conditioning of reflexes revealed a lack of laterality in modulation of homonymous and heteronymous reflexes. This technique will be extremely useful for further studies of heteronymous afferent pathways in normal and dysfunctional motor states, such as spinal cord injury, stroke and cerebral palsy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Idiosyncratic, retinotopic bias in face identification modulated by familiarity</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The perception of gender and age of unfamiliar faces is reported to vary idiosyncratically across retinal locations such that, for example, the same androgynous face may appear to be male at one location but female at another. Here we test spatial heterogeneity for the recognition of the &lt;i&gt;identity&lt;/i&gt; of personally familiar faces in human participants. We found idiosyncratic biases that were stable within participants and that varied more across locations for low as compared to high familiar faces. These data suggest that like face gender and age, face identity is processed, in part, by independent populations of neurons monitoring restricted spatial regions and that the recognition responses vary for the same face across these different locations. Moreover, repeated and varied social interactions appear to lead to adjustments of these independent face recognition neurons so that the same familiar face is eventually more likely to elicit the same recognition response across widely separated visual field locations. We provide a mechanistic account of this reduced retinotopic bias based on computational simulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; In this work we tested spatial heterogeneity for the recognition of personally familiar faces. We found retinotopic biases that varied more across locations for low as compared to highly familiar faces. The retinotopic biases were idiosyncratic and stable within participants. Our data suggest that, like face gender and age, face identity is processed by independent populations of neurons monitoring restricted spatial regions and that recognition may vary for the same face at these different locations. Unlike previous findings, our data and computational simulation address the effects of learning and show how increased familiarity modifies the representation of face identity in face-responsive cortical areas. This new perspective has broader implications for understanding how learning optimizes visual processes for socially salient stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Continuous attractors have been used to understand recent neuroscience
experiments where persistent activity patterns encode internal representations
of external attributes like head direction or spatial location. However, the
conditions under which the emergent bump of neural activity in such networks
can be manipulated by space and time-dependent external sensory or motor
signals are not understood. Here, we find fundamental limits on how rapidly
internal representations encoded along continuous attractors can be updated by
an external signal. We apply these results to place cell networks to derive a
velocity-dependent non-equilibrium memory capacity.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, graph theory has become a popular method for characterizing brain
functional organization. One important goal in graph theoretical analysis of
brain networks is to identify network differences across disease types or
conditions. Typical approaches include massive univariate testing of each edge
or comparisons of local and/or global network metrics to identify deviations in
topological organization. Some limitations of these methods include low
statistical power due to the large number of comparisons and difficulty
attributing overall differences in networks to local variations in brain
function. We propose a novel differential degree test (DDT) to identify brain
regions incident to a large number of differentially weighted edges across two
populations. The proposed test could help detect key brain locations involved
in diseases by demonstrating significantly altered neural connections. We
achieve this by generating an appropriate set of null networks which are
matched on the first and second moments of the observed difference network
using the Hirschberger-Qi-Steuer (HQS) algorithm. This formulation permits
separation of the network's true topology from the nuisance topology which is
induced by the correlation measure and may drive inter-regional connectivity in
ways unrelated to the brain function. Simulations indicate that the proposed
approach routinely outperforms competing methods in detecting differentially
connected regions of interest. Furthermore, we propose a data-adaptive
threshold selection procedure which is able to detect differentially weighted
edges and is shown to outperform competing methods that perform edge-wise
comparisons controlling for the error rate. An application of our method to a
major depressive disorder dataset leads to the identification of brain regions
in the default mode network commonly implicated in this ruminative disorder.

	<title>eLife: latest articles: KChIP3 coupled to Ca2+ oscillations exerts a tonic brake on baseline mucin release in the colon</title>

	<description>Regulated mucin secretion from specialized goblet cells by exogenous agonist-dependent (stimulated) and -independent (baseline) manner is essential for the function of the epithelial lining. Over extended periods, baseline release of mucin can exceed quantities released by stimulated secretion, yet its regulation remains poorly characterized. We have discovered that ryanodine receptor-dependent intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oscillations effect the dissociation of the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-binding protein, KChIP3, encoded by &lt;i&gt;KCNIP3&lt;/i&gt; gene, from mature mucin-filled secretory granules, allowing for their exocytosis. Increased Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oscillations, or depleting KChIP3, lead to mucin hypersecretion in a human differentiated colonic cell line, an effect reproduced in the colon of &lt;i&gt;Kcnip3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Conversely, overexpressing KChIP3 or abrogating its Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-sensing ability, increases KChIP3 association with granules, and inhibits baseline secretion. KChIP3 therefore emerges as the high-affinity Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensor that negatively regulates baseline mucin secretion. We suggest KChIP3 marks mature, primed mucin granules, and functions as a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oscillation-dependent brake to control baseline secretion.</description>

	<description>Mitochondrial complex I has a key role in cellular energy metabolism, generating a major portion of the proton motive force that drives aerobic ATP synthesis. The hydrophilic arm of the L-shaped ~1 MDa membrane protein complex transfers electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, providing the energy to drive proton pumping at distant sites in the membrane arm. The critical steps of energy conversion are associated with the redox chemistry of ubiquinone. We report the cryo-EM structure of complete mitochondrial complex I from the aerobic yeast &lt;i&gt;Yarrowia lipolytica&lt;/i&gt; both in the deactive form and after capturing the enzyme during steady-state activity. The site of ubiquinone binding observed during turnover supports a two-state stabilization change mechanism for complex I.</description>

	<description>Maintaining a healthy proteome involves all layers of gene expression regulation. By quantifying temporal changes of the transcriptome, translatome, proteome, and RNA-protein interactome in cervical cancer cells, we systematically characterize the molecular landscape in response to proteostatic challenges. We identify shared and specific responses to misfolded proteins and to oxidative stress, two conditions that are tightly linked. We reveal new aspects of the unfolded protein response, including many genes that escape global translation shutdown. A subset of these genes supports rerouting of energy production in the mitochondria. We also find that many genes change at multiple levels, in either the same or opposing directions, and at different time points. We highlight a variety of putative regulatory pathways, including the stress-dependent alternative splicing of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, and protein-RNA binding within the 3' untranslated region of molecular chaperones. These results illustrate the potential of this information-rich resource.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38105</link>
	<description>How does attentional modulation of neural activity enhance performance? Here we use a deep convolutional neural network as a large-scale model of the visual system to address this question. We model the feature similarity gain model of attention, in which attentional modulation is applied according to neural stimulus tuning. Using a variety of visual tasks, we show that neural modulations of the kind and magnitude observed experimentally lead to performance changes of the kind and magnitude observed experimentally. We find that, at earlier layers, attention applied according to tuning does not successfully propagate through the network, and has a weaker impact on performance than attention applied according to values computed for optimally modulating higher areas. This raises the question of whether biological attention might be applied at least in part to optimize function rather than strictly according to tuning. We suggest a simple experiment to distinguish these alternatives.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Inhibition of TrkB- and TrkC-Signaling Pathways Affects Neurogenesis in the Opossum Developing Neocortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy246</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;We have previously reported that the blockage of TrkB and TrkC signaling in primary culture of opossum neocortical cells affects neurogenesis that involves a range of processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Here, we studied whether TrkB and TrkC activity specifically affects various types of progenitor cell populations during neocortex formation in the Monodelphis opossum in vivo. We found that the inhibition of TrkB and TrkC activities affects the same proliferative cellular phenotype, but TrkC causes more pronounced changes in the rate of cell divisions. Additionally, inhibition of TrkB and TrkC does not affect apoptosis in vivo, which was found in cell culture experiments. The lack of TrkB and TrkC receptor activity caused the arrest of newly generated neurons; therefore, they could not penetrate the subplate zone. We suggest that at this time point in development, migration consists of 2 steps. During the initial step, neurons migrate and reach the base of the subplate, whereas during the next step the migration of neurons to their final position is regulated by TrkB or TrkC signaling.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Hippocampal Shape Maturation in Childhood and Adolescence</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy244</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy244/5112943?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The hippocampus is a subcortical structure critical for learning and memory, and a thorough understanding of its neurodevelopment is important for studying these processes in health and disease. However, few studies have quantified the typical developmental trajectory of the structure in childhood and adolescence. This study examined the cross-sectional age-related changes and sex differences in hippocampal shape in a multisite, multistudy cohort of 1676 typically developing children (age 1–22 years) using a novel intrinsic brain mapping method based on Laplace–Beltrami embedding of surfaces. Significant age-related expansion was observed bilaterally and nonlinear growth was observed primarily in the right head and tail of the hippocampus. Sex differences were also observed bilaterally along the lateral and medial aspects of the surface, with females exhibiting relatively larger surface expansion than males. Additionally, the superior posterior lateral surface of the left hippocampus exhibited an age–sex interaction with females expanding faster than males. Shape analysis provides enhanced sensitivity to regional changes in hippocampal morphology over traditional volumetric approaches and allows for the localization of developmental effects. Our results further support evidence that hippocampal structures follow distinct maturational trajectories that may coincide with the development of learning and memory skills during critical periods of development.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Hierarchical Brain Network for Face and Voice Integration of Emotion Expression</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy240</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The brain has separate specialized computational units to process faces and voices located in occipital and temporal cortices. However, humans seamlessly integrate signals from the faces and voices of others for optimal social interaction. How are emotional expressions, when delivered by different sensory modalities (faces and voices), integrated in the brain? In this study, we characterized the brains’ response to faces, voices, and combined face–voice information (congruent, incongruent), which varied in expression (neutral, fearful). Using a whole-brain approach, we found that only the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (rpSTS) responded more to bimodal stimuli than to face or voice alone but only when the stimuli contained emotional expression. Face- and voice-selective regions of interest, extracted from independent functional localizers, similarly revealed multisensory integration in the face-selective rpSTS only; further, this was the only face-selective region that also responded significantly to voices. Dynamic causal modeling revealed that the rpSTS receives unidirectional information from the face-selective fusiform face area, and voice-selective temporal voice area, with emotional expression affecting the connection strength. Our study promotes a hierarchical model of face and voice integration, with convergence in the rpSTS, and that such integration depends on the (emotional) salience of the stimuli.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Neuroanatomy of Autism Spectrum Disorder Symptomatology in 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy239</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy239/5112941?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11.2DS) is a genetic condition associated with a high prevalence of neuropsychiatric conditions that include autism spectrum disorder (ASD). While evidence suggests that clinical phenotypes represent distinct neurodevelopmental outcomes, it remains unknown whether this translates to the level of neurobiology. To fractionate the 22q11.2DS phenotype on the level of neuroanatomy, we examined differences in vertex-wise estimates of cortical volume, surface area, and cortical thickness between 1) individuals with 22q11.2DS (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 62) and neurotypical controls (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 57) and 2) 22q11.2DS individuals with ASD symptomatology (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 30) and those without (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 25). We firstly observed significant differences in surface anatomy between 22q11.2DS individuals and controls for all 3 neuroanatomical features, predominantly in parietotemporal regions, cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. We also established that 22q11.2DS individuals with ASD symptomatology were neuroanatomically distinct from 22q11.2DS individuals without ASD symptoms, particularly in brain regions that have previously been linked to ASD (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortices and the entorhinal cortex). Our findings indicate that different clinical 22q11.2DS phenotypes, including those with ASD symptomatology, may represent different neurobiological subgroups. The spatially distributed patterns of neuroanatomical differences associated with ASD symptomatology in 22q11.2DS may thus provide useful information for patient stratification and the prediction of clinical outcomes.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Dissociable Roles Within the Social Brain for Self–Other Processing: A HD-tDCS Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy238</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Theories of right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) function in social cognition include self–other distinction, self-inhibition, or embodied rotation, whereas the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) is associated with integrating social information. However, no study has provided causal evidence for dissociable roles of the rTPJ and dmPFC in social cognition. A total of 52 healthy young adults were stratified to receive either dmPFC or rTPJ anodal high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) in a sham-controlled, double-blinded, repeated measures design. Self–other processing was assessed across implicit and explicit level 1 (line-of-sight) and level 2 (mental rotation) visual perspective taking (VPT) tasks, and self–other effects on memory. DmPFC stimulation selectively increased the influence of the allocentric perspective during egocentric perspective taking, indexed by an increase in congruency effect across explicit VPT tasks. Moreover, dmPFC stimulation removed the self-reference effect in episodic memory by increasing the recognition of other and decreasing the recognition of self-encoded words. Stimulation of the rTPJ resulted in improved inhibition of the egocentric-perspective during level 2 VPT only, indexed by a reduction of the congruency effect when taking the allocentric perspective. This research supports theories suggesting that the rTPJ facilitates embodied mental rotation of the self into an alternate perspective, whereas the dmPFC integrates social information relevant to self-directed processes.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Early-Emerging Sulcal Patterns Are Atypical in Fetuses with Congenital Heart Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy235</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy235/5112934?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Fetuses with congenital heart disease (CHD) have third trimester alterations in cortical development on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, the intersulcal relationships contributing to global sulcal pattern remain unknown. This study applied a novel method for examining the geometric and topological relationships between sulci to fetal brain MRIs from 21–30 gestational weeks in CHD fetuses (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 19) and typically developing (TD) fetuses (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 17). Sulcal pattern similarity index (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;SI&lt;/span&gt;) to template fetal brain MRIs was determined for the position, area, and depth for corresponding sulcal basins and intersulcal relationships for each subject. CHD fetuses demonstrated altered global sulcal patterns in the left hemisphere compared with TD fetuses (TD [&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;SI&lt;/span&gt;, mean ± SD]: 0.822 ± 0.023, CHD: 0.795 ± 0.030, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; = 0.002). These differences were present in the earliest emerging sulci and were driven by differences in the position of corresponding sulcal basins (TD: 0.897 ± 0.024, CHD: 0.878 ± 0.019, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P =&lt;/span&gt; 0.006) and intersulcal relationships (TD: 0.876 ± 0.031, CHD: 0.857 ± 0.018, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; = 0.033). No differences in cortical gyrification index, mean curvature, or surface area were present. These data suggest our methods may be more sensitive than traditional measures for evaluating cortical developmental alterations early in gestation.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Tonotopy is an essential functional organization in the mammalian auditory cortex, and its source in the primary auditory cortex (A1) is the incoming frequency-related topographical projections from the ventral division of the medial geniculate body (MGv). However, circuits that relay this functional organization to higher-order regions such as the secondary auditory field (A2) have yet to be identified. Here, we discovered a new pathway that projects directly from MGv to A2 in mice. Tonotopy was established in A2 even when primary fields including A1 were removed, which indicates that tonotopy in A2 can be established solely by thalamic input. Moreover, the structural nature of differing thalamocortical connections was consistent with the functional organization of the target regions in the auditory cortex. Retrograde tracing revealed that the region of MGv input to a local area in A2 was broader than the region of MGv input to A1. Consistent with this anatomy, two-photon calcium imaging revealed that neuronal responses in the thalamocortical recipient layer of A2 showed wider bandwidth and greater heterogeneity of the best frequency distribution than those of A1. The current study demonstrates a new thalamocortical pathway that relays frequency information to A2 on the basis of the MGv compartmentalization.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: NFIX-Mediated Inhibition of Neuroblast Branching Regulates Migration Within the Adult Mouse Ventricular–Subventricular Zone</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy233</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy233/5112942?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Understanding the migration of newborn neurons within the brain presents a major challenge in contemporary biology. Neuronal migration is widespread within the developing brain but is also important within the adult brain. For instance, stem cells within the ventricular–subventricular zone (V-SVZ) and the subgranular zone of dentate gyrus of the adult rodent brain produce neuroblasts that migrate to the olfactory bulb and granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus, respectively, where they regulate key brain functions including innate olfactory responses, learning, and memory. Critically, our understanding of the factors mediating neuroblast migration remains limited. The transcription factor nuclear factor I X (NFIX) has previously been implicated in embryonic cortical development. Here, we employed conditional ablation of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Nfix&lt;/span&gt; from the adult mouse brain and demonstrated that the removal of this gene from either neural stem and progenitor cells, or neuroblasts, within the V-SVZ culminated in neuroblast migration defects. Mechanistically, we identified aberrant neuroblast branching, due in part to increased expression of the guanylyl cyclase natriuretic peptide receptor 2 (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Npr2&lt;/span&gt;), as a factor contributing to abnormal migration in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Nfix&lt;/span&gt;-deficient adult mice. Collectively, these data provide new insights into how neuroblast migration is regulated at a transcriptional level within the adult brain.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Reconfiguration of Dynamic Functional Connectivity in Sensory and Perceptual System in Schizophrenia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy232</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Schizophrenia is thought as a self-disorder with dysfunctional brain connectivity. This self-disorder is often attributed to high-order cognitive impairment. Yet due to the frequent report of sensorial and perceptual deficits, it has been hypothesized that self-disorder in schizophrenia is dysfunctional communication between sensory and cognitive processes. To further verify this assumption, the present study comprehensively examined dynamic reconfigurations of resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) in schizophrenia at voxel level, region level, and network levels (102 patients vs. 124 controls). We found patients who show consistently increased rsFC variability in sensory and perceptual system, including visual network, sensorimotor network, attention network, and thalamus at all the three levels. However, decreased variability in high-order networks, such as default mode network and frontal–parietal network were only consistently observed at region and network levels. Taken together, these findings highlighted the rudimentary role of elevated instability of information communication in sensory and perceptual system and attenuated whole-brain integration of high-order network in schizophrenia, which provided novel neural evidence to support the hypothesis of disrupted perceptual and cognitive function in schizophrenia. The foci of effects also highlighted that targeting perceptual deficits can be regarded as the key to enhance our understanding of pathophysiology in schizophrenia and promote new treatment intervention.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Seven unrelated individuals (four pediatric, three adults) with the TUBB3 E410K syndrome, harboring identical de novo heterozygous &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;TUBB3&lt;/span&gt; c.1228 G&amp;gt;A mutations, underwent neuropsychological testing and neuroimaging. Despite the absence of cortical malformations, they have intellectual and social disabilities. To search for potential etiologies for these deficits, we compared their brain's structural and white matter organization to 22 controls using structural and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. Diffusion images were processed to calculate fractional anisotropy (FA) and perform tract reconstructions. Cortical parcellation-based network analysis and gyral topology-based FA analyses were performed. Major interhemispheric, projection and intrahemispheric tracts were manually segmented. Subjects had decreased corpus callosum volume and decreased network efficiency. While only pediatric subjects had diffuse decreases in FA predominantly affecting mid- and long-range tracts, only adult subjects had white matter volume loss associated with decreased cortical surface area. All subjects showed aberrant corticospinal tract trajectory and bilateral absence of the dorsal language network long segment. Furthermore, pediatric subjects had more tracts with decreased FA compared with controls than did adult subjects. These findings define a TUBB3 E410K neuroimaging endophenotype and lead to the hypothesis that the age-related changes are due to microscopic intrahemispheric misguided axons that are pruned during maturation.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Computational Feature Analysis of Body Movements Reveals Hierarchical Brain Organization</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Social species spend considerable time observing the body movements of others to understand their actions, predict their emotions, watch their games, or enjoy their dance movements. Given the important information obtained from body movements, we still know surprisingly little about the details of brain mechanisms underlying movement perception. In this fMRI study, we investigated the relations between movement features obtained from automated computational analyses of video clips and the corresponding brain activity. Our results show that low-level computational features map to specific brain areas related to early visual- and motion-sensitive regions, while mid-level computational features are related to dynamic aspects of posture encoded in occipital–temporal cortex, posterior superior temporal sulcus and superior parietal lobe. Furthermore, behavioral features obtained from subjective ratings correlated with activity in higher action observation regions. Our computational feature-based analysis suggests that the neural mechanism of movement encoding is organized in the brain not so much by semantic categories than by feature statistics of the body movements.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Early Developmental Trajectories of Functional Connectivity Along the Visual Pathways in Rhesus Monkeys</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Early social interactions shape the development of social behavior, although the critical periods or the underlying neurodevelopmental processes are not completely understood. Here, we studied the developmental changes in neural pathways underlying visual social engagement in the translational rhesus monkey model. Changes in functional connectivity (FC) along the ventral object and motion pathways and the dorsal attention/visuo-spatial pathways were studied longitudinally using resting-state functional MRI in infant rhesus monkeys, from birth through early weaning (3 months), given the socioemotional changes experienced during this period. Our results revealed that (1) maturation along the visual pathways proceeds in a caudo-rostral progression with primary visual areas (V1–V3) showing strong FC as early as 2 weeks of age, whereas higher-order visual and attentional areas (e.g., MT–AST, LIP–FEF) show weak FC; (2) functional changes were pathway-specific (e.g., robust FC increases detected in the most anterior aspect of the object pathway (TE–AMY), but FC remained weak in the other pathways (e.g., AST–AMY)); (3) FC matures similarly in both right and left hemispheres. Our findings suggest that visual pathways in infant macaques undergo selective remodeling during the first 3 months of life, likely regulated by early social interactions and supporting the transition to independence from the mother.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Shared Genetic Basis of Educational Attainment and Cerebral Cortical Morphology</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy216</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Individual differences in educational attainment are linked to differences in intelligence, and predict important social, economic, and health outcomes. Previous studies have found common genetic factors that influence educational achievement, cognitive performance and total brain volume (i.e., brain size). Here, in a large sample of participants from the UK Biobank, we investigate the shared genetic basis between educational attainment and fine-grained cerebral cortical morphological features, and associate this genetic variation with a related aspect of cognitive ability. Importantly, we execute novel statistical methods that enable high-dimensional genetic correlation analysis, and compute high-resolution surface maps for the genetic correlations between educational attainment and vertex-wise morphological measurements. We conduct secondary analyses, using the UK Biobank verbal–numerical reasoning score, to confirm that variation in educational attainment that is genetically correlated with cortical morphology is related to differences in cognitive performance. Our analyses relate the genetic overlap between cognitive ability and cortical thickness measurements to bilateral primary motor cortex as well as predominantly left superior temporal cortex and proximal regions. These findings extend our understanding of the neurobiology that connects genetic variation to individual differences in educational attainment and cognitive performance.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Development and Decline of the Hippocampal Long-Axis Specialization and Differentiation During Encoding and Retrieval of Episodic Memories</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Change in hippocampal function is a major factor in life span development and decline of episodic memory. Evidence indicates a long-axis specialization where anterior hippocampus is more engaged during encoding than during retrieval, and posterior more engaged during retrieval than during encoding. We tested the life span trajectory of hippocampal long-axis episodic memory-related activity and functional connectivity (FC) in 496 participants (6.8–80.8 years) encoding and retrieving associative memories. We found evidence for a long-axis encoding–retrieval specialization that declined linearly during development and aging, eventually vanishing in the older adults. This was mainly driven by age effects on retrieval, which was associated with gradually lower activity from childhood to adulthood, followed by positive age relationships until 70 years. This pattern of age effects characterized task engagement regardless of memory success or failure. Especially for retrieval, children engaged posterior hippocampus more than anterior, while anterior was relatively more activated already in teenagers. Significant intrahippocampal connectivity was found during task, which declined with age. The results suggest that hippocampal long-axis differentiation and communication during episodic memory tasks develop rapidly during childhood, are different in older compared with younger adults, and that the age effects are related to task engagement, not the successful retrieval of episodic memories specifically.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Individuals from different social groups interpret the world in different ways. This study explores the neural basis of these group differences using a paradigm that simulates natural viewing conditions. Our aim was to determine if group differences could be found in sensory regions involved in the perception of the world or were evident in higher-level regions that are important for the interpretation of sensory information. We measured brain responses from 2 groups of football supporters, while they watched a video of matches between their teams. The time-course of response was then compared between individuals supporting the same (within-group) or the different (between-group) team. We found high intersubject correlations in low-level and high-level regions of the visual brain. However, these regions of the brain did not show any group differences. Regions that showed higher correlations for individuals from the same group were found in a network of frontal and subcortical brain regions. The interplay between these regions suggests a range of cognitive processes from motor control to social cognition and reward are important in the establishment of social groups. These results suggest that group differences are primarily reflected in regions involved in the evaluation and interpretation of the sensory input.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>Recent advances in Ca2+ imaging have given neuroscientists a tool to follow the activity of large numbers of individual neurons simultaneously in vivo in the brains of animals as they are presented with sensory stimulation, respond to environmental challenges, and engage in behaviors. The Ca2+ sensors used to transduce changes in cellular Ca2+ into changes in fluorescence must bind Ca2+ to produce a signal. By binding Ca2+, these sensors can act as buffers, often reducing the magnitude of a Ca2+ change severalfold, and producing a proportional slowing of the rates of change.</description>

	<description>Millisecond variations in spiking patterns can radically alter motor behavior, suggesting that traditional rate-based theories of motor control require revision. The importance of spike timing in sensorimotor control arises from dynamic interactions between the nervous system, muscles, and the body. New mechanisms, model systems, and theories are revealing how these interactions shape behavior.</description>

	<description>The auditory modality is fundamentally a temporal sense that requires analysis of changes in sound signals on timescales ranging from microseconds to minutes. To generate a faithful representation of changes in sound intensity and frequency over time, sound offsets (disappearances) as well as sound onsets (appearances) must be encoded by the auditory system. We review here the computational significance, perceptual roles, anatomical locations, and cellular and network origins of sound-offset responses in the mammalian auditory brain.</description>

	<description>Sensorimotor predictions are essential for adaptive behavior. In natural environments, events that demand sensorimotor predictions unfold across many timescales, and corresponding temporal predictions (either explicit or implicit) should therefore emerge in brain dynamics. Neuronal oscillations are scale-specific processes found in several frequency bands. They underlie periodicity in sensorimotor processing and can represent temporal predictions via their phase dynamics. These processes build upon endogenous neural rhythmicity and adapt in response to exogenous timing demands.</description>

	<description>The rate of affective disorder is substantially higher in women than in men, and considerable evidence points to the actions of ovarian hormones in mediating this disparity. In this Opinion, we discuss the hypothesis that cyclic changes in ovarian hormone levels produce cyclic alterations in connectivity between the intrinsic networks of the brain. These alterations produce specific temporal windows within the menstrual cycle when internetwork connectivity is increased, associated with increased stress reactivity and better memory for unpleasant, arousing events, leading to increased negative mood and susceptibility to affective disorder.</description>

	<description>Over the 40 years that TINS has been in existence, there has been substantial progress in understanding the types, organisation, and neural mechanisms of memory. The selectivity of memory maintenance and retention remains a puzzle, and we here summarise two contributions of our own research to this enigma: the striking impact of the novelty and surprise often of other events happening around the time that a new memory is encoded and how activated prior knowledge guides the updating process that characterises aspects of memory consolidation.</description>

	<description>The neocortex is one of the most distinctive structures of the mammalian brain, yet also one of the most varied in terms of both size and organization. Multiple processes have contributed to this variability, including evolutionary mechanisms (i.e., alterations in gene sequence) that alter the size, organization, and connections of neocortex, and activity dependent mechanisms that can also modify these same features. Thus, changes to the neocortex can occur over different time-scales, including within a single generation.</description>

	<description>The ability to detect time intervals and temporal patterns is critical to some of the most fundamental computations the brain performs, including the ability to communicate and appraise a dynamically changing environment. Many of these computations take place on the scale of tens to hundreds of milliseconds. Electrophysiological evidence shows that some neurons respond selectively to duration, interval, rate, or order. Because the time constants of many time-varying neural and synaptic properties, including short-term synaptic plasticity (STP), are also in the range of tens to hundreds of milliseconds, they are strong candidates to underlie the formation of temporally selective neurons.</description>

	<description>GABAergic interneurons, which are highly diverse, have long been thought to contribute to the timing of neural activity as well as to the generation and shaping of brain rhythms. GABAergic activity is crucial not only for entrainment of oscillatory activity across a neural population, but also for precise regulation of the timing of action potentials and the suppression of slow-timescale correlations. The diversity of inhibition provides the potential for flexible regulation of patterned activity, but also poses a challenge to identifying the elements of excitatory–inhibitory interactions underlying network engagement.</description>

	<description>The rotation of the Earth around its axis causes periodic exposure of half of its surface to sunlight. This daily recurring event has been internalized in most organisms in the form of cellular circadian clock mechanisms. These cellular clocks are synchronized with each other in various ways to establish circadian networks that build the circadian program in tissues and organs, coordinating physiology and behavior in the entire organism. In the mammalian brain, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) receives light information via the retina and synchronizes its own neuronal clocks to the light signal.</description>

	<description>Concussions/mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) represent a major public health concern due to persistent behavioral and neurological effects. The mechanisms by which concussions lead to such effects are partly attributable to an hyperacute indiscriminate glutamate release. Cerebral microdialysis studies in rodents reported a peak of extracellular glutamate 10 minutes after injury. Microdialysis has the advantage of being one of the few techniques allowing the quantification of neurotransmitters in vivo and at different time points following injury. In addition to the clear advantages afforded by microdialysis, the Wayne State weight-drop model induces an impact on the skull of a subject unrestrained by the fall of a weight. The latter model allows rapid acceleration and deceleration of the head and torso, an essential feature in human craniocerebral trauma and a factor that is missing from many existing animal concussion models. In the present study, we applied the Wayne State procedure and microdialysis to document, in awake rats, the acute changes in extracellular hippocampal glutamate and GABA levels resulting from concussive trauma. We studied the dorsal CA1 hippocampal region as it contains a high density of glutamatergic terminal and receptors, thus making it vulnerable to excitotoxic insult. Using HPLC, dialysate levels of hippocampal glutamate and GABA were measured in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats in 10 min increments for 60 min prior to, during and for 90 min following concussive trauma induced by the Wayne State weight-drop procedure. Sham control animals were treated in the same manner but without receiving the concussive trauma procedure. Our results show that concussive trauma is followed, within 10 min, by a robust, transient 3-fold increase in hippocampal glutamate levels; such changes were not seen in controls. In contrast, GABA levels were unaffected by the concussive trauma procedure. The findings derived from the approach used here are generally consistent with those of previous other studies. They also provide a crucial in vivo validation of the Wayne State procedure as a model with promising translational potential for pre-clinical studies on early therapeutic responses to concussion.</description>

	<description>The mesial prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex and the ventral striatum are key nodes of the human mesial fronto-striatal circuit involved in decision-making and executive function and pathological disorders. Here we ask whether deep wide-field repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) targeting the mesial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) influences resting state functional connectivity. In Study 1, we examined functional connectivity using resting state multi-echo and independent components analysis in 154 healthy subjects to characterize default connectivity in the MPFC and mid-cingulate cortex (MCC). In Study 2, we used inhibitory, 1 Hz deep rTMS with the H7-coil targeting MPFC and dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) in a separate group of 20 healthy volunteers and examined pre- and post-TMS functional connectivity using seed-based and independent components analysis. In Study 1, we show that MPFC and MCC have distinct patterns of functional connectivity with MPFC-ventral striatum showing negative, whereas MCC-ventral striatum showing positive functional connectivity. Low-frequency rTMS decreased functional connectivity of MPFC and dACC with the ventral striatum. We further showed enhanced connectivity between MCC and ventral striatum. These findings emphasize how deep inhibitory rTMS using the H7-coil can influence underlying network functional connectivity by decreasing connectivity of the targeted MPFC regions, thus potentially enhancing response inhibition and decreasing drug cue reactivity processes relevant to addictions. The unexpected finding of enhanced default connectivity between MCC and ventral striatum may be related to the decreased influence and connectivity between the MPFC and MCC. These findings are highly relevant to the treatment of disorders relying on the mesio-prefrontal-cingulo-striatal circuit.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Maternal immune activation specifically increases diagonal domain volume in the rat brain during early postnatal development</title>

	<description>Maternal immune activation (MIA) is consistently associated with elevated risk for multiple psychiatric and neurological disorders in the affected offspring. Converging lines of evidence from humans and animal models suggest a link between MIA and early entry into an atypical neurodevelopmental trajectory characterised by time- and sex-dependent abnormalities in brain structure and function. However to date, no such studies have investigated the brain-wide impact of MIA in the early post-weaning period, a critical and dynamic window of brain development. To address this, we acquired high-resolution ex vivo structural and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) images from Wistar rat brains on postnatal day (PD) 21 following exposure to the viral mimetic poly (I:C) or sterile saline on gestational day (GD) 15 using a recently validated protocol. Using a combination of atlas-based segmentation and tensor based morphometry analysis we observed that MIA resulted in a significant increase in the relative volume of the diagonal domain (FDR q&amp;lt;0.1). Additional trend-level volume increases (p&amp;lt;0.05 uncorrected) were also found for the olfactory structures and preoptic area. Although not significant after FDR correction, we found trend-level evidence (p&amp;lt;0.05 uncorrected) for MIA x sex interactions in the volume of the diagonal domain, nucleus accumbens, pineal gland and anterior commissure. In contrast to volume, we found no evidence for microstructural alterations in our DTI dataset at PD21. These data provide new insights into the specific effects of MIA early in development, highlighting in particular, the diagonal domain as a target for future studies.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Relationship between MEG global dynamic functional network connectivity measures and symptoms in schizophrenia</title>

	<description>An investigation of differences in dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) of healthy controls (HC) versus that of schizophrenia patients (SP) was completed, using eyes-open resting state MEG data. The MEG analysis utilized a source-space activity estimate (MNE/dSPM) whose result was the input to a group spatial independent component analysis (ICA), on which the networks of our MEG dFNC analysis were based. We have previously reported that our MEG dFNC revealed that SP change between cognitive meta-states (repeating patterns of network correlations which are allowed to overlap in time) significantly more often and to states which are more different, relative to HC. Here, we extend our previous work to investigate the relationship between symptomology in SP and four meta-state metrics. We found a significant correlation between positive symptoms and the two meta-state statistics which showed significant differences between HC and SP. These two statistics quantified 1) how often individuals change state and 2) the total distance traveled within the state-space. We additionally found that a clustering of the meta-state metrics divides SP into groups which vary in symptomology. These results indicate specific relationships between symptomology and brain function for SP.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Venlafaxine stimulates PNN proteolysis and MMP-9 dependent enhancement of gamma power; relevance to antidepressant efficacy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/432419v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Drugs that target monoaminergic transmission represent a first-line treatment for major depression. Though a full understanding of the mechanisms that underlie antidepressant efficacy is lacking, evidence supports a role for enhanced excitatory transmission. This can occur through two non-mutually exclusive mechanisms. The first involves increased function of excitatory neurons through relatively direct mechanisms such as enhanced dendritic arborization. Another mechanism involves reduced inhibitory function, which occurs with the rapid antidepressant ketamine. Consistent with this, GABAergic interneuron-mediated cortical inhibition is linked to reduced gamma oscillatory power, a rhythm also diminished in depression. Remission of depressive symptoms correlates with restoration of gamma power. Due to strong excitatory input, reliable GABA release and fast firing, PV neurons represent critical pacemakers for synchronous oscillations. PV neurons also represent the predominant GABAergic population enveloped by perineuronal nets (PNNs), lattice-like structures that localize glutamatergic input. Disruption of PNNs enhances lateral diffusion of glutamate receptors, reduces PV excitability, and enhances gamma activity. Studies suggest that monoamine reuptake inhibitors reduce integrity of the PNN. Mechanisms by which these inhibitors reduce PNN integrity, however, remain largely unexplored. A better understanding of these issues might encourage development of therapeutics that best upregulate PNN modulating proteases. We observe that the serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine reduces PNN integrity in murine brain. Moreover, venlafaxine treated mice (30 mg/kg/day) show an increase in carbachol-induced gamma power in hippocampal slices. Studies with mice deficient in matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), a protease linked to PNN disruption in other settings, suggest that MMP-9 contributes to venlafaxine-enhanced gamma activity.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Dynamic Functional Network Connectivity In Schizophrenia With MEG And fMRI, Do Different Time Scales Tell A Different Story?</title>

	<description>The importance of how brain networks function together to create brain states has become increasingly recognized. Therefore, an investigation of eyes-open resting state dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) of healthy controls (HC) versus that of schizophrenia patients (SP) via both fMRI and a novel MEG pipeline was completed. The fMRI analysis used a spatial independent component analysis (ICA) to determine the networks on which the dFNC was based. The MEG analysis utilized a source-space activity estimate (MNE/dSPM) whose result was the input to a spatial ICA, on which the networks of the MEG dFNC was based. We found that dFNC measures reveal significant differences between HC and SP, which depended upon the imaging modality. Consistent with previous findings, a dFNC analysis predicated on fMRI data revealed HC and SP remain in different overall brain states (defined by a k-means clustering of network correlations) for significantly different periods of time, with SP spending less time in a highly-connected state. The MEG dFNC, in contrast, revealed group differences in more global statistics: SP changed between meta-states (k-means cluster states that are allowed to overlap in time) significantly more often and to states which were more different, relative to HC. MEG dFNC also revealed a highly connected state where a significant difference was observed in inter-individual variability, with greater variability among SP. Overall, our results show that fMRI and MEG reveal between-group functional connectivity differences in distinct ways, highlighting the utility of using each of the modalities individually, or potentially a combination of modalities, to better inform our understanding of disorders such as schizophrenia.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The effect of facial expression on contrast sensitivity: a behavioural investigation and extension of Hedger, Garner, &amp; Adams (2015).</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/432229v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>It has been argued that rapid visual processing for fearful face expressions is driven by the fact that effective contrast is higher in these faces compared to other expressions, when the contrast sensitivity function is taken into account (Hedger, Garner, &amp;amp; Adams, 2015). This proposal has been upheld by data from image analyses, but is yet to be tested at the behavioural level. The present study conducts a traditional contrast sensitivity task for face images of various facial expressions. Findings show that visual contrast thresholds do not differ for different facial expressions We re-conduct analysis of faces effective contrast, using the procedure developed by Hedger, Garner, &amp;amp; Adams (2015), and show that higher effective contrast in fearful face expressions relies on face images first being normalised for RMS contrast. When not normalised for RMS contrast, effective contrast in fear expressions is no different, or sometimes even lower, compared to other expressions. These findings are discussed in relation to the implications of contrast normalisation on the salience of face expressions in behavioural and neurophysiological experiments, and also the extent that natural physical differences between facial stimuli are masked during stimulus standardisation and normalisation.</description>

	<description>The cerebellum integrates sensory stimuli and motor actions to enable smooth coordination and motor learning. We use population imaging and single-cell electrophysiology while monitoring behavior to find the neural correlates of sensory and motor variables in the cerebellar Purkinje cell population during visually-driven behaviors in larval zebrafish. We find that Purkinje cells functionally cluster into three regions that receive similarly tuned, sensory climbing fiber input relating to distinct visual features. In contrast, the simple spike output of nearly all Purkinje cells is strongly driven by motor-related tail and eye signals. At rest, complex spikes modulate simple spike rates over hundreds of milliseconds in a cell-specific way, whereas during swimming, complex spikes have a very acute temporal effect on already high simple spike rates. Our findings highlight the importance of motor context for cerebellar computations and provide the first comprehensive description of sensorimotor coding across the Purkinje cell population during behavior.</description>

	<description>Understanding the function of a tissue requires knowing the spatial organization of its constituent cell types. In the cerebral cortex, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revealed the genome-wide expression patterns that define its many, closely related cell types, but cannot reveal their spatial arrangement. Here we introduce probabilistic cell typing by in situ sequencing (pciSeq), an approach that leverages prior scRNA-seq classification to identify cell types using multiplexed in situ RNA detection. We applied this method to map the inhibitory neurons of hippocampal area CA1, a cell system critical for memory function, for which ground truth is available from extensive prior work identifying the laminar organization of subtly differing cell types. Our method confidently identified 16 interneuron classes, in a spatial arrangement closely matching ground truth. This method will allow identifying the spatial organization of fine cell types across the brain and other tissues.</description>

	<description>Defects in DNA strand break repair can trigger seizures that are often intractable and life-threatening. However, the molecular mechanism/s by which unrepaired DNA breaks trigger seizures are unknown. Here, we show that hyperactivity of the DNA break sensor protein poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 is widespread in DNA single-strand break repair defective XRCC1-mutant mouse brain, including the hippocampus and cortex. We demonstrate elevated seizure-like activity in XRCC1-mutant hippocampus in vitro and increased seizures in vivo, and we show that Parp1 deletion reduces or prevents both. We also show that the increased seizures in Xrcc1 mutant mice result in juvenile mortality, and that Parp1 deletion extends the lifespan of these mice up to 25-fold. Parp1 hyperactivation is thus a major molecular mechanism by which unrepaired endogenous DNA strand breaks trigger disease pathology, including neurological seizures and death. These data implicate inhibitors of PARP activity as a possible therapeutic approach for the treatment of single-strand break induced neurodegenerative disease.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Presynaptic Endoplasmic Reticulum Contributes Crucially to Short-term Plasticity in Small Hippocampal Synapses</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/431866v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/431866v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Short-term plasticity (STP) of the presynaptic terminal maintains a brief history of activity experienced by the synapse that may otherwise remain unseen by the postsynaptic neuron. These synaptic changes are primarily regulated by calcium dynamics in the presynaptic terminal. A rapid increase in intracellular calcium is initiated by the opening of voltage-dependent calcium channels in response to depolarization, the main source of calcium required for vesicle fusion. Separately, electron-microscopic studies of hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses reveal the strong presence of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in all presynaptic terminals. However, the precise role of the ER in modifying STP at the presynaptic terminal remains unexplored. To investigate the contribution of ER in modulating calcium dynamics in small hippocampal boutons, we performed in silico experiments in a physiologically-realistic canonical synaptic geometry based on reconstructions of CA3-CA1 Schaffer collaterals in the rat hippocampus. The model predicts that presynaptic calcium stores are critical in generating the observed paired-pulse ratio (PPR) of normal CA3-CA1 synapses. In control synapses with intact ER, SERCA pumps act as additional calcium buffers, lowering the intrinsic release probability of vesicle release and increasing PPR. In addition, the presence of ER allows ongoing activity to trigger calcium influx from the presynaptic ER via ryanodine receptors (RyRs) and inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs). Intracellular stores and their associated machinery also allows a synapse with a low release probability to operate more reliably due to attenuation of calcium fluctuations. Finally, blocking ER activity in the presynaptic terminal mimics the pathological state of a low facilitating synapse characterized in animal models of Alzheimer's disease, and underscores the critical role played by presynaptic stores in normal function.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: There is no single functional atlas even for a single individual: Parcellation of the human brain is state dependent</title>

	<description>The goal of human brain mapping has long been to delineate the functional subunits in the brain and elucidate the functional role of each of these brain regions. Recent work has focused on whole-brain parcellation of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data to identify these subunits and create a functional atlas. Functional connectivity approaches to understand the brain at the network level, require such an atlas to assess connections between nodes and extract network properties. While no single functional atlas has emerged as the dominant atlas to date, there remains an underlying assumption that such an atlas exists. Using fMRI data from a highly sampled subject as well as two independent replication data sets, we demonstrate that functional atlases reconfigure substantially and in a meaningful manner, according to brain state.</description>

	<description>Current cognitive models of reading assume that word recognition involves the 'bottom-up' assembly of perceived low-level visual features into letters, letter combinations, and words. This rather inefficient strategy, however, is incompatible with neurophysiological theories of Bayesian-like predictive neural computations during perception. Here we propose that prior knowledge of the words in a language is used to 'explain away' redundant and highly expected parts of the percept. As a result, subsequent processing stages operate upon an optimized representation highlighting information relevant for word identification, i.e., the orthographic prediction error. We demonstrate empirically that the orthographic prediction error accounts for word recognition behavior. We then report neurophysiological data showing that this informationally optimized orthographic prediction error is processed around 200 ms after word-onset in the occipital cortex. The remarkable efficiency of reading, thus, is achieved by optimizing the mental representation of the visual percept, based on prior visual-orthographic knowledge.</description>

	<description>Component analysis is a powerful tool to identify dominant patterns of interactions in multivariate datasets. In the context of fMRI data, methods such as principal component analysis or independent component analysis have been used to identify the brain networks shaping functional connectivity (FC). Importantly, these approaches are static in the sense that they ignore the temporal information contained in fMRI time series. Therefore, the corresponding components provide a static characterization of FC. Building upon recent findings suggesting that FC dynamics encode richer information about brain functional organization, we use a dynamic extension of component analysis to identify dynamic modes (DMs) of fMRI time series. We demonstrate the feasibility and relevance of this approach using resting-state and motor-task fMRI data of 730 healthy subjects of the Human Connectome Project (HCP). In resting-state, dominant DMs have strong resemblance with classical resting-state networks, with an additional temporal characterization of the networks in terms of oscillatory periods and damping times. In motor-task conditions, dominant DMs reveal interactions between several brain areas, including but not limited to the posterior parietal cortex and primary motor areas, that are not found with classical activation maps. Finally, we identify two canonical components linking the temporal properties of the resting-state DMs with 158 behavioral and demographic HCP measures. Altogether, these findings illustrate the benefits of the proposed dynamic component analysis framework, making it a promising tool to characterize the spatio-temporal organization of brain activity.</description>

	<description>Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in the embryonic mammalian neocortex generate different neuronal subtypes sequentially. A long-standing hypothesis to account for this temporal fate specification process is that NPCs change their differentiation potential over time. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these temporal changes in NPC properties are poorly understood. Here we show that Neurogenin1 and Neurogenin2 (Neurog1/2), two proneural transcription factors expressed in NPCs throughout cortical neurogenesis, specify the identity of one of the first cortical neuron subtypes generated, layer 6 cortico-thalamic neurons (CTNs). We found that Neurog1/2 specify the CTN fate through regulation of the cortical fate determinants Fezf2 and Foxp2 and that this Neurog-induced programme becomes inactive after the period of CTN production. Two independent mechanisms contribute to the arrest of CTN neuron generation at the end of layer 6 neurogenesis, including a reduction in the transcriptional activity of Neurog1/2 and the deposition of epigenetic repressive modifications mediated by Polycomb repressive complexes at the Foxp2 gene. Therefore, the duration of production of a cortical neuron subtype is controlled by multiple locking mechanisms involving both transcriptional and epigenetic processes.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Diverse Pathophysiological Processes Converge on Network Disruption in Mania</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/430868v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/430868v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: Neuroimaging of psychiatric disease is challenged by the difficulty of establishing the causal role of neuroimaging abnormalities. Lesions that cause mania present a unique opportunity to understand how brain network disruption may cause mania in both lesions and in bipolar disorder. Methods: A literature search revealed 23 case reports with imaged lesions that caused mania in patients without history of bipolar disorder. We traced these lesions and examined resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rsfMRI) connectivity to these lesions and control lesions to find networks that would be disrupted specifically by mania-causing lesions. The results were then used as regions-of-interest to examine rsfMRI connectivity in patients with bipolar disorder (n=16) who underwent imaging longitudinally across states of both mania and euthymia alongside a cohort of healthy participants scanned longitudinally. We then sought to replicate these results in independent cohorts of manic (n=26) and euthymic (n=21) participants with bipolar disorder. Results: Mania-inducing lesions overlap significantly in network connectivity. Mania-causing lesions selectively disrupt networks that include orbitofrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and temporal lobes. In bipolar disorder, the manic state was reflected in strong, significant, and specific disruption in network communication between these regions and regions implicated in bipolar pathophysiology: the amygdala and ventro-lateral prefrontal cortex. Limitations: The was heterogeneity in the clinical characterization of mania causing lesions. Conclusions: Lesions causing mania demonstrate shared and specific network disruptions. These disruptions are also observed in bipolar mania and suggest a convergence of multiple disorders on shared circuit dysfunction to cause mania.</description>

	<description>In this work we demonstrate how Finsler geometry -- and specifically the related geodesic tractography -- can be levied to analyze structural connections between different brain regions. We present new theoretical developments which support the definition of a novel Finsler metric and associated connectivity measures, based on closely related works on the Riemannian framework for diffusion MRI. Using data from the Human Connectome Project, as well as population data from an autism spectrum disorder study, we demonstrate that this new Finsler metric, together with the new connectivity measures, results in connectivity maps that are much closer to known tract anatomy compared to previous geodesic connectivity methods. Our implementation can be used to compute geodesic distance and connectivity maps for segmented areas, and is publicly available.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Marcus A. Triplett, Lilach Avitan, Geoffrey J. Goodhill&lt;/p&gt;

Spontaneous activity is a fundamental characteristic of the developing nervous system. Intriguingly, it often takes the form of multiple structured assemblies of neurons. Such assemblies can form even in the absence of afferent input, for instance in the zebrafish optic tectum after bilateral enucleation early in life. While the development of neural assemblies based on structured afferent input has been theoretically well-studied, it is less clear how they could arise in systems without afferent input. Here we show that a recurrent network of binary threshold neurons with initially random weights can form neural assemblies based on a simple Hebbian learning rule. Over development the network becomes increasingly modular while being driven by initially unstructured spontaneous activity, leading to the emergence of neural assemblies. Surprisingly, the set of neurons making up each assembly then continues to evolve, despite the number of assemblies remaining roughly constant. In the mature network assembly activity builds over several timesteps before the activation of the full assembly, as recently observed in calcium-imaging experiments. Our results show that Hebbian learning is sufficient to explain the emergence of highly structured patterns of neural activity in the absence of structured input.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-ItVQC45_AI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Reproductive endocrine disorders are prominent comorbidities of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in both men and women. The neural mechanisms underlying these comorbidities remain unclear, but hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons may be involved. Here, we report the first direct demonstrations of aberrant GnRH neuron function in an animal model of epilepsy. Recordings of GnRH neuron firing and excitability were made in acute mouse brain slices prepared two months after intrahippocampal injection of kainate (KA) or control saline, a well-established TLE model in which most females develop comorbid estrous cycle disruption. GnRH neurons from control females showed elevated firing and excitability on estrus compared with diestrus. By contrast, cells from KA-injected females that developed prolonged, disrupted estrous cycles (KA-long) showed the reverse pattern. Firing rates of cells from KA-injected females that maintained regular cycles (KA-regular) were not different from controls on diestrus, but were reduced on estrus. In KA-injected males, only GnRH neurons in the medial septum displayed elevated firing. In contrast to the diestrus versus estrus and sex-specific changes in firing, GnRH neuron intrinsic excitability was elevated in all KA-injected groups, indicating a role for afferent synaptic and neuromodulatory inputs in shaping overall changes in firing activity. Furthermore, KA-injected females showed cycle-stage-specific changes in circulating sex steroids on diestrus and estrus that also differed between KA-long and KA-regular groups. Together, these findings reveal that the effects of epilepsy on the neural control of reproduction are dynamic across the estrous cycle, distinct in association with comorbid estrous cycle disruption severity, and sex-specific.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: A Functionally Defined In Vivo Astrocyte Population Identified by c-Fos Activation in a Mouse Model of Multiple Sclerosis Modulated by S1P Signaling: Immediate-Early Astrocytes (ieAstrocytes)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes have prominent roles in central nervous system (CNS) function and disease, with subpopulations defined primarily by morphologies and molecular markers often determined in cell culture. Here, we identify an &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; astrocyte subpopulation termed immediate-early astrocytes (&lt;i&gt;ieAstrocytes&lt;/i&gt;) that is defined by functional c-Fos activation during CNS disease development. An unbiased screen for CNS cells showing c-Fos activation during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model for multiple sclerosis (MS), was developed by using inducible, TetTag c-Fos reporter mice that label activated cells with a temporally stable, nuclear green fluorescent protein (GFP). Four-dimensional (3D over time) c-Fos activation maps in the spinal cord were produced by combining tissue clearing (iDISCO) and confocal microscopy that identified onset and expansion of GFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cell populations during EAE. More than 95% of the GFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells showed glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity—in contrast to absent or rare labeling of neurons, microglia, and infiltrating immune cells—which constituted &lt;i&gt;ieAstrocytes&lt;/i&gt; that linearly increased in number with progression of EAE. &lt;i&gt;ieAstrocyte&lt;/i&gt; formation was reduced by either astrocyte-specific genetic removal of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) or pharmacological inhibition by fingolimod (FTY720), an FDA-approved MS medicine that can functionally antagonize S1P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ieAstrocyte&lt;/i&gt;s thus represent a functionally defined subset of disease-linked astrocytes that are the first and predominant CNS cell population activated during EAE, and that track with disease severity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Their reduction by a disease-modifying agent supports their therapeutic relevance to MS and potentially other neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Cell cryopreservation improves reproducibility and enables flexibility in experimental design. Although conventional freezing methodologies have been used to preserve primary neurons, poor cell viability and reduced survival severely limited their utility. We screened several high-performance freezing media and found that CryoStor10 (CS10) provided superior cryoprotection to primary mouse embryonic cortical neurons compared to other commercially-available or traditional reagents, permitting the recovery of 68.8% of cells relative to a fresh dissection. We characterized developmental, morphometric, and functional indicators of neuron maturation and found that, without exception, neurons recovered from cryostorage in CS10 media faithfully recapitulate &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; neurodevelopment in-step with neurons obtained by fresh dissection. Our method establishes cryopreserved neurons as a reliable, efficient, and equivalent model to fresh neuron cultures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Loss of Mecp2 Causes Atypical Synaptic and Molecular Plasticity of Parvalbumin-Expressing Interneurons Reflecting Rett Syndrome-Like Sensorimotor Defects</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Rett syndrome (RTT) is caused in most cases by loss-of-function mutations in the X-linked gene encoding methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (&lt;i&gt;MECP2&lt;/i&gt;). Understanding the pathological processes impacting sensory-motor control represents a major challenge for clinical management of individuals affected by RTT, but the underlying molecular and neuronal modifications remain unclear. We find that symptomatic male &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; knockout (KO) mice show atypically elevated parvalbumin (PV) expression in both somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortices together with excessive excitatory inputs converging onto PV-expressing interneurons (INs). In accordance, high-speed voltage-sensitive dye imaging shows reduced amplitude and spatial spread of synaptically induced neuronal depolarizations in S1 of &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; KO mice. Moreover, motor learning-dependent changes of PV expression and structural synaptic plasticity typically occurring on PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; INs in M1 are impaired in symptomatic &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; KO mice. Finally, we find similar abnormalities of PV networks plasticity in symptomatic female &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mice. These results indicate that in &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; mutant mice the configuration of PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; INs network is shifted toward an atypical plasticity state in relevant cortical areas compatible with the sensory-motor dysfunctions characteristics of RTT.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A rotation-equivariant convolutional neural network model of primary visual cortex. (arXiv:1809.10504v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10504</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Classical models describe primary visual cortex (V1) as a filter bank of
orientation-selective linear-nonlinear (LN) or energy models, but these models
fail to predict neural responses to natural stimuli accurately. Recent work
shows that models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) lead to much
more accurate predictions, but it remains unclear which features are extracted
by V1 neurons beyond orientation selectivity and phase invariance. Here we work
towards systematically studying V1 computations by categorizing neurons into
groups that perform similar computations. We present a framework to identify
common features independent of individual neurons' orientation selectivity by
using a rotation-equivariant convolutional neural network, which automatically
extracts every feature at multiple different orientations. We fit this model to
responses of a population of 6000 neurons to natural images recorded in mouse
primary visual cortex using two-photon imaging. We show that our
rotation-equivariant network not only outperforms a regular CNN with the same
number of feature maps, but also reveals a number of common features shared by
many V1 neurons, which deviate from the typical textbook idea of V1 as a bank
of Gabor filters. Our findings are a first step towards a powerful new tool to
study the nonlinear computations in V1.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Characterizing complex networks using Entropy-degree diagrams: unveiling changes in functional brain connectivity induced by Ayahuasca. (arXiv:1809.10301v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10301</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10301</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Open problems abound in the theory of complex networks, which has found
successful application to diverse fields of science. With the aim of further
advancing the understanding of the brain's functional connectivity, we propose
to evaluate a network metric which we term the geodesic entropy. This entropy,
in a way that can be made precise, quantifies the Shannon entropy of the
distance distribution to a specific node from all other nodes. Measurements of
geodesic entropy allow for the characterization of the structural information
of a network that takes into account the distinct role of each node into the
network topology. The measurement and characterization of this structural
information has the potential to greatly improve our understanding of sustained
activity and other emergent behaviors in networks, such as self-organized
criticality sometimes seen in such contexts. We apply these concepts and
methods to study the effects of how the psychedelic Ayahuasca affects the
functional connectivity of the human brain. We show that the geodesic entropy
is able to differentiate the functional networks of the human brain in two
different states of consciousness in the resting state: (i) the ordinary waking
state and (ii) a state altered by ingestion of the Ayahuasca. The entropy of
the nodes of brain networks from subjects under the influence of Ayahuasca
diverge significantly from those of the ordinary waking state. The functional
brain networks from subjects in the altered state have, on average, a larger
geodesic entropy compared to the ordinary state. We conclude that geodesic
entropy is a useful tool for analyzing complex networks and discuss how and why
it may bring even further valuable insights into the study of the human brain
and other empirical networks.

	<description>White adipose tissue (WAT) remodeling is dictated by coordinated interactions between adipocytes and resident stromal-vascular cells; however, the functional heterogeneity of adipose stromal cells has remained unresolved. We combined single-cell RNA-sequencing and FACS to identify and isolate functionally distinct subpopulations of PDGFRβ+ stromal cells within visceral WAT of adult mice. LY6C- CD9- PDGFRβ+ cells represent highly adipogenic visceral adipocyte precursor cells (‘APCs’), whereas LY6C+ PDGFRβ+ cells represent fibro-inflammatory progenitors (‘FIPs’). FIPs lack adipogenic capacity, display pro-fibrogenic/pro-inflammatory phenotypes, and can exert an anti-adipogenic effect on APCs. The pro-inflammatory phenotype of PDGFRβ+ cells is regulated, at least in part, by NR4A nuclear receptors. These data highlight the functional heterogeneity of visceral WAT perivascular cells, and provide insight into potential cell-cell interactions impacting adipogenesis and inflammation. These improved strategies to isolate FIPs and APCs from visceral WAT will facilitate the study of physiological WAT remodeling and mechanisms leading to metabolic dysfunction.</description>

Biological data sets are typically characterized by high dimensionality and low effect sizes. A powerful method for detecting systematic differences between experimental conditions in such multivariate data sets is multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), particularly pattern classification. However, in virtually all applications, data from the classes that correspond to the conditions of interest are not homogeneous but contain subclasses. Such subclasses can for example arise from individual subjects that contribute multiple data points, or from correlations of items within classes. We show here that in multivariate data that have subclasses nested within its class structure, these subclasses introduce systematic information that improves classifiability beyond what is expected by the size of the class difference. We analytically prove that this subclass bias systematically inflates correct classification rates (CCRs) of linear classifiers depending on the number of subclasses as well as on the portion of variance induced by the subclasses. In simulations, we demonstrate that subclass bias is highest when between-class effect size is low and subclass variance high. This bias can be reduced by increasing the total number of subclasses. However, we can account for the subclass bias by using permutation tests that explicitly consider the subclass structure of the data. We illustrate our result in several experiments that recorded human EEG activity, demonstrating that parametric statistical tests as well as typical trial-wise permutation fail to determine significance of classification outcomes correctly.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tMGb6u-BxMQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Multiscale analysis of autotroph-heterotroph interactions in a high-temperature microbial community</title>

Interactions among microbial community members can lead to emergent properties, such as enhanced productivity, stability, and robustness. Iron-oxide mats in acidic (pH 2–4), high-temperature (&amp;gt; 65 °C) springs of Yellowstone National Park contain relatively simple microbial communities and are well-characterized geochemically. Consequently, these communities are excellent model systems for studying the metabolic activity of individual populations and key microbial interactions. The primary goals of the current study were to integrate data collected &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; with &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; calculations across process-scales encompassing enzymatic activity, cellular metabolism, community interactions, and ecosystem biogeochemistry, as well as to predict and quantify the functional limits of autotroph-heterotroph interactions. Metagenomic and transcriptomic data were used to reconstruct carbon and energy metabolisms of an important autotroph (&lt;i&gt;Metallosphaera yellowstonensis&lt;/i&gt;) and heterotroph (&lt;i&gt;Geoarchaeum&lt;/i&gt; sp. OSPB) from the studied Fe(III)-oxide mat communities. Standard and hybrid elementary flux mode and flux balance analyses of metabolic models predicted cellular- and community-level metabolic acclimations to simulated environmental stresses, respectively. &lt;i&gt;In situ&lt;/i&gt; geochemical analyses, including oxygen depth-profiles, Fe(III)-oxide deposition rates, stable carbon isotopes and mat biomass concentrations, were combined with cellular models to explore autotroph-heterotroph interactions important to community structure-function. Integration of metabolic modeling with &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; measurements, including the relative population abundance of autotrophs to heterotrophs, demonstrated that Fe(III)-oxide mat communities operate at their maximum total community growth rate (i.e. sum of autotroph and heterotroph growth rates), as opposed to net community growth rate (i.e. total community growth rate subtracting autotroph consumed by heterotroph), as predicted from the maximum power principle. Integration of multiscale data with ecological theory provides a basis for predicting autotroph-heterotroph interactions and community-level cellular organization.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9cziYmlDKfI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Distal dendritic enrichment of HCN1 channels in hippocampal CA1 is promoted by estrogen, but does not require Reelin</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0258-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;HCN1 compartmentalization in CA1 pyramidal cells, essential for hippocampal information processing, is believed to be controlled by the extracellular matrix protein Reelin (Kupferman et al., 2014). Expression of Reelin, in turn, is stimulated by 17β-estradiol (E2). In this study, we therefore tested whether E2 regulates the compartmentalization of HCN1 in CA1 via Reelin. In organotypic entorhino-hippocampal cultures, we found that E2 promotes the HCN1 distal dendritic enrichment via the G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor GPER1, but apparently independent of Reelin, because GST-RAP, known to reduce reelin signaling, did not prevent E2-induced HCN1 enrichment in distal CA1. We therefore re-examined the role of Reelin for the regulation of HCN1 compartmentalization and could not detect effects of reduced Reelin signaling on HCN1 distribution in CA1, neither in the (developmental) slice culture model, nor in tamoxifen-inducible conditional &lt;i&gt;reelin&lt;/i&gt; knockout mice during adulthood. We conclude that for HCN1 channel compartmentalization in CA1 pyramidal cells, Reelin is not as essential as previously proposed and E2-effects on HCN1 distribution in CA1 are mediated by mechanisms that do not involve Reelin. Because HCN1 localization was not altered at different phases of the estrous cycle, gonadally-derived estradiol is unlikely to regulate HCN1 channel compartmentalization, while the pattern of immunoreactivity of aromatase, the final enzyme of estradiol synthesis, argues for a role of local hippocampal E2 synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Mechanisms of learning and memory require a fine-tuned interplay between ion channels on hippocampal neurons. Among these, CA1 pyramidal cells have a crucial position, as they integrate information from various hippocampal and extra-hippocampal sources. Identifying factors that influence the function of ion channels, such as the HCN1 channels, which filter entorhinal synaptic input, may therefore help to better understand processes that underlie learning and memory. Here we show that the dendritic localization of HCN1 channels, a critical determinant of their function, is influenced by estrogen (E2), thus bringing attention to the modulatory roles of sex hormones on hippocampal information processing, which are yet poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: The role of interleukin-10 in mediating the effect of immune challenge on mouse gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons in vivo</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Immune challenge alters neural functioning via cytokine production. Inflammation has profound impact on the central regulation of fertility, but the mechanisms involved are not clearly defined. The anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 is responsible for balancing the immune response in the brain. To examine whether IL-10 has an effect on the function of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, we first examined the effect of immune responses with distinct cytokine profiles, such as the T-cell-dependent (TD) and T-cell-independent (TI) B-cell response. We investigated the effect of the TD and TI immune responses on ERK1/2 phosphorylation in GnRH neurons by administering fluorescein-isothiocyanate/keyhole-limpet-hemocyanin (KLH-FITC) or dextran-FITC to female mice. Although dextran-FITC had no effect, KLH-FITC induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in GnRH neurons after 6 days. KLH-FITC treatment increased the levels of IL-10 in the hypothalamus, but this treatment did not cause lymphocyte infiltration or an increase in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In IL-10 KO mice, KLH-FITC-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the GnRH neurons was absent. We also showed that in IL-10 KO mice, the estrous cycle was disrupted. Perforated patch-clamp recordings from GnRH-GFP neurons, IL-10 immunohistochemistry and in vitro experiments on acute brain slices revealed that IL-10 can directly alter GnRH neuron firing and induce ERK1/2 phosphorylation. These observations demonstrate that IL-10 plays a role in influencing signaling of GnRH neurons in the TD immune response. These results also provide the first evidence that IL-10 can directly alter the function of GnRH neurons and may help the maintenance of the integrity of the estrous cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; The anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 plays a role in maintaining a balanced immune response in the brain. Although clinical studies have demonstrated that IL-10 influences fertility, the impact of IL-10 on gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons is unknown. Our results demonstrate that T cell-dependent (TD) immune challenge induces ERK1/2 phosphorylation in GnRH neurons via IL-10. We provide the first evidence that IL-10 directly regulates the firing and signaling of GnRH neurons. Our results indicate that IL-10-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in GnRH neurons might be associated with the maintenance of the estrous cycle in bacterial/viral infection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The reproducibility of scientific research has become a point of critical
concern. We argue that openness and transparency are critical for
reproducibility, and we outline an ecosystem for open and transparent science
that has emerged within the human neuroimaging community. We discuss the range
of open data sharing resources that have been developed for neuroimaging data,
and the role of data standards (particularly the Brain Imaging Data Structure)
in enabling the automated sharing, processing, and reuse of large neuroimaging
datasets. We outline how the open-source Python language has provided the basis
for a data science platform that enables reproducible data analysis and
visualization. We also discuss how new advances in software engineering, such
as containerization, provide the basis for greater reproducibility in data
analysis. The emergence of this new ecosystem provides an example for many
areas of science that are currently struggling with reproducibility.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding neuronal communication is fundamental in neuroscience but there
are few methodologies offering detailed analysis for well-controlled
conditions. By interfacing microElectrode arrays with microFluidics ({\mu}EF
devices), it is possible to compartmentalize neuronal cultures with a specified
alignment of axons and microelectrodes. This setup allows extracellular
recordings of spike propagation with high signal-to-noise ratio over the course
of several weeks. Addressing these {\mu}EF systems we developed an advanced,
yet easy-to-use, open-source computational tool, {\mu}SpikeHunter, which
provides detailed quantification of several communication-related properties
such as propagation velocity, conduction failure, spike timings, and coding
mechanisms. The combination of {\mu}EF devices and {\mu}SpikeHunter can be used
in the context of standard neuronal cultures or with co-culture configurations
where, for example, communication between sensory neurons and other cell types
is monitored and assessed. The ability to analyze axonal signals (in a
user-friendly, time-efficient, high-throughput manner) opens doors to new
approaches to studies of peripheral innervation, neural coding, and
neuroregeneration approaches, among many others. We demonstrate the use of
{\mu}SpikeHunter in dorsal root ganglion neurons where we analyze the presence
of anterograde signals in {\mu}EF devices.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the only major cause of mortality in the world
without an effective disease modifying treatment. Evidence supporting the so
called disconnection hypothesis suggests that functional connectivity
biomarkers may have clinical potential for early detection of AD. However,
known issues with low test-retest reliability and signal to noise in functional
connectivity may prevent accuracy and subsequent predictive capacity. We
validate the utility of a novel principal component based diagnostic
identifiability framework to increase separation in functional connectivity
across the Alzheimer's spectrum by identifying and reconstructing FC using only
AD sensitive components or connectivity modes. We show that this framework (1)
increases test-retest correspondence and (2) allows for better separation, in
functional connectivity, of diagnostic groups both at the whole brain and
individual resting state network level. Finally, we evaluate a posteriori the
association between connectivity mode weights with longitudinal neurocognitive

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Tutorial: Neuromorphic spiking neural networks for temporal learning. (arXiv:1809.09707v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spiking neural networks (SNN) as time-dependent hypotheses consisting of
spiking nodes (neurons) and directed edges (synapses) are believed to offer
unique solutions to reward prediction tasks and the related feedback that are
classified as reinforcement learning. Generally, temporal difference (TD)
learning renders it possible to optimize a model network to predict the delayed
reward in an ad hoc manner. Neuromorphic SNNs--networks built using dedicated
hardware--particularly leverage such TD learning for not only reward prediction
but also temporal sequence prediction in a physical time domain. In this
tutorial, such learning in a physical time domain is referred to as temporal
learning to distinguish it from conventional TD learning-based methods that
generally involve algorithmic (rather than physical) time. This tutorial
addresses neuromorphic SNNs for temporal learning from the scratch. It first
concerns general characteristics of SNNs including spiking neurons and
information coding schemes and then moves on to temporal learning including its
general concept, feasible algorithms, and their association with
neurophysiological learning rules that have intensively been enriched for the
last few decades.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Development of spatial suppression surrounding the focus of visual attention. (arXiv:1809.09700v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09700</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09700</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The capacity to filter out irrelevant information from our environment is
critical to efficient processing. Yet, during development, when building a
knowledge base of the world is occurring, the ability to selectively allocate
attentional resources is limited (e.g., Amso &amp;amp; Scerif, 2015). In adulthood,
research has demonstrated that surrounding the spatial location of attentional
focus is a suppressive field, resulting from top-down attention promoting the
processing of relevant stimuli and inhibiting surrounding distractors (e.g.,
Hopf et al., 2006). It is not fully known, however, whether this phenomenon
manifests in development. In the current study, we examined whether spatial
suppression surrounding the focus of visual attention is exhibited in
developmental age groups. Participants between 12 and 27 years of age exhibited
spatial suppression surrounding their focus of visual attention. Their accuracy
increased as a function of the separation distance between a spatially cued
(and attended) target and a second target, suggesting that a ring of
suppression surrounded the attended target. When a central cue was instead
presented and therefore attention was no longer spatially cued, surround
suppression was not observed, indicating that our initial findings of
suppression were indeed related to the focus of attention. Attentional surround
suppression was not observed in 8- to 11-years-olds, even with a longer spatial
cue presentation time, demonstrating that the lack of the effect at these ages
is not due to slowed attentional feedback processes. Our findings demonstrate
that top-down attentional processes are still immature until approximately 12
years of age, and that they continue to be refined throughout adolescence,
converging well with previous research on attentional development.

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Optogenetics enables real-time spatiotemporal control over spiral wave dynamics in an excitable cardiac system</title>

	<description>Propagation of non-linear waves is key to the functioning of diverse biological systems. Such waves can organize into spirals, rotating around a core, whose properties determine the overall wave dynamics. Theoretically, manipulation of a spiral wave core should lead to full spatiotemporal control over its dynamics. However, this theory lacks supportive evidence (even at a conceptual level), making it thus a long-standing hypothesis. Here, we propose a new phenomenological concept that involves artificially dragging spiral waves by their cores, to prove the afore-mentioned hypothesis &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt;, with subsequent &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; validation in optogenetically-modified monolayers of rat atrial cardiomyocytes. We thereby connect previously established, but unrelated concepts of spiral wave attraction, anchoring and unpinning to demonstrate that core manipulation, through controlled displacement of heterogeneities in excitable media, allows forced movement of spiral waves along pre-defined trajectories. Consequently, we impose real-time spatiotemporal control over spiral wave dynamics in a biological system.</description>

	<description>Fast synaptic inhibition in the nervous system depends on the transmembrane flux of Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ions based on the neuronal Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; driving force. Established theories regarding the determinants of Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; driving force have recently been questioned. Here we present biophysical models of Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis using the pump-leak model. Using numerical and novel analytic solutions, we demonstrate that the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase, ion conductances, impermeant anions, electrodiffusion, water fluxes and cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs) play roles in setting the Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; driving force. Our models, together with experimental validation, show that while impermeant anions can contribute to setting [Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; in neurons, they have a negligible effect on the driving force for Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; locally and cell-wide. In contrast, we demonstrate that CCCs are well-suited for modulating Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; driving force and hence inhibitory signalling in neurons. Our findings reconcile recent experimental findings and provide a framework for understanding the interplay of different chloride regulatory processes in neurons.</description>

	<description>Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are molecules exposed or released by dead cells that trigger or modulate immunity and tissue repair. In vertebrates, the cytoskeletal component F-actin is a DAMP specifically recognised by DNGR-1, an innate immune receptor. Previously we suggested that actin is also a DAMP in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; by inducing STAT-dependent (Srinivasan et al., 2016). Here, we revise that conclusion and report that α-actinin is far more potent than actin at inducing the same STAT response and can be found in trace amounts in actin preparations. Recombinant expression of actin or α-actinin in bacteria demonstrated that only α-actinin could drive the expression of STAT target genes in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. The response to injected α-actinin required the same signalling cascade that we had identified in our previous work using actin preparations. Taken together, these data indicate that α-actinin rather than actin drives STAT activation when injected into &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

	<description>Germ granules are non-membranous ribonucleoprotein granules deemed the hubs for post-transcriptional gene regulation and functionally linked to germ cell fate across species. Little is known about the physical properties of germ granules and how these relate to germ cell function. Here we study two types of germ granules in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; embryo: cytoplasmic germ granules that instruct primordial germ cells (PGCs) formation and nuclear germ granules within early PGCs with unknown function. We show that cytoplasmic and nuclear germ granules are phase transitioned condensates nucleated by Oskar protein that display liquid as well as hydrogel-like properties. Focusing on nuclear granules, we find that Oskar drives their formation in heterologous cell systems. Multiple, independent Oskar protein domains synergize to promote granule phase separation. Deletion of Oskar's nuclear localization sequence specifically ablates nuclear granules in cell systems. In the embryo, nuclear germ granules promote germ cell divisions thereby increasing PGC number for the next generation.</description>

	<description>We examined alterations in E/I-balance in schizophrenia (ScZ) through measurements of resting-state gamma-band activity in participants meeting clinical high-risk (CHR) criteria (n = 88), 21 first episode (FEP) patients and 34 chronic ScZ-patients. Furthermore, MRS-data were obtained in CHR-participants and matched controls. Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) resting-state activity was examined at source level and MEG-data were correlated with neuropsychological scores and clinical symptoms. CHR-participants were characterized by increased 64–90 Hz power. In contrast, FEP- and ScZ-patients showed aberrant spectral power at both low- and high gamma-band frequencies. MRS-data showed a shift in E/I-balance toward increased excitation in CHR-participants, which correlated with increased occipital gamma-band power. Finally, neuropsychological deficits and clinical symptoms in FEP and ScZ-patients were correlated with reduced gamma band-activity, while elevated psychotic symptoms in the CHR group showed the opposite relationship. The current study suggests that resting-state gamma-band power and altered Glx/GABA ratio indicate changes in E/I-balance parameters across illness stages in ScZ.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Heterogeneity of Astrocytic and Neuronal GLT-1 at Cortical Excitatory Synapses, as Revealed by its Colocalization With Na+/K+-ATPase α Isoforms</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy203</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;GLT-1, the major glutamate transporter, is expressed at perisynaptic astrocytic processes (PAP) and axon terminals (AxT). GLT-1 is coupled to Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase (NKA) α1–3 isoforms, whose subcellular distribution and spatial organization in relationship to GLT-1 are largely unknown. Using several microscopy techniques, we showed that at excitatory synapses α1 and α3 are exclusively neuronal (mainly in dendrites and in some AxT), while α2 is predominantly astrocytic. GLT-1 displayed a differential colocalization with α1–3. GLT-1/α2 and GLT-1/α3 colocalization was higher in GLT-1 positive puncta partially (for GLT-1/α2) or almost totally (for GLT-1/α3) overlapping with VGLUT1 positive terminals than in nonoverlapping ones. GLT-1 colocalized with α2 at PAP, and with α1 and α3 at AxT. GLT-1 and α2 gold particles were ∼1.5–2 times closer than GLT-1/α1 and GLT-1/α3 particles. GLT-1/α2 complexes (edge to edge interdistance of gold particles ≤50 nm) concentrated at the perisynaptic region of PAP membranes, whereas neuronal GLT-1/α1 and GLT-1/α3 complexes were fewer and more uniformly distributed in AxT. These data unveil different composition of GLT-1 and α subunits complexes in the glial and neuronal domains of excitatory synapses. The spatial organization of GLT-1/α1–3 complexes suggests that GLT-1/NKA interaction is more efficient in astrocytes than in neurons, further supporting the dominant role of astrocytic GLT-1 in glutamate homeostasis.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Farzaneh Khajouei, Saurabh Sinha&lt;/p&gt;

Studying a gene’s regulatory mechanisms is a tedious process that involves identification of candidate regulators by transcription factor (TF) knockout or over-expression experiments, delineation of enhancers by reporter assays, and demonstration of direct TF influence by site mutagenesis, among other approaches. Such experiments are often chosen based on the biologist’s intuition, from several testable hypotheses. We pursue the goal of making this process systematic by using ideas from information theory to reason about experiments in gene regulation, in the hope of ultimately enabling rigorous experiment design strategies. For this, we make use of a state-of-the-art mathematical model of gene expression, which provides a way to formalize our current knowledge of cis- as well as trans- regulatory mechanisms of a gene. Ambiguities in such knowledge can be expressed as uncertainties in the model, which we capture formally by building an ensemble of plausible models that fit the existing data and defining a probability distribution over the ensemble. We then characterize the impact of a new experiment on our understanding of the gene’s regulation based on how the ensemble of plausible models and its probability distribution changes when challenged with results from that experiment. This allows us to assess the ‘value’ of the experiment retroactively as the reduction in entropy of the distribution (information gain) resulting from the experiment’s results. We fully formalize this novel approach to reasoning about gene regulation experiments and use it to evaluate a variety of perturbation experiments on two developmental genes of &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;. We also provide objective and ‘biologist-friendly’ descriptions of the information gained from each such experiment. The rigorously defined information theoretic approaches presented here can be used in the future to formulate systematic strategies for experiment design pertaining to studies of gene regulatory mechanisms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/z4Q0168x58A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Quantitative single cell analysis uncovers the life/death decision in CD95 network</title>

CD95/Fas/APO-1 is a member of the death receptor family that triggers apoptotic and anti-apoptotic responses in particular, NF-κB. These responses are characterized by a strong heterogeneity within a population of cells. To determine how the cell decides between life and death we developed a computational model supported by imaging flow cytometry analysis of CD95 signaling. Here we show that CD95 stimulation leads to the induction of caspase and NF-kB pathways simultaneously in one cell. The related life/death decision strictly depends on cell-to-cell variability in the formation of the death-inducing complex (DISC) on one side (extrinsic noise) &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. stochastic gene expression of the NF-kB pathway on the other side (intrinsic noise). Moreover, our analysis has uncovered that the stochasticity in apoptosis and NF-kB pathways leads not only to survival or death of a cell, but also causes a third type of response to CD95 stimulation that we termed ambivalent response. Cells in the ambivalent state can undergo cell death or survive which was subsequently validated by experiments. Taken together, we have uncovered how these two competing pathways control the fate of a cell, which in turn plays an important role for development of anti-cancer therapies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fCqyOiqzsjo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Maternal immune activation (MIA) has been identified as a causal factor in psychiatric disorders by epidemiological studies in humans and mechanistic studies in rodent models. Addressing this gap in species between mice and human will accelerate the understanding of the role of MIA in the etiology of psychiatric disorders. Here we provide the first study of MIA in the ferret (&lt;i&gt;Mustela putorius furo&lt;/i&gt;), an animal model with a rich history of developmental investigations due to the similarities in developmental programs and cortical organization with primates. We found that after MIA by injection of PolyIC in the pregnant mother animal, the adult offspring exhibited reduced social behavior, less eye-contact with humans, decreased recognition memory, a sex-specific increase in amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion, and altered gut microbiome. We also studied the neurophysiological properties of the MIA ferrets in development by &lt;i&gt;in-vivo&lt;/i&gt; recordings of the local field potential (LFP) from visual cortex in 5-6 weeks old animals, and found that the spontaneous and sensory-evoked LFP had decreased power, especially in the gamma frequency band. Overall, our results provide the first evidence for the detrimental effect of MIA in ferrets support the use of the ferret as an intermediate model species for the study of disorders with neurodevelopmental origin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Maternal immune activation (MIA) has been adopted in the rodent model to study neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia. Yet, neurodevelopmental programs differ quite substantially between mice and humans. The ferret has a rich history for the study of neurodevelopment due to its unique advantages that combine short gestation time with the emergence of sophisticated cortical organization during development. The present study found that MIA leads to a range of behavioral abnormalities as well as altered gut microbiome in adult ferrets. Notably, we observed impaired brain oscillations in these animals in early development. Our results lay the foundation for the translational study of neurodevelopmental disorders in ferrets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Increased Synthesis of Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycan Promotes Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis in Response to Enriched Environment</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) is a candidate regulator of embryonic neurogenesis. The aim of this study was to specify the functional significance of CSPG in adult hippocampal neurogenesis using male mice. Here, we showed that neural stem cells and neuronal progenitors in the dentate gyrus were covered in part by CSPG. Pharmacological depletion of CSPG in the dentate gyrus reduced the densities of neuronal progenitors and newborn granule cells. 3D reconstruction of newborn granule cells showed that their maturation was inhibited by CSPG digestion. The novel object recognition test revealed that CSPG digestion caused cognitive memory impairment. Western blot analysis showed that expression of β-catenin in the dentate gyrus was decreased by CSPG digestion. The amount of CSPG in the dentate gyrus was increased by enriched environment (EE) and was decreased by forced swim stress. In addition, EE accelerated the recovery of CSPG expression in the dentate gyrus from the pharmacological depletion and promoted the restoration of granule cell production. Conversely, the densities of newborn granule cells were also decreased in mice that lacked chondroitin sulfate &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1 (CSGalNAcT1), a key enzyme for CSPG synthesis (T1KO mice). The capacity of EE to promote granule cell production and improve cognitive memory was impaired in T1KO mice. These findings indicate that CSPG is involved in the regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis and suggest that increased synthesis of CSPG by CSGalNacT1 may mediate promotion of granule cell production and improvement of cognitive memory in response to EE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) is a candidate regulator of embryonic neurogenesis. Here, we specified the role of CSPG in adult neurogenesis in the mouse hippocampus. Digestion of CSPG in the dentate gyrus impaired granule cell production and cognitive memory. Enriched environment (EE) promoted the recovery of CSPG expression and granule cell production from the CSPG digestion. Additionally, adult neurogenesis was impaired in mice that lacked a key enzyme for CSPG synthesis (T1KO mice). The capacity of EE to promote granule cell production and cognitive memory was impaired in T1KO mice. Altogether, these findings indicate that CSPG underlies adult hippocampal neurogenesis and suggest that increased synthesis of CSPG may mediate promotion of granule cell production in response to EE.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: TRPM2 Exacerbates Central Nervous System Inflammation in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis by Increasing Production of CXCL2 Chemokines</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/39/8484?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the CNS characterized by demyelination and axonal injury. Current therapies that mainly target lymphocytes do not fully meet clinical need due to the risk of severe side effects and lack of efficacy against progressive MS. Evidence suggests that MS is associated with CNS inflammation, although the underlying molecular mechanism is poorly understood. Transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2), a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-permeable nonselective cation channel, is expressed at high levels in the brain and by immune cells, including monocyte lineage cells. Here, we show that TRPM2 plays a pathological role in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. Knockout (KO) or pharmacological inhibition of TRPM2 inhibited progression of EAE and TRPM2-KO mice showed lower activation of Iba1-immunopositive monocyte lineage cells and neutrophil infiltration of the CNS than WT mice. Moreover, CXCL2 production in TRPM2-KO mice was significantly reduced at day 14, although the severity of EAE was the same as that in WT mice at that time point. In addition, we used BM chimeric mice to show that TRPM2 expressed by CNS-infiltrating macrophages contributes to progression of EAE. Because CXCL2 induces migration of neutrophils, these results indicate that reduced expression of CXCL2 in the CNS suppresses neutrophil infiltration and slows progression of EAE in TRPM2-KO mice. Together, the results suggest that TRPM2 plays an important role in progression of EAE pathology and shed light on its putative role as a therapeutic target for MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Current therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS), which mainly target lymphocytes, carry the risk of severe side effects and lack efficacy against the progressive form of the disease. Here, we found that the transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) channel, which is abundantly expressed in CNS-infiltrating macrophages, plays a crucial role in development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. EAE progression was suppressed by Knockout (KO) or pharmacological inhibition of TRPM2; this was attributed to a reduction in CXCL2 chemokine production by CNS-infiltrating macrophages in TRPM2-KO mice, resulting in suppression of neutrophil infiltration into the CNS. These results reveal an important role of TRPM2 in the pathogenesis of EAE and shed light on its potential as a therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Brain-Heart Biomarker for Epileptogenesis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/39/8473?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/39/8473?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Postinjury epilepsy is an potentially preventable sequela in as many as 20% of patients with brain insults. For these cases biomarkers of epileptogenesis are critical to facilitate identification of patients at high-risk of developing epilepsy and to introduce effective anti-epileptogenic interventions. Here, we demonstrate that delayed brain–heart coincidences serve as a reliable biomarker. In a murine model of post-infection acquired epilepsy, we used long-term simultaneous measurements of the brain activity via electroencephalography and autonomic cardiac activity via electrocardiography, in male mice, to quantitatively track brain–heart interactions during epileptogenesis. We find that abnormal cortical discharges precede abnormal fluctuations in the cardiac rhythm at the resolution of single beat-to-beat intervals. The delayed brain–heart coincidence is detectable as early as the onset of chronic measurements, 2–14 weeks before the first seizure, only in animals that become epileptic, and increases during epileptogenesis. Therefore, delayed brain–heart coincidence serves as a biomarker of epileptogenesis and could be used for phenotyping, diagnostic, and therapeutic purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; No biomarker that readily predicts and tracks epileptogenesis currently exists for the wide range of human acquired epilepsies. Here, we used long-term measurements of brain and heart activity in a mouse model of post-infection acquired epilepsy to investigate the potential of brain–heart interaction as a biomarker of epileptogenesis. We found that delayed coincidences from brain to heart can clearly separate the mice that became epileptic from those that did not weeks before development of epilepsy. Our findings allow for phenotyping and tracking of epileptogenesis in this and likely other models of acquired epilepsy. Such capability is critical for efficient adjunctive treatment development and for tracking the efficacy of such treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Neuronal Ensemble in the Rostral Agranular Insula Tracks Cocaine-Induced Devaluation of Natural Reward and Predicts Cocaine Seeking</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/39/8463?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In substance use disorders, negative affect associated with drug withdrawal can elicit strong drug craving and promote relapse. One brain region implicated in those processes is the rostral agranular insular cortex (RAIC), although precisely how this region encodes negative affect associated with drug seeking is unknown. Here, a preclinical model was used where RAIC activity was examined in male Sprague Dawley rats during intraoral infusions of a sweet (saccharin) paired with impending but delayed access to cocaine self-administration, and for comparative purposes, during the sweet predicting saline self-administration or injection of lithium chloride (LiCl), or during intraoral infusions of a bitter taste (quinine). Consistent with previous work, cocaine-paired saccharin, LiCl-paired saccharin, and quinine all elicited aversive taste reactivity. However, the aversive taste reactivity elicited by the cocaine-paired tastant was qualitatively different from that evoked by the other two agents. Furthermore, differences in taste reactivity were reflected in RAIC cell firing, where distinct shifts in neural signaling were observed specifically after cocaine but not LiCl conditioning. Notably, low motivation for cocaine (indicated by low loading and slower latencies to lever press) was correlated with this shift in RAIC signaling, but aversive (gaping) responses were not. Collectively, these findings indicate that cocaine-paired tastants elicit unique aspects of aversive behaviors that differ from traditional conditioned taste aversion (LiCl) or quinine and that the RAIC plays a role in modulating drug-seeking behaviors driven by drug-induced dysphoria (craving), but not negative affect per se.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In substance use disorders, negative affect associated with drug cues can elicit craving and promote relapse; however, the underlying neurocircuitry of this phenomenon is unknown. Here, we investigated the role of the rostral agranular insula cortex (RAIC) in these processes using a preclinical model wherein intraoral delivery of a sweet is paired with delayed access to cocaine self-administration. The taste comes to elicit negative affect that predicts heightened drug seeking. Here, we found that a population of RAIC neurons became inhibited during presentation of the cocaine-paired tastant (when negative affect is high) and that this inhibitory neural profile predicted lower drug seeking. These findings suggest that the RAIC may function to oppose cue-induced cocaine craving and help reduce motivation for the drug.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Feedback-Based Learning in Aging: Contributions and Trajectories of Change in Striatal and Hippocampal Systems</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/39/8453?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/39/8453?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The striatum supports learning from immediate feedback by coding prediction errors (PEs), whereas the hippocampus (HC) plays a parallel role in learning from delayed feedback. Both regions show evidence of decline in human aging, but behavioral research suggests greater decline in HC versus striatal functions. The present study included male and female humans and used fMRI to examine younger and older adults' brain activation patterns during a learning task with choice feedback presented immediately or after a brief delay. Participants then completed a surprise memory task that tested their recognition of trial-unique feedback stimuli, followed by assessments of postlearning cue preference, outcome probability awareness, and willingness to pay. The study yielded three main findings. First, behavioral measures indicated similar rates of learning in younger and older adults across conditions, but postlearning measures indicated impairment in older adults' ability to subsequently apply learning to discriminate between cues. Second, PE signals in the striatum were greater for immediate versus delayed feedback in both age groups, but PE signals in the HC were greater for delayed versus immediate feedback only in younger adults. Third, unlike younger adults, older adults failed to exhibit enhanced episodic memory for outcome stimuli in the delayed-feedback condition. Together, these findings indicate that HC circuits supporting learning and memory decline more than striatal circuits in healthy aging, which suggests that declines in HC learning signals may be an important predictor of deficits in learning-dependent economic decisions among older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The hippocampus (HC) and striatum play distinct and critical roles in learning. Substantial research suggests that age-related decline in learning supported by the HC outpaces decline in learning supported by the striatum; however, such inferences have been drawn by comparing performance in tasks with fundamentally different structures. The present study overcomes this obstacle by implementing a single fMRI-learning paradigm with a subtle variation in feedback timing to examine differential age effects on memory supported by the HC and striatum. Our results provide converging behavioral and brain-imaging evidence showing that HC circuits supporting learning and memory decline more than striatal circuits in healthy aging and that declines in HC learning signals may predict early deficits in learning-dependent decisions among older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Auditory Predictive Coding across Awareness States under Anesthesia: An Intracranial Electrophysiology Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/39/8441?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/39/8441?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The systems-level mechanisms underlying loss of consciousness (LOC) under anesthesia remain unclear. General anesthetics suppress sensory responses within higher-order cortex and feedback connections, both critical elements of predictive coding hypotheses of conscious perception. Responses to auditory novelty may offer promise as biomarkers for consciousness. This study examined anesthesia-induced changes in auditory novelty responses over short (local deviant [LD]) and long (global deviant [GD]) time scales, envisioned to engage preattentive and conscious levels of processing, respectively. Electrocorticographic recordings were obtained in human neurosurgical patients (3 male, 3 female) from four hierarchical processing levels: core auditory cortex, non-core auditory cortex, auditory-related, and PFC. Stimuli were vowel patterns incorporating deviants within and across stimuli (LD and GD). Subjects were presented with stimuli while awake, and during sedation (responsive) and following LOC (unresponsive) under propofol anesthesia. LD and GD effects were assayed as the averaged evoked potential and high gamma (70–150 Hz) activity. In the awake state, LD and GD effects were present in all recorded regions, with averaged evoked potential effects more broadly distributed than high gamma activity. Under sedation, LD effects were preserved in all regions, except PFC. LOC was accompanied by loss of LD effects outside of auditory cortex. By contrast, GD effects were markedly suppressed under sedation in all regions and were absent following LOC. Thus, although the presence of GD effects is indicative of being awake, its absence is not indicative of LOC. Loss of LD effects in higher-order cortical areas may constitute an alternative biomarker of LOC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Development of a biomarker that indexes changes in the brain upon loss of consciousness (LOC) under general anesthesia has broad implications for elucidating the neural basis of awareness and clinical relevance to mechanisms of sleep, coma, and disorders of consciousness. Using intracranial recordings from neurosurgery patients, we investigated changes in the activation of cortical networks involved in auditory novelty detection over short (local deviance) and long (global deviance) time scales associated with sedation and LOC under propofol anesthesia. Our results indicate that, whereas the presence of global deviance effects can index awareness, their loss cannot serve as a biomarker for LOC. The dramatic reduction of local deviance effects in areas beyond auditory cortex may constitute an alternative biomarker of LOC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Contextual-Dependent Attention Effect on Crowded Orientation Signals in Human Visual Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/39/8433?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/39/8433?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A target becomes hard to identify with nearby visual stimuli. This phenomenon, known as crowding, places a fundamental limit on conscious perception and object recognition. To understand the neural representation of crowded stimuli, we used fMRI and a forward encoding model to reconstruct the target-specific feature from multivoxel activation patterns evoked by orientation patches. Orientation-selective response profiles were constructed in V1–V4 for a target embedded in different contexts. Subjects of both sexes either directed their attention over all the orientation patches or selectively to the target. In the context with a weak crowding effect, attending to the target enhanced the orientation selectivity of the response profile; such effect increased along the visual pathway. In the context with a strong crowding effect, attending to the target enhanced the orientation selectivity of the response profile in the earlier visual area, but not in V4. The increase and decrease of orientation selectivity along the visual hierarchy demonstrate a contextual-dependent attention effect on crowded orientation signals: in the context with a weak crowding effect, selective attention gradually resolves the target from nearby distractors along the hierarchy; in the context with a strong crowding effect, while selective attention maintains the target feature in the earlier visual area, its effect decreases in the downstream area. Our findings reveal how the human visual system represents the target-specific feature at multiple stages under the limit of attention selection in a cluttered scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Using fMRI and a forward encoding model, we reconstructed orientation-selective response profiles for a target embedded in crowded contexts. In the context with a weak crowding effect, attention gradually resolves the target from nearby distractors along the visual hierarchy. In the context with a strong crowding effect, while the feature of the target is preserved in the early visual cortex, it degrades in the later visual processing stage. The increase and decrease of orientation selectivity along the visual hierarchy reveal how the human visual system strikes to present the target-specific feature under the limit of attention selection in a cluttered scene.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Interneuron Simplification and Loss of Structural Plasticity As Markers of Aging-Related Functional Decline</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/39/8421?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Changes in excitatory neuron and synapse structure have been recognized as a potential physical source of age-related cognitive decline. Despite the importance of inhibition to brain plasticity, little is known regarding aging-associated changes to inhibitory neurons. Here we test for age-related cellular and circuit changes to inhibitory neurons of mouse visual cortex. We find no substantial difference in inhibitory neuron number, inhibitory neuronal subtypes, or synapse numbers within the cerebral cortex of aged mice compared with younger adults. However, when comparing cortical interneuron morphological parameters, we find differences in complexity, suggesting that arbors are simplified in aged mice. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; two-photon microscopy has previously shown that in contrast to pyramidal neurons, inhibitory interneurons retain a capacity for dendritic remodeling in the adult. We find that this capacity diminishes with age and is accompanied by a shift in dynamics from balanced branch additions and retractions to progressive prevalence of retractions, culminating in a dendritic arbor that is both simpler and more stable. Recording of visually evoked potentials shows that aging-related interneuron dendritic arbor simplification and reduced dynamics go hand in hand with loss of induced stimulus-selective response potentiation (SRP), a paradigm for adult visual cortical plasticity. Chronic treatment with the antidepressant fluoxetine reversed deficits in interneuron structural dynamics and restored SRP in aged animals. Our results support a structural basis for age-related impairments in sensory perception, and suggest that declines in inhibitory neuron structural plasticity during aging contribute to reduced functional plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Structural alterations in neuronal morphology and synaptic connections have been proposed as a potential physical basis for age–related decline in cognitive function. Little is known regarding aging-associated changes to inhibitory neurons, despite the importance of inhibitory circuitry to adult cortical plasticity and the reorganization of cortical maps. Here we show that brain aging goes hand in hand with progressive structural simplification and reduced plasticity of inhibitory neurons, and a parallel decline in sensory map plasticity. Fluoxetine treatment can attenuate the concurrent age–related declines in interneuron structural and functional plasticity, suggesting it could provide an important therapeutic approach for mitigating sensory and cognitive deficits associated with aging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Functional riboSNitch in the 3' Untranslated Region of FKBP5 Alters MicroRNA-320a Binding Efficiency and Mediates Vulnerability to Chronic Post-Traumatic Pain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/39/8407?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/39/8407?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown that common variants of the gene coding for FK506-binding protein 51 (&lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt;), a critical regulator of glucocorticoid sensitivity, affect vulnerability to stress-related disorders. In a previous report, &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt; rs1360780 was identified as a functional variant because of its effect on gene methylation. Here we report evidence for a novel functional &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt; allele, rs3800373. This study assessed the association between rs3800373 and post-traumatic chronic pain in 1607 women and men from two ethnically diverse human cohorts. The molecular mechanism through which rs3800373 affects adverse outcomes was established via &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; analyses. The rs3800373 minor allele predicted worse adverse outcomes after trauma exposure, such that individuals with the minor (risk) allele developed more severe post-traumatic chronic musculoskeletal pain. Among these individuals, peritraumatic circulating &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt; expression levels increased as cortisol and glucocorticoid receptor (&lt;i&gt;NR3C1&lt;/i&gt;) mRNA levels increased, consistent with increased glucocorticoid resistance. Bioinformatic, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, and mutational analyses indicate that the rs3800373 minor allele reduces the binding of a stress- and pain-associated microRNA, miR-320a, to &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt; via altering the &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt; mRNA 3'UTR secondary structure (i.e., is a riboSNitch). This results in relatively greater &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt; translation, unchecked by miR-320a. Overall, these results identify an important gene–miRNA interaction influencing chronic pain risk in vulnerable individuals and suggest that exogenous methods to achieve targeted reduction in poststress &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression may constitute useful therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt; is a critical regulator of the stress response. Previous studies have shown that dysregulation of the expression of this gene plays a role in the pathogenesis of chronic pain development as well as a number of comorbid neuropsychiatric disorders. In the current study, we identified a functional allele (rs3800373) in the 3'UTR of &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt; that influences vulnerability to chronic post-traumatic pain in two ethnic cohorts. Using multiple complementary experimental approaches, we show that the &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt; rs3800373 minor allele alters the secondary structure of &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt; mRNA, decreasing the binding of a stress- and pain-associated microRNA, miR-320a. This results in relatively greater &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt; translation, unchecked by miR-320a, increasing glucocorticoid resistance and increasing vulnerability to post-traumatic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Adhesion-GPCR BAI1 Promotes Excitatory Synaptogenesis by Coordinating Bidirectional Trans-synaptic Signaling</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Excitatory synapses are specialized cell–cell contacts located on actin-rich dendritic spines that mediate information flow and storage in the brain. The postsynaptic adhesion-G protein-coupled receptor (A-GPCR) BAI1 is a critical regulator of excitatory synaptogenesis, which functions in part by recruiting the Par3-Tiam1 polarity complex to spines, inducing local Rac1 GTPase activation and actin cytoskeletal remodeling. However, a detailed mechanistic understanding of how BAI1 controls synapse and spine development remains elusive. Here, we confirm that BAI1 is required &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; for hippocampal spine development, and we identify three distinct signaling mechanisms mediating BAI1's prosynaptogenic functions. Using &lt;i&gt;in utero&lt;/i&gt; electroporation to sparsely knock down BAI1 expression in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, we show that BAI1 cell-autonomously promotes spinogenesis in the developing mouse brain. BAI1 appears to function as a receptor at synapses, as its extracellular N-terminal segment is required for both its prospinogenic and prosynaptogenic functions. Moreover, BAI1 activation with a &lt;i&gt;Stachel&lt;/i&gt;-derived peptide, which mimics a tethered agonist motif found in A-GPCRs, drives synaptic Rac1 activation and subsequent spine and synapse development. We also reveal, for the first time, a trans-synaptic function for BAI1, demonstrating in a mixed-culture assay that BAI1 induces the clustering of presynaptic vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGluT1) in contacting axons, indicative of presynaptic differentiation. Finally, we show that BAI1 forms a receptor complex with the synaptogenic cell-adhesion molecule Neuroligin-1 (NRLN1) and mediates NRLN1-dependent spine growth and synapse development. Together, these findings establish BAI1 as an essential postsynaptic A-GPCR that regulates excitatory synaptogenesis by coordinating bidirectional trans-synaptic signaling in cooperation with NRLN1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Adhesion-G protein-coupled receptors are cell-adhesion receptors with important roles in nervous system development, function, and neuropsychiatric disorders. The postsynaptic adhesion-G protein-coupled receptor BAI1 is a critical regulator of dendritic spine and excitatory synapse development. However, the mechanism by which BAI1 controls these functions remains unclear. Our study identifies three distinct signaling paradigms for BAI1, demonstrating that it mediates forward, reverse, and lateral signaling in spines. Activation of BAI1 by a &lt;i&gt;Stachel&lt;/i&gt;-dependent mechanism induces local Rac1 activation and subsequent spinogenesis/synaptogenesis. BAI1 also signals trans-synaptically to promote presynaptic differentiation. Furthermore, BAI1 interacts with the postsynaptic cell-adhesion molecule Neuroligin-1 (NRLN1) and facilitates NRLN1-dependent spine growth and excitatory synaptogenesis. Thus, our findings establish BAI1 as a functional synaptogenic receptor that promotes presynaptic and postsynaptic development in cooperation with synaptic organizer NRLN1.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Posterior Parietal Cortex Dysfunction Is Central to Working Memory Storage and Broad Cognitive Deficits in Schizophrenia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/39/8378?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;PFC dysfunction is widely believed to underlie working memory (WM) deficits in people with schizophrenia (PSZ), but few studies have focused on measures of WM storage devoid of manipulation. Research in neurotypical individuals has shown that storage capacity is more closely related to posterior parietal cortex (PPC) than PFC, suggesting that reductions in WM storage capacity in schizophrenia that are associated with broad cognitive deficits may be related to neural activity in PPC. In the present human neuroimaging study, 37 PSZ and 37 matched healthy control subjects of either sex completed a change detection task with varying set sizes while undergoing fMRI. The task was designed to emphasize WM storage with minimal top-down control demands. Whole-brain analysis identified areas in which BOLD activity covaried with the number of items maintained in WM (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;), as derived from task performance at a given set size. Across groups, &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt; values independent of set size predicted BOLD activity in PPC, including superior and inferior parietal lobules and intraparietal sulcus, and middle occipital gyrus. Whole-brain interaction analysis found significantly less &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;-dependent signal modulation in PSZ than healthy control subjects in left PPC, a phenomenon that could not be explained by a narrower &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt; value range. The slope between &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt; and PPC activation statistically accounted for 43.4% of the between-group differences in broad cognitive function. These results indicate that PPC dysfunction is central to WM storage deficits in PSZ and may play a key role in the broad cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; People with schizophrenia exhibit cognitive deficits across a wide range of tasks. Explaining these impairments in terms of a small number of core deficits with clearly defined neural correlates would advance the understanding of the disorder and promote treatment development. We show that a substantial portion of broad cognitive deficits in schizophrenia can be explained by a failure to flexibly modulate posterior parietal cortex activity as a function of the amount of information currently stored in working memory. Working memory deficits have long been considered central to schizophrenia-related cognitive deficits, but the focus has been on paradigms involving some form of top-down control rather than pure storage of information, which may have unduly narrowed the focus on prefrontal dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: S-Nitrosylation of Divalent Metal Transporter 1 Enhances Iron Uptake to Mediate Loss of Dopaminergic Neurons and Motoric Deficit</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Elevated iron deposition has been reported in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the route of iron uptake leading to high deposition in the substantia nigra is unresolved. Here, we show a mechanism in enhanced Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake via S-nitrosylation of divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1). While DMT1 could be S-nitrosylated by exogenous nitric oxide donors, in human PD brains, endogenously S-nitrosylated DMT1 was detected in postmortem substantia nigra. Patch-clamp electrophysiological recordings and iron uptake assays confirmed increased Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake through S-nitrosylated DMT1. We identified two major S-nitrosylation sites, C23 and C540, by mass spectrometry, and DMT1 C23A or C540A substitutions abolished nitric oxide (NO)-mediated DMT1 current increase. To evaluate &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; significance, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was stereotaxically injected into the substantia nigra of female and male mice to induce inflammation and production of NO. The intranigral LPS injection resulted in corresponding increase in Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; deposition, JNK activation, dopaminergic neuronal loss and deficit in motoric activity, and these were rescued by the NO synthase inhibitor l-NAME or by the DMT1-selective blocker ebselen. Lentiviral knockdown of DMT1 abolished LPS-induced dopaminergic neuron loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neuroinflammation and high cytoplasmic Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels have been implicated in the initiation and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we report the unexpected enhancement of the functional activity of transmembrane divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) by S-nitrosylation. We demonstrated that S-nitrosylation increased DMT1-mediated Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake, and two cysteines were identified by mass spectrometry to be the sites for S-nitrosylation and for enhanced iron uptake. One conceptual advance is that while DMT1 activity could be increased by external acidification because the gating of the DMT1 transporter is proton motive, we discovered that DMT1 activity could also be enhanced by S-nitrosylation. Significantly, lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide (NO)-mediated neuronal death in the substantia nigra could be ameliorated by using l-NAME, a NO synthase inhibitor, or by ebselen, a DMT1-selective blocker.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor Type J (PTPRJ) Regulates Retinal Axonal Projections by Inhibiting Eph and Abl Kinases in Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Eph receptors play pivotal roles in the axon guidance of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) at the optic chiasm and the establishment of the topographic retinocollicular map. We previously demonstrated that protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type O (PTPRO) is specifically involved in the control of retinotectal projections in chicks through the dephosphorylation of EphA and EphB receptors. We subsequently revealed that all the mouse R3 subfamily members (PTPRB, PTPRH, PTPRJ, and PTPRO) of the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) family inhibited Eph receptors as their substrates in cultured mammalian cells. We herein investigated the functional roles of R3 RPTPs in the projection of mouse retinal axon of both sexes. &lt;i&gt;Ptpro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ptprj&lt;/i&gt; were expressed in mouse RGCs; however, &lt;i&gt;Ptprj&lt;/i&gt; expression levels were markedly higher than those of &lt;i&gt;Ptpro&lt;/i&gt;. Consistent with their expression levels, Eph receptor activity was significantly enhanced in &lt;i&gt;Ptprj&lt;/i&gt;-knock-out (&lt;i&gt;Ptprj&lt;/i&gt;-KO) retinas. In &lt;i&gt;Ptprj&lt;/i&gt;-KO and &lt;i&gt;Ptprj&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Ptpro&lt;/i&gt;-double-KO (DKO) mice, the number of retinal axons that projected ipsilaterally or to the contralateral eye was significantly increased. Furthermore, retinal axons in &lt;i&gt;Ptprj&lt;/i&gt;-KO and DKO mice formed anteriorly shifted ectopic terminal zones in the superior colliculus (SC). We found that c-Abl (Abelson tyrosine kinase) was downstream of ephrin–Eph signaling for the repulsion of retinal axons at the optic chiasm and in the SC. c-Abl was identified as a novel substrate for PTPRJ and PTPRO, and the phosphorylation of c-Abl was upregulated in &lt;i&gt;Ptprj&lt;/i&gt;-KO and DKO retinas. Thus, PTPRJ regulates retinocollicular projections in mice by controlling the activity of Eph and c-Abl kinases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Correct retinocollicular projection is a prerequisite for proper vision. Eph receptors have been implicated in retinal axon guidance at the optic chiasm and the establishment of the topographic retinocollicular map. We herein demonstrated that protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type J (PTPRJ) regulated retinal axonal projections by controlling Eph activities. The retinas of &lt;i&gt;Ptprj&lt;/i&gt;-knock-out (KO) and &lt;i&gt;Ptpro&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Ptprj&lt;/i&gt; double-KO mice exhibited significantly enhanced Eph activities over those in wild-type mice, and their axons showed defects in pathfinding at the chiasm and retinocollicular topographic map formation. We also revealed that c-Abl (Abelson tyrosine kinase) downstream of Eph receptors was regulated by PTPRJ. These results indicate that the regulation of the ephrin–Eph–c-Abl axis by PTPRJ plays pivotal roles in the proper central projection of retinal axons during development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Transneuronal Downregulation of the Premotor Cholinergic System After Corticospinal Tract Loss</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/39/8329?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Injury to the supraspinal motor systems, especially the corticospinal tract, leads to movement impairments. In addition to direct disruption of descending motor pathways, spinal motor circuits that are distant to and not directly damaged by the lesion undergo remodeling that contributes significantly to the impairments. Knowing which spinal circuits are remodeled and the underlying mechanisms are critical for understanding the functional changes in the motor pathway and for developing repair strategies. Here, we target spinal premotor cholinergic interneurons (IN) that directly modulate motoneuron excitability via their cholinergic C-bouton terminals. Using a model of unilateral medullary corticospinal tract lesion in male rats, we found transneuronal downregulation of the premotor cholinergic pathway. Phagocytic microglial cells were upregulated in parallel with cholinergic pathway downregulation and both were blocked by minocycline, a microglia activation inhibitor. Additionally, we found a transient increase in interneuronal complement protein C1q expression that preceded cell loss. 3D reconstructions showed ongoing phagocytosis of C1q-expressing cholinergic INs by microglia 3 d after injury, which was complete by 10 d after injury. Unilateral motor cortex inactivation using the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor agonist muscimol replicated the changes detected at 3 d after lesion, indicating activity dependence. The neuronal loss after the lesion was rescued by increasing spinal activity using cathodal &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-spinal direct current stimulation. Our finding of activity-dependent modulation of cholinergic premotor INs after CST injury provides the mechanistic insight that maintaining activity, possibly during a critical period, helps to protect distant motor circuits from further damage and, as a result, may improve motor functional recovery and rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Supraspinal injury to the motor system disrupts descending motor pathways, leading to movement impairments. Whether and how intrinsic spinal circuits are remodeled after a brain injury is unclear. Using a rat model of unilateral corticospinal tract lesion in the medulla, we show activity-dependent, transneuronal downregulation of the spinal premotor cholinergic system, which is mediated by microglial phagocytosis, possibly involving a rapid and transient increase in neuronal C1q before neuronal loss. Spinal cord neuromodulation after injury to augment spinal activity rescued the premotor cholinergic system. Our findings provide the mechanistic insight that maintaining activity, possibly during an early critical period, could protect distant motor circuits from further damage mediated by microglia and interneuronal complement protein and improve motor functional outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Coherent Activity between the Prelimbic and Auditory Cortex in the Slow-Gamma Band Underlies Fear Discrimination</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/39/8313?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The medial prefrontal cortex and the basolateral amygdala (BLA) are essential for discriminating between harmful and safe stimuli. The primary auditory cortex (Te1) sends projections to both sites, but whether and how it interacts with these areas during fear discrimination are poorly understood. Here we show that in male rats that can differentiate between a new tone and a threatening one, the selective optogenetic inhibition of Te1 axon terminals into the prelimbic (PL) cortex shifted discrimination to fear generalization. Meanwhile, no effects were detected when Te1 terminals were inhibited in the BLA. Using a combination of local field potential and multiunit recordings, we show that in animals that discriminate successfully between a new tone and a harmful one, the activity of the Te1 and the PL cortex becomes immediately and tightly synchronized in the slow-gamma range (40–70 Hz) at the onset of the new tone. This enhanced synchronization was not present in other frequency ranges, such as the theta range. Critically, the level of gamma synchrony predicted the behavioral choice (i.e., no freezing or freezing) of the animals. Moreover, in the same rats, gamma synchrony was absent before the fear-learning trial and when animals should discriminate between an olfactory stimulus and the auditory harmful one. Thus, our findings reveal that the Te1 and the PL cortex dynamically establish a functional connection during auditory fear-discrimination processes, and that this corticocortical oscillatory mechanism drives the behavioral choice of the animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Identifying neural networks that infer safety versus danger is of great interest in the scientific field. Fear generalization reduces the chances of an animal's survival and leads to psychiatric diseases, such as post-traumatic stress disorders and phobias in humans. Here we demonstrate that animals able to differentiate a new tone from a previous threating tone showed synchronization between the prefrontal and primary auditory cortices. Critically, this connectivity precedes and predicts the behavioral outcome of the animal. Optogenetic inhibition of this functional connectivity leads to fear generalization. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that a corticocortical dialogue occurring between sensory and prefrontal areas is a key node for fear-discrimination processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Automated, predictive, and interpretable inference of C. elegans escape dynamics. (arXiv:1809.09321v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09321</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09321</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The roundworm C. elegans exhibits robust escape behavior in response to
rapidly rising temperature. The behavior lasts for a few seconds, shows history
dependence, involves both sensory and motor systems, and is too complicated to
model mechanistically using currently available knowledge. Instead we model the
process phenomenologically, and we use the Sir Isaac dynamical inference
platform to infer the model in a fully automated fashion directly from
experimental data. The inferred model requires incorporation of an unobserved
dynamical variable, and is biologically interpretable. The model makes accurate
predictions about the dynamics of the worm behavior, and it can be used to
characterize the functional logic of the dynamical system underlying the escape
response. This work illustrates the power of modern artificial intelligence to
aid in discovery of accurate and interpretable models of complex natural
systems.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Comparison of fluctuations in global network topology of modeled and empirical brain functional connectivity</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Makoto Fukushima, Olaf Sporns&lt;/p&gt;

Dynamic models of large-scale brain activity have been used for reproducing many empirical findings on human brain functional connectivity. Features that have been shown to be reproducible by comparing modeled to empirical data include functional connectivity measured over several minutes of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, as well as its time-resolved fluctuations on a time scale of tens of seconds. However, comparison of modeled and empirical data has not been conducted yet for fluctuations in global network topology of functional connectivity, such as fluctuations between segregated and integrated topology or between high and low modularity topology. Since these global network-level fluctuations have been shown to be related to human cognition and behavior, there is an emerging need for clarifying their reproducibility with computational models. To address this problem, we directly compared fluctuations in global network topology of functional connectivity between modeled and empirical data, and clarified the degree to which a stationary model of spontaneous brain dynamics can reproduce the empirically observed fluctuations. Modeled fluctuations were simulated using a system of coupled phase oscillators wired according to brain structural connectivity. By performing model parameter search, we found that modeled fluctuations in global metrics quantifying network integration and modularity had more than 80% of magnitudes of those observed in the empirical data. Temporal properties of network states determined based on fluctuations in these metrics were also found to be reproducible, although their spatial patterns in functional connectivity did not perfectly marched. These results suggest that stationary models simulating resting-state activity can reproduce the magnitude of empirical fluctuations in segregation and integration, whereas additional factors, such as active mechanisms controlling non-stationary dynamics and/or greater accuracy of mapping brain structural connectivity, would be necessary for fully reproducing the spatial patterning associated with these fluctuations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sr-8OBw5Vvo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Bin Wu, Lei Zhou&lt;/p&gt;

Cooperation is key for the evolution of biological systems ranging from bacteria communities to human societies. Evolutionary processes can dramatically alter the cooperation level. Evolutionary processes are typically of two classes: comparison based and self-evaluation based. The fate of cooperation is extremely sensitive to the details of comparison based processes. For self-evaluation processes, however, it is still unclear whether the sensitivity remains. We concentrate on a class of self-evaluation processes based on aspiration, where all the individuals adjust behaviors based on their own aspirations. We prove that the evolutionary outcome with heterogeneous aspirations is the same as that of the homogeneous one for regular networks under weak selection limit. Simulation results further suggest that it is also valid for general networks across various distributions of personalised aspirations. Our result clearly indicates that self-evaluation processes are robust in contrast with comparison based rules. In addition, our result greatly simplifies the calculation of the aspiration dynamics, which is computationally expensive.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AtRjHXVAAl8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Electrophysiological Signature Reveals Laminar Structure of the Porcine Hippocampus</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus is integral to working and episodic memory and is a central region of interest in diseases affecting these processes. Pig models are widely used in translational research and may provide an excellent bridge between rodents and nonhuman primates for CNS disease models because of their gyrencephalic neuroanatomy and significant white matter composition. However, the laminar structure of the pig hippocampus has not been well characterized. Therefore, we histologically characterized the dorsal hippocampus of Yucatan miniature pigs and quantified the cytoarchitecture of the hippocampal layers. We then utilized stereotaxis combined with single-unit electrophysiological mapping to precisely place multichannel laminar silicon probes into the dorsal hippocampus without the need for image guidance. We used &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiological recordings of simultaneous laminar field potentials and single-unit activity in multiple layers of the dorsal hippocampus to physiologically identify and quantify these layers under anesthesia. Consistent with previous reports, we found the porcine hippocampus to have the expected archicortical laminar structure, with some anatomical and histological features comparable to the rodent and others to the primate hippocampus. Importantly, we found these distinct features to be reflected in the laminar electrophysiology. This characterization, as well as our electrophysiology-based methodology targeting the porcine hippocampal lamina combined with high-channel-count silicon probes, will allow for analysis of spike-field interactions during normal and disease states in both anesthetized and future awake behaving neurophysiology in this large animal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Signal transduction and cytoskeleton networks in a wide variety of cells display excitability, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we show that during random migration and in response to chemoattractants, cells maintain complementary spatial and temporal distributions of Ras activity and phosphatidylinositol (3,4)-bisphosphate [PI(3,4)P2]. In addition, depletion of PI(3,4)P2...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/z7X4Er-YjeM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Uncovering Multi-Site Identifiability Based on Resting-State Functional Connectomes. (arXiv:1809.08959v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08959</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08959</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multi-site studies are becoming important to increase statistical power,
enhance generalizability, and to improve the likelihood of pooling relevant
subgroups together activities which are otherwise limited by the availability
of patients or funds at a single site. Even with harmonized imaging sequences,
site-dependent variability can mask the advantages of these multi-site studies.
The aim of this study was to assess multi-site reproducibility in resting-state
functional connectivity fingerprints, and to improve identifiability of
obtained functional connectomes. The individual fingerprinting of functional
connectivity profiles is promising due to its potential as a robust
neuroimaging biomarker with which to draw single-subject inferences. We
evaluated individual fingerprints in test-retest visit pairs within and across
two sites and present a generalized framework based on principal component
analysis to improve identifiability. Those principal components that maximized
differential identifiability of a training dataset were used as an orthogonal
connectivity basis to reconstruct the individual functional connectomes of
training and validation sets. The optimally reconstructed functional
connectomes showed a substantial improvement in individual fingerprinting of
the subjects within and across the two sites and test-retest visit pairs
relative to the original data. A notable increase in ICC values for functional
edges and resting-state networks were also observed for reconstructed
functional connectomes. Improvements in identifiability were not found to be
affected by the presence or absence of global signal regression. Result
demonstrate that the data-driven method presented in this study can improve
identifiability in resting-state functional connectomes in multi-site studies.

	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08704</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08704</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The social brain hypothesis postulates the increasing complexity of social
interactions as a driving force for the evolution of cognitive abilities.
Whereas dyadic and triadic relations play a basic role in defining social
behaviours and pose many challenges for the social brain, individuals in animal
societies typically belong to relatively large networks. How the structure and
dynamics of these networks also contribute to the evolution of cognition, and
vice versa, is less understood. Here we review how collective phenomena can
occur in systems where social agents do not require sophisticated cognitive
skills, and how complex networks can grow from simple probabilistic rules, or
even emerge from the interaction between agents and their environment, without
explicit social factors. We further show that the analysis of social networks
can be used to develop good indicators of social complexity beyond the
individual or dyadic level. We also discuss the types of challenges that the
social brain must cope with in structured groups, such as higher information
fluxes, originating from individuals playing different roles in the network, or
dyadic contacts of widely varying durations and frequencies. We discuss the
relevance of these ideas for primates and other animals societies.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: BrainNet: A Multi-Person Brain-to-Brain Interface for Direct Collaboration Between Brains. (arXiv:1809.08632v1 [cs.HC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08632</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08632</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We present BrainNet which, to our knowledge, is the first multi-person
non-invasive direct brain-to-brain interface for collaborative problem solving.
The interface combines electroencephalography (EEG) to record brain signals and
transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to deliver information noninvasively to
the brain. The interface allows three human subjects to collaborate and solve a
task using direct brain-to-brain communication. Two of the three subjects are
&quot;Senders&quot; whose brain signals are decoded using real-time EEG data analysis to
extract decisions about whether to rotate a block in a Tetris-like game before
it is dropped to fill a line. The Senders' decisions are transmitted via the
Internet to the brain of a third subject, the &quot;Receiver,&quot; who cannot see the
game screen. The decisions are delivered to the Receiver's brain via magnetic
stimulation of the occipital cortex. The Receiver integrates the information
received and makes a decision using an EEG interface about either turning the
block or keeping it in the same position. A second round of the game gives the
Senders one more chance to validate and provide feedback to the Receiver's
action. We evaluated the performance of BrainNet in terms of (1) Group-level
performance during the game; (2) True/False positive rates of subjects'
decisions; (3) Mutual information between subjects. Five groups of three
subjects successfully used BrainNet to perform the Tetris task, with an average
accuracy of 0.813. Furthermore, by varying the information reliability of the
Senders by artificially injecting noise into one Sender's signal, we found that
Receivers are able to learn which Sender is more reliable based solely on the
information transmitted to their brains. Our results raise the possibility of
future brain-to-brain interfaces that enable cooperative problem solving by
humans using a &quot;social network&quot; of connected brains.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08504</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We use methods from computational algebraic topology to study functional
brain networks, in which nodes represent brain regions and weighted edges
represent similarity of fMRI time series from each region. With these tools,
which allow one to characterize topological invariants such as loops in
high-dimensional data, we are able to gain understanding into low-dimensional
structures in networks in a way that complements traditional approaches based
on pairwise interactions. In the present paper, we analyze networks constructed
from task-based fMRI data from schizophrenia patients, healthy controls, and
healthy siblings of schizophrenia patients using persistent homology, which
allows us to explore the persistence of topological structures such as loops at
different scales in the networks. We use persistence landscapes, persistence
images, and Betti curves to create output summaries from our
persistent-homology calculations, and we study the persistence landscapes and
images using $k$-means clustering and community detection. Based on our
analysis of persistence landscapes, we find that the members of the sibling
cohort have topological features (specifically, their 1-dimensional loops) that
are distinct from the other two cohorts. From the persistence images, we are
able to distinguish all three subject groups and to determine the brain regions
in the loops (with four or more edges) that allow us to make these
distinctions.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We develop a phenomenological coarse--graining procedure for activity in a
large network of neurons, and apply this to recordings from a population of
1000+ cells in the hippocampus. Distributions of coarse--grained variables seem
to approach a fixed non--Gaussian form, and we see evidence of scaling in both
static and dynamic quantities. These results suggest that the collective
behavior of the network is described by a non--trivial fixed point.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08291</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Asking questions is a pervasive human activity, but little is understood
about what makes them difficult to answer. An analysis of a pair of large
databases, of New York Times crosswords and questions from the quiz-show
Jeopardy, establishes two orthogonal dimensions of question difficulty:
obscurity (the rarity of the answer) and opacity (the indirectness of question
cues, operationalized with word2vec). The importance of opacity, and the role
of synergistic information in resolving it, suggests that accounts of
difficulty in terms of prior expectations captures only a part of the
question-asking process. A further regression analysis shows the presence of
additional dimensions to question-asking: question complexity, the answer's
local network density, cue intersection, and the presence of signal words. Our
work shows how question-askers can help their interlocutors by using contextual
cues, or, conversely, how a particular kind of unfamiliarity with the domain in
question can make it harder for individuals to learn from others. Taken
together, these results suggest how Bayesian models of question difficulty can
be supplemented by process models and accounts of the heuristics individuals
use to navigate conceptual spaces.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Affective computing is confronted to high inter-subject variability, in both
emotional and physiological responses to a given stimulus. In a stimuli-shared
framework, that is to say for different subjects who watch the same stimuli,
Inter-Subject Correlation (ISC) measured from Electroencephalographic (EEG)
recordings characterize the correlations between the respective signals at the
different EEG channels. In order to investigate the interplay between ISC and
emotion, we propose to study the effect of valence and arousal on the ISC
score. To this end, we exploited various computational schemes corresponding to
different subsets of the dataset: all the data, stimulus-wise, subject
pairwise, and both stimulus-wise and subject pairwise. We thus applied these
schemes to the HCI MAHNOB and DEAP databases. Our results suggest that the ISC
score decreases with valence and increases with arousal, as already shown by
previous results on functional MRI.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: OptMDFpathway: Identification of metabolic pathways with maximal thermodynamic driving force and its application for analyzing the endogenous CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation potential of Escherichia coli</title>

Constraint-based modeling techniques have become a standard tool for the &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; analysis of metabolic networks. To further improve their accuracy, recent methodological developments focused on integration of thermodynamic information in metabolic models to assess the feasibility of flux distributions by thermodynamic driving forces. Here we present &lt;i&gt;OptMDFpathway&lt;/i&gt;, a method that extends the recently proposed framework of Max-min Driving Force (MDF) for thermodynamic pathway analysis. Given a metabolic network model, &lt;i&gt;OptMDFpathway&lt;/i&gt; identifies both the optimal MDF for a desired phenotypic behavior as well as the respective pathway itself that supports the optimal driving force. &lt;i&gt;OptMDFpathway&lt;/i&gt; is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program and is applicable to genome-scale metabolic networks. As an important theoretical result, we also show that there exists always at least one elementary mode in the network that reaches the maximal MDF. We employed our new approach to systematically identify all substrate-product combinations in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; where product synthesis allows for concomitant net CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; assimilation via thermodynamically feasible pathways. Although biomass synthesis cannot be coupled to net CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation in &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; we found that as many as 145 of the 949 cytosolic carbon metabolites contained in the genome-scale model &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;JO1366 enable net CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; incorporation along thermodynamically feasible pathways with glycerol as substrate and 34 with glucose. The most promising products in terms of carbon assimilation yield and thermodynamic driving forces are orotate, aspartate and the C4-metabolites of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. We also identified thermodynamic bottlenecks frequently limiting the maximal driving force of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-fixing pathways. Our results indicate that heterotrophic organisms like &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; hold a possibly underestimated potential for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; assimilation which may complement existing biotechnological approaches for capturing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, we envision that the developed &lt;i&gt;OptMDFpathway&lt;/i&gt; approach can be used for many other applications within the framework of constrained-based modeling and for rational design of metabolic networks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4gUy88yqGt0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Studies of neuron-behaviour correlation and causal manipulation have long been used separately to understand the neural basis of perception. Yet these approaches sometimes lead to drastically conflicting conclusions about the functional role of brain areas. Theories that focus only on choice-related neuronal activity cannot reconcile those findings without additional experiments involving large-scale recordings to measure interneuronal correlations. By expanding current theories of neural coding and incorporating results from inactivation experiments, we demonstrate here that it is possible to infer decoding weights of different brain areas at a coarse scale without precise knowledge of the correlation structure. We apply this technique to neural data collected from two different cortical areas in macaque monkeys trained to perform a heading discrimination task. We identify two opposing decoding schemes, each consistent with data depending on the nature of correlated noise. Our theory makes specific testable predictions to distinguish these scenarios experimentally without requiring measurement of the underlying noise correlations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0oFfpAXFrZQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Proteome-scale relationships between local amino acid composition and protein fates and functions</title>

Proteins with low-complexity domains continue to emerge as key players in both normal and pathological cellular processes. Although low-complexity domains are often grouped into a single class, individual low-complexity domains can differ substantially with respect to amino acid composition. These differences may strongly influence the physical properties, cellular regulation, and molecular functions of low-complexity domains. Therefore, we developed a bioinformatic approach to explore relationships between amino acid composition, protein metabolism, and protein function. We find that local compositional enrichment within protein sequences is associated with differences in translation efficiency, abundance, half-life, protein-protein interaction promiscuity, subcellular localization, and molecular functions of proteins on a proteome-wide scale. However, local enrichment of related amino acids is sometimes associated with opposite effects on protein regulation and function, highlighting the importance of distinguishing between different types of low-complexity domains. Furthermore, many of these effects are discernible at amino acid compositions below those required for classification as low-complexity or statistically-biased by traditional methods and in the absence of homopolymeric amino acid repeats, indicating that thresholds employed by classical methods may not reflect biologically relevant criteria. Application of our analyses to composition-driven processes, such as the formation of membraneless organelles, reveals distinct composition profiles even for closely related organelles. Collectively, these results provide a unique perspective and detailed insights into relationships between amino acid composition, protein metabolism, and protein functions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/x3TzhcTkcXI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Expression of Transcripts Selective for GABA Neuron Subpopulations across the Cortical Visuospatial Working Memory Network in the Healthy State and Schizophrenia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy227</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy227/5106159?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Visuospatial working memory (WM), which is impaired in schizophrenia, depends on a distributed network including visual, posterior parietal, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortical regions. Within each region, information processing is differentially regulated by subsets of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons that express parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SST), or vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). In schizophrenia, WM impairments have been associated with alterations of PV and SST neurons in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Here, we quantified transcripts selectively expressed in GABA neuron subsets across four cortical regions in the WM network from comparison and schizophrenia subjects. In comparison subjects, PV mRNA levels declined and SST mRNA levels increased from posterior to anterior regions, whereas VIP mRNA levels were comparable across regions except for the primary visual cortex (V1). In schizophrenia subjects, each transcript in PV and SST neurons exhibited similar alterations across all regions, whereas transcripts in VIP neurons were unaltered in any region except for V1. These findings suggest that the contribution of each GABA neuron subset to inhibitory regulation of local circuitry normally differs across cortical regions of the visuospatial WM network and that in schizophrenia alterations of PV and SST neurons are a shared feature across these regions, whereas VIP neurons are affected only in V1.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Although less well appreciated, many other types of cells also send out similar finger-like projections. Indeed, unlike neuronal specific phenomena such as synapse formation or synaptic transmission, an important issue for thought is that this critical long-standing question of how a cellular process like an axon or dendrite forms and extends is not primarily a neuroscience problem but a cell biological problem. In that case, the use of simple cellular processes — such as the bristle cell process of Drosophila — can aid in the fight to answer these critical questions. Specifically, determining how a model cellular process is generated can provide a framework for manipulations of all types of membranous process-containing cells, including different types of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Condition-adaptive fused graphical lasso (CFGL): An adaptive procedure for inferring condition-specific gene co-expression network</title>

Co-expression network analysis provides useful information for studying gene regulation in biological processes. Examining condition-specific patterns of co-expression can provide insights into the underlying cellular processes activated in a particular condition. One challenge in this type of analysis is that the sample sizes in each condition are usually small, making the statistical inference of co-expression patterns highly underpowered. A joint network construction that borrows information from related structures across conditions has the potential to improve the power of the analysis. One possible approach to constructing the co-expression network is to use the Gaussian graphical model. Though several methods are available for joint estimation of multiple graphical models, they do not fully account for the heterogeneity between samples and between co-expression patterns introduced by condition specificity. Here we develop the condition-adaptive fused graphical lasso (CFGL), a data-driven approach to incorporate condition specificity in the estimation of co-expression networks. We show that this method improves the accuracy with which networks are learned. The application of this method on a rat multi-tissue dataset and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer dataset provides interesting biological insights. In both analyses, we identify numerous modules enriched for Gene Ontology functions and observe that the modules that are upregulated in a particular condition are often involved in condition-specific activities. Interestingly, we observe that the genes strongly associated with survival time in the TCGA dataset are less likely to be network hubs, suggesting that genes associated with cancer progression are likely to govern specific functions or execute final biological functions in pathways, rather than regulating a large number of biological processes. Additionally, we observed that the tumor-specific hub genes tend to have few shared edges with normal tissue, revealing tumor-specific regulatory mechanism.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sYsvXJw3a1s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Systematic analysis of transmitter co-expression reveals organizing principles of local interneuron heterogeneity</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Broad neuronal classes are surprisingly heterogeneous across many parameters and sub-classes often exhibit partially overlapping traits including transmitter co-expression. However, the extent to which transmitter co-expression occurs in predictable, consistent patterns is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that pairwise co-expression of GABA and multiple neuropeptide families by olfactory local interneurons (LNs) of the moth &lt;i&gt;Manduca sexta&lt;/i&gt; is highly heterogeneous, with a single LN capable of expressing neuropeptides from at least four peptide families and few instances in which neuropeptides are consistently co-expressed. Using computational modeling, we demonstrate that observed co-expression patterns cannot be explained by independent probabilities of expression of each neuropeptide. Our analyses point to three organizing principles that once taken into consideration allow replication of overall co-expression structure: 1- peptidergic neurons are highly likely to -co-express GABA; 2- expression probability of Allatotropin depends upon Myoinhibitory peptide expression; 3- the all-or-none co-expression patterns of Tachykinin neurons with several other neuropeptides. For other peptide pairs, the presence of one peptide was not predictive of the presence of the other and co-expression probability could be replicated by independent probabilities. The stochastic nature of these co-expression patterns highlights the heterogeneity of transmitter content among LNs and argues against clear-cut definition of subpopulation types based on the presence of &lt;i&gt;single&lt;/i&gt; neuropeptides. Furthermore, the receptors for all neuropeptides and GABA were expressed within each population of principal neuron type in the AL. Thus, activation of any given LN results in a dynamic cocktail of modulators that have the potential to influence every level of olfactory processing within the AL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Understanding the functional roles of individual local interneurons (LNs) is complex because traits, like transmitter co-expression, are often partially overlapping across the population. Here, we find that single olfactory LNs co-express neuropeptides from at least four individual peptide families, and that GABA and neuropeptides are partially and heterogeneously co-expressed across the entire population. The stochastic nature of many observed co-expression patterns argues against clear-cut and exclusive definition of subpopulations based on the expression of &lt;i&gt;single&lt;/i&gt; neuropeptides. Overall, our results suggest that activation of any given LN causes the release of a variable combination of neuropeptides and GABA that, based on receptor expression, target the input, output and local processing stages of the olfactory coding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

One of the marvels of biology is the phenotypic plasticity of microorganisms. It allows them to maintain high growth rates across conditions. Studies suggest that cells can express metabolic enzymes at tuned concentrations through adjustment of gene expression. The associated transcription factors are often regulated by intracellular metabolites. Here we study metabolite-mediated regulation of metabolic-gene expression that maximises metabolic fluxes across conditions. We developed an adaptive control theory, &lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt;ORAC (for ‘Specific Flux (q) Optimization by Robust Adaptive Control’), and illustrate it with several examples of metabolic pathways. The key feature of the theory is that it does not require knowledge of the regulatory network, only of the metabolic part. We derive that maximal metabolic flux can be maintained in the face of varying &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; environmental parameters only if the number of transcription-factor binding metabolites is at least equal to &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. The controlling circuits appear to require simple biochemical kinetics. We conclude that microorganisms likely can achieve maximal rates in metabolic pathways, in the face of environmental changes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xhqkoxj5QT8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Transition state characteristics during cell differentiation</title>

Models describing the process of stem-cell differentiation are plentiful, and may offer insights into the underlying mechanisms and experimentally observed behaviour. Waddington’s epigenetic landscape has been providing a conceptual framework for differentiation processes since its inception. It also allows, however, for detailed mathematical and quantitative analyses, as the landscape can, at least in principle, be related to mathematical models of dynamical systems. Here we focus on a set of dynamical systems features that are intimately linked to cell differentiation, by considering exemplar dynamical models that capture important aspects of stem cell differentiation dynamics. These models allow us to map the paths that cells take through gene expression space as they move from one fate to another, e.g. from a stem-cell to a more specialized cell type. Our analysis highlights the role of the transition state (TS) that separates distinct cell fates, and how the nature of the TS changes as the underlying landscape changes—change that can be induced by e.g. cellular signaling. We demonstrate that models for stem cell differentiation may be interpreted in terms of either a static or transitory landscape. For the static case the TS represents a particular transcriptional profile that all cells approach during differentiation. Alternatively, the TS may refer to the commonly observed period of heterogeneity as cells undergo stochastic transitions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/US819jwYZK0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Intrinsic plasticity is expressed in virtually all neuronal types including principal cells and interneurons. Activation of synaptic glutamate receptors initiates long-lasting changes in neuronal excitability at presynaptic and postsynaptic side. As synaptic plasticity, intrinsic plasticity is bi-directional and expresses a certain level of input-specificity or cell-specificity. We discuss here the nature of the learning rules shared by intrinsic and synaptic plasticity and the impact of intrinsic plasticity on temporal processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

The attenuation of either maintenance or plasticity leads to impaired circuit function and ultimately to neurodegenerative disorders. Over the last few years, significant discoveries of molecular mechanisms were made that mediate the formation and maintenance of axons. Here, we highlight intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms that ensure the health and survival of axons. We also briefly discuss examples of mutations associated with impaired axonal maintenance identified in specific neurological conditions. A better understanding of these mechanisms will therefore help to define targets for therapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Distinctive Structural and Molecular Features of Myelinated Inhibitory Axons in Human Neocortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0297-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Numerous types of inhibitory neurons sculpt the performance of human neocortical circuits, with each type exhibiting a constellation of subcellular phenotypic features in support of its specialized functions. Axonal myelination has been absent among the characteristics used to distinguish inhibitory neuron types; in fact, very little is known about myelinated inhibitory axons in human neocortex. Here, using array tomography to analyze samples of neurosurgically excised human neocortex, we show that inhibitory myelinated axons originate predominantly from parvalbumin-containing interneurons. Compared to myelinated excitatory axons, they have higher neurofilament and lower microtubule content, shorter nodes of Ranvier, and more myelin basic protein in their myelin sheath. Furthermore, these inhibitory axons have more mitochondria, likely to sustain the high energy demands of parvalbumin interneurons, as well as more 2’,3’-cyclic nucleotide 3’-phosphodiesterase, a protein enriched in the myelin cytoplasmic channels that are thought to facilitate the delivery of nutrients from ensheathing oligodendrocytes. Our results demonstrate that myelinated axons of parvalbumin inhibitory interneurons exhibit distinctive features that may support the specialized functions of this neuron type in human neocortical circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Numerous myelinated axons traverse the human neocortex, enabling fast and efficient signal transmission. Myelinated axons originate from both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, but their properties have rarely been studied in relation to parent neuron type. Here, we show that axons of inhibitory neurons have distinctive structural and molecular features that contrast with those of the majority of excitatory myelinated axons in human neocortex. These differences are likely to have important implications for neurological disorders that involve pathologies of myelinated axons. For example, the distinct molecular and structural organization of inhibitory and excitatory myelinated axons may underlie differences in their vulnerability in neurological disorders or to injuries, and may require different strategies for prevention and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Sniffing fast: paradoxical effects on odor concentration discrimination at the levels of olfactory bulb output and behavior</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0148-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;In awake mice, sniffing behavior is subject to complex contextual modulation. It has been hypothesized that variance in inhalation dynamics alters odor concentration profiles in the naris despite a constant environmental concentration. Using whole cell recordings in the olfactory bulb of awake mice, we directly demonstrate that rapid sniffing mimics the effect of odor concentration increase at the level of both mitral and tufted cell (MTC) firing rate responses and temporal responses. Paradoxically, we find that mice are capable of discriminating fine concentration differences within short timescales despite highly variable sniffing behavior. One way that the olfactory system could differentiate between a change in sniffing and a change in concentration would be to receive information about the inhalation parameters in parallel with information about the odor. We find that the sniff-driven activity of MTCs without odor input is informative of the kind of inhalation that just occurred, allowing rapid detection of a change in inhalation. Thus, a possible reason for sniff modulation of the early olfactory system may be to directly inform downstream centres of nasal flow dynamics, so that an inference can be made about environmental concentration independent of sniff variance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; One of the fundamental tasks of the brain is to represent the features of the environment in a stable way. In the olfactory system, it has been hypothesized that changing the way you sniff will alter the concentration of odor coming into the nasal passage, even though the environmental concentration has not changed. Here we show that indeed, the effect of faster sniffing on olfactory bulb responses is very similar to increasing odor concentration. Despite this, mice can easily tell the difference between a change in sniffing and a change in concentration in an olfactory task. To resolve this apparent discrepancy, we suggest and give evidence for ways in which olfactory bulb information about sniffing parameters may be utilised.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Morphological and Biophysical Determinants of the Intracellular and Extracellular Waveforms in Nigral Dopaminergic Neurons: A Computational Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/38/8295?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/38/8295?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Action potentials (APs) in nigral dopaminergic neurons often exhibit two separate components: the first reflecting spike initiation in the dendritically located axon initial segment (AIS) and the second the subsequent dendro-somatic spike. These components are separated by a &lt;i&gt;notch&lt;/i&gt; in the ascending phase of the somatic extracellular waveform and in the temporal derivative of the somatic intracellular waveform. Still, considerable variability exists in the presence and magnitude of the &lt;i&gt;notch&lt;/i&gt; across neurons. To systematically address the contribution of AIS, dendritic and somatic compartments to shaping the two-component APs, we modeled APs of previously &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiologically characterized and 3D-reconstructed male mouse and rat dopaminergic neurons. A parsimonious two-domain model, with high (AIS) and lower (dendro-somatic) Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductance, reproduced the notch in the temporal derivatives, but not in the extracellular APs, regardless of morphology. The notch was only revealed when somatic active currents were reduced, constraining the model to three domains. Thus, an initial AIS spike is followed by an actively generated spike by the axon-bearing dendrite (ABD), in turn followed mostly passively by the soma. The transition from being a source compartment for the AIS spike to a source compartment for the ABD spike satisfactorily explains the extracellular somatic notch. Larger AISs and thinner ABD (but not soma-to-AIS distance) accentuate the AIS component. We conclude that variability in AIS size and ABD caliber explains variability in AP extracellular waveform and separation of AIS and dendro-somatic components, given the presence of at least three functional domains with distinct excitability characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Midbrain dopamine neurons make an important contribution to circuits mediating motivation and movement. Understanding the basic rules that govern the electrical activity of single dopaminergic neurons is therefore essential to reveal how they ultimately contribute to movement and motivation as well as what goes wrong in associated disorders. Our computational study focuses on the generation and propagation of action potentials and shows that different morphologies and excitability characteristics of the cell body, dendrites and proximal axon can explain the diversity of action potentials shapes in this population. These compartments likely make differential contributions both to normal dopaminergic signaling and could potentially underlie pathological dopaminergic signaling implicated in addiction, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and other disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Dynamics of biomolecular assemblies offer invaluable insights into their functional mechanisms. For extremely large biomolecular systems, such as HIV-1 capsid that has nearly 5 millions atoms, obtaining its normal mode dynamics using even coarse-grained models can be a challenging task. In this work, we have successfully carried out a normal mode analysis of an entire HIV-1 capsid in full all-atom details. This is made possible through our newly developed BOSE (Block of Selected Elasticity) model that is founded on the principle of resonance discovered in our recent work. The resonance principle makes it possible to most efficiently compute the vibrations of a whole capsid at any given frequency by projecting the motions of component capsomeres into a narrow subspace. We have conducted also assessments of the quality of the BOSE modes by comparing them with benchmark modes obtained directly from the original Hessian matrix. Our all-atom normal mode dynamics study of the HIV-1 capsid reveals the dynamic role of the pentamers in stabilizing the capsid structure and is in agreement with experimental findings that suggest capsid disassembly and uncoating start when the pentamers become destabilized. Our results on the dynamics of hexamer pores suggest that nucleotide transport should take place mostly at hexamers near pentamers, especially at the larger hemispherical end.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6rrbmtVPD1U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Robust spatial memory maps encoded by networks with transient connections</title>

The spiking activity of principal cells in mammalian hippocampus encodes an internalized neuronal representation of the ambient space—a cognitive map. Once learned, such a map enables the animal to navigate a given environment for a long period. However, the neuronal substrate that produces this map is transient: the synaptic connections in the hippocampus and in the downstream neuronal networks never cease to form and to deteriorate at a rapid rate. How can the brain maintain a robust, reliable representation of space using a network that constantly changes its architecture? We address this question using a computational framework that allows evaluating the effect produced by the decaying connections between simulated hippocampal neurons on the properties of the cognitive map. Using novel Algebraic Topology techniques, we demonstrate that emergence of stable cognitive maps produced by networks with transient architectures is a generic phenomenon. The model also points out that deterioration of the cognitive map caused by weakening or lost connections between neurons may be compensated by simulating the neuronal activity. Lastly, the model explicates the importance of the complementary learning systems for processing spatial information at different levels of spatiotemporal granularity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gbbOgT7E6ek&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Despite significant progress in understanding cocaine-induced plasticity, an effective treatment of cocaine addiction is lacking. Chronic cocaine potentiates excitatory and alters inhibitory transmission to dopamine neurons, induces dopamine neuron hyperexcitability, and reduces dopamine release in projection areas. Understanding how intrinsic and synaptic plasticity interact to control dopamine neuron firing and dopamine release could prove useful in the development of new therapeutics. In this review, we examine recent literature discussing cocaine-induced plasticity in the VTA and highlight potential therapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Automatic Cell Segmentation by Adaptive Thresholding (ACSAT) for Large-Scale Calcium Imaging Datasets</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Advances in calcium imaging have made it possible to record from an increasingly larger number of neurons simultaneously. Neuroscientists can now routinely image hundreds to thousands of individual neurons. An emerging technical challenge that parallels the advancement in imaging a large number of individual neurons is the processing of correspondingly large datasets. One important step is the identification of individual neurons. Traditional methods rely mainly on manual or semimanual inspection, which cannot be scaled for processing large datasets. To address this challenge, we focused on developing an automated segmentation method, which we refer to as automated cell segmentation by adaptive thresholding (ACSAT). ACSAT works with a time-collapsed image and includes an iterative procedure that automatically calculates global and local threshold values during successive iterations based on the distribution of image pixel intensities. Thus, the algorithm is capable of handling variations in morphological details and in fluorescence intensities in different calcium imaging datasets. In this paper, we demonstrate the utility of ACSAT by testing it on 500 simulated datasets, two wide-field hippocampus datasets, a wide-field striatum dataset, a wide-field cell culture dataset, and a two-photon hippocampus dataset. For the simulated datasets with truth, ACSAT achieved &amp;gt;80% recall and precision when the signal-to-noise ratio was no less than ~24 dB.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus is integral to working and episodic memory, and is a central region of interest in diseases affecting these processes. Pig models are widely used in translational research, and may provide an excellent bridge between rodents and non-human primates for CNS disease models due to their gyrencephalic neuroanatomy and significant white matter composition. However, the laminar structure of the pig hippocampus has not been well characterized. Therefore, we histologically characterized the dorsal hippocampus of Yucatan miniature pigs and quantified the cytoarchitecture of the hippocampal layers. We then utilized stereotaxis combined with single unit electrophysiological mapping to precisely place multichannel laminar silicon probes into the dorsal hippocampus without the need for image guidance. We used &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiological recordings of simultaneous laminar field potentials and single unit activity in multiple layers of the dorsal hippocampus to physiologically identify and quantify these layers under anesthesia. Consistent with previous reports, we found the porcine hippocampus to have the expected archicortical laminar structure with some anatomical and histological features comparable to the rodent and others to the primate hippocampus. Importantly, we found these distinct features to be reflected in the laminar electrophysiology. This characterization, as well as our electrophysiology-based methodology targeting the porcine hippocampal lamina combined with high channel count silicon probes will allow for analysis of spike-field interactions during normal and disease states in both anesthetized and future awake behaving neurophysiology in this large animal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The hippocampus is central to working and episodic memory and is critically affected by diverse disease processes. In order to investigate hippocampal electrophysiology in translational large animal models, we developed an imaging-free stereotaxis and intraoperative electrophysiology methodology with custom silicon probes to precisely localize probe placement within the hippocampal laminar structure. We report for the first time the profile of single units and local field potentials in the pig dorsal hippocampus and relate them to a histological description. This characterization forms the basis for accessible translational pig models to study diseases of the central nervous system affecting hippocampal circuitry in the large animal gyrencephalic brain, as well as the groundwork for potential awake behaving neurophysiology of the porcine hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Dynamic and Sex-Specific Changes in Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Neuron Activity and Excitability in a Mouse Model of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Reproductive endocrine disorders are prominent co-morbidities of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in both men and women. The neural mechanisms underlying these co-morbidities remain unclear, but hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons may be involved. Here we report the first direct demonstrations of aberrant GnRH neuron function in an animal model of epilepsy. Recordings of GnRH neuron firing and excitability were made in acute mouse brain slices prepared 2 months after intrahippocampal injection of kainate (KA) or control saline, a well-established TLE model in which most females develop co-morbid estrous cycle disruption. GnRH neurons from control females showed elevated firing and excitability on estrus compared with diestrus. By contrast, cells from KA-injected females that developed prolonged, disrupted estrous cycles (KA-long) showed the reverse pattern. Firing rates of cells from KA-injected females that maintained regular cycles (KA-regular) were not different from controls on diestrus, but were reduced on estrus. In KA-injected males, only GnRH neurons in the medial septum displayed elevated firing. In contrast to the diestrus-vs.-estrus and sex-specific changes in firing, GnRH neuron intrinsic excitability was elevated in all KA-injected groups, indicating a role for afferent synaptic and neuromodulatory inputs in shaping overall changes in firing activity. Furthermore, KA-injected females showed cycle-stage-specific changes in circulating sex steroids on diestrus and estrus that also differed between KA-long and KA-regular groups. Together, these findings reveal that the effects of epilepsy on the neural control of reproduction are dynamic across the estrous cycle, distinct in association with co-morbid estrous cycle disruption severity, and sex-specific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; People with epilepsy are at higher risk of reproductive endocrine disorders compared with the general population, but the neural mechanisms linking epilepsy and these co-morbidities are unknown. Here we report changes in the function of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, which control fertility, in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. GnRH neurons from epileptic female mice showed changes in activity dependent on estrous cycle stage and associated with severity of cycle disruption. The impacts of epilepsy on GnRH neurons in males were less severe. These findings provide novel evidence for impacts of epilepsy on GnRH neuron function, and will thus be of clinical relevance in developing new strategies to ameliorate reproductive co-morbidities and to treat the underlying seizures and epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Connectome of the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus: New evidence of the core-shell relationship</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;A brain clock, constituted of ~20,000 peptidergically heterogeneous neurons, is located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). While many peptidergic cell types have been identified, little is known about the connections among these neurons in mice. We first sought to identify contacts among major peptidergic cell types in the SCN using triple-label fluorescent immunocytochemistry. To this end, contacts among vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), and calretinin (CALR) cells of the core, and arginine vasopressin (AVP) and met-enkephalin (ENK) cells of the shell were analyzed. Some core-to-shell and shell-to-core communications are specialized. We found that in wild-type mice, AVP fibers make extremely sparse contacts onto VIP neurons but contacts in the reverse direction are numerous. In contrast, AVP fibers make more contacts onto GRP neurons than conversely. For the other cell types tested, largely reciprocal connections are made. These results point to peptidergic cell type specific communications between core and shell SCN neurons. To further understand the impact of VIP-to-AVP communication, we next explored the SCN in VIP deficient mice (VIP-KO). In these animals, AVP expression is markedly reduced in the SCN, but it is not altered in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei. Surprisingly, in VIP-KO mice, the number of AVP appositions onto other peptidergic cell types is not different from controls. Colchicine administration, which blocks AVP transport, restored numbers of AVP neurons to that of wild-type littermates. The results indicate that VIP has an important role in modulating AVP expression levels in the SCN in this mouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement:&lt;/b&gt; The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) brain clock bears ~20,000 neurons of many peptidergic types. Numerous studies have focused broadly on the core- (VIP-rich) to shell (AVP-rich) areas, leaving aside questions of interconnections among specific peptidergic neuron types. Here we describe contacts between AVP, GRP, VIP, ENK, and CALR SCN peptidergic phenotypes in wild-type mice, and examine changes to these connections consequent to loss of the key core peptide, VIP. Thus, in the absence of VIP, expression of the shell peptide AVP was reduced. The work delineates interrelationships among specific SCN neurons and highlights a complexity in interpreting the consequences of single gene knockouts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Strategic and dynamic temporal weighting for perceptual decisions in humans and macaques</title>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Perceptual decision-making is often modeled as the accumulation of sensory evidence over time. Recent studies using psychophysical reverse correlation have shown that even though the sensory evidence is stationary over time, subjects may exhibit a time-varying weighting strategy, weighting some stimulus epochs more heavily than others. While previous work has explained time-varying weighting as a consequence of static decision mechanisms (e.g., decision bound or leak), here we show that time-varying weighting can reflect strategic adaptation to stimulus statistics, and thus can readily take a number of forms. We characterized the temporal weighting strategies of humans and macaques performing a motion discrimination task in which the amount of information carried by motion stimulus was manipulated over time. Both species could adapt their temporal weighting strategy to match the time-varying statistics of the sensory stimulus. When early stimulus epochs had higher mean motion strength than late, subjects adopted a pronounced early weighting strategy, where early information was weighted more heavily in guiding perceptual decisions. When the mean motion strength was greater in later stimulus epochs, in contrast, subjects shifted to a marked late-weighting strategy. These results demonstrate that perceptual decisions involve a temporally flexible weighting process in both humans and monkeys, and introduce a paradigm with which to manipulate sensory stimuli in decision-making tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; During decision-making, the weight assigned by subjects to sensory information over time is not necessarily constant. Such time-varying weighting is often interpreted as a signature of a particular decision-making model (e.g., higher weighting of early stimulus information is consistent with a bounded accumulation process). Temporal weighting may also result, however, from a strategic reweighting of the stimulus evidence itself that takes place before and/or independent of a decision-making mechanism. Here we use a psychophysical reverse correlation paradigm to both measure and manipulate temporal weighting behavior. We demonstrate that both humans and macaques adopt weighting strategies that are flexible, consistent with dynamic reweighing of the sensory stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CNS lymphatic drainage and neuroinflammation are regulated by meningeal lymphatic vasculature&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CNS lymphatic drainage and neuroinflammation are regulated by meningeal lymphatic vasculature, Published online: 17 September 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0227-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-018-0227-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Louveau et al. demonstrate that meningeal lymphatics drain CSF-derived macromolecules and immune cells and play a key role in regulating neuroinflammation. Meningeal lymphatics may represent a new therapeutic target for multiple sclerosis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/m5v3ZXdjCa4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Inhibitory connectivity defines the realm of excitatory plasticity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inhibitory connectivity defines the realm of excitatory plasticity, Published online: 17 September 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0226-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-018-0226-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Mongillo et al. use theoretical modeling to link structure &amp;amp; activity in a cortical network. They find that activity patterns are predominantly controlled by inhibitory connections, making the network robust to ongoing changes in excitatory synapses.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/Zwrv6SbZUlA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Porf-2 = Arhgap39 = Vilse: A Pivotal Role in Neurodevelopment, Learning and Memory</title>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Small GTP converting enzymes, GTPases, are essential for the efficient completion of many physiological and developmental processes. They are regulated by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). &lt;i&gt;Arhgap39&lt;/i&gt;, also known as preoptic regulatory factor-2 (Porf-2) or Vilse, a member of the Rho GAP group, was first identified in 1990 in the rat CNS. It has since been shown to regulate apoptosis, cell migration, neurogenesis and cerebral and hippocampal dendritic spine morphology. It plays a pivotal role in neurodevelopment and learning and memory. Homologous or orthologous genes are found in over 280 vertebrate and invertebrate species suggesting preservation through evolution. Not surprisingly, loss of the &lt;i&gt;Arhgap39/Porf-2&lt;/i&gt; gene in mice manifests as an embryonic lethal condition. Although &lt;i&gt;Arhgap39/Porf-2&lt;/i&gt; is highly expressed in the brain, it is also widely distributed throughout the body, with potential additional roles in oncogenesis and morphogenesis. This review summarizes, for the first time, the known information about this gene under its various names, in addition to considering its transcripts and proteins. The majority of findings described have been made in rats, mice, humans and fruit flies. This work surveys the known functions, functional mediators, variables modifying expression and upstream regulators of expression, and potential physiological and pathological roles of &lt;i&gt;Arhgap39/Porf-2&lt;/i&gt; in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This review comprehensively includes what is currently known about &lt;i&gt;Arhgap39/Porf-2&lt;/i&gt; under its multiple names. Arhgap39 is a critically required molecule for neurodevelopment, learning and memory that is expressed throughout the lifespan. It also has definitive roles in stem cell fate and cell migration, apoptosis and proliferation, in both neural and non-neural sites. Homologous or orthologous genes have been conserved for millennia through evolution with a wide phylogenetic distribution from invertebrates to mammals. Its expression is exquisitely regulated by age, sex, location and hormones. The consequences of dysregulation of &lt;i&gt;Arhgap39&lt;/i&gt; are currently under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: February 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 54&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Ilona C Grunwald Kadow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behaviors are often categorized into innate or learned. Innate behaviors are thought to be genetically encoded and hardwired into the brain, while learned behavior is a product of the interaction between experience and the plasticity of synapses and neurons. Recent work in different models show that innate behavior, too, is plastic and depends on the current behavioral context and the internal state of an animal. Furthermore, these studies suggest that the neural circuits underpinning innate and learned behavior interact and even overlap. For instance, hunger modulates several innate behaviors relying in part on neural circuits required for learning and memory such as the mushroom body in the fruit fly. These new findings suggest that state-dependent innate behavior and learning rely on functionally and anatomically overlapping and shared neural circuits indicating a common evolutionary history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
