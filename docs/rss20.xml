	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Making Sense of Consciousness as Integrated Information: Evolution and Issues of IIT. (arXiv:1807.02103v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we explore how Integrated Information Theory of consciousness
(IIT) has evolved and what problems are involved in the theory. IIT is a
hypothesis that consciousness can be explained in terms of integrated
information. It argues that a number of fundamental properties of experience
can be properly analyzed and explained by physical systems' informational
properties. Throughout the last decade, there have been many advances in IIT's
theoretical structure and mathematical model. In addition, as all hypotheses in
the field of science of consciousness, IIT has given rise to several
controversies and issues. In this context, a critical survey for IIT is
urgently needed. To this end, we first introduce fundamental concepts of IIT
and related issues. Thereafter, we discuss major transitions IIT has been
through and how they affect IIT. Finally, in the last section, some theoretical
issues involved in IIT's principles are presented. The paper concludes by
suggesting that, for the sake of future development, IIT should more seriously
take metacognitive accessibility to experience.

	<title>eLife: latest articles: An automated high-resolution in vivo screen in zebrafish to identify chemical regulators of myelination</title>

	<description>Myelinating oligodendrocytes are essential for central nervous system (CNS) formation and function. Their disruption is implicated in numerous neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. However, recent studies have indicated that oligodendrocytes may be tractable for treatment of disease. In recent years, zebrafish have become well established for the study of myelinating oligodendrocyte biology and drug discovery &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Here, by automating the delivery of zebrafish larvae to a spinning disk confocal microscope, we were able to automate high-resolution imaging of myelinating oligodendrocytes &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. From there, we developed an image analysis pipeline that facilitated a screen of compounds with epigenetic and post-translational targets for their effects on regulating myelinating oligodendrocyte number. This screen identified novel compounds that strongly promote myelinating oligodendrocyte formation &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Our imaging platform and analysis pipeline is flexible and can be employed for high-resolution imaging-based screens of broad interest using zebrafish.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: G9a/GLP Complex Acts as a Bidirectional Switch to Regulate Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor-Dependent Plasticity in Hippocampal CA1 Pyramidal Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy161</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy161/5049853?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent long-term depression (mGluR-LTD) is conventionally considered to be solely dependent on local protein synthesis. Given the impact of epigenetics on memory, the intriguing question is whether epigenetic regulation influences mGluR-LTD as well. G9a/GLP histone lysine methyltransferase complex is crucial for brain development and goal-directed learning as well as for drug-addiction. In this study, we analyzed whether the epigenetic regulation by G9a/GLP complex affects mGluR-LTD in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons of 5–7 weeks old male Wistar rats. In hippocampal slices with intact CA1 dendritic regions, inhibition of G9a/GLP activity abolished mGluR-LTD. The inhibition of this complex upregulated the expression of plasticity proteins like PKMζ, which mediated the prevention of mGluR-LTD expression by regulating the NSF-GluA2-mediated trafficking of AMPA receptors towards the postsynaptic site. G9a/GLP inhibition during the induction of mGluR-LTD also downregulated the protein levels of phosphorylated-GluA2 and Arc. Interestingly, G9a/GLP inhibition could not impede the mGluR-LTD when the cell-body was severed. Our study highlights the role of G9a/GLP complex in intact neuronal network as a bidirectional switch; when turned on, it facilitates the expression of mGluR-LTD, and when turned off, it promotes the expression of long-term potentiation.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Cortical Neuron Migration and Dendrite Morphology are Regulated by Carboxypeptidase E</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy155</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy155/5049851?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Higher brain function relies on proper development of the cerebral cortex, including correct positioning of neurons and dendrite morphology. Disruptions in these processes may result in various neurocognitive disorders. Mutations in the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;CPE&lt;/span&gt; gene, which encodes carboxypeptidase E (CPE), have been linked to depression and intellectual disability. However, it remains unclear whether CPE is involved in early brain development and in turn contributes to the pathophysiology of neurocognitive disorders. Here, we investigate the effects of CPE knockdown on early brain development and explore the functional significance of the interaction between CPE and its binding partner p150&lt;sup&gt;Glued&lt;/sup&gt;. We demonstrate that CPE is required for cortical neuron migration and dendrite arborization. Furthermore, we show that expression of CPE-C10 redistributes p150&lt;sup&gt;Glued&lt;/sup&gt; from the centrosome and that disruption of CPE interaction with p150&lt;sup&gt;Glued&lt;/sup&gt; leads to abnormal neuronal migration and dendrite morphology, suggesting that a complex between CPE and p150&lt;sup&gt;Glued&lt;/sup&gt; is necessary for proper neurodevelopment.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Sparse Labeling and Neural Tracing in Brain Circuits by STARS Strategy: Revealing Morphological Development of Type II Spiral Ganglion Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy154</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Elucidating axonal and dendritic projection patterns of individual neurons is a key for understanding the cytoarchitecture of neural circuits in the brain. This requires genetic approaches to achieve Golgi-like sparse labeling of desired types of neurons. Here, we explored a novel strategy of stochastic gene activation with regulated sparseness (STARS), in which the stochastic choice between 2 competing Cre-&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;lox&lt;/span&gt; recombination events is controlled by varying the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;lox&lt;/span&gt; efficiency and cassette length. In a created STARS transgenic mouse crossed with various Cre driver lines, sparse neuronal labeling with a relatively uniform level of sparseness was achieved across different brain regions and cell types in both central and peripheral nervous systems. Tracing of individual type II peripheral auditory fibers revealed for the first time that they undergo experience-dependent developmental refinement, which is impaired by attenuating external sound input. Our results suggest that STARS strategy can be applied for circuit mapping and sparse gene manipulation.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Neural Basis of Sensorimotor Plasticity in Speech Motor Adaptation</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;When we speak, we get correlated sensory feedback from speech sounds and from the muscles and soft tissues of the vocal tract. Here we dissociate the contributions of auditory and somatosensory feedback to identify brain networks that underlie the somatic contribution to speech motor learning. The technique uses a robotic device that selectively alters somatosensory inputs in combination with resting-state fMRI scans that reveal learning-related changes in functional connectivity. A partial correlation analysis is used to identify connectivity changes that are not explained by the time course of activity in any other learning-related areas. This analysis revealed changes related to behavioral improvements in movement and separately, to changes in auditory perception: Speech motor adaptation itself was associated with connectivity changes that were primarily in non-motor areas of brain, specifically, to a strengthening of connectivity between auditory and somatosensory cortex and between presupplementary motor area and the inferior parietal lobule. In contrast, connectively changes associated with alterations to auditory perception were restricted to speech motor areas, specifically, primary motor cortex and inferior frontal gyrus. Overall, our findings show that during adaptation, somatosensory inputs result in a broad range of changes in connectivity in areas associated with speech motor control and learning.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Neuronal Mechanisms Recording the Stream of Consciousness–A Reappraisal of Wilder Penfield’s (1891–1976) Concept of Experiential Phenomena Elicited by Electrical Stimulation of the Human Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy085</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy085/5049846?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Research on memory has been a major focus in the neurosciences over the past decades. An important advance was achieved by Wilder Penfield at the Montreal Neurological Institute, who reported from the 1930s to the 1950s about experiential phenomena induced by electrical brain stimulation in humans, implying neuronal causation of memory. Since then, neuroscientists have addressed the topic of memory from a range of subdisciplines; however, these reports by Penfield and his group as well as those on patient H. M. by Brenda Milner at the same institution continue to be referenced as groundbreaking. Further experimental work by Nobel laureates Eric Kandel and John O’Keefe, as well as by Edvard and May-Britt Moser related Penfield’s patient documentation to experiential phenomena. However, our reassessment of Penfield’s original patient documentation questions the stance that he had uncovered the “storehouse of memories.” Human memory must be regarded more as context sensitive and as representative of an active reconstructive process, than as a simple recording of events. Hence, strategies aiming at naturalizing all phenomena of mind (including memory) to cellular and molecular mechanisms cannot convincingly refer to Penfield’s electrophysiological studies alone as evidence that memories are solely caused by neuronal firing patterns.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Statistical shape analysis of large datasets based on diffeomorphic iterative centroids</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/363861v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/363861v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>In this paper, we propose an approach for template-based shape analysis of large datasets, using diffeomorphic centroids as atlas shapes. Diffeomorphic centroid methods fit in the Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) framework and use kernel metrics on currents to quantify surface dissimilarities. The statistical analysis is based on a Kernel Principal Component Analysis (Kernel PCA) performed on the set of momentum vectors which parametrize the deformations. We tested the approach on different datasets of hippocampal shapes extracted from brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), compared three different centroid methods and a variational template estimation. The largest dataset is composed of 1000 surfaces, and we are able to analyse this dataset in 26 hours using a diffeomorphic centroid. Our experiments demonstrate that computing diffeomorphic centroids in place of standard variational templates leads to similar shape analysis results and saves around 70% of computation time. Furthermore, the approach is able to adequately capture the variability of hippocampal shapes with a reasonable number of dimensions, and to predict anatomical features of the hippocampus in healthy subjects.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Energetic substrate availability regulates synchronous activity in an excitatory neural network</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/363671v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Neural networks are required to meet significant metabolic demands associated with performing sophisticated computational tasks in the brain. The necessity for efficient transmission of information imposes stringent constraints on the metabolic pathways that can be used for energy generation at the synapse, and energetic substrate availability has been shown to reduce the efficacy of synaptic function. Here we take a combined experimental-computational approach to study the effects of energetic substrate availability on global neural network behavior and find that glucose alone can sustain excitatory neurotransmission required to generate high-frequency synchronous bursting that emerges in culture. In contrast, obligatory oxidative energetic substrates such as lactate and pyruvate are unable to substitute for glucose, indicating that glycolysis is the primary metabolic pathway underlying coordinated network activity. Our experimental results and computational modelling therefore support recent suggestions that glycolysis serves as the predominant source of ATP for synaptic vesicle recycling at presynaptic nerve terminals.</description>

	<description>Recent studies have demonstrated that task success signals can modulate behavioral changes during sensorimotor adaptation tasks, primarily through the engagement of explicit processes. In a series of reaching experiments with human participants, we explore a potential interaction between reward-based learning and implicit adaptation, using a method in which feedback is not contingent on task performance. We varied the size of the target to compare conditions in which visual feedback indicated an invariant angular error that either hit or missed the target. Hitting the target attenuated the behavioral changes from adaptation, an effect we attribute to the generation of an intrinsic reward signal. We evaluated two models, one in which reward and adaptation systems operate in parallel, and a second in which reward acts directly on the adaptation system. The results favor the latter, consistent with evidence showing communication, and possible overlap, between neural substrates underlying reward-based learning and sensorimotor adaptation.</description>

	<description>Tau is an axonal protein known to form abnormal aggregates and is the biomarker of Alzheimers disease. Metal-based therapeutics for inhibition of Tau aggregation is limited and rarely reported in the contemporary science. Here, the first example is reported of a rationally designed molecular cobalt(II)-complexes for effective inhibition of Tau and disaggregation of preformed Tau fibrils. The mechanistic studies revealed that the prevention of Tau aggregation by CBMCs is concentration-dependent and Tau seldom exhibits conformational changes. Interestingly, CBMCs play a dual role by causing disassembly of preformed aggregates as well as complete Tau inhibition. We believe that this unprecedented finding by the newly developed molecular complexes has a potential to lead to developing innovative metal-based therapeutics for Alzheimers disease.</description>

Focal adhesions are protein complexes that anchor cells to the extracellular matrix. During migration, the growth and disassembly of these structures are spatiotemporally regulated, with new adhesions forming at the leading edge of the cell and mature adhesions disassembling at the rear. Signalling proteins and structural cytoskeletal components tightly regulate adhesion dynamics. Paxillin, an adaptor protein within adhesions, is one of these proteins. Its phosphorylation at serine 273 (S273) is crucial for maintaining fast adhesion assembly and disassembly. Paxillin is known to bind to a GIT1-βPIX-PAK1 complex, which increases the local activation of the small GTPase Rac. To understand quantitatively the behaviour of this system and how it relates to adhesion assembly/disassembly, we developed a mathematical model describing the dynamics of the small GTPases Rac and Rho as determined by paxillin S273 phosphorylation. Our model revealed that the system possesses bistability, where switching between uninduced (active Rho) and induced (active Rac) states can occur through a change in rate of paxillin phosphorylation or PAK1 activation. The bistable switch is characterized by the presence of memory, minimal change in the levels of active Rac and Rho within the induced and uninduced states, respectively, and the limited regime of monostability associated with the uninduced state. These results were validated experimentally by showing the presence of bimodality in adhesion assembly and disassembly rates, and demonstrating that Rac activity increases after treating Chinese Hamster Ovary cells with okadaic acid (a paxillin phosphatase inhibitor), followed by a modest recovery after 20 min washout. Spatial gradients of phosphorylated paxillin in a reaction-diffusion model gave rise to distinct regions of Rac and Rho activities, resembling polarization of a cell into front and rear. Perturbing several parameters of the model also revealed important insights into how signalling components upstream and downstream of paxillin phosphorylation affect dynamics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4Bo3nqD1NCA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Genome-scale models of metabolism and macromolecular expression (ME-models) explicitly compute the optimal proteome composition of a growing cell. ME-models expand upon the well-established genome-scale models of metabolism (M-models), and they enable a new fundamental understanding of cellular growth. ME-models have increased predictive capabilities and accuracy due to their inclusion of the biosynthetic costs for the machinery of life, but they come with a significant increase in model size and complexity. This challenge results in models which are both difficult to compute and challenging to understand conceptually. As a result, ME-models exist for only two organisms (&lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Thermotoga maritima&lt;/i&gt;) and are still used by relatively few researchers. To address these challenges, we have developed a new software framework called COBRAme for building and simulating ME-models. It is coded in Python and built on COBRApy, a popular platform for using M-models. COBRAme streamlines computation and analysis of ME-models. It provides tools to simplify constructing and editing ME-models to enable ME-model reconstructions for new organisms. We used COBRAme to reconstruct a condensed &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; ME-model called &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;JL1678b-ME. This reformulated model gives functionally identical solutions to previous &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; ME-models while using 1/5 the number of free variables and solving in less than 10 minutes, a marked improvement over the 6 hour solve time of previous ME-model formulations. Errors in previous ME-models were also corrected leading to 52 additional genes that must be expressed in &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;JL1678b-ME to grow aerobically in glucose minimal &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; media. This manuscript outlines the architecture of COBRAme and demonstrates how ME-models can be created, modified, and shared most efficiently using the new software framework.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cjOqyaA5KvQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Moment-to-Moment Fluctuations in Neuronal Excitability Bias Subjective Perception Rather than Strategic Decision-Making</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Perceiving an external stimulus depends not only on the physical features of the stimulus, but also fundamentally on the current state of neuronal excitability, indexed by the power of ongoing alpha-band and beta-band oscillations (8–30 Hz). Recent studies suggest that heightened excitability does not improve perceptual precision, but biases observers to report the presence of a stimulus regardless of its physical presence. It is unknown whether this bias is due to changes in observers’ subjective perceptual experience (perceptual bias) or their perception-independent decision-making strategy (decision bias). We tested these alternative interpretations in an EEG experiment in which male and female human participants performed two-interval forced choice (2IFC) detection and discrimination. According to signal detection theory, perceptual bias only affects 2IFC detection, but not discrimination, while interval decision bias should be task independent. We found that correct detection was more likely when excitability before the stimulus-present interval exceeded that before the stimulus-absent interval (i.e., 8–17 Hz power was weaker before the stimulus-present interval), consistent with an effect of excitability on perceptual bias. By contrast, discrimination accuracy was unaffected by excitability fluctuations between intervals, ruling out an effect on interval decision bias. We conclude that the current state of neuronal excitability biases the perceptual experience itself, rather than the decision process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Loss of Blood-Brain Barrier Integrity in a KCl-Induced Model of Episodic Headache Enhances CNS Drug Delivery</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Cortical spreading depression (CSD) in the CNS is suggested as a common mechanism contributing to headache. Despite strong evidence for CNS involvement in headache disorders, drug development for headache disorders remains focused on peripheral targets. Difficulty in delivering drugs across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may partially account for this disparity. It is known, however, that BBB permeability is increased during several CNS pathologies. In this study, we investigated BBB changes in response to KCl-induced CSD events and subsequent allodynia in rats. Cortical KCl injection in awake, freely moving rats produced facial allodynia with peak intensity between 1.5 and 3 hours and CSD induction within 0.5 to 2 hours post-injection. Brain perfusion of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C-sucrose as a marker of BBB paracellular permeability revealed increased leak in the cortex, but not brainstem, beginning 0.5 hours post-KCl injection and resolving within 6 hours; no changes in tight junction (TJ) proteins occludin or claudin-5 expression were observed. Acute pre-treatment with topiramate to inhibit CSD did not prevent the increased BBB paracellular permeability. CNS delivery of the abortive anti-migraine agent sumatriptan was increased in the cortex 1.5 hours post-KCl injection. Surprisingly, sumatriptan uptake was also increased in the brainstem following CSD induction, suggesting regulation of active transport mechanisms at the BBB. Together these results demonstrate the ability of CSD events to produce transient, time-dependent changes in BBB permeability when allodynia is present and to mediate access of clinically relevant therapeutics (i.e., sumatriptan) to the CNS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The need to overcome the BBB is one of the major hurdles in designing CNS active drugs. CNS mechanisms have been shown to play a vital role in primary and secondary headache disorders. In this study we show that BBB permeability is transiently increased in a rat model of CSD induced episodic headache. We also observed a significant increase in sumatriptan uptake into the brain. Clinically, sumatriptan has been shown to be most efficacious when given close to the onset of headache pain, corresponding to times where we observed increased CNS uptake in our rat model. These data suggest that altered BBB permeability occurs during CSD and may be taken advantage of during therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: A Large Endoplasmic Reticulum-Resident Pool of TRPM1 in Retinal ON-Bipolar Cells</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The chemical signal of light onset, a decrease in glutamate release from rod and cone photoreceptors, is processed by a postsynaptic G protein signaling cascade in ON-bipolar cells (BPCs). The metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR6, along with other cascade elements, is localized synaptically at the BPC dendritic tips. The effector ion channel protein transient receptor potential melastatin-1 (TRPM1), in contrast, is located not only at the dendritic tips but also in BPC bodies and axons. Little is known about the intracellular localization of TRPM1, or its trafficking route to the dendritic tip plasma membrane. Recombinant TRPM1 expressed in mammalian cells colocalized with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) markers, with little or none detected at the plasma membrane. In mouse retina, somatic TRPM1 was similarly intracellular, and not at the plasma membrane. Labeling of ER membranes by expression of a fluorescent marker showed that in BPCs the ER extends into axons and dendrites, but not dendritic tips. In cell bodies, TRPM1 colocalized with the ER, and not with the Golgi apparatus. Fluorescence protease protection (FPP) assays with TRPM1-GFP fusions in heterologous cells revealed that the N and C termini are both accessible to the cytoplasm, consistent with the transmembrane domain topology of related TRP channels. These results indicate that the majority of TRPM1 is present in the ER, from which it can potentially be transported to the dendritic tips as needed for ON light responses. The excess of ER-resident TRPM1 relative to the amount needed at the dendritic tips suggests a potential new function for TRPM1 in the ER.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The role of robot design in decoding error-related information from EEG signals of a human observer. (arXiv:1807.01597v1 [cs.HC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01597</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;For utilization of robotic assistive devices in everyday life, means for
detection and processing of erroneous robot actions are a focal aspect in the
development of collaborative systems, especially when controlled via brain
signals. Though, the variety of possible scenarios and the diversity of used
robotic systems pose a challenge for error decoding from recordings of brain
signals such as via EEG. For example, it is unclear whether humanoid
appearances of robotic assistants have an influence on the performance. In this
paper, we designed a study in which two different robots executed the same task
both in an erroneous and a correct manner. We find error-related EEG signals of
human observers indicating that the performance of the error decoding was
independent of robot design. However, we can show that it was possible to
identify which robot performed the instructed task by means of the EEG signals.
In this case, deep convolutional neural networks (deep ConvNets) could reach
significantly higher ac curacies than both regularized Linear Discriminanat
Analysis (rLDA) and filter bank common spatial patterns (FB-CSP) combined with
rLDA. Our findings indicate that decoding information about robot action
success from the EEG, particularly when using deep neural networks, may be an
applicable approach for a broad range of robot designs.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Tonic activation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors decreases intrinsic excitability and promotes bistability in a model of neuronal activity. (arXiv:1807.01491v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;NMDA receptors (NMDA-R) typically contribute to excitatory synaptic
transmission in the central nervous system. While calcium influx through NMDA-R
plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity, indirect experimental evidence
also exists demonstrating actions of NMDAR-mediated calcium influx on neuronal
excitability through the activation of calcium-activated potassium channels.
But, so far, this mechanism has not been studied theoretically. Our theoretical
model provide a simple description of neuronal electrical activity including
the tonic activity of NMDA receptors and a cytosolic calcium compartment. We
show that calcium influx through NMDA-R can directly be coupled to activation
of calcium-activated potassium channels providing an overall inhibitory effect
on neuronal excitability. Furthermore, the presence of tonic NMDA-R activity
promotes bistability in electrical activity by dramatically increasing the
stimulus interval where both a stable steady state and repetitive firing can

of memory traces in neuronal circuits. They also shed light on the way by which
beta-amyloids can decrease neuronal activity when interfering with NMDA-R in
Alzheimer's disease.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In vitro and in vivo spiking activity clearly differ. Whereas networks in
vitro develop strong bursts separated by periods of very little spiking
activity, in vivo cortical networks show continuous activity. This is puzzling
considering that both networks presumably share similar single-neuron dynamics
and plasticity rules. We propose that the defining difference between in vitro
and in vivo dynamics is the strength of external input. In vitro, networks are
virtually isolated, whereas in vivo every brain area receives continuous input.
We analyze a model of spiking neurons in which the input strength, mediated by
spike rate homeostasis, determines the characteristics of the dynamical state.
In more detail, our analytical and numerical results on various network
topologies show consistently that under increasing input, homeostatic
plasticity generates distinct dynamic states, from bursting, to
close-to-critical, reverberating and irregular states. This implies that the
dynamic state of a neural network is not fixed but can readily adapt to the
input strengths. Indeed, our results match experimental spike recordings in
vitro and in vivo: the in vitro bursting behavior is consistent with a state
generated by very low network input (&amp;lt; 0.1%), whereas in vivo activity suggests
that on the order of 1% recorded spikes are input-driven, resulting in
reverberating dynamics. Importantly, this predicts that one can abolish the
ubiquitous bursts of in vitro preparations, and instead impose dynamics
comparable to in vivo activity by exposing the system to weak long-term
stimulation, thereby opening new paths to establish an in vivo-like assay in
vitro for basic as well as neurological studies.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Shot Noise Neuron Model. (arXiv:1807.01469v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01469</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01469</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we propose a shot noise-based leaky integrated and firing
neuron model and provide a detailed analysis of the performance of this model
compared to the traditional diffusion approximated model. In theoretical
neuroscience, there are three general neuron models in the field: Compartmental
neuron model is a conductance-based model, in which it views the biological
neurons as a large circuit. The problem of this model comes from its structural
complexity and the number of its free parameters; Leaky integrated and firing
model is a more flexible model due to the special design called
threshold-resetting, in which the voltage of the neuron is reset after reaching
the threshold. This model is proposed as an alternative to the compartment
model to provide a more biologically realistic model that can capture spike
timing behaviors that are observed in experiments. In addition to that, it is
more computationally efficient since it has much less free parameters; Firing
rate-based neuron model uses the firing rate of the neuron as the coupling
terms in the coupled neuronal network models. Models of this kind can be easily
analyzed on the network level. Theoretical analysis for this model proves the
existence of phase transition and shows that the computational capacity is
boosted in the chaotic regime.

	<description>Congenital hydrocephalus (CH) is a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality, affecting 1 in 1,000 live births and representing up to 3% of all pediatric hospital charges. Using data from the largest CH exome sequencing study to date, Furey et al. identify four genes (TRIM71, SMARCC1, PTCH1, and SHH) not previously implicated in CH. Remarkably, all four genes regulate ventricular zone neural stem cell fate and, together, explain ∼10% of CH cases. These findings implicate impaired neurogenesis in pathogenesis of a significant number of CH patients, with potential diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic ramifications.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Local protein synthesis in axon terminals and dendritic spines differentiates plasticity contexts</title>

	<description>While there is ample evidence for localized mRNAs and protein synthesis in mature neuronal postsynaptic compartments, clear demonstrations of these processes in presynaptic terminals are extremely limited. Using expansion microscopy to resolve pre- and postsynaptic compartments we discovered that most presynaptic terminals contain mRNA and ribosomes. Using fluorescence-activated synaptosome sorting, we directly visualized or sequenced hundreds of mRNA species within excitatory boutons. Following brief metabolic labeling, over 30% of all presynaptic terminals exhibit a signal, providing evidence for ongoing protein synthesis. Using different classic plasticity paradigms, we discovered unique patterns of rapid pre- and/or postsynaptic translation. These data suggest that local protein synthesis in both pre- and postsynaptic elements is differentially recruited to drive the unique compartment-specific phenotypes that underlie different forms of plasticity.</description>

	<description>Studies and behavioral interventions have focused on reinforcement and context change as means to influence preferences. Cue-approach training (CAT) has been shown to induce preference changes lasting months, towards items that were merely paired with a neutral cue and a speeded response without reinforcement. We scanned 36 participants with fMRI during a passive viewing task before, after and one month following CAT to study the neural basis of representation and modification of preferences in the absence of reinforcements. We found that enhanced visual processing in the short-term, and memory processes in the long-term, underlie value change. These results show for the first time a change in the neural representation of items in perceptual regions immediately after training and enhanced memory accessibility after 30 days. Our findings emphasize the potential of targeting the process of neural representation to accomplish long-term behavioral change and set the ground for new theories and clinical interventions.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/362814v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Circadian clock dysfunction is a common symptom of aging and neurodegenerative diseases, though its impact on brain health is poorly understood. Astrocyte activation occurs in response to diverse insults, and plays a critical role in brain health and disease. We report that the core clock protein BMAL1 regulates astrogliosis in a synergistic manner via a cell-autonomous mechanism, and via a lesser non-cell-autonomous signal from neurons. Astrocyte-specific Bmal1 deletion induces astrocyte activation in vitro and in vivo, mediated in part by suppression of glutathione-s-transferase signaling. Functionally, loss of Bmal1 in astrocytes promotes neuronal death in vitro. Our results demonstrate that the core clock protein BMAL1 regulates astrocyte activation and function in vivo, elucidating a novel mechanism by which the circadian clock could influence many aspects of brain function and neurologic disease.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Feedforward and feedback control share an internal model of the arm\'s dynamics</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/362699v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/362699v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Humans have a remarkable capacity to learn novel movement patterns in a wide variety of contexts. Recent work has shown that, when countering external forces, the nervous system adjusts not only voluntary (ie. feedforward) control but also reflex (ie. feedback) responses. Here we show that directly altering the physical properties of the arm (i.e. intersegmental dynamics) causes the nervous system to adjust feedforward control and that this learning also transfers to feedback responses even though they were never directly trained. In our first experiment, we altered intersegmental dynamics by asking participants to generate pure elbow movements with the shoulder joint either free to rotate or locked. Locking the shoulder joint cancels the interaction forces that arise at the shoulder during forearm rotation and thus removes the need to activate shoulder muscles to prevent shoulder joint rotation. We first asked whether the nervous system learns this altered mapping of intersegmental dynamics. In the baseline phase, we found robust activation of shoulder flexor muscles for pure elbow flexion trials prior to movement onset - as required to counter the intersegmental dynamics. After locking the shoulder joint in the adaptation phase, we found a substantial reduction in shoulder muscle activity over many trials. After unlocking the shoulder joint in the post-adaptation phase, we observed after-effects, as participants made systematic hand path errors. In our second experiment, we investigated whether such learning transfers to feedback control. Mechanical perturbations applied to the limb in the baseline phase revealed that feedback responses, like feedforward control, also appropriately countered intersegmental dynamics. In the adaptation phase, we found a substantial reduction in shoulder feedback responses - as appropriate for the altered intersegmental dynamics. We also found that this decay in shoulder feedback responses correlated across subjects with the amount of decay during feedforward control. Our work adds to the growing evidence that feedforward and feedback control share an internal model of the arm's dynamics.</description>

	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/361055v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/361055v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Metabolic state is a potent modulator of sleep and circadian behavior and animals acutely modulate their sleep in accordance with internal energy stores and food availability. Across phyla, hormones secreted from adipose tissue act in the brain to control neural physiology and behavior to modulate sleep and metabolic state. Growing evidence suggests the fat body is a critical regulator of complex behaviors, but little is known about the genes that function within the fat body to regulate sleep. To identify molecular factors functioning in the periphery to regulate sleep, we performed an RNAi screen selectively knocking down genes in the fat body. We found that knockdown of Phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase/Pfas(Ade2), a highly conserved gene involved the biosynthesis of purines, reduces sleep and energy stores. Flies heterozygous for multiple Ade2 mutations are also short sleepers and this effect is partially rescued by restoring Ade2 to the fat body. Targeted knockdown of Ade2 in the fat body does not alter arousal threshold or the homeostatic response to sleep deprivation, suggesting a specific role in modulating baseline sleep duration. Together, these findings suggest Ade2 functions within the fat body to promote both sleep and energy storage, providing a functional link between these processes.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Oscillatory Encoding of Visual Stimulus Familiarity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/27/6223?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/27/6223?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Familiarity of the environment changes the way we perceive and encode incoming information. However, the neural substrates underlying this phenomenon are poorly understood. Here we describe a new form of experience-dependent low-frequency oscillations in the primary visual cortex (V1) of awake adult male mice. The oscillations emerged in visually evoked potentials and single-unit activity following repeated visual stimulation. The oscillations were sensitive to the spatial frequency content of a visual stimulus and required the mAChRs for their induction and expression. Finally, ongoing visually evoked  (4–8 Hz) oscillations boost the visually evoked potential amplitude of incoming visual stimuli if the stimuli are presented at the high excitability phase of the oscillations. Our results demonstrate that an oscillatory code can be used to encode familiarity and serves as a gate for oncoming sensory inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Previous experience can influence the processing of incoming sensory information by the brain and alter perception. However, the mechanistic understanding of how this process takes place is lacking. We have discovered that persistent low-frequency oscillations in the primary visual cortex encode information about familiarity and the spatial frequency of the stimulus. These familiarity evoked oscillations influence neuronal responses to the oncoming stimuli in a way that depends on the oscillation phase. Our work demonstrates a new mechanism of visual stimulus feature detection and learning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Alcohol Consumption during Adolescence in a Mouse Model of Binge Drinking Alters the Intrinsic Excitability and Function of the Prefrontal Cortex through a Reduction in the Hyperpolarization-Activated Cation Current</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/27/6207?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/27/6207?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Periodic episodes of excessive alcohol consumption (&quot;binge drinking&quot;) occur frequently among adolescents, and early binge drinking is associated with an increased risk of alcohol use disorders later in life. The PFC undergoes significant development during adolescence and hence may be especially susceptible to the effects of binge drinking. In humans and in animal models, adolescent alcohol exposure is known to alter PFC neuronal activity and produce deficits in PFC-dependent behaviors, such as decision making, response inhibition, and working memory. Using a voluntary intermittent access to alcohol (IA EtOH) procedure in male mice, we demonstrate that binge-level alcohol consumption during adolescence leads to altered drinking patterns and working memory deficits in young adulthood, two outcomes that suggest medial PFC dysfunction. We recorded from pyramidal neurons (PNs) in the prelimbic subregion of the medial PFC in slices obtained from mice that had IA EtOH and found that they display altered excitability, including a hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential and reductions in the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) and in intrinsic persistent activity (a mode of neuronal firing that is dependent on I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;). Many of these effects on intrinsic excitability were sustained following abstinence and observed in mice that showed working memory deficits. In addition, we found that resting membrane potential and the I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent voltage &quot;sag&quot; in prelimbic PFC PNs are developmentally regulated during adolescence, suggesting that adolescent alcohol exposure may compromise PFC function by arresting the normal developmental trajectory of PN intrinsic excitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Binge alcohol drinking during adolescence has negative consequences for the function of the developing PFC. Using a mouse model of voluntary binge drinking during adolescence, we found that this behavior leads to working memory deficits and altered drinking behavior in adulthood. In addition, we found that adolescent drinking is associated with specific changes to the intrinsic excitability of pyramidal neurons in the PFC, reducing the ability of these neurons to generate intrinsic persistent activity, a phenomenon thought to be important for working memory. These findings may help explain why human adolescent binge drinkers show performance deficits on tasks mediated by the PFC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Classification of Neurons in the Primate Reticular Formation and Changes after Recovery from Pyramidal Tract Lesion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/27/6190?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The reticular formation is important in primate motor control, both in health and during recovery after brain damage. Little is known about the different neurons present in the reticular nuclei. Here we recorded extracellular spikes from the reticular formation in five healthy female awake behaving monkeys (193 cells), and in two female monkeys 1 year after recovery from a unilateral pyramidal tract lesion (125 cells). Analysis of spike shape and four measures derived from the interspike interval distribution identified four clusters of neurons in control animals. Cluster 1 cells had a slow firing rate. Cluster 2 cells had narrow spikes and irregular firing, which often included high-frequency bursts. Cluster 3 cells were highly rhythmic and fast firing. Cluster 4 cells showed negative spikes. A separate population of 42 cells was antidromically identified as reticulospinal neurons in five anesthetized female monkeys. The distribution of spike width in these cells closely overlaid the distribution for cluster 2, leading us tentatively to suggest that cluster 2 included neurons with reticulospinal projections. In animals after corticospinal lesion, cells could be identified in all four clusters. The firing rate of cells in clusters 1 and 2 was increased in lesioned animals relative to control animals (by 52% and 60%, respectively); cells in cluster 2 were also more regular and more bursting in the lesioned animals. We suggest that changes in both membrane properties and local circuits within the reticular formation occur following lesioning, potentially increasing reticulospinal output to help compensate for lost corticospinal descending drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This work is the first to subclassify neurons in the reticular formation, providing insights into the local circuitry of this important but little understood structure. The approach developed can be applied to any extracellular recording from this region, allowing future studies to place their data within our current framework of four neural types. Changes in reticular neurons may be important to subserve functional recovery after damage in human patients, such as after stroke or spinal cord injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sensory systems do not develop and function independently of one another, yet they are typically studied in isolation. Effects of multisensory interactions on the developing neocortex can be revealed by altering the ratios of incoming sensory inputs associated with different modalities. We investigated neural responses in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of short-tailed opossums (&lt;i&gt;Monodelphis domestica&lt;/i&gt;; either sex) after the elimination of visual input through bilateral enucleation very early in development. To assess the influence of tactile experience after vision loss, we also examined naturally occurring patterns of exploratory behavior. In early blind (EB) animals, overall levels of tactile experience were similar to those of sighted controls (SC); locomotor activity was unimpaired and accompanied by whisking. Using extracellular single-unit recording techniques under anesthesia, we found that EB animals exhibited a reduction in the magnitude of neural responses to whisker stimuli in S1, coupled with spatial sharpening of receptive fields, in comparison to SC animals. These alterations manifested as two different effects on sensory processing in S1 of EB animals: the ability of neurons to detect single whisker stimulation was decreased, whereas their ability to discriminate between stimulation of neighboring whiskers was enhanced. The increased selectivity of S1 neurons in EB animals was reflected in improved population decoding performance for whisker stimulus position, particularly along the rostrocaudal axis of the snout, which aligns with the primary axis of natural whisker motion. These findings suggest that a functionally distinct form of somatosensory plasticity occurs when vision is lost early in development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; After sensory loss, compensatory behavior mediated through the spared senses could be generated entirely through the recruitment of brain areas associated with the deprived sense. Alternatively, functional compensation in spared modalities may be achieved through a combination of plasticity in brain areas corresponding to both spared and deprived sensory modalities. Although activation of neurons in cortex associated with a deprived sense has been described frequently, it is unclear whether this is the only substrate available for compensation or if plasticity within cortical fields corresponding to spared modalities, particularly primary sensory cortices, may also contribute. Here, we demonstrate empirically that early loss of vision alters coding of sensory inputs in primary somatosensory cortex in a manner that supports enhanced tactile discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neural Network Interactions Modulate CRY-Dependent Photoresponses in Drosophila</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Light is one of the chief environmental cues that reset circadian clocks. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, CRYPTOCHROME (CRY) mediates acute photic resetting of circadian clocks by promoting the degradation of TIMELESS in a cell-autonomous manner. Thus, even circadian oscillators in peripheral organs can independently perceive light in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. However, there is substantial evidence for nonautonomous mechanisms of circadian photoreception in the brain. We have previously shown that the morning (M) and evening (E) oscillators are critical light-sensing neurons that cooperate to shift the phase of circadian behavior in response to light input. We show here that light can efficiently phase delay or phase advance circadian locomotor behavior in male &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; even when either the M- or the E-oscillators are ablated, suggesting that behavioral phase shifts and their directionality are largely a consequence of the cell-autonomous nature of CRY-dependent photoreception. Our observation that the phase response curves of brain and peripheral oscillators are remarkably similar further supports this idea. Nevertheless, the neural network modulates circadian photoresponses. We show that the M-oscillator neurotransmitter pigment dispersing factor plays a critical role in the coordination between M- and E-oscillators after light exposure, and we uncover a potential role for a subset of dorsal neurons in the control of phase advances. Thus, neural modulation of autonomous light detection might play an important role in the plasticity of circadian behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Input pathways provide circadian rhythms with the flexibility needed to harmonize their phase with environmental cycles. Light is the chief environmental cue that synchronizes circadian clocks. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, the photoreceptor CRYPTOCHROME resets circadian clocks cell-autonomously. However, recent studies indicate that, in the brain, interactions between clock neurons are critical to reset circadian locomotor behavior. We present evidence supporting the idea that the ability of flies to advance or delay their rhythmic behavior in response to light input essentially results from cell-autonomous photoreception. However, because of their networked organization, we find that circadian neurons have to cooperate to reset the phase of circadian behavior in response to photic cues. Our work thus helps to reconcile cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous models of circadian entrainment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: {alpha}2{delta}-4 Is Required for the Molecular and Structural Organization of Rod and Cone Photoreceptor Synapses</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-4 is an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.4 L-type channels that regulate the development and mature exocytotic function of the photoreceptor ribbon synapse. In humans, mutations in the &lt;i&gt;CACNA2D4&lt;/i&gt; gene encoding α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-4 cause heterogeneous forms of vision impairment in humans, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of which remain unclear. To investigate the retinal function of α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-4, we used genome editing to generate an α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-4 knock-out (α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-4 KO) mouse. In male and female α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-4 KO mice, rod spherules lack ribbons and other synaptic hallmarks early in development. Although the molecular organization of cone synapses is less affected than rod synapses, horizontal and cone bipolar processes extend abnormally in the outer nuclear layer in α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-4 KO retina. In reconstructions of α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-4 KO cone pedicles by serial block face scanning electron microscopy, ribbons appear normal, except that less than one-third show the expected triadic organization of processes at ribbon sites. The severity of the synaptic defects in α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-4 KO mice correlates with a progressive loss of Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.4 channels, first in terminals of rods and later cones. Despite the absence of b-waves in electroretinograms, visually guided behavior is evident in α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-4 KO mice and better under photopic than scotopic conditions. We conclude that α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-4 plays an essential role in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of rod and cone synapses, the disruption of which may contribute to visual impairment in humans with &lt;i&gt;CACNA2D4&lt;/i&gt; mutations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In the retina, visual information is first communicated by the synapse formed between photoreceptors and second-order neurons. The mechanisms that regulate the structural integrity of this synapse are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate a role for α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-4, a subunit of voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels, in organizing the structure and function of photoreceptor synapses. We find that presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels are progressively lost and that rod and cone synapses are disrupted in mice that lack α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-4. Our results suggest that alterations in presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling and photoreceptor synapse structure may contribute to vision impairment in humans with mutations in the &lt;i&gt;CACNA2D4&lt;/i&gt; gene encoding α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-4.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Perineuronal Nets in the Deep Cerebellar Nuclei Regulate GABAergic Transmission and Delay Eyeblink Conditioning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/27/6130?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Perineuronal nets (PNNs), composed mainly of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, are the extracellular matrix that surrounds cell bodies, proximal dendrites, and axon initial segments of adult CNS neurons. PNNs are known to regulate neuronal plasticity, although their physiological roles in cerebellar functions have yet to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the contribution of PNNs to GABAergic transmission from cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) to large glutamatergic neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) in male mice by recording IPSCs from cerebellar slices, in which PNNs were depleted with chondroitinase ABC (ChABC). We found that PNN depletion increased the amplitude of evoked IPSCs and enhanced the paired-pulse depression. ChABC treatment also facilitated spontaneous IPSCs and increased the miniature IPSC frequency without changing not only the amplitude but also the density of PC terminals, suggesting that PNN depletion enhances presynaptic GABA release. We also demonstrated that the enhanced GABAergic transmission facilitated rebound firing in large glutamatergic DCN neurons, which is expected to result in the efficient induction of synaptic plasticity at synapses onto DCN neurons. Furthermore, we tested whether PNN depletion affects cerebellar motor learning. Mice having received the enzyme into the interpositus nuclei, which are responsible for delay eyeblink conditioning, exhibited the conditioned response at a significantly higher rate than control mice. Therefore, our results suggest that PNNs of the DCN suppress GABAergic transmission between PCs and large glutamatergic DCN neurons and restrict synaptic plasticity associated with motor learning in the adult cerebellum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are one of the extracellular matrices of adult CNS neurons and implicated in regulating various brain functions. Here we found that enzymatic PNN depletion in the mouse deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) reduced the paired-pulse ratio of IPSCs and increased the miniature IPSC frequency without changing the amplitude, suggesting that PNN depletion enhances GABA release from the presynaptic Purkinje cell (PC) terminals. Mice having received the enzyme in the interpositus nuclei exhibited a higher conditioned response rate in delay eyeblink conditioning than control mice. These results suggest that PNNs regulate presynaptic functions of PC terminals in the DCN and functional plasticity of synapses on DCN neurons, which influences the flexibility of adult cerebellar functions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Loss of CaMKI Function Disrupts Salt Aversive Learning in C. elegans</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/27/6114?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to adapt behavior to environmental fluctuations is critical for survival of organisms ranging from invertebrates to mammals. &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; can learn to avoid sodium chloride when it is paired with starvation. This behavior may help animals avoid areas without food. Although some genes have been implicated in this salt-aversive learning behavior, critical genetic components, and the neural circuit in which they act, remain elusive. Here, we show that the sole worm ortholog of mammalian CaMKI/IV, CMK-1, is essential for salt-aversive learning behavior in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; hermaphrodites. We find that CMK-1 acts in the primary salt-sensing ASE neurons to regulate this behavior. By characterizing the intracellular calcium dynamics in ASE neurons using microfluidics, we find that loss of &lt;i&gt;cmk-1&lt;/i&gt; has subtle effects on sensory-evoked calcium responses in ASE axons and their modulation by salt conditioning. Our study implicates the expression of the conserved CaMKI/CMK-1 in chemosensory neurons as a regulator of behavioral plasticity to environmental salt in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Like other animals, the nematode &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; depends on salt for survival and navigates toward high concentrations of this essential mineral. In addition to its role as an essential nutrient, salt also causes osmotic stress at high concentrations. A growing body of evidence indicates that &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; balances the requirement for salt with the danger it presents through a process called salt-aversive learning. We show that this behavior depends on expression of a calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase, CMK-1, in the ASE salt-sensing neurons. Our study identifies CMK-1 and salt-sensitive chemosensory neurons as key factors in this form of behavioral plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4) Regulates Neuronal Activity by Controlling GABABR Trafficking</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/27/6102?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/27/6102?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4) has been postulated as a key regulator of learning and memory. We previously reported that specific hippocampal ATF4 downregulation causes deficits in synaptic plasticity and memory and reduction of glutamatergic functionality. Here we extend our studies to address ATF4's role in neuronal excitability. We find that long-term ATF4 knockdown in cultured rat hippocampal neurons significantly increases the frequency of spontaneous action potentials. This effect is associated with decreased functionality of metabotropic GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs). Knocking down ATF4 results in significant reduction of GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R-induced GIRK currents and increased mIPSC frequency. Furthermore, reducing ATF4 significantly decreases expression of membrane-exposed, but not total, GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R 1a and 1b subunits, indicating that ATF4 regulates GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R trafficking. In contrast, ATF4 knockdown has no effect on surface expression of GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R2s, several GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R-coupled ion channels or β2 and 2 GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Rs. Pharmacologic manipulations confirmed the relationship between GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R functionality and action potential frequency in our cultures. Specifically, the effects of ATF4 downregulation cited above are fully rescued by transcriptionally active, but not by transcriptionally inactive, shRNA-resistant, ATF4. We previously reported that ATF4 promotes stabilization of the actin-regulatory protein Cdc42 by a transcription-dependent mechanism. To test the hypothesis that this action underlies the mechanism by which ATF4 loss affects neuronal firing rates and GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R trafficking, we downregulated Cdc42 and found that this phenocopies the effects of ATF4 knockdown on these properties. In conclusion, our data favor a model in which ATF4, by regulating Cdc42 expression, affects trafficking of GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs, which in turn modulates the excitability properties of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs), the metabotropic receptors for the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, have crucial roles in controlling the firing rate of neurons. Deficits in trafficking/functionality of GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs have been linked to a variety of neurological and psychiatric conditions, including epilepsy, anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, addiction, and pain. Here we show that GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs trafficking is influenced by Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4), a protein that has a pivotal role in hippocampal memory processes. We found that ATF4 downregulation in hippocampal neurons reduces membrane-bound GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R levels and thereby increases intrinsic excitability. These effects are mediated by loss of the small GTPase Cdc42 following ATF4 downregulation. These findings reveal a critical role for ATF4 in regulating the modulation of neuronal excitability by GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Nerve Injury-Induced Chronic Pain Is Associated with Persistent DNA Methylation Reprogramming in Dorsal Root Ganglion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/27/6090?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nerve injury-induced hyperactivity of primary sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) contributes to chronic pain development, but the underlying epigenetic mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we determined genome-wide changes in DNA methylation in the nervous system in neuropathic pain. Spinal nerve ligation (SNL), but not paclitaxel treatment, in male Sprague Dawley rats induced a consistent low-level hypomethylation in the CpG sites in the DRG during the acute and chronic phases of neuropathic pain. DNA methylation remodeling in the DRG occurred early after SNL and persisted for at least 3 weeks. SNL caused DNA methylation changes at 8% of CpG sites with prevailing hypomethylation outside of CpG islands, in introns, intergenic regions, and repetitive sequences. In contrast, SNL caused more gains of methylation in the spinal cord and prefrontal cortex. The DNA methylation changes in the injured DRGs recapitulated developmental reprogramming at the neonatal stage. Methylation reprogramming was correlated with increased gene expression variability. A diet deficient in methyl donors induced hypomethylation and pain hypersensitivity. Intrathecal administration of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor RG108 caused long-lasting pain hypersensitivity. DNA methylation reprogramming in the DRG thus contributes to nerve injury-induced chronic pain. Restoring DNA methylation may represent a new therapeutic approach to treat neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Epigenetic mechanisms are critically involved in the transition from acute to chronic pain after nerve injury. However, genome-wide changes in DNA methylation in the nervous system and their roles in neuropathic pain development remain unclear. Here we used digital restriction enzyme analysis of methylation to quantitatively determine genome-wide DNA methylation changes caused by nerve injury. We showed that nerve injury caused DNA methylation changes at 8% of CpG sites with prevailing hypomethylation outside of CpG islands in the dorsal root ganglion. Reducing DNA methylation induced pain hypersensitivity, whereas increasing DNA methylation attenuated neuropathic pain. These findings extend our understanding of the epigenetic mechanism of chronic neuropathic pain and suggest new strategies to treat nerve injury-induced chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neural Prediction Errors Distinguish Perception and Misperception of Speech</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/27/6076?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/27/6076?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Humans use prior expectations to improve perception, especially of sensory signals that are degraded or ambiguous. However, if sensory input deviates from prior expectations, then correct perception depends on adjusting or rejecting prior expectations. Failure to adjust or reject the prior leads to perceptual illusions, especially if there is partial overlap (and thus partial mismatch) between expectations and input. With speech, &quot;slips of the ear&quot; occur when expectations lead to misperception. For instance, an entomologist might be more susceptible to hear &quot;The ants are my friends&quot; for &quot;The answer, my friend&quot; (in the Bob Dylan song &lt;i&gt;Blowing in the Wind&lt;/i&gt;). Here, we contrast two mechanisms by which prior expectations may lead to misperception of degraded speech. First, clear representations of the common sounds in the prior and input (i.e., expected sounds) may lead to incorrect confirmation of the prior. Second, insufficient representations of sounds that deviate between prior and input (i.e., prediction errors) could lead to deception. We used crossmodal predictions from written words that partially match degraded speech to compare neural responses when male and female human listeners were deceived into accepting the prior or correctly reject it. Combined behavioral and multivariate representational similarity analysis of fMRI data show that veridical perception of degraded speech is signaled by representations of prediction error in the left superior temporal sulcus. Instead of using top-down processes to support perception of expected sensory input, our findings suggest that the strength of neural prediction error representations distinguishes correct perception and misperception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Misperceiving spoken words is an everyday experience, with outcomes that range from shared amusement to serious miscommunication. For hearing-impaired individuals, frequent misperception can lead to social withdrawal and isolation, with severe consequences for wellbeing. In this work, we specify the neural mechanisms by which prior expectations, which are so often helpful for perception, can lead to misperception of degraded sensory signals. Most descriptive theories of illusory perception explain misperception as arising from a clear sensory representation of features or sounds that are in common between prior expectations and sensory input. Our work instead provides support for a complementary proposal: that misperception occurs when there is an insufficient sensory representations of the deviation between expectations and sensory signals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Glial {beta}II Spectrin Contributes to Paranode Formation and Maintenance</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/27/6063?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/27/6063?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Action potential conduction along myelinated axons depends on high densities of voltage-gated Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels at the nodes of Ranvier. Flanking each node, paranodal junctions (paranodes) are formed between axons and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) or oligodendrocytes in the CNS. Paranodal junctions contribute to both node assembly and maintenance. Despite their importance, the molecular mechanisms responsible for paranode assembly and maintenance remain poorly understood. βII spectrin is expressed in diverse cells and is an essential part of the submembranous cytoskeleton. Here, we show that Schwann cell βII spectrin is highly enriched at paranodes. To elucidate the roles of glial βII spectrin, we generated mutant mice lacking βII spectrin in myelinating glial cells by crossing mice with a floxed allele of &lt;i&gt;Sptbn1&lt;/i&gt; with &lt;i&gt;Cnp-Cre&lt;/i&gt; mice, and analyzed both male and female mice. Juvenile (4 weeks) and middle-aged (60 weeks) mutant mice showed reduced grip strength and sciatic nerve conduction slowing, whereas no phenotype was observed between 8 and 24 weeks of age. Consistent with these findings, immunofluorescence microscopy revealed disorganized paranodes in the PNS and CNS of both postnatal day 13 and middle-aged mutant mice, but not in young adult mutant mice. Electron microscopy confirmed partial loss of transverse bands at the paranodal axoglial junction in the middle-aged mutant mice in both the PNS and CNS. These findings demonstrate that a spectrin-based cytoskeleton in myelinating glia contributes to formation and maintenance of paranodal junctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Myelinating glia form paranodal axoglial junctions that flank both sides of the nodes of Ranvier. These junctions contribute to node formation and maintenance and are essential for proper nervous system function. We found that a submembranous spectrin cytoskeleton is highly enriched at paranodes in Schwann cells. Ablation of βII spectrin in myelinating glial cells disrupted the paranodal cell adhesion complex in both peripheral and CNSs, resulting in muscle weakness and sciatic nerve conduction slowing in juvenile and middle-aged mice. Our data show that a spectrin-based submembranous cytoskeleton in myelinating glia plays important roles in paranode formation and maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Differential Neurotoxicity Related to Tetracycline Transactivator and TDP-43 Expression in Conditional TDP-43 Mouse Model of Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/27/6045?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is among the most prevalent dementias of early-onset. Pathologically, FTLD presents with tauopathy or TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) proteinopathy. A biallelic mouse model of FTLD was produced on a mix FVB/129SVE background overexpressing wild-type human TDP-43 (hTDP-43) using tetracycline transactivator (tTA), a system widely used in mouse models of neurological disorders. tTA activates hTDP-43, which is placed downstream of the tetracycline response element. The original study on this transgenic mouse found hippocampal degeneration following hTDP-43 expression, but did not account for independent effects of tTA protein. Here, we initially analyzed the neurotoxic effects of tTA in postweaning age mice of either sex using immunostaining and area measurements of select brain regions. We observed tTA-dependent toxicity selectively in the hippocampus affecting the dentate gyrus significantly more than CA fields, whereas hTDP-43-dependent toxicity in bigenic mice occurred in most other cortical regions. Atrophy was associated with inflammation, activation of caspase-3, and loss of neurons. The atrophy associated with tTA expression was rescuable by the tetracycline analog, doxycycline, in the diet. MRI studies corroborated the patterns of atrophy. tTA-induced degeneration was strain-dependent and was rescued by moving the transgene onto a congenic C57BL/6 background. Despite significant hippocampal atrophy, behavioral tests in bigenic mice revealed no hippocampally mediated memory impairment. Significant atrophy in most cortical areas due solely to TDP-43 expression indicates that this mouse model remains useful for providing critical insight into co-occurrence of TDP-43 pathology, neurodegeneration, and behavioral deficits in FTLD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The tTA expression system has been widely used in mice to model neurological disorders. The technique allows investigators to reversibly turn on or off disease causing genes. Here, we report on a mouse model that overexpresses human TDP-43 using tTA and attempt to recapitulate features of TDP-43 pathology present in human FTLD. The tTA expression system is problematic, resulting in dramatic degeneration of the hippocampus. Thus, our study adds a note of caution for the use of the tTA system. However, because FTLD is primarily characterized by cortical degeneration and our mouse model shows significant atrophy in most cortical areas due to human TDP-43 overexpression, our animal model remains useful for providing critical insight on this human disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding visual perceptual learning (VPL) has become increasingly more challenging as new phenomena are discovered with novel stimuli and training paradigms. Although existing models aid our knowledge of critical aspects of VPL, the connections shown by these models between behavioral learning and plasticity across different brain areas are typically superficial. Most models explain VPL as readout from simple perceptual representations to decision areas and are not easily adaptable to explain new findings. Here, we show that a well -known instance of deep neural network (DNN), whereas not designed specifically for VPL, provides a computational model of VPL with enough complexity to be studied at many levels of analyses. After learning a Gabor orientation discrimination task, the DNN model reproduced key behavioral results, including increasing specificity with higher task precision, and also suggested that learning precise discriminations could transfer asymmetrically to coarse discriminations when the stimulus conditions varied. Consistent with the behavioral findings, the distribution of plasticity moved toward lower layers when task precision increased and this distribution was also modulated by tasks with different stimulus types. Furthermore, learning in the network units demonstrated close resemblance to extant electrophysiological recordings in monkey visual areas. Altogether, the DNN fulfilled predictions of existing theories regarding specificity and plasticity and reproduced findings of tuning changes in neurons of the primate visual areas. Although the comparisons were mostly qualitative, the DNN provides a new method of studying VPL, can serve as a test bed for theories, and assists in generating predictions for physiological investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Visual perceptual learning (VPL) has been found to cause changes at multiple stages of the visual hierarchy. We found that training a deep neural network (DNN) on an orientation discrimination task produced behavioral and physiological patterns similar to those found in human and monkey experiments. Unlike existing VPL models, the DNN was pre-trained on natural images to reach high performance in object recognition, but was not designed specifically for VPL; however, it fulfilled predictions of existing theories regarding specificity and plasticity and reproduced findings of tuning changes in neurons of the primate visual areas. When used with care, this unbiased and deep-hierarchical model can provide new ways of studying VPL from behavior to physiology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

At excitatory synapses, activation of NMDA receptors by glutamate leads to calcium influx triggering intracellular pathways that promote the trafficking of AMPA receptors to the post-synaptic membrane and actin remodeling. New evidence shows that Wnt secreted proteins, known for their role in synapse development, are essential for early stages of long-term potentiation, a form of plasticity that increases synaptic strength. Here, we review recent progress in this area and the significance of Wnt signaling to synaptic plasticity in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Loss of Atoh1 from neurons regulating hypoxic and hypercapnic chemoresponses causes neonatal respiratory failure in mice</title>

	<description>&lt;i&gt;Atoh1&lt;/i&gt;-null mice die at birth from respiratory failure, but the precise cause has remained elusive. Loss of &lt;i&gt;Atoh1&lt;/i&gt; from various components of the respiratory circuitry (e.g., the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN)) have so far produced at most 50% neonatal lethality. To identify other &lt;i&gt;Atoh1&lt;/i&gt;-lineage neurons that contribute to postnatal survival, we examined parabrachial complex neurons derived from the rostral rhombic lip (rRL) and found that they are activated during respiratory chemochallenges. &lt;i&gt;Atoh1&lt;/i&gt;-deletion from the rRL does not affect survival, but causes apneas and respiratory depression during hypoxia, likely due to loss of projections to the preBötzinger Complex and RTN. &lt;i&gt;Atoh1&lt;/i&gt; thus promotes the development of the neural circuits governing hypoxic (rRL) and hypercapnic (RTN) chemoresponses, and combined loss of &lt;i&gt;Atoh1&lt;/i&gt; from these regions causes fully penetrant neonatal lethality. This work underscores the importance of modulating respiratory rhythms in response to chemosensory information during early postnatal life.</description>

	<description>The Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport III (ESCRT-III) proteins are critical for cellular membrane scission processes with topologies inverted relative to clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Some viruses appropriate ESCRT-IIIs for their release. By imaging single assembling viral-like particles of HIV-1, we observed that ESCRT-IIIs and the ATPase VPS4 arrive after most of the virion membrane is bent, linger for tens of seconds, and depart ~20 seconds before scission. These observations suggest ESCRT-IIIs are recruited by a combination of membrane curvature and the late domains of the HIV-1 Gag protein. ESCRT-IIIs may pull the neck into a narrower form but must leave to allow scission. If scission does not occur within minutes of ESCRT departure, ESCRT-III and VPS4 are recruited again. This mechanistic insight is likely relevant for other ESCRT dependent scission processes including cell division, endosome tubulation, multivesicular body and nuclear envelope formation, and secretion of exosomes and ectosomes.</description>

	<description>Coordination of cell growth with division is essential for proper cell function. In budding yeast, although some molecular mechanisms responsible for cell size control during G1 have been elucidated, the mechanism by which cell size homeostasis is established remains to be discovered. Here, we developed a new technique based on quantification of histone levels to monitor cell cycle progression in individual cells with unprecedented accuracy. Our analysis establishes the existence of a mechanism controlling bud size in G2/M that prevents premature onset of anaphase, and controls the overall size variability. While most G1 mutants do not display impaired size homeostasis, mutants in which Cyclin B-Cdk regulation is altered display large size variability. Our study thus demonstrates that size homeostasis is not controlled by a G1-specific mechanism alone but is likely to be an emergent property resulting from the integration of several mechanisms that coordinate cell and bud growth with division.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: What you see depends on what you hear: temporal averaging and crossmodal integration</title>

	<description>In our multisensory world, we often rely more on auditory information than on visual input for temporal processing. One typical demonstration of this is that the rate of auditory flutter assimilates the rate of concurrent visual flicker. To date, however, this auditory dominance effect has largely been studied using regular auditory rhythms. It thus remains unclear whether irregular rhythms would have a similar impact on visual temporal processing; what information is extracted from the auditory sequence that comes to influence visual timing; and how the auditory and visual temporal rates are integrated together in quantitative terms. We investigated these questions by assessing, and modeling, the influence of a task-irrelevant auditory sequence on the type of &quot;Ternus apparent motion&quot;: group motion versus element motion. The type of motion seen critically depends on the time interval between the two Ternus display frames. We found that an irrelevant auditory sequence preceding the Ternus display modulates the visual interval, making observers perceive either more group motion or more element motion. This biasing effect manifests whether the auditory sequence is regular or irregular, and it is based on a summary statistic extracted from the sequential intervals: their geometric mean. However, the audiovisual interaction depends on the discrepancy between the mean auditory and visual intervals: if it becomes too large, no interaction occurs - which can be quantitatively described by a partial Bayesian integration model. Overall, our findings reveal a crossmodal perceptual averaging principle that may underlie complex audiovisual interactions in many everyday dynamic situations.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Flow stimuli reveal ecologically-appropriate responses in mouse visual cortex</title>

	<description>Assessments of the mouse visual system based on spatial frequency analysis imply that its visual capacity is low, with few neurons responding to spatial frequencies greater than 0.5 cycles/deg. However, visually-mediated behaviors, such as prey capture, suggest that the mouse visual system is more precise. We introduce a new stimulus class--visual flow patterns--that is more like what the mouse would encounter in the natural world than are sine-wave gratings but is more tractable for analysis than are natural images. We used 128-site silicon microelectrodes to measure the simultaneous responses of single neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) of alert mice. While holding temporal-frequency content fixed, we explored a class of drifting patterns of black or white dots that have energy only at higher spatial frequencies. These flow stimuli evoke strong visually-mediated responses well beyond those predicted by spatial frequency analysis. Flow responses predominate in higher spatial-frequency ranges (0.15-1.6 cycles/degree); many are orientation- or direction-selective; and flow responses of many neurons depend strongly on sign of contrast. Many cells exhibit distributed responses across our stimulus ensemble. Together, these results challenge conventional linear approaches to visual processing and extend the mouse's visual capacity to behaviorally-relevant ranges.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Neural signatures of detours, shortcuts and back-tracking during navigation</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/362319v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Central to the concept of the 'cognitive map' is that it confers flexibility in behaviour allowing animals to take efficient detours, exploit shortcuts and realise when they need to back-track rather than continue on a poorly chosen route. Currently the neural underpinnings of such behaviour remains unclear. During fMRI we tested human subjects on their ability to navigate to a set of goal locations in a virtual desert island riven by lava, which occasionally shifted to block selected paths (necessitating detours) or receded to open new paths (affording shortcuts). We found that detours activated a wide network of frontal regions compared to shortcuts. Activity in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex specifically also increased when participants encountered new paths that appeared to provide a shortcut in the direction of the goal but which added distance to the path (false short-cuts). During spontaneous back-tracking events, activity increased in frontal regions and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, while activity in regions associated with the core default-mode network were suppressed. These results help inform current models as to how the brain supports navigation and planning.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Consistent visuomotor adaptations and generalizations can be achieved through different rotations of robust motor modules</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/362228v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Humans have a remarkable ability to modify their motor commands in response to alterations in the environment. These motor commands are thought to be adaptively tuned by combining different motor primitives, a characteristic that allows for adaptations to be generalized also to relevant untrained scenarios. A complementary theory of motor primitives has shown that natural movements can be described by the combination of relatively invariant sets of muscle synergies. Synergistic structures have been shown to be maintained and tuned during motor adaptations. Here we studied the influence of synergistic organization of movement at the muscular level on the way in which adaptations to a 45 degrees clockwise visuomotor rotation are achieved and generalized. We confirm that adaptation is achieved by tuning a set of robust muscle synergies and we show that the same biomechanical adaptation can be achieved by differentially tuning the same synergies. We demonstrate that this differential tuning influences the presence and extent of generalization and depends on the way in which the targets are experienced relatively to the synergistic structure itself. Our results support the speculation that muscle synergies may be a part of the functional motor primitives that the motor system updates during motor adaptations.</description>

	<description>In vitro and in vivo spiking activity clearly differ. Whereas networks in vitro develop strong bursts separated by periods of very little spiking activity, in vivo cortical networks show continuous activity. This is puzzling considering that both networks presumably share similar single-neuron dynamics and plasticity rules. We propose that the defining difference between in vitro and in vivo dynamics is the strength of external input. In vitro, networks are virtually isolated, whereas in vivo every brain area receives continuous input. We analyze a model of spiking neurons in which the input strength, mediated by spike rate homeostasis, determines the characteristics of the dynamical state. In more detail, our analytical and numerical results on various network topologies show consistently that under increasing input, homeostatic plasticity generates distinct dynamic states, from bursting, to close-to-critical, reverberating and irregular states. This implies that the dynamic state of a neural network is not fixed but can readily adapt to the input strengths. Indeed, our results match experimental spike recordings in vitro and in vivo: the in vitro bursting behavior is consistent with a state generated by very low network input (&amp;lt; 0.1%), whereas in vivo activity suggests that on the order of 1% recorded spikes are input-driven, resulting in reverberating dynamics. Importantly, this predicts that one can abolish the ubiquitous bursts of in vitro preparations, and instead impose dynamics comparable to in vivo activity by exposing the system to weak long-term stimulation, thereby opening new paths to establish an in vivo-like assay in vitro for basic as well as neurological studies.</description>

	<description>The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is a multifaceted region of cortex, contributing to several cognitive processes including sensorimotor integration and spatial navigation. Although recent years have seen a considerable rise in the use of rodents, particularly mice, to investigate PPC and related networks, a coherent anatomical definition of PPC in the mouse is still lacking. To address this, we delineated the mouse PPC using cyto- and chemoarchitectural markers from Nissl-, parvalbumin- and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2-staining. Additionally, we performed bilateral triple anterograde tracer injections in primary visual cortex (V1) and prepared flattened tangential sections from one hemisphere and coronal sections from the other, allowing us to co-register the cytoarchitectural features of PPC with V1 projections. In charting the location of extrastriate areas and the architectural features of PPC in the context of each other, we reconcile different, widely used conventions for demarcating PPC in the mouse. Furthermore, triple anterograde tracer injections in PPC showed strong projections to associative thalamic nuclei as well as higher visual areas, orbitofrontal, cingulate and secondary motor cortices. Retrograde circuit mapping with rabies virus further showed that all cortical connections were reciprocal. These combined approaches provide a coherent definition of mouse PPC that incorporates laminar architecture, extrastriate projections, thalamic, and cortico-cortical connections.</description>

	<description>Sleep appears to be a universally conserved phenomenon among the animal kingdom but whether this striking evolutionary conservation underlies a basic vital function is still an open question. Using novel technologies, we conducted an unprecedentedly detailed high-throughput analysis of sleep in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, coupled with a life-long chronic and specific sleep restriction. Our results show that some wild-type flies are virtually sleepless in baseline conditions and that complete, forced sleep restriction is not necessarily a lethal treatment in wild-type Drosophila melanogaster. We also show that circadian drive, and not homeostatic regulation, is the main contributor to sleep pressure in flies. We propose a three-partite model framework of sleep function, according to which, total sleep accounts for three components: a vital component, a useful component, and an accessory component.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Spatiotemporal Analysis of Category and Target-related Information Processing in the Brain during Object Detection</title>

	<description>To recognize a target object, brain implements strategies which involved a combination of externally sensory-driven and internally task-driven mechanisms. While previous studies have suggested the role of frontal brain areas in sending task-related information to visual cortices, especially the lateral-occipital cortex, they failed to provide quantitative evidence supporting the transaction of task-related information between those areas. However, recently developed representational Granger causality analysis, could allow us to track the movement of any desired information in the brain. Therefore, we designed an EEG object detection experiment and evaluated the spatiotemporal dynamics of category- and target-related information transaction across the brain using the mentioned method. Results showed that prefrontal area was the first region to process the target-related information, even before the appearance of the stimulus. This information was transferred to posterior brain areas during the stimulus presentation probably to facilitate object recognition and to direct the decision-making procedure. We also observed that, as compared to category-related information, the target-related information could predict the behavioral detection outcomes more precisely, suggesting the dominant representation of the internal compared to external information. These results provided new insights into the role of prefrontal cortex and the representation of task in the brain during object detection.</description>

	<description>The human ability to use different tools demonstrates our capability of forming and maintaining multiple, context specific motor memories. Experimentally, this ability has been investigated in dual adaptation, where participants adjust their reaching movements to opposing visuomotor transformations. Adaptation in these paradigms occurs by distinct processes, i.e. the development of explicit aiming strategies for each transformation and/or the implicit acquisition of distinct visuomotor mappings. The presence of distinct, transformation-dependent aftereffects has been interpreted as support for the latter. Alternatively, however, distinct aftereffects could reflect adaptation of a single visuomotor map, which is locally adjusted in different regions of the workspace. Indeed, recent studies suggest that explicit aiming strategies direct where in the workspace implicit adaptation occurs. Disentangling these possibilities is critical to understanding how humans acquire and maintain separate motor memories for different skills and tools. We therefore investigated generalization of explicit and implicit adaptation to different directions after participants practiced two opposing cursor rotations, which were associated with separate visual workspaces. Whereas participants learned to compensate opposing rotations by explicit strategies that were specific to the visual workspace cue, aftereffects were not sensitive to visual workspace cues. Instead, aftereffects displayed bimodal generalization patterns that appeared to reflect locally limited learning of both transformations. By varying target arrangements and instructions, we show that these generalization patterns are consistent with implicit adaptation that generalizes locally around (explicit) movement plans associated with opposing visuomotor transformations. Our findings show that strategies can shape implicit adaptation in a complex manner.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: On the Subspace Invariance of Population Responses</title>

	<description>The response of a neural population in cat primary visual cortex to the linear combination of two sinusoidal gratings (a plaid) can be well approximated by a weighted sum of the population responses to the individual gratings - a property we refer to as subspace invariance. We tested subspace invariance in mouse primary visual cortex by measuring the angle between the population response to a plaid and the plane spanned by the population responses to its individual components. We found robust violations of subspace invariance, represented by a median angular deviation of ~55 deg. The cause of this departure is a strong, negative correlation between the mean responses a neuron to the individual gratings and its response to the plaid. We suggest that an early nonlinearity may distort the power distribution of grating and plaid stimuli such that plaids have a prominent power component at {+/-}45 deg off the fundamental orientations. We conclude that subspace invariance does not hold in mouse V1. This finding rules out a large class of possible models of population coding, including vector averaging and gain control.</description>

	<description>How sure are we about what we know? Confidence, measured via self-report, is often interpreted as a subjective probabilistic estimate on having made a correct judgement. The neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the construction of confidence and the information incorporated into these judgements are of increasing interest. Investigating these mechanisms requires principled and practically applicable measures of confidence and metacognition. Unfortunately, current measures of confidence are subject to distortions from decision biases and task performance. Motivated by a recent signal-detection theoretic behavioural measure of metacognitive sensitivity, known as meta-d', here we present a quantitative behavioural measure of confidence that is invariant to decision bias and task performance. This measure, which we call m-distance, captures in a principled way the propensity to report decisions with high (or low) confidence. Computational simulations demonstrate the robustness of m-distance to decision bias and task performance, as well as its behaviour under conditions of high and low metacognitive sensitivity and under dual-channel and hierarchical models of metacognition. The introduction of the m-distance measure will enhance systematic quantitative studies of the behavioural expression and neurocognitive basis of subjective confidence.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Post-Turing tissue pattern formation: Advent of mechanochemistry</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006259</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Felix Brinkmann, Moritz Mercker, Thomas Richter, Anna Marciniak-Czochra&lt;/p&gt;

Chemical and mechanical pattern formation is fundamental during embryogenesis and tissue development. Yet, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms are still elusive in many cases. Most current theories assume that tissue development is driven by chemical processes: either as a sequence of chemical patterns each depending on the previous one, or by patterns spontaneously arising from specific chemical interactions (such as “Turing-patterns”). Within both theories, mechanical patterns are usually regarded as passive by-products of chemical pre-patters. However, several experiments question these theories, and an increasing number of studies shows that tissue mechanics can actively influence chemical patterns during development. In this study, we thus focus on the interplay between chemical and mechanical processes during tissue development. On one hand, based on recent experimental data, we develop new mechanochemical simulation models of evolving tissues, in which the full 3D representation of the tissue appears to be critical for obtaining a realistic mechanochemical behaviour. The presented modelling approach is flexible and numerically studied using state of the art finite element methods. Thus, it may serve as a basis to combine simulations with new experimental methods in tissue development. On the other hand, we apply the developed approach and demonstrate that even simple interactions between tissue mechanics and chemistry spontaneously lead to robust and complex mechanochemical patterns. Especially, we demonstrate that the main contradictions arising in the framework of purely chemical theories are naturally and automatically resolved using the mechanochemical patterning theory.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TU2UMRsefhw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Retinal detachment (RD) is a sight-threatening complication common in many highly prevalent retinal disorders. RD rapidly leads to photoreceptor cell death beginning within 12 h following detachment. In patients with sustained RD, progressive visual decline due to photoreceptor cell death is common, leading to significant and permanent loss of vision....&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/E90Cr_z6ukQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Functional Recovery of a Locomotor Network after Injury: Plasticity beyond the Central Nervous System</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0195-18.2018v2?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0195-18.2018v2?rss=1</link>
	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Many animals depend on descending information from the brain for the initiation and proper execution of locomotion. Interestingly, after injury and the loss of such inputs, locomotor function can sometimes be regained without the regrowth of central connections. In the medicinal leech, &lt;i&gt;Hirudo verbana&lt;/i&gt;, we have shown that crawling reemerges after removal of descending inputs. Here, we studied the mechanisms underlying this return of locomotion by asking if central pattern generators (CPGs) in crawl-recovered leeches are sufficient to produce crawl-specific intersegmental coordination. From recovered animals, we treated isolated chains of ganglia with dopamine to activate the crawl CPGs (one crawl CPG per ganglion), and observed fictive crawl-like bursting in the dorsal-longitudinal-excitor motoneuron (DE-3); an established crawl-monitor neuron. However, these preparations did not exhibit crawl-specific coordination across the CPGs. Although the crawl CPGs always generated bi-directional activation of adjacent CPGs, we never observed crawl-appropriate intersegmental phase delays. Because central circuits alone were unable to organize crawl-specific coordination, we tested the coordinating role of the peripheral nervous system. In transected leeches normally destined for recovery, we removed afferent information to the anterior-most (lead) ganglion located below the nerve-cord transection site. In these dually treated animals, overt crawling was greatly delayed or prevented. After filling the peripheral nerves with Neurobiotin tracer distal to the nerve-root lesion, we found a perfect correlation between regrowth of peripheral neuronal fibers and crawl recovery. Our study establishes that during recovery after injury crawl-specific intersegmental coordination switches to a new dependency on afferent information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; In the field of motor control, a pressing issue to resolve is how the central and peripheral nervous system become retuned and work together to establish functional locomotor patterns after descending signals are chronically removed after injury. The work we have presented, in the medicinal leech, clarifies that central pattern generator (CPG) neural networks are highly plastic in their ability to incorporate different timing elements for their intersegmental coordination after descending-coordinating information is removed. Essentially, the crawl CPGs switch their dependence on descending-timing cues to those originating from proprioceptive neurons in the muscular body wall. Results from our experimentally tractable preparation may provide a platform to guide future studies of locomotor recovery in vertebrate animals after spinal cord injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: A Multilevel Computational Characterization of Endophenotypes in Addiction</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Addiction is characterized by a profound intersubject (phenotypic) variability in the expression of addictive symptomatology and propensity to relapse following treatment. However, laboratory investigations have primarily focused on common neural substrates in addiction and have not yet been able to identify mechanisms that can account for the multifaceted phenotypic behaviors reported in the literature. To fill this knowledge gap theoretically, here we simulated phenotypic variations in addiction symptomology and responses to putative treatments, using both a neural model, based on cortico-striatal circuit dynamics, and an algorithmic model of reinforcement learning. These simulations rely on the widely accepted assumption that both the ventral, model-based, goal-directed system and the dorsal, model-free, habitual system are vulnerable to extra-physiologic dopamine reinforcements triggered by addictive rewards. We found that endophenotypic differences in the balance between the two circuit or control systems resulted in an inverted U-shape in optimal choice behavior. Specifically, greater unbalance led to a higher likelihood of developing addiction and more severe drug-taking behaviors. Furthermore, endophenotypes with opposite asymmetrical biases among cortico-striatal circuits expressed similar addiction behaviors, but responded differently to simulated treatments, suggesting personalized treatment development could rely on endophenotypic rather than phenotypic differentiations. We propose our simulated results, confirmed across neural and algorithmic levels of analysis, inform on a fundamental and, to date, neglected quantitative method to characterize clinical heterogeneity in addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Addiction is known to encompass heterogeneity in its development, maintenance, and treatment response. While previous work has mostly focused on the common mechanisms underlying vulnerabilities in addiction at a group level, the neurocomputational causes for such intersubject variability in addition are not well-understood. To fill this knowledge gap, we combine a neural and a reinforcement learning model to reveal that the balance between neural circuits or computational control modalities characterizes the presence of behavioral phenotypes in addiction. The presence of converging effects, validated across neural and algorithmic levels of analysis, informs on a quantitative method to characterize clinical heterogeneity, and potentially helps future development of precision treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Neurons Specifically Activated by Fear Learning in Lateral Amygdala Display Increased Synaptic Strength</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The lateral amygdala (LA) plays a critical role in the formation of fear conditioned associative memories. Previous studies have used c-&lt;i&gt;fos&lt;/i&gt; regulated expression to identify a spatially restricted population of neurons within the LA that is specifically activated by fear learning. These neurons are likely to be a part of a memory engram but, to date, functional evidence for this has been lacking. We show that neurons within a spatially restricted region of the LA had an increase in both the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sPSC) when compared to neurons recorded from home-cage control mice. We then more specifically addressed if this increased synaptic activity was limited to learning-activated neurons. Using a &lt;i&gt;fos&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;tau-LacZ&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;FTL&lt;/i&gt;) transgenic mouse line, we developed a fluorescence-based method of identifying and recording from neurons activated by fear learning (&lt;i&gt;FTL&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) in acute brain slices. An increase in frequency and amplitude of sPSCs was observed in &lt;i&gt;FTL&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; neurons when compared to non-activated &lt;i&gt;FTL&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; neurons in fear conditioned mice. No learning-induced changes were observed in the action potential input-output relationships. These findings support the idea that a discrete LA neuron population forms part of a memory engram through changes in synaptic connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The lateral amygdala (LA) is critical for the formation of associative fear memories, such as those formed by fear conditioning. A subset of neurons in LA are activated by fear conditioning suggesting that they may be part of a memory engram. However, there is no functional evidence to support this view. Electrophysiological characterisation of LA neurons shows that the frequency and amplitude of synaptic events increase following fear conditioning. A method based on β-galactosidase as a reporter was developed to locate activated neurons in acute slice. An increase in frequency and amplitude of synaptic events was observed in activated compared to non-activated neurons supporting the idea that a discrete LA neuron population forms part of a memory engram.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Chronometry on Spike-LFP Responses Reveals the Functional Neural Circuitry of Early Auditory Cortex Underlying Sound Processing and Discrimination</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Animals and humans rapidly detect specific features of sounds, but the time courses of the underlying neural response for different stimulus categories is largely unknown. Furthermore, the intricate functional organization of auditory information processing pathways is poorly understood. Here, we computed neuronal response latencies from simultaneously recorded spike trains and local field potentials (LFPs) along the first two stages of cortical sound processing, primary auditory cortex (A1) and lateral belt (LB), of awake, behaving macaques. Two types of response latencies were measured for spike trains as well as LFPs: (1) onset latency, time-locked to onset of external auditory stimuli; and (2) selection latency, time taken from stimulus onset to a selective response to a specific stimulus category. Trial-by-trial LFP onset latencies predominantly reflecting synaptic input arrival typically preceded spike onset latencies, assumed to be representative of neuronal output indicating that both areas may receive input environmental signals and relay the information to the next stage. In A1, simple sounds, such as pure tones (PTs), yielded shorter spike onset latencies compared to complex sounds, such as monkey vocalizations (&quot;Coos&quot;). This trend was reversed in LB, indicating a hierarchical functional organization of auditory cortex in the macaque. LFP selection latencies in A1 were always shorter than those in LB for both PT and Coo reflecting the serial arrival of stimulus-specific information in these areas. Thus, chronometry on spike-LFP signals revealed some of the effective neural circuitry underlying complex sound discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cochlea displays complex and highly nonlinear behavior in response to
wide-ranging auditory stimuli. While there have been many recent advancements
in the modeling of cochlear dynamics, it remains unclear what mathematical
structures underlie the essential features of the extended cochlea. We
construct a dynamical system consisting of a series of strongly coupled
critical oscillators to show that high-dimensional nonhyperbolic dynamics can
account for high-order compressive nonlinearities, amplification of weak input,
frequency selectivity, and traveling waves of activity. As a single Hopf
bifurcation generically gives rise to features of cochlea at a local level, the
nonhyperbolicity mechanism proposed in this paper can be seen as a
higher-dimensional analogue for the entire extended cochlea.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cortical neurons in the fluctuation driven regime can realize ultrafast
population encoding. The underlying biophysical mechanisms, however, are not
well understood. Reducing the sharpness of the action potential onset can
impair ultrafast population encoding, but it is not clear whether a sharp
action potential onset is sufficient for ultrafast population encoding. One
hypothesis proposes that the sharp action potential onset is caused by the
electrotonic separation of the site of action potential initiation from the
soma, and that this spatial separation also results in ultrafast population
encoding. Here we examined this hypothesis by studying the linear response
properties of model neurons with a defined initiation site. We find that
placing the initiation site at different axonal positions has only a weak
impact on the linear response function of the model. It fails to generate the
ultrafast response and high bandwidth that is observed in cortical neurons.
Furthermore, the high frequency regime of the linear response function of this
model is insensitive to correlation times of the input current contradicting
empirical evidence. When we increase the voltage sensitivity of sodium channels
at the initiation site, the two empirically observed phenomena can be
recovered. We provide an explanation for the dissociation of sharp action
potential onset and ultrafast response. By investigating varying soma sizes, we
furthermore highlight the effect of neuron morphology on the linear response.
Our results show that a sharp onset of action potentials is not sufficient for
the ultrafast response. In the light of recent reports of activity-dependent
repositioning of the axon initial segment, our study predicts that a more
distal initiation site can lead to an increased sharpness of the somatic
waveform but it does not affect the linear response of a population of neurons.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This document provides an overview of the material covered in a course taught
at Stanford in the spring quarter of 2018. The course draws upon insight from
cognitive and systems neuroscience to implement hybrid connectionist and
symbolic reasoning systems that leverage and extend the state of the art in
machine learning by integrating human and machine intelligence. As a concrete
example we focus on digital assistants that learn from continuous dialog with
an expert software engineer while providing initial value as powerful
analytical, computational and mathematical savants. Over time these savants
learn cognitive strategies (domain-relevant problem solving skills) and develop
intuitions (heuristics and the experience necessary for applying them) by
learning from their expert associates. By doing so these savants elevate their
innate analytical skills allowing them to partner on an equal footing as
versatile collaborators - effectively serving as cognitive extensions and
digital prostheses, thereby amplifying and emulating their human partner's
conceptually-flexible thinking patterns and enabling improved access to and
control over powerful computing resources.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Feed-forward convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are currently
state-of-the-art for object classification tasks such as ImageNet. Further,
they are quantitatively accurate models of temporally-averaged responses of
neurons in the primate brain's visual system. However, biological visual
systems have two ubiquitous architectural features not shared with typical
CNNs: local recurrence within cortical areas, and long-range feedback from
downstream areas to upstream areas. Here we explored the role of recurrence in
improving classification performance. We found that standard forms of
recurrence (vanilla RNNs and LSTMs) do not perform well within deep CNNs on the
ImageNet task. In contrast, custom cells that incorporated two structural
features, bypassing and gating, were able to boost task accuracy substantially.
We extended these design principles in an automated search over thousands of
model architectures, which identified novel local recurrent cells and
long-range feedback connections useful for object recognition. Moreover, these
task-optimized ConvRNNs explained the dynamics of neural activity in the
primate visual system better than feedforward networks, suggesting a role for
the brain's recurrent connections in performing difficult visual behaviors.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36482</link>
	<description>We present a multispecies coalescent model for quantitative traits that allows for evolutionary inferences at micro- and macroevolutionary scales. A major advantage of this model is its ability to incorporate genealogical discordance underlying a quantitative trait. We show that discordance causes a decrease in the expected trait covariance between more closely related species relative to more distantly related species. If unaccounted for, this outcome can lead to an overestimation of a trait's evolutionary rate, to a decrease in its phylogenetic signal, and to errors when examining shifts in mean trait values. The number of loci controlling a quantitative trait appears to be irrelevant to all trends reported, and discordance also affected discrete, threshold traits. Our model and analyses point to the conditions under which different methods should fare better or worse, in addition to indicating current and future approaches that can mitigate the effects of discordance.</description>

	<description>Parkinson's disease is a progressive neuropathological disorder that belongs to the class of synucleopathies, in which the protein alpha-synuclein is found at abnormally high concentrations in affected neurons. Its hallmark are intracellular inclusions called Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. We here report the structure of cytotoxic alpha-synuclein fibrils (residues 1-121), determined by cryo-electron microscopy structure at a resolution of 3.4Å. Two protofilaments form a polar fibril composed of staggered β-strands. The backbone of residues 38 to 95, including the fibril core and the non-amyloid component region, are well resolved in the EM map. Residues 50-57, containing three of the mutation sites associated with familial synucleinopathies, form the interface between the two protofilaments and contribute to fibril stability. A hydrophobic cleft at one end of the fibril may have implications for fibril elongation, and invites for the design of molecules for diagnosis and treatment of synucleinopathies.</description>

	<description>Matrix stiffening with downstream activation of mechanosensitive pathways is strongly implicated in progressive fibrosis; however, pathologic changes in extracellular matrix (ECM) that initiate mechano-homeostasis dysregulation are not defined in human disease. By integrated multiscale biomechanical and biological analyses of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis lung tissue, we identify that increased tissue stiffness is a function of dysregulated post-translational collagen cross-linking rather than any collagen concentration increase whilst at the nanometre-scale collagen fibrils are structurally and functionally abnormal with increased stiffness, reduced swelling ratio, and reduced diameter. In ex vivo and animal models of lung fibrosis, dual inhibition of lysyl oxidase-like (LOXL) 2 and LOXL3 was sufficient to normalise collagen fibrillogenesis, reduce tissue stiffness, and improve lung function in vivo. Thus, in human fibrosis, altered collagen architecture is a key determinant of abnormal ECM structure-function, and inhibition of pyridinoline cross-linking can maintain mechano-homeostasis to limit the self-sustaining effects of ECM on progressive fibrosis.</description>

	<description>Genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors have revolutionized the study of signal transduction by enabling the real-time tracking of signaling activities in live cells. Investigating the interaction between signaling networks has become increasingly important to understanding complex cellular phenomena, necessitating an update of the biosensor toolkit to allow monitoring and perturbing multiple activities simultaneously in the same cell. We therefore developed a new class of fluorescent biosensors based on homo-FRET, deemed FLuorescence Anisotropy REporters (FLAREs), which combine the multiplexing ability of single-color sensors with a quantitative, ratiometric readout. Using an array of color variants, we were able to demonstrate multiplexed imaging of three activity reporters simultaneously in the same cell. We further demonstrate the compatibility of FLAREs for use with optogenetic tools as well as intravital two-photon imaging.</description>

	<description>Mammals produce volatile odours that convey different types of societal information. In &lt;i&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/i&gt;, this is now recognised as body odour, a key chemical component of which is the sulphurous thioalcohol, 3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol (3M3SH). Volatile 3M3SH is produced in the underarm as a result of specific microbial activity, which act on the odourless dipeptide-containing malodour precursor molecule, S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH, secreted in the axilla (underarm) during colonisation. The mechanism by which these bacteria recognise S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH and produce body odour is still poorly understood. Here we report the structural and biochemical basis of bacterial transport of S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH by &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus hominis&lt;/i&gt;, which is converted to the sulphurous thioalcohol component 3M3SH in the bacterial cytoplasm, before being released into the environment. Knowledge of the molecular basis of precursor transport, essential for body odour formation, provides a novel opportunity to design specific inhibitors of malodour production in humans.</description>

	<description>Reverse replay of hippocampal place cells occurs frequently at rewarded locations, suggesting its contribution to goal-directed path learning. Symmetric spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) in CA3 likely potentiates recurrent synapses for both forward (start to goal) and reverse (goal to start) replays during sequential activation of place cells. However, how reverse replay selectively strengthens forward synaptic pathway is unclear. Here, we show computationally that firing sequences bias synaptic transmissions to the opposite direction of propagation under symmetric STDP in the co-presence of short-term synaptic depression or afterdepolarization. We demonstrate that significant biases are created in biologically realistic simulation settings, and this bias enables reverse replay to enhance goal-directed spatial memory on a W-maze. Further, we show that essentially the same mechanism works in a two-dimensional open field. Our model for the first time provides the mechanistic account for the way reverse replay contributes to hippocampal sequence learning for reward-seeking spatial navigation.</description>

	<description>Neuropathic pain resulting from nerve injury can become persistent and difficult to treat but the molecular signaling responsible for its development remains poorly described. Here, we identify the neuronal stress sensor dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK; &lt;i&gt;Map3k12&lt;/i&gt;) as a key molecule controlling the maladaptive pathways that lead to pain following injury. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of DLK reduces mechanical hypersensitivity in a mouse model of neuropathic pain. Furthermore, DLK inhibition also prevents the spinal cord microgliosis that results from nerve injury and arises distant from the injury site. These striking phenotypes result from the control by DLK of a transcriptional program in somatosensory neurons regulating the expression of numerous genes implicated in pain pathogenesis, including the immune gene &lt;i&gt;Csf1&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, activation of DLK is an early event, or even the master regulator, controlling a wide variety of pathways downstream of nerve injury that ultimately lead to chronic pain.</description>

	<description>A fundamental issue in developmental biology and in organ homeostasis is understanding the molecular mechanisms governing the balance between stem cell maintenance and differentiation into a specific lineage. Accumulating data suggest that cell cycle dynamics play a major role in the regulation of this balance. Here we show that the G2/M cell cycle regulator CDC25B phosphatase is required in mammals to finely tune neuronal production in the neural tube. We show that in chick neural progenitors, CDC25B activity favors fast nuclei departure from the apical surface in early G1, stimulates neurogenic divisions and promotes neuronal differentiation. We design a mathematical model showing that within a limited period of time, cell cycle length modifications cannot account for changes in the ratio of the mode of division. Using a CDC25B point mutation that cannot interact with CDK, we show that part of CDC25B activity is independent of its action on the cell cycle.</description>

This fundamental connectional feature pertains to different mammalian cortices, and recent neuroimaging advancements have started to pave the way for its function-based mapping in humans. Here, we propose a framework that systematically explains the characteristic layer-specific origin of structural connections and its graded variation across the cortical sheet and across mammalian species.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A dual regulation mechanism of histidine kinase CheA identified by combining network-dynamics modeling and system-level input-output data</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Bernardo A. Mello, Wenlin Pan, Gerald L. Hazelbauer, Yuhai Tu&lt;/p&gt;

It is challenging to decipher molecular mechanisms in biological systems from system-level input-output data, especially for complex processes that involve interactions among multiple components. We addressed this general problem for the bacterial histidine kinase CheA, the activity of which is regulated in chemotaxis signaling complexes by bacterial chemoreceptors. We developed a general network model to describe the dynamics of the system, treating the receptor complex with coupling protein CheW and the P3P4P5 domains of kinase CheA as a regulated enzyme with two substrates, ATP and P1, the phosphoryl-accepting domain of CheA. Our simple network model allowed us to search hypothesis space systematically. For different and progressively more complex regulation schemes, we fit our models to a large set of input-output data with the aim of identifying the simplest possible regulation mechanisms consistent with the data. Our modeling and analysis revealed novel dual regulation mechanisms in which receptor activity regulated ATP binding plus one other process, either P1 binding or phosphoryl transfer between P1 and ATP. Strikingly, in our models receptor control affected the kinetic rate constants of substrate association and dissociation equally and thus did not alter the respective equilibrium constants. We suggest experiments that could distinguish between the two dual-regulation mechanisms. This systems-biology approach of combining modeling and a large input-output dataset should be applicable for studying other complex biological processes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/55xMZx8_bX8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Serotonergic dysregulation is implicated in numerous psychiatric disorders. Serotonin plays widespread trophic roles during neurodevelopment; thus perturbations to this system during development may increase risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. Epidemiological studies have examined association between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment during pregnancy and increased autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk in offspring. It is unclear from these studies whether ASD susceptibility is purely related to maternal psychiatric diagnosis, or if treatment poses additional risk. We sought to determine if maternal SSRI treatment alone or in combination with genetically vulnerable background was sufficient to induce offspring behavior disruptions relevant to ASD. We exposed C57BL/6J or &lt;i&gt;Celf6&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt; mouse dams to fluoxetine during different periods of gestation and lactation, and characterized offspring on tasks assessing social communicative interaction and repetitive behavior patterns including sensory sensitivities. We demonstrate robust reductions in pup ultrasonic vocalizations and alterations in social hierarchy behaviors, as well as perseverative behaviors and tactile hypersensitivity. &lt;i&gt;Celf6&lt;/i&gt; mutant mice demonstrate social communicative deficits and perseverative behaviors, without further interaction with fluoxetine. Fluoxetine re-exposure in adulthood ameliorates the tactile hypersensitivity yet exacerbates the dominance phenotype. This suggests acute deficiencies in serotonin levels likely underlie the abnormal responses to sensory stimuli, while the social alterations are instead due to altered development of social circuits. These findings indicate maternal fluoxetine treatment, independent of maternal stress, can induce behavioral disruptions in mammalian offspring, thus contributing to our understanding of the developmental role of the serotonin system and the possible risks to offspring of SSRI treatment during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Human epidemiological studies suggest that taking antidepressants during pregnancy may increase risk autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in offspring. Since only women with a diagnosis take antidepressants, there is substantial debate on whether all increased ASD risk is contributed by the diagnosis, or if medication has an additional influence. We reasoned empirical studies in a reduced system might provide some indication if there was biological basis for such an influence. Our mouse studies show that, in the absence of other maternal manipulations or stressors, maternal selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) exposure alone can alter the behavioral circuits for sensory, social and repetitive behaviors, relevant to ASD, in a mammalian brain, and that some of these changes are reversible by SSRI re-exposure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Human adolescence is a period of rapid changes in cognition and goal-directed behavior, and constitutes a major transitional phase towards adulthood. One of the mechanisms suggested to underlie the protracted maturation of functional brain networks, is the increased network integration and segregation enhancing neural efficiency. Importantly, the increasing coordinated network interplay throughout development is mediated through functional hubs, which are highly connected brain areas suggested to be pivotal nodes for the regulation of neural activity. To elucidate brain hub development during childhood and adolescence, we estimated voxel-wise eigenvector centrality (EC) using fMRI data from two different psychological contexts (resting state and a working memory task), in a large cross-sectional sample (n = 754) spanning the age from 8-22 years, and decomposed the maps using independent component analysis. Our results reveal significant age-related centrality differences in cingulo-opercular, visual and sensorimotor network nodes during both rest and task performance, suggesting that common neurodevelopmental processes manifest across different mental states. Supporting the functional significance of these developmental patterns, the centrality of the cingulo-opercular node was positively associated with task performance. These findings provide evidence for protracted maturation of hub properties in specific nodes of the brain connectome during the course of childhood and adolescence, and suggest that cingulo-opercular centrality is a key factor supporting neurocognitive development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Adolescence is a sensitive period during ontogeny and a maturational gateway to adulthood. A better characterization of the brain changes underpinning cognitive and emotional development occurring during this period is key to inform models of normal and abnormal adaptation. Advanced brain imaging allows for &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies of the protracted maturation of brain network function and connectivity during childhood and adolescence. Here, we used functional brain imaging to identify neural hubs during two psychological contexts in 754 children and adolescents. Key regions of the brain network showed increasing importance through adolescence, and individual differences in working memory performance was associated with the centrality of cingulo-opercular network nodes, suggesting a hot-spot for neurocognitive development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Expressions of emotion are powerful triggers for situation-appropriate responses by the observer. Of particular interest regarding the preparation of such adaptive actions are parietal and premotor cortices, given their potential for interaction with the amygdala (AMG), which is known to play a crucial role in the processing of affective information and in motor response. We set out to disentangle the respective roles of the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and ventral premotor cortex (PMv) in humans in the processing of emotional body expressions by assessing remote effects of continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) in the action network and in AMG. Participants were presented with blocks of short videos showing either angry or neutral whole-body actions. The experiment consisted of three fMRI sessions: two sessions were preceded by stimulation of either right IPL (rIPL) or right PMv (rPMv); and a third session assessed baseline activity. Interestingly, whereas at baseline the left AMG did not differentiate between neutral and angry body postures, a significant difference between these conditions emerged after stimulation of either rIPL or rPMv, with much larger responses to angry than to neutral stimuli. In addition, the effects of cTBS stimulation and emotion were also observed in two other action-relevant areas, the supplementary motor area and the superior parietal cortex. Together, these results show how areas involved in action and emotion perception and in action preparation interact dynamically.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Optogenetic Study of Anterior BNST and Basomedial Amygdala Projections to the Ventromedial Hypothalamus</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The basomedial amygdala (BM) influences the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) through direct glutamatergic projections as well as indirectly, through the anterior part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTa). However, BM and BNSTa axons end in a segregated fashion in VMH. BM projects to the core of VMH, where VMH’s projection cells are located, whereas BNSTa projects to the shell of VMH, where GABAergic cells that inhibit core neurons are concentrated. However, the consequences of this dual regulation of VMH by BM and BNSTa are unknown. To study this question, we recorded the responses of VMH’s shell and core neurons to the optogenetic activation of BM or BNSTa inputs in transgenic mice that selectively express Cre-recombinase in glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons. Glutamatergic BM inputs fired most core neurons but elicited no response in GABAergic shell neurons. Following BM infusions of AAV-EF1α-DIO-hChR2-mCherry in Vgat-ires-Cre-Ai6 mice, no anterograde labeling was observed in the VMH, suggesting that GABAergic BM neurons do not project to the VMH. In contrast, BNSTa sent mostly GABAergic projections that inhibited both shell and core neurons. However, BNSTa-evoked IPSPs had a higher amplitude in shell neurons. Since we also found that activation of GABAergic shell neurons causes an inhibition of core neurons, these results suggest that depending on the firing rate of shell neurons, BNSTa inputs could elicit a net inhibition or disinhibition of core neurons. Thus, the dual regulation of VMH by BM and BNSTa imparts flexibility to this regulator of defensive and social behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Systemic and Intra-Habenular Activation of the Orphan G Protein-Coupled Receptor GPR139 Decreases Compulsive-Like Alcohol Drinking and Hyperalgesia in Alcohol-Dependent Rats</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;GPR139 is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is expressed mainly in the brain, with the highest expression in the medial habenula. The modulation of GPR139 receptor function has been hypothesized to be beneficial in the treatment of some mental disorders, but behavioral studies have not yet provided causal evidence of the role of GPR139 in brain dysfunction. Because of the high expression of GPR139 in the habenula, a critical brain region in addiction, we hypothesized that GPR139 may play role in alcohol dependence. Thus, we tested the effect of GPR139 receptor activation using the selective, brain-penetrant receptor agonist JNJ-63533054 on addiction-like behaviors in alcohol-dependent male rats. Systemic administration of JNJ-63533054 (30 mg/kg but not 10 mg/kg, p.o.) reversed the escalation of alcohol self-administration in alcohol-dependent rats, without affecting water or saccharin intake in dependent rats or alcohol intake in nondependent rats. Moreover, systemic JNJ-63533054 administration decreased withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia, without affecting somatic signs of alcohol withdrawal. Further analysis demonstrated that JNJ-63533054 was effective only in a subgroup of dependent rats that exhibited compulsive-like alcohol drinking. Finally, site-specific microinjection of JNJ-63533054 in the habenula but not interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) reduced both alcohol self-administration and withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia in dependent rats. These results provide robust preclinical evidence that GPR139 receptor activation reverses key addiction-like behaviors in dependent animals, suggest that GPR139 may be a novel target for the treatment of alcohol use disorder, and demonstrate that GPR139 is functionally relevant in regulating mammalian behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human neurons expressing mutations associated with neurodegenerative disease are becoming more widely available. Hence, developing assays capable of accurately detecting changes that occur early in the disease process and identifying therapeutics able to slow these changes should become ever more important. Using automated live-cell imaging, we studied human motor neurons in the process of dying following neurotrophic factor withdrawal. We tracked different neuronal features, including cell body size, neurite length, and number of nodes. In particular, measuring the number of nodes in individual neurons proved to be an accurate predictor of relative health. Importantly, intermediate phenotypes were defined and could be used to distinguish between agents that could fully restore neurons and neurites and those only capable of maintaining neuronal cell bodies. Application of live-cell imaging to disease modeling has the potential to uncover new classes of therapeutic molecules that intervene early in disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Functional Recovery of a Locomotor Network after Injury: Plasticity beyond the Central Nervous System</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0195-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Many animals depend on descending information from the brain for the initiation and proper execution of locomotion. Interestingly, after injury and the loss of such inputs, locomotor function can sometimes be regained without the regrowth of central connections. In the medicinal leech, &lt;i&gt;Hirudo verbana&lt;/i&gt;, we have shown that crawling reemerges after removal of descending inputs. Here, we studied the mechanisms underlying this return of locomotion by asking if central pattern generators (CPGs) in crawl-recovered leeches are sufficient to produce crawl-specific intersegmental coordination. From recovered animals, we treated isolated chains of ganglia with dopamine to activate the crawl CPGs (one crawl CPG per ganglion), and observed fictive crawl-like bursting in the dorsal-longitudinal-excitor motoneuron (DE-3); an established crawl-monitor neuron. However, these preparations did not exhibit crawl-specific coordination across the CPGs. Although the crawl CPGs always generated bi-directional activation of adjacent CPGs, we never observed crawl-appropriate intersegmental phase delays. Because central circuits alone were unable to organize crawl-specific coordination, we tested the coordinating role of the peripheral nervous system. In transected leeches normally destined for recovery, we removed afferent information to the anterior-most (lead) ganglion located below the nerve-cord transection site. In these dually treated animals, overt crawling was greatly delayed or prevented. After filling the peripheral nerves with Neurobiotin tracer distal to the nerve-root lesion, we found a perfect correlation between regrowth of peripheral neuronal fibers and crawl recovery. Our study establishes that during recovery after injury crawl-specific intersegmental coordination switches to a new dependency on afferent information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; In the field of motor control, a pressing issue to resolve is how the central and peripheral nervous system become retuned and work together to establish functional locomotor patterns after descending signals are chronically removed after injury. The work we have presented, in the medicinal leech, clarifies that central pattern generator (CPG) neural networks are highly plastic in their ability to incorporate different timing elements for their intersegmental coordination after descending-coordinating information is removed. Essentially, the crawl CPGs switch their dependence on descending-timing cues to those originating from proprioceptive neurons in the muscular body wall. Results from our experimentally tractable preparation may provide a platform to guide future studies of locomotor recovery in vertebrate animals after spinal cord injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Genetic Control of Myelin Plasticity after Chronic Psychosocial Stress</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Anxiety disorders often manifest in genetically susceptible individuals after psychosocial stress, but the mechanisms underlying these gene-environment interactions are largely unknown. We used the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) mouse model to study resilience and susceptibility to chronic psychosocial stress. We identified a strong genetic background effect in CSDS-induced social avoidance using four inbred mouse strains: 69% of C57BL/6NCrl (B6), 23% of BALB/cAnNCrl, 19% of 129S2/SvPasCrl, and 5% of DBA/2NCrl (D2) mice were stress-resilient. Furthermore, different inbred mouse strains responded differently to stress, suggesting they use distinct coping strategies. To identify biological pathways affected by CSDS, we used RNA-seq of three brain regions of two strains, B6 and D2: medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), ventral hippocampus (vHPC), and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. We discovered over-representation of oligodendrocyte-related genes in the differentially expressed gene population. Because oligodendrocytes myelinate axons, we measured myelin thickness and found significant region and strain-specific differences. For example, in resilient D2 mice mPFC axons had thinner myelin than controls, whereas susceptible B6 mice had thinner myelin than controls in the vHPC. Neither myelin-related gene expression in several other regions, nor corpus callosum thickness, differed between stressed and control animals. Our unbiased gene expression experiment suggests that myelin plasticity is a substantial response to chronic psychosocial stress, varies across brain regions, and is genetically controlled. Identification of genetic regulators of the myelin response will provide mechanistic insight into the molecular basis of stress-related diseases, such as anxiety disorders, a critical step in developing targeted therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Chronic psychosocial stress is a well-established risk factor for anxiety disorders, but the development of targets for therapeutic intervention is limited by ignorance of the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms. We used inbred genetically defined mice to identify neurobiological pathways that underlie stress-induced social avoidance, a type of anxiety. We found genetically controlled differences in myelin-related gene expression in stress-exposed mice, with concurrent differences in myelin thickness, suggesting that myelin plasticity is a major stress response of the brain. The adaptive response to stress may increase or decrease myelin thickness, depending on the demands of the specific circuit. Our findings provide a foundation for the identification of specific genetic regulators of chronic stress-induced myelin plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Mammalian BK-type voltage- and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels are found in a wide range of cells and intracellular organelles. Among different loci, the composition of the extracellular microenvironment, including pH, may differ substantially. For example, it has been reported that BK channels are expressed in lysosomes with their extracellular side facing the strongly acidified lysosomal lumen (pH ~ 4.5). Here we show that BK activation is strongly and reversibly inhibited by extracellular H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, with its conductance-voltage relationship shifted by more than +100 mV at pH&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; 4. Our results reveal that this inhibition is mainly caused by H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; inhibition of BK voltage-sensor (VSD) activation through three acidic residues on the extracellular side of BK VSD. Given that these key residues (D133, D147, D153) are highly conserved among members in the voltage-dependent cation channel superfamily, the mechanism underlying BK inhibition by extracellular acidification might also be applicable to other members in the family.</description>

	<description>The CRISPR system for prokaryotic adaptive immunity provides RNA-mediated protection from viruses and mobile genetic elements. When viral RNA transcripts are detected, type III systems adopt an activated state that licenses DNA interference and synthesis of cyclic oligoadenylate (cOA). cOA activates nucleases and transcription factors that orchestrate the antiviral response. We demonstrate that cOA synthesis is subject to tight temporal control, commencing on target RNA binding, and is deactivated rapidly as target RNA is cleaved and dissociates. Mismatches in the target RNA are well tolerated and still activate the cyclase domain, except when located close to the 3' end of the target. Phosphorothioate modification reduces target RNA cleavage and stimulates cOA production. The 'RNA shredding' activity originally ascribed to type III systems may thus be a reflection of an exquisite mechanism for control of the Cas10 subunit, rather than a direct antiviral defence.</description>

	<description>To ensure timely cytokinesis, the equatorial actomyosin contractile ring constricts at a relatively constant rate despite its progressively decreasing size. Thus, the per-unit-length constriction rate increases as ring perimeter decreases. To understand this acceleration, we monitored cortical surface and ring component dynamics during the first cytokinesis of the &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; embryo. We found that, per-unit-length, the amount of ring components (myosin, anillin) and the constriction rate increase with parallel exponential kinetics. Quantitative analysis of cortical flow indicated that the cortex within the ring is compressed along the axis perpendicular to the ring, and the per-unit-length rate of cortical compression increases during constriction in proportion to ring myosin. We propose that positive feedback between ring myosin and compression-driven flow of cortex into the ring drives an exponential increase in the per-unit-length amount of ring myosin to maintain a high ring constriction rate and support this proposal with an analytical mathematical model.</description>

	<description>Ion channels control human sperm fertilizing ability by triggering hyperactivated motility, which is regulated by membrane potential, intracellular pH, and cytosolic calcium. Previous studies unraveled three essential ion channels that regulate these parameters: 1) the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel CatSper, 2) the K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel KSper, and 3) the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel Hv1. However, the molecular identity of the sperm Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductance that mediates initial membrane depolarization and, thus, triggers downstream signaling events is yet to be defined. Here, we functionally characterize DSper, the Depolarizing Channel of Sperm, as the temperature-activated channel TRPV4. It is functionally expressed at both mRNA and protein levels, while other temperature-sensitive TRPV channels are not functional in human sperm. DSper currents are activated by warm temperatures and mediate cation conductance, that shares a pharmacological profile reminiscent of TRPV4. Together, these results suggest that TRPV4 activation triggers initial membrane depolarization, facilitating both CatSper and Hv1 gating and, consequently, sperm hyperactivation.</description>

	<description>Magnetic resonance imaging has become an indispensable tool for studying associations between structural and functional properties of the brain and behavior in humans. However, generally recognized standards for assessing and reporting the reliability of these techniques are still lacking. Here, we introduce a new approach for assessing and reporting reliability, termed intra-class effect decomposition (ICED). ICED uses structural equation modeling of data from a repeated-measures design to decompose reliability into orthogonal sources of measurement error that are associated with different characteristics of the measurements, for example, session, day, or scanning site. This allows researchers to describe the magnitude of different error components, make inferences about error sources, and inform them in planning future studies. We apply ICED to published measurements of myelin content and resting state functional connectivity. These examples illustrate how longitudinal data can be leveraged separately or conjointly with cross-sectional data to obtain more precise estimates of reliability.</description>

	<description>The ability to flexibly adjust movement timing is important for everyday life. Although the basal ganglia and cerebellum have been implicated in monitoring of supra- and sub-second intervals, respectively, the underlying neuronal mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that in monkeys trained to generate a self-initiated saccade at instructed timing following a visual cue, neurons in the caudate nucleus kept track of passage of time throughout the delay period, while those in the cerebellar dentate nucleus were recruited only during the last part of the delay period. Conversely, neuronal correlates of trial-by-trial variation of self-timing emerged earlier in the cerebellum than the striatum. Local inactivation of respective recording sites confirmed the difference in their relative contributions to supra- and sub-second intervals. These results suggest that the basal ganglia may measure elapsed time relative to the intended interval, while the cerebellum might be responsible for the fine adjustment of self-timing.</description>

	<description>How can blood rapidly and precisely reach active neurons at a given time and location has remained enigmatic for a long time. A 2003 paper by Zonta et al. suggested key roles for astrocytes in the signaling between neurons and blood vessels. While a consensus on the specific intermediary roles of astrocytes in this process is still evolving, research in the past 15 years has led to a deeper and more refined understanding of the neuro-glio-vascular unit.</description>

	<description>In 1983 Libet et al. demonstrated that brain activity associated with a voluntary act precedes conscious experience of the intention to act by several hundred milliseconds. The implication that it is the brain, rather than ‘free will’, that initiates voluntary acts has been discussed ever since by philosophers and lawyers, as well as by scientists. We show here how Libet’s original study gave rise to an entire research field of experimental investigations of volition.</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;By using AT8-immunocytochemistry that visualizes hyperphosphorylated tau protein, we examined neurofibrillary changes related to sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 40 individuals at neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) stages I–IV. We report the presence of abnormal tau changes within solitary pyramidal neurons in layers III and V of the neocortex. These pyramidal cells showed pathology in different cell compartments (dendritic, somatic, axonal) that appeared to occur sequentially: Tau pathology was seen in distal segments of the basal dendrites, then in proximal dendrites, the soma, and, finally, in the axon of affected neurons. These findings are remarkable in that they point to the existence of neurofibrillary changes in regions routinely associated with later NFT stages. In addition, they lend support to the idea that it may be the axons of cortico-cortical top-down neurons in neocortical fields involved in AD that carry and spread abnormal tau seeds in a focused manner (transsynaptically) into the distal dendritic segments of nerve cells following directly in the neuronal chain, thereby sustaining further tau-seeded templating.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Parvalbumin Interneurons Shape Neuronal Vulnerability in Blunt TBI</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Excessive excitation has been hypothesized to subsume a significant part of the acute damage occurring after traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, reduced neuronal excitability, loss of neuronal firing, and a disturbed excitation/inhibition balance have been detected. Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons are major regulators of perisomatic inhibition, principal neurons firing, and overall cortical excitability. However, their role in acute TBI pathogenic cascades is unclear. We exploited the chemogenetic Pharmacologically Selective Activation Module and Pharmacologically Selective Effector Module control of PV-Cre&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons and the Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drug (DREADD) control of principal neurons in a blunt model of TBI to explore the role of inhibition in shaping neuronal vulnerability to TBI. We demonstrated that inactivation of PV interneurons at the instance or soon after trauma enhances survival of principal neurons and reduces gliosis at 7 dpi whereas, activation of PV interneurons decreased neuronal survival. The protective effect of PV inactivation was suppressed by expressing the nuclear calcium buffer PV-nuclear localisation sequence in principal neurons, implying an activity-dependent neuroprotective signal. In fact, protective effects were obtained by increasing the excitability of principal neurons directly using DREADDs. Thus, we show that sustaining neuronal excitation in the early phases of TBI may reduce neuronal vulnerability by increasing activity-dependent survival, while excess activation of perisomatic inhibition is detrimental to neuronal integrity.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Computation predicts rapidly adapting mechanotransduction currents cannot account for tactile encoding in Merkel cell-neurite complexes</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Gregory J. Gerling, Lingtian Wan, Benjamin U. Hoffman, Yuxiang Wang, Ellen A. Lumpkin&lt;/p&gt;

Distinct firing properties among touch receptors are influenced by multiple, interworking anatomical structures. Our understanding of the functions and crosstalk of Merkel cells and their associated neurites—the end organs of slowly adapting type I (SAI) afferents—remains incomplete. Piezo2 mechanically activated channels are required both in Merkel cells and in sensory neurons for canonical SAI responses in rodents; however, a central unanswered question is how rapidly inactivating currents give rise to sustained action potential volleys in SAI afferents. The computational model herein synthesizes mechanotransduction currents originating from Merkel cells and neurites, in context of skin mechanics and neural dynamics. Its goal is to mimic distinct spike firing patterns from wildtype animals, as well as &lt;i&gt;Atoh1&lt;/i&gt; knockout animals that completely lack Merkel cells. The developed generator function includes a Merkel cell mechanism that represents its mechanotransduction currents and downstream voltage-activated conductances (slower decay of current) and a neurite mechanism that represents its mechanotransduction currents (faster decay of current). To mimic sustained firing in wildtype animals, a longer time constant was needed than the 200 ms observed for mechanically activated membrane depolarizations in rodent Merkel cells. One mechanism that suffices is to introduce an ultra-slowly inactivating current, with a time constant on the order of 1.7 s. This mechanism may drive the slow adaptation of the sustained response, for which the skin’s viscoelastic relaxation cannot account. Positioned within the sensory neuron, this source of current reconciles the physiology and anatomical characteristics of &lt;i&gt;Atoh1&lt;/i&gt; knockout animals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AN0hi7HylwE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: White-Matter Pathways for Statistical Learning of Temporal Structures</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Extracting the statistics of event streams in natural environments is critical for interpreting current events and predicting future ones. The brain is known to rapidly find structure and meaning in unfamiliar streams of sensory experience, often by mere exposure to the environment (i.e. without explicit feedback). Yet, we know little about the brain pathways that support this type of statistical learning. Here, we test whether changes in white-matter connectivity due to training relate to our ability to extract temporal regularities. By combining behavioral training and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), we demonstrate that humans adapt to the environment’s statistics as they change over time from simple repetition to probabilistic combinations. In particular, we show that learning relates to the decision strategy that individuals adopt when extracting temporal statistics. We next test for learning-dependent changes in white-matter connectivity and ask whether they relate to individual variability in decision strategy. Our DTI results provide evidence for dissociable white-matter pathways that relate to individual strategy: extracting the exact sequence statistics (i.e. matching) relates to connectivity changes between caudate and hippocampus, while selecting the most probable outcomes in a given context (i.e. maximizing) relates to connectivity changes between prefrontal, cingulate and basal ganglia (caudate, putamen) regions. Thus, our findings provide evidence for distinct cortico-striatal circuits that show learning-dependent changes of white-matter connectivity and support individual ability to learn behaviorally-relevant statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Training is known to improve performance in a range of sensory-motor tasks and alter white-matter connectivity, as measured by Diffusion Tensor imaging (DTI). Yet, learning to extract the statistics of event streams in natural environments is thought to often occur without explicit feedback (i.e. by mere exposure to the environment). Here, we demonstrate that this type of statistical learning of temporal structures without trial-by-trial feedback relates to changes in white-matter connectivity in the human brain. Our findings provide evidence for distinct cortico-striatal circuits that support individual ability to learn behaviorally-relevant statistics. In particular, individuals engage dissociable structural brain networks depending on their decision strategy, suggesting alternate brain routes to learning predictive structures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Understanding how neural systems integrate, encode, and compute information is central to understanding brain function. Frequently, data from neuroscience experiments are multivariate, the interactions between the variables are non-linear, and the landscape of hypothesized or possible interactions between variables is extremely broad. Information theory is well suited to address these types of data as it possesses multivariate analysis tools, it can be applied to many different types of data, it can capture non-linear interactions, and it does not require assumptions about the structure of the underlying data (i.e., it is model independent). In this article, we walk through the mathematics of information theory along with common logistical problems associated with data type, data binning, data quantity requirements, bias, and significance testing. Next, we analyze models inspired by canonical neuroscience experiments to improve understanding and demonstrate the strengths of information theory analyses. To facilitate the use of information theory analyses, and an understanding of how these analyses are implemented, we also provide a free MATLAB software package that can be applied to a wide range of data from neuroscience experiments, as well as from other fields of study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; A primary function of the brain is to process and store information. Therefore, it makes sense to analyze the behavior of the brain using information theory, a statistical tool especially designed to quantify information. Furthermore, given improvements in data gathering techniques, the power of information theory to analyze large, complex data sets is particularly relevant. In this tutorial, we provide a thorough introduction to information theory and how it can be applied to data gathered from the brain. Our primary audience for this tutorial is researchers new to information theory. We provide numerous intuitive examples including small abstract systems, small and large brain circuits, systems from famous neuroscience experiments, and free software to implement all calculations and models presented herein.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Age-Related Declines in Prefrontal Cortical Expression of Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors that Support Working Memory</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Glutamate signaling is essential for the persistent neural activity in prefrontal cortex (PFC) that enables working memory. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are a diverse class of proteins that modulate excitatory neurotransmission via both presynaptic regulation of extracellular glutamate levels and postsynaptic modulation of ion channels on dendritic spines. This receptor class is of significant therapeutic interest for treatment of cognitive disorders associated with glutamate dysregulation. Working memory impairment and cortical hypoexcitability are both associated with advanced aging. Whether aging modifies PFC mGluR expression, and the extent to which any such alterations are regionally or subtype specific, however, is unknown. Moreover, it is unclear whether specific mGluRs in PFC are critical for working memory, and thus, whether altered mGluR expression in aging or disease is sufficient to play a causative role in working memory decline. Experiments in the current study first evaluated the effects of age on medial PFC (mPFC) mGluR expression using biochemical and molecular approaches in rats. Of the eight mGluRs examined, only mGluR5, mGluR3, and mGluR4 were significantly reduced in the aged PFC. The reductions in mGluR3 and mGluR5 (but not mGluR4) were observed in both mRNA and protein and were selectively localized to the prelimbic (PrL), but not infralimbic (IL), subregion of mPFC. Finally, pharmacological blockade of mGluR5 or mGluR2/3 using selective antagonists directed to PrL significantly impaired working memory without influencing non-mnemonic aspects of task performance. Together, these data implicate attenuated expression of PFC mGluR5 and mGluR3 in the impaired working memory associated with advanced ages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Psychophysical laws as reflection of mental space properties. (arXiv:1806.11077v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The paper is devoted to the relationship between psychophysics and physics of
mind. The basic trends in psychophysics development are briefly discussed with
special attention focused on Teghtsoonian's hypotheses. These hypotheses pose
the concept of the universality of inner psychophysics and enable to speak
about psychological space as an individual object with its own properties.
Turning to the two-component description of human behavior (I. Lubashevsky,
Physics of the Human Mind, Springer, 2017) the notion of mental space is
formulated and human perception of external stimuli is treated as the emergence
of the corresponding images in the mental space. On one hand, these images are
caused by external stimuli and their magnitude bears the information about the
intensity of the corresponding stimuli. On the other hand, the individual
structure of such images as well as their subsistence after emergence is
determined only by the properties of mental space on its own. Finally, the
mental operations of image comparison and their scaling are defined in a way
allowing for the bounded capacity of human cognition. As demonstrated, the
developed theory of stimulus perception is able to explain the basic
regularities of psychophysics, e.g., (i) the regression and range effects
leading to the overestimation of weak stimuli and the underestimation of strong
stimuli, (ii) scalar variability (Weber's and Ekman' laws), and (\textit{iii})
the sequential (memory) effects. As the final result, a solution to the
Fechner-Stevens dilemma is proposed. This solution posits that Fechner's
logarithmic law is not a consequences of Weber's law but stems from the
interplay of uncertainty in evaluating stimulus intensities and the multi-step
scaling required to overcome the stimulus incommensurability.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A hierarchical heteroclinic network: Controlling the time evolution along its paths. (arXiv:1806.11039v1 [nlin.AO])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.11039</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.11039</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We consider a heteroclinic network in the framework of winnerless competition
of species. It consists of two levels of heteroclinic cycles. On the lower
level, the heteroclinic cycle connects three saddles, each representing the
survival of a single species; on the higher level, the cycle connects three
such heteroclinic cycles, in which nine species are involved. We show how to
tune the predation rates in order to generate the long time scales on the
higher level from the shorter time scales on the lower level. Moreover, when we
tune a single bifurcation parameter, first the motion along the lower and next
along the higher-level heteroclinic cycles are replaced by a heteroclinic cycle
between 3-species coexistence-fixed points and by a 9-species coexistence-fixed
point, respectively. We also observe a similar impact of additive noise. Beyond
its usual role of preventing the slowing-down of heteroclinic trajectories at
small noise level, its increasing strength can replace the lower-level
heteroclinic cycle by 3-species coexistence fixed-points, connected by an
effective limit cycle, and for even stronger noise the trajectories converge to
the 9-species coexistence-fixed point. The model has applications to systems in
which slow oscillations modulate fast oscillations with sudden transitions
between the temporary winners.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Two critical positions in zinc finger domains are heavily mutated in three human cancer types</title>

A major goal of cancer genomics is to identify somatic mutations that play a role in tumor initiation or progression. Somatic mutations within transcription factors are of particular interest, as gene expression dysregulation is widespread in cancers. The substantial gene expression variation evident across tumors suggests that numerous regulatory factors are likely to be involved and that somatic mutations within them may not occur at high frequencies across patient cohorts, thereby complicating efforts to uncover which ones are cancer-relevant. Here we analyze somatic mutations within the largest family of human transcription factors, namely those that bind DNA via Cys2His2 zinc finger domains. Specifically, to hone in on important mutations within these genes, we aggregated somatic mutations across all of them by their positions within Cys2His2 zinc finger domains. Remarkably, we found that for three classes of cancers profiled by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)—Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma, Colon and Rectal Adenocarcinomas, and Skin Cutaneous Melanoma—two specific, functionally important positions within zinc finger domains are mutated significantly more often than expected by chance, with alterations in 18%, 10% and 43% of tumors, respectively. Numerous zinc finger genes are affected, with those containing Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) repressor domains preferentially targeted by these mutations. Further, the genes with these mutations also have high overall missense mutation rates, are expressed at levels comparable to those of known cancer genes, and together have biological process annotations that are consistent with roles in cancers. Altogether, we introduce evidence broadly implicating mutations within a diverse set of zinc finger proteins as relevant for cancer, and propose that they contribute to the widespread transcriptional dysregulation observed in cancer cells.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ei87dOiwXCQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Foreground-Background Segmentation Revealed during Natural Image Viewing</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;One of the major challenges in visual neuroscience is represented by foreground-background segmentation. Data from nonhuman primates show that segmentation leads to two distinct, but associated processes: the enhancement of neural activity during figure processing (i.e., foreground enhancement) and the suppression of background-related activity (i.e., background suppression). To study foreground-background segmentation in ecological conditions, we introduce a novel method based on parametric modulation of low-level image properties followed by application of simple computational image-processing models. By correlating the outcome of this procedure with human fMRI activity, measured during passive viewing of 334 natural images, we produced easily interpretable &quot;correlation images&quot; from visual populations. Results show evidence of foreground enhancement in all tested regions, from V1 to LOC, while background suppression occurs in V4 and LOC only. &quot;Correlation images&quot; derived from V4 and LOC revealed a preserved spatial resolution of foreground textures, indicating a richer representation of the salient part of natural images, rather than a simplistic model of object shape. Our results indicate that scene segmentation occurs during natural viewing, even when individuals are not required to perform any particular task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Foreground-background segmentation has been considered critical to form discrete object representations from continuous sensory percepts. We developed a pre-filtering approach which overcame typical limitations in modeling brain responses to complex stimuli and could be generalized to related processes. Our findings provide novel support to the hypothesis that foreground-background segmentation of natural scenes occurs during passive perception, sustained by the distributed activity of multiple areas across the visual processing stream. Specifically, while foreground information is enhanced along the entire visual pathway, V4 and LOC show a background suppression effect, though retaining texture information from the foreground. Our observations challenge the idea that these regions of the visual system may primarily encode simple object representations based on silhouette or shape features only.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Early Abrogation of Gelatinase Activity Extends the Time Window for tPA Thrombolysis after Embolic Focal Cerebral Ischemia in Mice</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is caused by clotting in the cerebral arteries, leading to brain oxygen deprivation and cerebral infarction. Recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is currently the only Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for ischemic stroke. However, tPA has to be administered within 4.5 h from the disease onset and delayed treatment of tPA can increase the risk of neurovascular impairment, including neuronal cell death, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, and hemorrhagic transformation. A key contributing factor for tPA-induced neurovascular impairment is activation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). We used a clinically-relevant mouse embolic model of focal-cerebral ischemia by insertion of a single embolus of blood clot to block the right middle cerebral artery. We showed that administration of the potent and highly selective gelatinase inhibitor SB-3CT extends the time window for administration of tPA, attenuating infarct volume, mitigating BBB disruption, and antagonizing the increase in cerebral hemorrhage induced by tPA treatment. We demonstrated that SB-3CT attenuates tPA-induced expression of vascular MMP-9, prevents gelatinase-mediated cleavage of extracellular laminin, rescues endothelial cells, and reduces caveolae-mediated transcytosis of endothelial cells. These results suggest that abrogation of MMP-9 activity mitigates the detrimental effects of tPA treatment, thus the combination treatment holds great promise for extending the therapeutic window for tPA thrombolysis, which opens the opportunity for clinical recourse to a greater number of patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The neural circuits responsible for these orienting movements have long served as a model to address fundamental questions in systems neuroscience. Though postural control is vital, we know little about development of either balance reflexes or the neural circuitry that produces them. Recent work in a genetically and optically accessible vertebrate, the larval zebrafish, has begun to reveal the mechanisms by which such vestibular behaviors and circuits come to function. Here we highlight recent work that leverages the particular advantages of the larval zebrafish to illuminate mechanisms of postural development, the role of sensation for balance circuit development, and the organization of developing vestibular circuits. Further, we frame open questions regarding the developmental mechanisms for functional circuit assembly and maturation where studying the zebrafish vestibular system is likely to open new frontiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The time-changing nature of our world demands processing of huge amounts of
information in fast and reliable way to generate successful behaviors.
Therefore, significant brain resources are devoted to process spatiotemporal
information. Neural basis of spatial processing and their cognitive correlates
are well established mostly for static environments. Nonetheless, in
time-changing situations the brain exploits specific processing mechanisms for
temporal information based on prediction and anticipation, as time compression
during visual perception and mental navigation. Alternative hypothesis of time
compaction integrates both views, postulating that dynamic situations are
internally represented as static spatial maps where temporal information is
extracted by predicting and structuring the relevant interactions.
Nevertheless, empirical approaches tackling the biological soundness of time
compaction are still lacking. Here we show that performance in a discrimination
learning task involving dynamic situations can be either favored or hampered
via previous exposition to interfering static scenes. In this sense, men were
effectively conditioned in contrast to a control group, in coherence with the
hypothesis. Meanwhile, women performed on par with control men, regardless of
the previous conditioning. This suggests time compaction is a salient cognitive
strategy in men when dealing with dynamic situations, while women seem to rely
on a broader range of information processing strategies. Finally, we further
corroborated the time compaction mechanism involved in these experimental
findings through a mathematical model of the experimental process. Our results
point to some form of static internal representation mechanism at cognitive
level involved in decision-making and strategy planning in dynamic situations

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Humans perform remarkably well in many cognitive tasks including pattern
recognition. However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying this process are not
well understood. Nevertheless, artificial neural networks, inspired in brain
circuits, have been designed and used to tackle spatio-temporal pattern
recognition tasks. In this paper we present a multineuronal spike pattern
detection structure able to autonomously implement online learning and
recognition of parallel spike sequences (i.e., sequences of pulses belonging to
different neurons/neural ensembles). The operating principle of this structure
is based on two spiking/synaptic neurocomputational characteristics: spike
latency, that enables neurons to fire spikes with a certain delay and
heterosynaptic plasticity, that allows the own regulation of synaptic weights.
From the perspective of the information representation, the structure allows
mapping a spatio-temporal stimulus into a multidimensional, temporal, feature
space. In this space, the parameter coordinate and the time at which a neuron
fires represent one specific feature. In this sense, each feature can be
considered to span a single temporal axis. We applied our proposed scheme to
experimental data obtained from a motor inhibitory cognitive task. The test
exhibits good classification performance, indicating the adequateness of our
approach. In addition to its effectiveness, its simplicity and low
computational cost suggest a large scale implementation for real time
recognition applications in several areas, such as brain computer interface,
personal biometrics authentication or early detection of diseases.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Clustering coefficients for correlation networks. (arXiv:1806.10228v1 [physics.soc-ph])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10228</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The clustering coefficient quantifies the abundance of connected triangles in
a network and is a major descriptive statistics of networks. For example, it
finds an application in the assessment of small-worldness of brain networks,
which is affected by attentional and cognitive conditions, age, psychiatric
disorders and so forth. However, it remains unclear how the clustering
coefficient should be measured in a correlation-based network, which is among
major representations of brain networks. In the present article, we propose
clustering coefficients tailored to correlation matrices. The key idea is to
use three-way partial correlation or partial mutual information to measure the
strength of the association between the two neighbouring nodes of a focal node
relative to the amount of pseudo-correlation expected from indirect paths
between the nodes. Our method avoids the difficulties of previous applications
of clustering coefficient (and other) measures in defining correlational
networks, i.e., thresholding on the correlation value, discarding of negative
correlation values, the pseudo-correlation problem and full partial correlation
matrices whose estimation is computationally difficult. For proof of concept,
we apply the proposed clustering coefficient measures to functional magnetic
resonance imaging data obtained from healthy participants of various ages and
compare them with conventional clustering coefficients. We show that the
clustering coefficients decline with the age. The proposed clustering
coefficients are more strongly correlated with age than the conventional ones
are. We also show that the local variants of the proposed clustering
coefficients are useful in characterising individual nodes. In contrast, the
conventional local clustering coefficients were strongly correlated with and

	<description>&lt;p&gt;It is widely believed that the backpropagation algorithm is essential for
learning good feature detectors in early layers of artificial neural networks,
so that these detectors are useful for the task performed by the higher layers
of that neural network. At the same time, the traditional form of
backpropagation is biologically implausible. In the present paper we propose an
unusual learning rule, which has a degree of biological plausibility, and which
is motivated by Hebb's idea that change of the synapse strength should be local
- i.e. should depend only on the activities of the pre and post synaptic
neurons. We design a learning algorithm that utilizes global inhibition in the
hidden layer, and is capable of learning early feature detectors in a
completely unsupervised way. These learned lower layer feature detectors can be
used to train higher layer weights in a usual supervised way so that the
performance of the full network is comparable to the performance of standard
feedforward networks trained end-to-end with a backpropagation algorithm.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Probabilistic inference provides a language for describing how organisms may
learn from and adapt to their environment. The computations needed to implement
probabilistic inference often require specific representations, akin to having
the suitable data structures for implementing certain algorithms in computer
programming. Yet it is unclear how such representations can be instantiated in
the stochastic, parallel-running biochemical machinery found in cells (such as
single-celled organisms). Here, we show how representations for supporting
inference in Markov models can be embodied in cellular circuits, by combining a
concentration-dependent scheme for encoding probabilities with a mechanism for
directional counting. We show how the logic of protein production and
degradation constrains the computation we set out to implement. We argue that
this process by which an abstract computation is shaped by its biochemical
realization strikes a compromise between &quot;rationalistic&quot; information-processing
perspectives and alternative approaches that emphasize embodiment.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: An Autonomic Network: Synchrony Between Slow Rhythms of Pulse and Brain Resting State Is Associated with Personality and Emotions</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The sympathetic system’s role in modulating vasculature and its influence on emotions and personality led us to test the hypothesis that interactions between brain resting-state networks (RSNs) and pulse amplitude (indexing sympathetic activity) would be associated with emotions and personality. In 203 participants, we characterized RSN spatiotemporal characteristics, and phase–amplitude associations of RSN fluctuations with pulse and respiratory recordings. We found that RSNs are spatially reproducible within participants and were temporally associated with low frequencies (LFs &amp;lt; 0.1 Hz) in physiological signals. LF fluctuations in pulse amplitude were not related to cardiac electrical activity and preceded LF fluctuations in RSNs, while LF respiratory amplitude fluctuations followed LF fluctuations in RSNs. LF phase dispersion (PD) (lack of synchrony) between RSNs and pulse (PD&lt;sub&gt;pulse&lt;/sub&gt;) (not respiratory) correlated with the common variability in measures of personality and emotions, with more synchrony being associated with more positive temperamental characteristics. Voxel-level PD&lt;sub&gt;pulse&lt;/sub&gt; mapping revealed an “autonomic brain network,” including sensory cortices and dorsal attention stream, with significant interactions with peripheral signals. Here, we uncover associations between pulse signal amplitude (presumably of sympathetic origin) and brain resting state, suggesting that interactions between central and autonomic nervous systems are important for characterizing personality and emotions.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>A reductively mechanistic approach to neuroscience suggests that low-level physical laws determine our actions and that mental states are epiphenomena. In this scheme there seems to be little room for free will or genuine agency. I argue here that physical indeterminacy provides room for the information entailed in patterns of neuronal firing – the mental content of beliefs, goals, and intentions – to have real causal power in decision-making.</description>

Sleep spindles are brief oscillatory events during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Spindle density and synchronization properties are different in MEG versus EEG recordings in humans and also vary with learning performance, suggesting spindle involvement in memory consolidation. Here, using computational models, we identified network mechanisms that may explain differences in spindle properties across cortical structures. First, we report that differences in spindle occurrence between MEG and EEG data may arise from the contrasting properties of the core and matrix thalamocortical systems. The matrix system, projecting superficially, has wider thalamocortical fanout compared to the core system, which projects to middle layers, and requires the recruitment of a larger population of neurons to initiate a spindle. This property was sufficient to explain lower spindle density and higher spatial synchrony of spindles in the superficial cortical layers, as observed in the EEG signal. In contrast, spindles in the core system occurred more frequently but less synchronously, as observed in the MEG recordings. Furthermore, consistent with human recordings, in the model, spindles occurred independently in the core system but the matrix system spindles commonly co-occurred with core spindles. We also found that the intracortical excitatory connections from layer III/IV to layer V promote spindle propagation from the core to the matrix system, leading to widespread spindle activity. Our study predicts that plasticity of intra- and inter-cortical connectivity can potentially be a mechanism for increased spindle density as has been observed during learning.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/n6XKqTbGe3g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: h-Type Membrane Current Shapes the Local Field Potential from Populations of Pyramidal Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/26/6011?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In cortex, the local field potential (LFP) is thought to mainly stem from correlated synaptic input to populations of geometrically aligned neurons. Computer models of single cortical pyramidal neurons showed that subthreshold voltage-dependent membrane conductances can also shape the LFP signal, in particular the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;; h-type). This ion channel is prominent in various types of pyramidal neurons, typically showing an increasing density gradient along the apical dendrites. Here, we investigate how &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; affects the LFP generated by a model of a population of cortical pyramidal neurons. We find that the LFP from populations of neurons that receive uncorrelated synaptic input can be well predicted by the LFP from single neurons. In this case, when input impinges on the distal dendrites, where most h-type channels are located, a strong resonance in the LFP was measured near the soma, whereas the opposite configuration does not reveal an &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; contribution to the LFP. Introducing correlations in the synaptic inputs to the pyramidal cells strongly amplifies the LFP, while maintaining the differential effects of &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; for distal dendritic versus perisomatic input. Previous theoretical work showed that input correlations do not amplify LFP power when neurons receive synaptic input uniformly across the cell. We find that this crucially depends on the membrane conductance distribution: the asymmetric distribution of &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; results in a strong amplification of the LFP when synaptic inputs to the cell population are correlated. In conclusion, we find that the h-type current is particularly suited to shape the LFP signal in cortical populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The local field potential (LFP), the low-frequency part of extracellular potentials recorded in neural tissue, is often used for probing neural circuit activity. While the cortical LFP is thought to mainly reflect synaptic inputs onto pyramidal neurons, little is known about the role of subthreshold active conductances in shaping the LFP. By means of biophysical modeling we obtain a comprehensive, qualitative understanding of how LFPs generated by populations of cortical pyramidal neurons depend on active subthreshold currents, and identify the key importance of the h-type channel. Our results show that LFPs can give information about the active properties of neurons and that preferred frequencies in the LFP can result from those cellular properties instead of, for example, network dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Laminin {beta}2 Chain Regulates Retinal Progenitor Cell Mitotic Spindle Orientation via Dystroglycan</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/26/5996?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Vertebrate retinal development follows a pattern during which retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) give rise to all retinal cell types in a highly conserved temporal sequence. RPC proliferation and cell cycle exit are tightly coordinated to ensure proper and timely production of each of the retinal cell types. Extracellular matrix (ECM) plays an important role in eye development, influencing RPC proliferation and differentiation. In this study, we demonstrate that laminins, key ECM components, in the inner limiting membrane, control mitotic spindle orientation by providing environmental cues to the RPCs. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; deletion of laminin β2 in mice of both sexes results in a loss RPC basal processes and contact with the ECM, leading to a shift of the mitotic spindle pole orientation toward asymmetric cell divisions. This leads to decreased proliferation and premature RPC pool depletion, resulting in overproduction of rod photoreceptors at the expense of bipolar cells and Müller glia. Moreover, we show that deletion of laminin β2 leads to disruption and mislocalization of its receptors: dystroglycan and β1-integrin. Addition of exogenous β2-containing laminins to laminin β2-deficient retinal explants stabilizes the RPC basal processes and directs their mitotic spindle orientation toward symmetric divisions, leading to increased RPC proliferation, as well as restores proper receptor localization at the retinal surface. Finally, functional blocking of dystroglycan in wild-type retinal explants phenocopies laminin β2 ablation. Our data suggest that dystroglycan-mediated signaling between RPCs and the ECM is of key importance in controlling critical developmental events during retinogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The mechanisms governing retinogenesis are subject to both intrinsic and extrinsic signaling cues. Although the role of intrinsic signaling has been the subject of many studies, our understanding of the role of the microenvironment in retinal development remains unclear. Using a combination of &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; approaches, we demonstrate that laminins, key extracellular matrix components, provide signaling cues that control retinal progenitor cell attachment to the basement membrane, mitotic axis, proliferation, and fate adoption. Moreover, we identify, for the first time, dystroglycan as the receptor responsible for directing retinal progenitor cell mitotic spindle orientation. Our data suggest a mechanism where dystroglycan-mediated signaling between the cell and the extracellular matrix controls the proliferative potential of progenitors in the developing CNS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Local BDNF Delivery to the Injured Cervical Spinal Cord using an Engineered Hydrogel Enhances Diaphragmatic Respiratory Function</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/26/5982?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We developed an innovative biomaterial-based approach to repair the critical neural circuitry that controls diaphragm activation by locally delivering brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to injured cervical spinal cord. BDNF can be used to restore respiratory function via a number of potential repair mechanisms; however, widespread BDNF biodistribution resulting from delivery methods such as systemic injection or lumbar puncture can lead to inefficient drug delivery and adverse side effects. As a viable alternative, we developed a novel hydrogel-based system loaded with polysaccharide-BDNF particles self-assembled by electrostatic interactions that can be safely implanted in the intrathecal space for achieving local BDNF delivery with controlled dosing and duration. Implantation of BDNF hydrogel after C4/C5 contusion-type spinal cord injury (SCI) in female rats robustly preserved diaphragm function, as assessed by &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; recordings of compound muscle action potential and electromyography amplitudes. However, BDNF hydrogel did not decrease lesion size or degeneration of cervical motor neuron soma, suggesting that its therapeutic mechanism of action was not neuroprotection within spinal cord. Interestingly, BDNF hydrogel significantly preserved diaphragm innervation by phrenic motor neurons (PhMNs), as assessed by detailed neuromuscular junction morphological analysis and retrograde PhMN labeling from diaphragm using cholera toxin B. Furthermore, BDNF hydrogel enhanced the serotonergic axon innervation of PhMNs that plays an important role in modulating PhMN excitability. Our findings demonstrate that local BDNF hydrogel delivery is a robustly effective and safe strategy to restore diaphragm function after SCI. In addition, we demonstrate novel therapeutic mechanisms by which BDNF can repair respiratory neural circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Respiratory compromise is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality following traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). We used an innovative biomaterial-based drug delivery system in the form of a hydrogel that can be safely injected into the intrathecal space for achieving local delivery of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) with controlled dosing and duration, while avoiding side effects associated with other delivery methods. In a clinically relevant rat model of cervical contusion-type SCI, BDNF hydrogel robustly and persistently improved diaphragmatic respiratory function by enhancing phrenic motor neuron (PhMN) innervation of the diaphragm neuromuscular junction and by increasing serotonergic innervation of PhMNs in ventral horn of the cervical spinal cord. These exciting findings demonstrate that local BDNF hydrogel delivery is a safe and robustly effective strategy to maintain respiratory function after cervical SCI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: LeMoNADe: Learned Motif and Neuronal Assembly Detection in calcium imaging videos. (arXiv:1806.09963v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09963</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09963</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal assemblies, loosely defined as subsets of neurons with reoccurring
spatio-temporally coordinated activation patterns, or &quot;motifs&quot;, are thought to
be building blocks of neural representations and information processing. We
here propose LeMoNADe, a new exploratory data analysis method that facilitates
hunting for motifs in calcium imaging videos, the dominant microscopic
functional imaging modality in neurophysiology. Our nonparametric method
extracts motifs directly from videos, bypassing the difficult intermediate step
of spike extraction. Our technique augments variational autoencoders with a
discrete stochastic node, and we show in detail how a differentiable
reparametrization and relaxation can be used. An evaluation on simulated data,
with available ground truth, reveals excellent quantitative performance. In
real video data acquired from brain slices, with no ground truth available,
LeMoNADe uncovers nontrivial candidate motifs that can help generate hypotheses
for more focused biological investigation.

This paper presents a data analysis framework to uncover relationships between health conditions, age and sex for a large population of patients. We study a massive heterogeneous sample of 1.7 million patients in Brazil, containing 47 million of health records with detailed medical conditions for visits to medical facilities for a period of 17 months. The findings suggest that medical conditions can be grouped into clusters that share very distinctive densities in the ages of the patients. For each cluster, we further present the ICD-10 chapters within it. Finally, we relate the findings to comorbidity networks, uncovering the relation of the discovered clusters of age densities to comorbidity networks literature.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5diqBMl6Y-k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Traveling waves appear and disappear in unison with produced speech. (arXiv:1806.09559v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09559</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09559</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In Rapela (2016) we reported traveling waves (TWs) on electrocorticographic
(ECoG) recordings from an epileptic subject over speech processing brain
regions, while the subject rhythmically produced consonant-vowel syllables
(CVSs). In Rapela (2017) we showed that TWs are precisely synchronized, in
dynamical systems terms, to these productions. Here we show that TWs do not
occur continuously, but tend to appear before the initiation of CVSs and tend
to disappear before their termination. During moments of silence, between
productions of CVSs, TWs tend to reverse direction. To our knowledge, this is
the first study showing TWs related to the production of speech and, more
generally, the first report of behavioral correlates of mesoscale TWs in
behaving humans.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Cross-paradigm pretraining of convolutional networks improves intracranial EEG decoding. (arXiv:1806.09532v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09532</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09532</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the classification of brain signals in real-life
applications, the training and the prediction data are often described by
different distributions. Furthermore, diverse data sets, e.g., recorded from
various subjects or tasks, can even exhibit distinct feature spaces. The fact
that data that have to be classified are often only available in small amounts
reinforces the need for techniques to generalize learned information, as
performances of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are enhanced by increasing
quantity of disposable data. In this paper, we apply transfer learning to a
framework based on deep convolutional neural networks (deep ConvNets) to prove
the transferability of learned patterns in error-related brain signals across
different tasks. The experiments described in this paper demonstrate the
usefulness of transfer learning, especially improving performances when only
little data can be used to distinguish between erroneous and correct
realization of a task. This effect could be delimited from a transfer of merely
general brain signal characteristics, underlining the transfer of
error-specific information. Furthermore, we could extract similar patterns in
time-frequency analyses in identical channels, leading to selective high signal
correlations between the two different paradigms. Decoding on the intracranial
data without pre-transfer reaches median accuracies of $(76.94 \pm 2.17)\,\%$
and $(81.50 \pm 9.49)\,\%$, respectively.

Metagenomic sequencing of patient samples is a very promising method for the diagnosis of human infections. Sequencing has the ability to capture all the DNA or RNA from pathogenic organisms in a human sample. However, complete and accurate characterization of the sequence, including identification of any pathogens, depends on the availability and quality of genomes for comparison. Thousands of genomes are now available, and as these numbers grow, the power of metagenomic sequencing for diagnosis should increase. However, recent studies have exposed the presence of contamination in published genomes, which when used for diagnosis increases the risk of falsely identifying the wrong pathogen. To address this problem, we have developed a bioinformatics system for eliminating contamination as well as low-complexity genomic sequences in the draft genomes of eukaryotic pathogens. We applied this software to identify and remove human, bacterial, archaeal, and viral sequences present in a comprehensive database of all sequenced eukaryotic pathogen genomes. We also removed low-complexity genomic sequences, another source of false positives. Using this pipeline, we have produced a database of “clean” eukaryotic pathogen genomes for use with bioinformatics classification and analysis tools. We demonstrate that when attempting to find eukaryotic pathogens in metagenomic samples, the new database provides better sensitivity than one using the original genomes while offering a dramatic reduction in false positives.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/a0K1XU9oCec&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

As single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets have become more widespread the number of tools designed to analyse these data has dramatically increased. Navigating the vast sea of tools now available is becoming increasingly challenging for researchers. In order to better facilitate selection of appropriate analysis tools we have created the scRNA-tools database (www.scRNA-tools.org) to catalogue and curate analysis tools as they become available. Our database collects a range of information on each scRNA-seq analysis tool and categorises them according to the analysis tasks they perform. Exploration of this database gives insights into the areas of rapid development of analysis methods for scRNA-seq data. We see that many tools perform tasks specific to scRNA-seq analysis, particularly clustering and ordering of cells. We also find that the scRNA-seq community embraces an open-source and open-science approach, with most tools available under open-source licenses and preprints being extensively used as a means to describe methods. The scRNA-tools database provides a valuable resource for researchers embarking on scRNA-seq analysis and records the growth of the field over time.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/k_dQmqkjXl0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The impact of temporal sampling resolution on parameter inference for biological transport models</title>

Imaging data has become an essential tool to explore key biological questions at various scales, for example the motile behaviour of bacteria or the transport of mRNA, and it has the potential to transform our understanding of important transport mechanisms. Often these imaging studies require us to compare biological species or mutants, and to do this we need to quantitatively characterise their behaviour. Mathematical models offer a quantitative description of a system that enables us to perform this comparison, but to relate mechanistic mathematical models to imaging data, we need to estimate their parameters. In this work we study how collecting data at different temporal resolutions impacts our ability to infer parameters of biological transport models; performing exact inference for simple velocity jump process models in a Bayesian framework. The question of how best to choose the frequency with which data is collected is prominent in a host of studies because the majority of imaging technologies place constraints on the frequency with which images can be taken, and the discrete nature of observations can introduce errors into parameter estimates. In this work, we mitigate such errors by formulating the velocity jump process model within a hidden states framework. This allows us to obtain estimates of the reorientation rate and noise amplitude for noisy observations of a simple velocity jump process. We demonstrate the sensitivity of these estimates to temporal variations in the sampling resolution and extent of measurement noise. We use our methodology to provide experimental guidelines for researchers aiming to characterise motile behaviour that can be described by a velocity jump process. In particular, we consider how experimental constraints resulting in a trade-off between temporal sampling resolution and observation noise may affect parameter estimates. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of our methodology to model misspecification, and then apply our inference framework to a dataset that was generated with the aim of understanding the localization of RNA-protein complexes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bJ09RqwTbkw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Studies of female specific behaviors have remained niche, but the focus is changing as illustrated by the recent progress in understanding the female courtship responses and egg-laying decisions. In this review, we will cover our current knowledge about female behaviors in these two specific contexts. Recent studies elucidate on how females process the courtship song. They also show that egg-laying decisions are extremely complex, requiring the assessment of food, microbial, predator and social cues. Study of female responses will improve our understanding of how a nervous system processes different challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Their morphology and density change throughout life, reflecting the maturation and reorganization of excitatory circuits. The development of &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; two-photon microscopy has enabled the monitoring of the same dendritic spines over time during different developmental periods. In this review we focus on recent &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; imaging studies in rodents that have revealed cell type-specific and region-specific structural dynamics of dendritic spines. We also discuss how the contributions of local inhibitory neurons and long-distance excitatory and neuromodulatory inputs to the cortex influence dendritic spine development and dynamics. Such studies will facilitate our understanding of how environmental factors and experiences affect cortical synapse development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>Neuronal proteostasis is maintained by the dynamic integration of different processes that regulate the synthesis, folding, quality control, and localization of proteins. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) serves as a fundamental pillar of the proteostasis network, and is emerging as a key compartment to sustain normal brain function. The unfolded protein response (UPR), the main mechanism that copes with ER stress, plays a central role in the quality control of many ion channels and receptors, in addition to crosstalk with signaling pathways that regulate connectivity, synapse formation, and neuronal plasticity.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Transmission of temporally correlated spike trains through synapses with short-term depression</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Alex D. Bird, Magnus J. E. Richardson&lt;/p&gt;

Short-term synaptic depression, caused by depletion of releasable neurotransmitter, modulates the strength of neuronal connections in a history-dependent manner. Quantifying the statistics of synaptic transmission requires stochastic models that link probabilistic neurotransmitter release with presynaptic spike-train statistics. Common approaches are to model the presynaptic spike train as either regular or a memory-less Poisson process: few analytical results are available that describe depressing synapses when the afferent spike train has more complex, temporally correlated statistics such as bursts. Here we present a series of analytical results—from vesicle release-site occupancy statistics, via neurotransmitter release, to the post-synaptic voltage mean and variance—for depressing synapses driven by correlated presynaptic spike trains. The class of presynaptic drive considered is that fully characterised by the inter-spike-interval distribution and encompasses a broad range of models used for neuronal circuit and network analyses, such as integrate-and-fire models with a complete post-spike reset and receiving sufficiently short-time correlated drive. We further demonstrate that the derived post-synaptic voltage mean and variance allow for a simple and accurate approximation of the firing rate of the post-synaptic neuron, using the exponential integrate-and-fire model as an example.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Lipidated apolipoprotein E4 structure and its receptor binding mechanism determined by a combined cross-linking coupled to mass spectrometry and molecular dynamics approach</title>

Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a forefront actor in the transport of lipids and the maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis, and is also strongly implicated in Alzheimer’s disease. Upon lipid-binding apoE adopts a conformational state that mediates the receptor-induced internalization of lipoproteins. Due to its inherent structural dynamics and the presence of lipids, the structure of the biologically active apoE remains so far poorly described. To address this issue, we developed an innovative hybrid method combining experimental data with molecular modeling and dynamics to generate comprehensive models of the lipidated apoE4 isoform. Chemical cross-linking combined with mass spectrometry provided distance restraints, characterizing the three-dimensional organization of apoE4 molecules at the surface of lipidic nanoparticles. The ensemble of spatial restraints was then rationalized in an original molecular modeling approach to generate monomeric models of apoE4 that advocated the existence of two alternative conformations. These two models point towards an activation mechanism of apoE4 relying on a regulation of the accessibility of its receptor binding region. Further, molecular dynamics simulations of the dimerized and lipidated apoE4 monomeric conformations revealed an elongation of the apoE N-terminal domain, whereby helix 4 is rearranged, together with Arg172, into a proper orientation essential for lipoprotein receptor association. Overall, our results show how apoE4 adapts its conformation for the recognition of the low density lipoprotein receptor and we propose a novel mechanism of activation for apoE4 that is based on accessibility and remodeling of the receptor binding region.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dL-J_TXfeus&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Control of neurite growth and guidance by an inhibitory cell-body signal</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006218</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Brendan A. Bicknell, Zac Pujic, Peter Dayan, Geoffrey J. Goodhill&lt;/p&gt;

The development of a functional nervous system requires tight control of neurite growth and guidance by extracellular chemical cues. Neurite growth is astonishingly sensitive to shallow concentration gradients, but a widely observed feature of both growth and guidance regulation, with important consequences for development and regeneration, is that both are only elicited over the same relatively narrow range of concentrations. Here we show that all these phenomena can be explained within one theoretical framework. We first test long-standing explanations for the suppression of the trophic effects of nerve growth factor at high concentrations, and find they are contradicted by experiment. Instead we propose a new hypothesis involving inhibitory signalling among the cell bodies, and then extend this hypothesis to show how both growth and guidance can be understood in terms of a common underlying signalling mechanism. This new model for the first time unifies several key features of neurite growth regulation, quantitatively explains many aspects of experimental data, and makes new predictions about unknown details of developmental signalling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_iAROQSe6Po&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Community interactions and spatial structure shape selection on antibiotic resistant lineages</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Sylvie Estrela, Sam P. Brown&lt;/p&gt;

Polymicrobial interactions play an important role in shaping the outcome of antibiotic treatment, yet how multispecies communities respond to antibiotic assault is still little understood. Here we use an individual-based simulation model of microbial biofilms to investigate how competitive and mutualistic interactions between an antibiotic-resistant and a susceptible strain (or species) influence the two-lineage community response to antibiotic exposure. Our model predicts that while increasing competition and antibiotics leads to increasing competitive release of the antibiotic-resistant strain, hitting a mutualistic community of cross-feeding species with antibiotics leads to a mutualistic suppression effect where both susceptible and resistant species are harmed. We next show that the impact of antibiotics is further governed by emergent spatial feedbacks within communities. Mutualistic cross-feeding communities can rescue susceptible members by subsidizing their growth inside the biofilm despite lack of access to the nutrient-rich and high-antibiotic growing front. Moreover, we show that antibiotic detoxification by resistant cells can protect nearby susceptible cells, but such cross-protection is more effective in mutualistic communities because mutualism drives mixing of resistant and susceptible cells. In contrast, competition leads to segregation, which ultimately prevents susceptible cells to profit from detoxification. Understanding how the interplay between microbial metabolic interactions and community spatial structuring shapes the outcome of antibiotic treatment can be key to effectively leverage the power of antibiotics and promote microbiome health.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LJhLUT2wYlg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Solving the RNA design problem with reinforcement learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006176</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/sNWGqeRtEb8/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Eastman, Jade Shi, Bharath Ramsundar, Vijay S. Pande&lt;/p&gt;

We use reinforcement learning to train an agent for computational RNA design: given a target secondary structure, design a sequence that folds to that structure &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt;. Our agent uses a novel graph convolutional architecture allowing a single model to be applied to arbitrary target structures of any length. After training it on randomly generated targets, we test it on the Eterna100 benchmark and find it outperforms all previous algorithms. Analysis of its solutions shows it has successfully learned some advanced strategies identified by players of the game Eterna, allowing it to solve some very difficult structures. On the other hand, it has failed to learn other strategies, possibly because they were not required for the targets in the training set. This suggests the possibility that future improvements to the training protocol may yield further gains in performance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sNWGqeRtEb8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Theta Oscillations Index Frontal Decision-Making and Mediate Reciprocal Frontal–Parietal Interactions in Willed Attention</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy149</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy149/5041999?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Attention can be attracted reflexively by sensory signals, biased by learning or reward, or focused voluntarily based on momentary goals. When voluntary attention is focused by purely internal decision processes (will), rather than instructions via external cues, we call this “willed attention.” In prior work, we reported ERP and fMRI correlates of willed spatial attention in trial-by-trial cuing tasks. Here we further investigated the oscillatory mechanisms of willed attention by contrasting the event-related EEG spectrogram between instructional and choice cues. Two experiments were conducted at 2 different sites using the same visuospatial attention paradigm. Consistent between the 2 experiments, we found increases in frontal theta power (starting at ~500 ms post cue) for willed attention relative to instructed attention. This frontal theta increase was accompanied by increased frontal–parietal theta-band coherence and bidirectional Granger causality. Additionally, the onset of attention-related posterior alpha power lateralization was delayed in willed attention relative to instructed attention, and the amount of delay was related to the timing of frontal theta increase. These results, replicated across 2 experiments, suggest that theta oscillations are the neuronal signals indexing decision-making in the frontal cortex, and mediating reciprocal communications between the frontal executive and parietal attentional control regions during willed attention.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Quantitative Three-Dimensional Reconstructions of Excitatory Synaptic Boutons in Layer 5 of the Adult Human Temporal Lobe Neocortex: A Fine-Scale Electron Microscopic Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy146</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy146/5042008?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Studies of synapses are available for different brain regions of several animal species including non-human primates, but comparatively little is known about their quantitative morphology in humans. Here, synaptic boutons in Layer 5 (L5) of the human temporal lobe (TL) neocortex were investigated in biopsy tissue, using fine-scale electron microscopy, and quantitative three-dimensional reconstructions. The size and organization of the presynaptic active zones (PreAZs), postsynaptic densities (PSDs), and that of the 3 distinct pools of synaptic vesicles (SVs) were particularly analyzed. L5 synaptic boutons were medium-sized (~6 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) with a single but relatively large PreAZ (~0.3 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). They contained a total of ~1500 SVs/bouton, ~20 constituting the putative readily releasable pool (RRP), ~180 the recycling pool (RP), and the remainder, the resting pool. The PreAZs, PSDs, and vesicle pools are ~3-fold larger than those of CNS synapses in other species. Astrocytic processes reached the synaptic cleft and may regulate the glutamate concentration. Profound differences exist between synapses in human TL neocortex and those described in various species, particularly in the size and geometry of PreAZs and PSDs, the large RRP/RP, and the astrocytic ensheathment suggesting high synaptic efficacy, strength, and modulation of synaptic transmission at human synapses.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Toward Task Connectomics: Examining Whole-Brain Task Modulated Connectivity in Different Task Domains</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy055</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Human brain anatomical and resting-state functional connectivity have been comprehensively portrayed using MRI, which are termed anatomical and functional connectomes. A systematic examination of tasks modulated whole brain functional connectivity, which we term as task connectome, is still lacking. We analyzed 6 block-designed and 1 event-related designed functional MRI data, and examined whole-brain task modulated connectivity in various task domains, including emotion, reward, language, relation, social cognition, working memory, and inhibition. By using psychophysiological interaction between pairs of regions from the whole brain, we identified statistically significant task modulated connectivity in 4 tasks between their experimental and respective control conditions. Task modulated connectivity was found not only between regions that were activated during the task but also regions that were not activated or deactivated, suggesting a broader involvement of brain regions in a task than indicated by simple regional activations. Decreased functional connectivity was observed in all the 4 tasks and sometimes reduced connectivity was even between regions that were both activated during the task. This suggests that brain regions that are activated together do not necessarily work together. The current study demonstrates the comprehensive task connectomes of 4 tasks, and suggested complex relationships between regional activations and connectivity changes.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>Developing animals must begin to interact with the world before their neural development is complete. This means they must build neural codes appropriate for turning sensory inputs into motor outputs adaptively as their neural hardware matures. We review some recent progress in the understanding of the relationship between neural coding and neural circuit development. We focus particularly on neural coding in the context of topographic maps and spontaneous activity, as well as receptive field and circuit development, drawing on examples from both mammalian visual cortex and fish optic tectum.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Systems modelling of the EGFR-PYK2-c-Met interaction network predicts and prioritizes synergistic drug combinations for triple-negative breast cancer</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006192</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Sung-Young Shin, Anna-Katharina Müller, Nandini Verma, Sima Lev, Lan K. Nguyen&lt;/p&gt;

Prediction of drug combinations that effectively target cancer cells is a critical challenge for cancer therapy, in particular for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a highly aggressive breast cancer subtype with no effective targeted treatment. As signalling pathway networks critically control cancer cell behaviour, analysis of signalling network activity and crosstalk can help predict potent drug combinations and rational stratification of patients, thus bringing therapeutic and prognostic values. We have previously showed that the non-receptor tyrosine kinase PYK2 is a downstream effector of EGFR and c-Met and demonstrated their crosstalk signalling in basal-like TNBC. Here we applied a systems modelling approach and developed a mechanistic model of the integrated EGFR-PYK2-c-Met signalling network to identify and prioritize potent drug combinations for TNBC. Model predictions validated by experimental data revealed that among six potential combinations of drug pairs targeting the central nodes of the network, including EGFR, c-Met, PYK2 and STAT3, co-targeting of EGFR and PYK2 and to a lesser extent of EGFR and c-Met yielded strongest synergistic effect. Importantly, the synergy in co-targeting EGFR and PYK2 was linked to switch-like cell proliferation-associated responses. Moreover, simulations of patient-specific models using public gene expression data of TNBC patients led to predictive stratification of patients into subgroups displaying distinct susceptibility to specific drug combinations. These results suggest that mechanistic systems modelling is a powerful approach for the rational design, prediction and prioritization of potent combination therapies for individual patients, thus providing a concrete step towards personalized treatment for TNBC and other tumour types.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lYpC_ByFRf0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Reversing allosteric communication: From detecting allosteric sites to inducing and tuning targeted allosteric response</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006228</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/13RpS-9zFXo/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Wei-Ven Tee, Enrico Guarnera, Igor N. Berezovsky&lt;/p&gt;

The omnipresence of allosteric regulation together with the fundamental role of structural dynamics in this phenomenon have initiated a great interest to the detection of regulatory exosites and design of corresponding effectors. However, despite a general consensus on the key role of dynamics most of the earlier efforts on the prediction of allosteric sites are heavily crippled by the static nature of the underlying methods, which are either structure-based approaches seeking for deep surface pockets typical for “traditional” orthosteric drugs or sequence-based techniques exploiting the conservation of protein sequences. Because of the critical role of global protein dynamics in allosteric signaling, we investigate the hypothesis of reversibility in allosteric communication, according to which allosteric sites can be detected via the perturbation of the functional sites. The reversibility is tested here using our structure-based perturbation model of allostery, which allows one to analyze the causality and energetics of allosteric communication. We validate the “reverse perturbation” hypothesis and its predictive power on a set of classical allosteric proteins, then, on the independent extended benchmark set. We also show that, in addition to known allosteric sites, the perturbation of the functional sites unravels rather extended protein regions, which can host latent regulatory exosites. These protein parts that are dynamically coupled with functional sites can also be used for inducing and tuning allosteric communication, and an exhaustive exploration of the per-residue contributions to allosteric effects can eventually lead to the optimal modulation of protein activity. The site-effector interactions necessary for a specific mode and level of allosteric communication can be fine-tuned by adjusting the site’s structure to an available effector molecule and by the design or selection of an appropriate ligand.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/13RpS-9zFXo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Evolution of chemokine receptors is driven by mutations in the sodium binding site</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006209</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Bruck Taddese, Madeline Deniaud, Antoine Garnier, Asma Tiss, Hajer Guissouma, Hervé Abdi, Daniel Henrion, Marie Chabbert&lt;/p&gt;

Chemokines and their receptors (members of the GPCR super-family) are involved in a wide variety of physiological processes and diseases; thus, understanding the specificity of the chemokine receptor family could help develop new receptor specific drugs. Here, we explore the evolutionary mechanisms that led to the emergence of the chemokine receptors. Based on GPCR hierarchical classification, we analyzed nested GPCR sets with an eigen decomposition approach of the sequence covariation matrix and determined three key residues whose mutation was crucial for the emergence of the chemokine receptors and their subsequent divergence into homeostatic and inflammatory receptors. These residues are part of the allosteric sodium binding site. Their structural and functional roles were investigated by molecular dynamics simulations of CXCR4 and CCR5 as prototypes of homeostatic and inflammatory chemokine receptors, respectively. This study indicates that the three mutations crucial for the evolution of the chemokine receptors dramatically altered the sodium binding mode. In CXCR4, the sodium ion is tightly bound by four protein atoms and one water molecule. In CCR5, the sodium ion is mobile within the binding pocket and moves between different sites involving from one to three protein atoms and two to five water molecules. Analysis of chemokine receptor evolution reveals that a highly constrained sodium binding site characterized most ancient receptors, and that the constraints were subsequently loosened during the divergence of this receptor family. We discuss the implications of these findings for the evolution of the chemokine receptor functions and mechanisms of action.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sHjAbuefwKk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

This process involves an LC-mediated rise in extracellular DA in the midline thalamus, requires D2 receptors on PVT neurons, and increases stress sensitivity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/FZo3XFNP9G0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Altered Cortical and Hippocampal Excitability in TgF344-AD Rats Modeling Alzheimer’s Disease Pathology</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Current findings suggest that accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau in the brain disrupt synaptic function in hippocampal–cortical neuronal networks leading to impairment in cognitive and affective functions in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Development of new disease-modifying AD drugs are challenging due to the lack of predictive animal models and efficacy assays. In the present study we recorded neural activity in TgF344-AD rats, a transgenic model with a full array of AD pathological features, including age-dependent Aβ accumulation, tauopathy, neuronal loss, and cognitive impairments. Under urethane anesthesia, TgF344-AD rats showed significant age-dependent decline in brainstem-elicited hippocampal theta oscillation and decreased theta-phase gamma-amplitude coupling comparing to their age-matched wild-type counterparts. In freely-behaving condition, the power of hippocampal theta oscillation and gamma power during sharp-wave ripples were significantly lower in TgF344-AD rats. Additionally, these rats showed impaired coherence in both intercortical and hippocampal–cortical network dynamics, and increased incidence of paroxysmal high-voltage spindles, which occur during awake, behaviorally quiescent state. TgF344-AD rats demonstrated impairments in sensory processing, having diminished auditory gating and 40-Hz auditory evoked steady-state response. The observed differences in neurophysiological activities in TgF344-AD rats, which mirror several abnormalities described in AD patients, may be used as promising markers to monitor disease-modifying therapies.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Sustained Activation of Postsynaptic 5-HT2A Receptors Gates Plasticity at Prefrontal Cortex Synapses</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy064</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy064/5039142?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a key role in many high-level cognitive processes. It is densely innervated by serotonergic neurons originating from the dorsal and median raphe nuclei, which profoundly influence PFC activity. Among the 5-HT receptors abundantly expressed in PFC, 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors located in dendrites of layer V pyramidal neurons control neuronal excitability and mediate the psychotropic effects of psychedelic hallucinogens, but their impact on glutamatergic transmission and synaptic plasticity remains poorly characterized. Here, we show that a 20-min exposure of mouse PFC slices to serotonin or the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor agonist 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) produces a long-lasting depression of evoked AMPA excitatory postsynaptic currents in layer V pyramidal neurons. DOI-elicited long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission is absent in slices from 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-deficient mice, is rescued by viral expression of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor in pyramidal neurons and occludes electrically induced long-term depression. Furthermore, 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor activation promotes phosphorylation of GluA2 AMPA receptor subunit at Ser&lt;sup&gt;880&lt;/sup&gt; and AMPA receptor internalization, indicating common mechanisms with electrically induced LTD. These findings provide one of the first examples of LTD gating under the control of a G protein-coupled receptor that might lead to imbalanced synaptic plasticity and memory impairment following a nonphysiological elevation of extracellular serotonin.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Erzurumlu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Molecular identification of neuronal types and genetic and imaging approaches to characterize their properties reveal morphological, physiological and dynamic aspects of sensory circuit development. Here we focus on the mouse tactile sensory circuitry, with particular emphasis on the main trigeminal pathway that connects the whiskers, the major tactile organ in rodents, to the neocortex. At each level of this pathway, neurogenesis, axonal elongation, pathfinding, target recognition and circuit reorganization including dendritic refinement of cortical layer 4 neurons occur contemporaneously and a multitude of molecular signals are used in differing combinations. We highlight recent advances in development of tactile circuitry and note gaps in our understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>The precise regulation of fluid and energy homeostasis is essential for survival. It is well appreciated that ingestive behaviors are tightly regulated by both peripheral sensory inputs and central appetite signals. With recent neurogenetic technologies, considerable progress has been made in our understanding of basic taste qualities, the molecular and/or cellular basis of taste sensing, and the central circuits for thirst and hunger. In this review, we first highlight the functional similarities and differences between mammalian and invertebrate taste processing.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Brain Activity and Network Interactions in the Impact of Internal Emotional Distraction</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy129</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Emotional distraction may come from the external world and from our mind, as internal distraction. Although external emotional distraction has been extensively investigated, less is known about the mechanisms associated with the impact of internal emotional distraction on cognitive performance, and those involved in coping with such distraction. These issues were investigated using a working memory task with emotional distraction, where recollected unpleasant autobiographical memories served as internal emotional distraction. Emotion regulation was manipulated by instructing participants to focus their attention either on or away from the emotional aspects of their memories. Behaviorally, focusing away from emotion was associated with better working memory performance than focusing on the recollected emotions. Functional MRI data showed reduced response in brain regions associated with the salience network, coupled with greater recruitment of executive prefrontal and memory-related temporoparietal regions, and with increased frontoparietal connectivity, when subjects focused on nonemotional contextual details of their memories. Finally, temporal dissociations were also identified between regions involved in self-referential (showing faster responses) versus context-related processing (showing delayed responses). These findings demonstrate that focused attention is an effective regulation strategy in coping with internal distraction, and are relevant for understanding clinical conditions where coping with distressing memories is dysfunctional.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Fast Compensatory Functional Network Changes Caused by Reversible Inactivation of Monkey Parietal Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy128</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy128/5036733?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The brain has a remarkable capacity to recover after lesions. However, little is known about compensatory neural adaptations at the systems level. We addressed this question by investigating behavioral and (correlated) functional changes throughout the cortex that are induced by focal, reversible inactivations. Specifically, monkeys performed a demanding covert spatial attention task while the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) was inactivated with muscimol and whole-brain fMRI activity was recorded. The inactivation caused LIP-specific decreases in task-related fMRI activity. In addition, these local effects triggered large-scale network changes. Unlike most studies in which animals were mainly passive relative to the stimuli, we observed heterogeneous effects with more profound muscimol-induced increases of task-related fMRI activity in areas connected to LIP, especially FEF. Furthermore, in areas such as FEF and V4, muscimol-induced changes in fMRI activity correlated with changes in behavioral performance. Notably, the activity changes in remote areas did not correlate with the decreased activity at the site of the inactivation, suggesting that such changes arise via neuronal mechanisms lying in the intact portion of the functional task network, with FEF a likely key player. The excitationâ€“inhibition dynamics unmasking existing excitatory connections across the functional network might initiate these rapid adaptive changes.&lt;/span&gt;</description>
