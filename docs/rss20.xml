	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain plasticity refers to brain's ability to change neuronal connections, as
a result of environmental stimuli, new experiences, or damage. In this work, we
study the effects of the synaptic delay on both the coupling strengths and
synchronisation in a neuronal network with synaptic plasticity. We build a
network of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons, where the plasticity is given by the Hebbian
rules. We verify that without time delay the excitatory synapses became
stronger from the high frequency to low frequency neurons and the inhibitory
synapses increases in the opposite way, when the delay is increased the network
presents a non-trivial topology. Regarding the synchronisation, only for small
values of the synaptic delay this phenomenon is observed.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;During wakefulness and deep sleep brain states, cortical neural networks show
a different behavior, with the second characterized by transients of high
network activity. To investigate their impact on neuronal behavior, we apply a
pairwise Ising model analysis by inferring the maximum entropy model that
reproduces single and pairwise moments of the neuron's spiking activity. In
this work we first review the inference algorithm introduced in Ferrari,Phys.
Rev. E (2016). We then succeed in applying the algorithm to infer the model
from a large ensemble of neurons recorded by multi-electrode array in human
temporal cortex. We compare the Ising model performance in capturing the
statistical properties of the network activity during wakefulness and deep
sleep. For the latter, the pairwise model misses relevant transients of high
network activity, suggesting that additional constraints are necessary to
accurately model the data.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Microglial elimination of dopamine D1 receptors defines sex-specific changes in nucleus accumbens development and social play behavior during adolescence</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/211029v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/211029v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Adolescence is a developmental period in which the mesolimbic dopaminergic &quot;reward&quot; circuitry of the brain, including the nucleus accumbens (NAc), undergoes significant developmental plasticity and neural circuit maturation. Dopamine D1 receptors (D1rs) in the NAc have recently been demonstrated to be critical modulators of social behavior, but how these receptors are regulated in adolescence to mediate social behavior is not well understood. In this report, we used multi-plexed immunohistochemistry with volumetric reconstructions, co-immunoprecipitation, ex vivo, and in vivo stereotaxic, microglial manipulation, and social behavior assessment to demonstrate that microglia and complement-mediated phagocytic activity shapes sex-specific NAc development. Moreover, we report for the first time that microglia-mediated phagocytosis is required for natural developmental changes in behavior, specifically, adolescent male social play behavior. These data have broad implications for understanding how experience interacts with the developing reward circuity, sex-specific responses to stimuli in adolescence, and how neuropsychiatric disorders may arise in a sexually dimorphic manner.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: FiberNet 2.0: An Automatic Neural Network Based Tool for Clustering White Matter Fibers in the Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/210781v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/210781v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The brain's white matter fiber tracts are impaired in a range of common and devastating conditions, from Alzheimer's disease to brain trauma, and in developmental disorders such as autism and neurogenetic syndromes. Many studies now examine the connectivity and microstructure of the brain's neural pathways, spurring the development of algorithms to extract and measure tracts and fiber bundles. Clustering white matter (WM) fibers, from whole-brain tractography, into anatomically meaningful bundles is still a challenging problem. Existing tract segmentation methods use atlases or regions of interest (ROI) or unsupervised spectral clustering. Even so, atlas-based segmentation does not always partition the brain into a set of recognizable fiber bundles. Deep learning techniques can be applied to automatically segment and cluster white matter fibers. Here we propose a robust approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn shape features of the fiber bundles, which we then exploit to cluster WM fibers into bundles. In a range of tests across diverse fiber bundles, we illustrate the accuracy of our method, and its ability to suppress false positive fibers.</description>

	<description>A fundamental challenge in designing brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) is decoding behavior from time-varying neural oscillations. In typical applications, decoders are constructed for individual subjects and with limited data leading to restrictions on the types of models that can be utilized. Currently, the best performing decoders are typically linear models capable of utilizing rigid timing constraints with limited training data. Here we demonstrate the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to take advantage of the temporal information present in sequential neural data collected from subjects implanted with electrocorticographic (ECoG) electrode arrays performing a finger flexion task. Our constructed models are capable of achieving accuracies that are comparable to existing techniques while also being robust to variation in sample data size. Moreover, we utilize the LSTM networks and an affine transformation layer to construct a novel architecture for transfer learning. We demonstrate that in scenarios where only the affine transform is learned for a new subject, it is possible to achieve results comparable to existing state-of-the-art techniques. The notable advantage is the increased stability of the model during training on novel subjects. Relaxing the constraint of only training the affine transformation, we establish our model as capable of exceeding performance of current models across all training data sizes. Overall, this work demonstrates that LSTMs are a versatile model that can accurately capture temporal patterns in neural data and can provide a foundation for transfer learning in neural decoding.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A state representation for reinforcement learning and decision-making in the orbitofrontal cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/210591v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/210591v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Despite decades of research, the exact ways in which the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) influences cognitive function have remained mysterious. Anatomically, the OFC is characterized by remarkably broad connectivity to sensory, limbic and subcortical areas, and functional studies have implicated the OFC in a plethora of functions ranging from facial processing to value-guided choice. Notwithstanding such diversity of findings, much research suggests that one important function of the OFC is to support decision making and reinforcement learning. Here, we describe a novel theory that posits that OFC's specific role in decision-making is to provide an up-to-date representation of task-related information, called a state representation. This representation reflects a mapping between distinct task states and sensory as well as unobservable information. We summarize evidence supporting the existence of such state representations in rodent and human OFC and argue that forming these state representations provides a crucial scaffold that allows animals to efficiently perform decision making and reinforcement learning in high-dimensional and partially observable environments. Finally, we argue that our theory offers an integrating framework for linking the diversity of functions ascribed to OFC and is in line with its wide ranging connectivity.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/209858v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by a progressive loss of brain function. Improved precision in mapping the altered brain pathways can provide a deep understanding of the trajectory of decline. We propose a tractometry workflow for conducting group statistical analyses of pointwise microstructural measures along white matter fasciculi to identify patterns of abnormalities associated with disease. We combined state-of-the-art tools including fiber registration, tract simplification and fiber matching for accurate point-wise statistical analyses across populations. We test the utility of this method by identifying group differences between Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and healthy controls. We find statistically significant group differences in diffusion MRI derived measures along the anterior thalamic radiations (ATR), corticospinal tract (CST) and regions of the corpus callosum (CC). These pathways are essential for motor control systems within cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical brain networks. Moreover, the reported pathological changes were not widespread but rather localized along several tracts. Point-wise tract analyses may therefore offer an advantage in anatomical specificity over traditional methods that assess mean microstructural measures across large regions of interest.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The Association of Externalizing and Internalizing Problems with Indicators of Intelligence in a Sample of At-Risk Children</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/210500v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>A substantial body of research suggests that various psychopathological constructs fall into two hierarchical clusters: externalizing and internalizing problems. Researchers, moreover, have also highlighted the high rate of comorbidity between externalizing and internalizing psychopathology. Numerous risk factors for psychopathology and behavioral problems have been found, including low intelligence. However, much of this research has focused on externalizing problems, thus it remains less clear how (and if) intelligence relates differently to internalizing problems. The current study seeks to contribute to this knowledge base by examining the associations between two indicators of intelligence and internalizing, externalizing, and total scores on the Child Behavioral Checklist in a sample of approximately 2,500 at-risk children. While the two measures of intelligence performed differently, there emerged a consistent relationship between overall lower IQ and higher behavioral problem total scores. There was some evidence that low IQ also predicted higher internalizing scores, but this relationship varied greatly by measure and model. Results, limitations, and implications of the current study are discussed.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Applications of community detection techniques to brain graphs: Algorithmic considerations and implications for neural function</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/209429v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>The human brain can be represented as a graph in which neural units such as cells or small volumes of tissue are heterogeneously connected to one another through structural or functional links. Brain graphs are parsimonious representations of neural systems that have begun to offer fundamental insights into healthy human cognition, as well as its alteration in disease. A critical open question in network neuroscience lies in how neural units cluster into densely interconnected groups that can provide the coordinated activity that is characteristic of perception, action, and adaptive behaviors. Tools that have proven particularly useful for addressing this question are community detection approaches, which can be used to identify communities or modules in brain graphs: groups of neural units that are densely interconnected with other units in their own group but sparsely interconnected with units in other groups. In this paper, we describe a common community detection algorithm known as modularity maximization, and we detail its applications to brain graphs constructed from neuroimaging data. We pay particular attention to important algorithmic considerations, especially in recent extensions of these techniques to graphs that evolve in time. After recounting a few fundamental insights that these techniques have provided into brain function, we highlight potential avenues of methodological advancements for future studies seeking to better characterize the patterns of coordinated activity in the brain that accompany human behavior. This tutorial provides a naive reader with an introduction to theoretical considerations pertinent to the generation of brain graphs, an understanding of modularity maximization for community detection, a resource of statistical measures that can be used to characterize community structure, and an appreciation of the utility of these approaches in uncovering behaviorally-relevant network dynamics in neuroimaging data.</description>

Orientation preference maps (OPMs) are present in carnivores (such as cats and ferrets) and primates but are absent in rodents. In this study we investigate the possible link between astrocyte arbors and presence of OPMs. We simulate the development of orientation maps with varying hypercolumn widths using a variant of the Laterally Interconnected Synergetically Self-Organizing Map (LISSOM) model, the Gain Control Adaptive Laterally connected (GCAL) model, with an additional layer simulating astrocytic activation. The synaptic activity of V1 neurons is given as input to the astrocyte layer. The activity of this astrocyte layer is now used to modulate bidirectional plasticity of lateral excitatory connections in the V1 layer. By simply varying the radius of the astrocytes, the extent of lateral excitatory neuronal connections can be manipulated. An increase in the radius of lateral excitatory connections subsequently increases the size of a single hypercolumn in the OPM. When these lateral excitatory connections become small enough the OPM disappears and a salt-and-pepper organization emerges.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Qa6CliFsDxQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Noise is a prevalent and sometimes even dominant aspect of many biological processes. While many natural systems have adapted to attenuate or even usefully integrate noise, the variability it introduces often still delimits the achievable precision across biological functions. This is particularly so for visual phototransduction, the process responsible for converting photons of light into usable electrical signals (quantum bumps). Here, randomness of both the photon inputs (regarded as extrinsic noise) and the conversion process (intrinsic noise) are seen as two distinct, independent and significant limitations on visual reliability. Past research has attempted to quantify the relative effects of these noise sources by using approximate methods that do not fully account for the discrete, point process and time ordered nature of the problem. As a result the conclusions drawn from these different approaches have led to inconsistent expositions of phototransduction noise performance.
This paper provides a fresh and complete analysis of the relative impact of intrinsic and extrinsic noise in invertebrate phototransduction using minimum mean squared error reconstruction techniques based on Bayesian point process (Snyder) filters. An integrate-fire based algorithm is developed to reliably estimate photon times from quantum bumps and Snyder filters are then used to causally estimate random light intensities both at the front and back end of the phototransduction cascade. Comparison of these estimates reveals that the dominant noise source transitions from extrinsic to intrinsic as light intensity increases. By extending the filtering techniques to account for delays, it is further found that among the intrinsic noise components, which include bump latency (mean delay and jitter) and shape (amplitude and width) variance, it is the mean delay that is critical to noise performance. As the timeliness of visual information is important for real-time action, this delay could potentially limit the speed at which invertebrates can respond to stimuli. Consequently, if one wants to increase visual fidelity, reducing the photoconversion lag is much more important than improving the regularity of the electrical signal.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ArMoUPqphhA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Prophylactic vaccination protects against the development of oxycodone addiction</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/210369v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abuse of prescription opioids is a growing public health crisis in the United States, with drug overdose deaths increasing dramatically over the past 15 years. Few preclinical studies exist on the reinforcing effects of oxycodone or on the development of therapies for oxycodone abuse. This study was conducted to determine if immunopharmacotherapy directed against oxycodone would be capable of altering oxycodone-induced antinociception and intravenous self-administration. Male Wistar rats were administered a small-molecule immunoconjugate vaccine (Oxy-TT) or the control carrier protein, tetanus toxoid (TT), and trained to intravenously self-administer oxycodone (0.06 or 0.15 mg/kg/infusion). Brain oxycodone concentrations were 50% lower in Oxy-TT rats compared to TT rats 30 minutes after injection (1 mg/kg, s.c.) whereas plasma oxycodone was 15-fold higher from drug sequestration by circulating antibodies. Oxy-TT rats were also less sensitive to 1-2 mg/kg, s.c. oxycodone on a hot water nociception assay. Half of the Oxy-TT rats failed to acquire IVSA under the 0.06 mg/kg/infusion training dose. Oxycodone self-administration of Oxy-TT rats trained on 0.15 mg/kg/infusion was higher than controls; however under progressive ratio (PR) conditions the Oxy-TT rats decreased their oxycodone intake, unlike TT controls. These data demonstrate that active vaccination provides protection against the antinociceptive and reinforcing effects of oxycodone. Anti-drug vaccines may entirely prevent repeated use in some individuals who otherwise would become addicted. Vaccination may also reduce dependence in those who become addicted and therefore facilitate the effects of other therapeutic interventions which increase the difficulty of drug use or incentivize other behaviors.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The relationship between spatial configuration and functional connectivity of brain regions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/210195v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/210195v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Brain connectivity is often considered in terms of the communication between functionally distinct brain regions. Many studies have investigated the extent to which patterns of coupling strength between multiple neural populations relates to behavior. For example, studies have used &quot;functional connectivity fingerprints&quot; to characterise individuals' brain activity. Here, we investigate the extent to which the exact spatial arrangement of cortical regions interacts with measures of brain connectivity. We find that the shape and exact location of brain regions interact strongly with the modelling of brain connectivity, and present evidence that the spatial arrangement of functional regions is strongly predictive of non-imaging measures of behaviour and lifestyle. We believe that, in many cases, cross-subject variations in the spatial configuration of functional brain regions are being interpreted as changes in functional connectivity. Therefore, a better understanding of these effects is important when interpreting the relationship between functional imaging data and cognitive traits.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Restriction of dietary protein leads to conditioned protein preference and elevated palatability of protein-containing food in rats.</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/210146v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/210146v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The mechanisms by which intake of dietary protein is regulated are poorly understood despite their potential involvement in determining food choice and appetite. In particular, it is unclear whether protein deficiency results in a specific appetite for protein and whether influences on diet are immediate or develop over time. To determine the effects of protein restriction on consumption, preference, and palatability for protein we assessed patterns of intake for casein (protein) and maltodextrin (carbohydrate) solutions in adult rats. To induce a state of protein restriction, rats were maintained on a low protein diet (5% casein) and compared to control rats on non-restricted diet (20% casein). Under these dietary conditions, relative to control rats, protein-restricted rats exhibited hyperphagia without weight gain. After two weeks, on alternate conditioning days, rats were given access to either isocaloric casein or maltodextrin solutions that were saccharin-sweetened and distinctly flavoured whilst consumption and licking patterns were recorded. This allowed rats to learn about the post-ingestive nutritional consequences of the two different solutions. Subsequently, during a preference test when rats had access to both solutions, we found that protein-restricted rats exhibited a preference for casein over carbohydrate whereas non-restricted rats did not. Analysis of lick microstructure revealed that this preference was associated with an increase in cluster size and number, reflective of an increase in palatability. In conclusion, protein-restriction induced a conditioned preference for protein, relative to carbohydrate, and this was associated with increased palatability.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Molecular insights into the pathways underlying naked mole-rat eusociality</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/209932v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/209932v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: Eusociality is the highest level of social organization and naked mole-rats (NMR)s are amongst the few mammals showing this unique social behavior; nevertheless, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the eusociality of NMRs. Results: Gene expression profiling of NMR brain and gonads (ovary and testis), from animals belonging to different reproductive castes, revealed robust gene expression differences between reproductive and non-reproductive members of NMR colonies. In the brain, dopaminergic pathways appear to be potential players in NMR eusocial behaviour. Breeding animals (queens and breeding males) showed increased expression of genes involved in dopamine metabolism. Using immunohistochemistry, we notably found these differences to be in dopaminergic hypothalamic areas, which provide inhibitory control over the secretion of prolactin, amongst other regions. Furthermore, plasma prolactin concentrations were elevated in many non-breeders (of both sexes), often reaching levels exceeding that of pregnant or lactating queens, suggesting a role for hyperprolactinaemia in socially-induced reproductive suppression. We also found that the ovaries of non-breeding females are arrested at pre-pubertal stage. They contained fewer supporting stromal cells compared to queens, and had very low expression of the aromatase gene Cyp19A1 (a key enzyme in estrogen synthesis) compared to non-breeding females. In the testes, genes involved in post meiosis spermatogenesis and sperm maturation (Prm1, Prm2, Odf3 and Akap4) were highly expressed in breeding males compared to non-breeders, explaining the low sperm number and impaired sperm motility characteristic of non-breeding males. Conclusions: Our study suggests that extreme reproductive skew, one of the defining features of eusociality, is associated with changes in expression of key components of dopamine pathways, which could lead to hypogonadism and a lifetime of socially-induced sterility for most NMRs.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Network supporting contextual fear learning after hippocampal damage has increased dependence on retrosplenial cortex</title>

	<description>Hippocampal damage results in profound retrograde, but not anterograde amnesia in contextual fear conditioning (CFC). Possible compensating regions were seldom proposed and never empirically addressed. Here, we modelled functional brain networks based on pCREB expression of various regions in rats with dorsal hippocampal lesion (dHPC) after undergoing CFC session. Both the dHPC and SHAM (control) networks were small-world, but presented different hubs, with different centrality values, and different correlation coefficient distributions, suggesting equivalent interactivity but different connectivity patterns between the networks. Further, double lesions of dHPC and a dHPC network hub (perirhinal, Per; or disgranular retrosplenial, RSC, cortices), showed impaired CFC only after dHPC-RSC, but not dHPC-Per. Consistently, RSC showed more robust differences in centrality in the dHPC network. In the absence of hippocampus, the functional networks involved in learning and memory might increase their dependence on the RSC, a proposed central region in the medial temporal lobe memory system.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Multi-modal brain fingerprinting: a manifold approximation based framework</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/209726v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/209726v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>In this work, we propose a simple and computationally efficient framework for multi-modal brain fingerprinting analysis from large datasets. The key idea is to represent each image as a bag of local features, and obtain a subject proximity graph using feature matches (over the set of all the images). This subject proximity graph, which is an approximation of the image appearance manifold, can be used to obtain a compact fingerprint representation using concepts of manifold embedding, and also allows out of sample extensions. The proposed framework can work with any local feature descriptors and is used to compare and contrast MRI modalities and their combination for the task of identification of genetically related subjects. Experiments using the T1/T2-weighted MRI and diffusion MRI data of 1010 Human Connectome Project subjects demonstrate strong links between the proposed manifold approximation and genetic proximity, with a multi-modal brain fingerprint being more discriminative than individual modalities. Single/multi-modal fingerprints for Mono-zygotic twins are found to be more similar than dizygotic or non-twin siblings in a rank retrieval analysis. This is also observed in terms of the number of feature matches between twin/sibling pairs, in major brain structures across both hemispheres. The robustness of the proposed framework for image alignment and scan resolution, with high reproducibility using retest scans, suggests the promising future application of multi-modal brain fingerprinting for characterization of individuals in large cohort analysis.</description>

	<description>We present a new structural brain network parcellation scheme that can subdivide existing parcellations into smaller subregions in a hierarchically nested fashion. The hierarchical parcellation was used to build multilayer convolutional structural brain networks that preserve topology across different network scales. As an application, we applied the method to diffusion weighted imaging study of 111 twin pairs. The genetic contribution of the whole brain structural connectivity was determined. We showed that the overall heritability is consistent across different network scales.</description>

	<description>The multilingual brain must implement mechanisms that serve to select the appropriate language as a function of the communicative environment. Engaging these mechanisms on a regular basis appears to have consequences for brain structure and function. A number of reports have implicated the caudate nuclei as important nodes in polyglot language control processes, while others have shown the caudate nuclei to be structurally altered in bilingual populations compared to monolingual populations. However, the majority of published work focuses on the categorical differences between monolingual and bilingual individuals, and little is known about whether these findings extend to multilingual individuals who have even greater language control demands. In the present paper we present an analysis of the volume and morphology of the caudate nuclei in a group of 75 multilingual individuals speaking three or more languages. Volumetric analyses reveal a significant relationship between multilingual experience and right caudate volume, as well as a marginally-significant relationship with left caudate volume. Vertexwise analysis revealed a significant enlargement of dorsal and anterior portions of the left caudate nucleus with connectivity to executive and to executive brain regions, as a function of multilingual expertise. These results suggest that multilingual expertise might exercise a continuous impact on the brain, and that as additional languages beyond a second are acquired, the additional demands for control result in modifications to brain structures associated with language management processes.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The Spectral Fingerprint of Sleep Problems in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/209452v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/209452v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>BACKGROUND: Sleep problems are a core feature of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, a robust objective measure for the sleep disturbance in patients has yet to be found. METHODS: The current study assessed EEG power across a wide frequency range and multiple scalp locations, in matched trauma-exposed individuals with and without PTSD, during rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep. In addition, a full polysomnographical evaluation was performed, including sleep staging and assessment of respiratory function, limb movements and heart rate. The occurrence of sleep disorders was also assessed. RESULTS: In PTSD patients, NREM sleep shows a substantial loss of slow oscillation power and increased higher frequency activity compared to controls. The change is most pronounced in right-frontal brain areas and correlates with insomnia. PTSD REM sleep shows a large power shift in the opposite direction, with increased slow oscillation power in occipital areas, which is strongly related to nightmare activity and to lesser extent with insomnia. These pronounced spectral changes occur in the context of severe subjective sleep problems, increased occurrence of various sleep disorders and modest changes in sleep macrostructure. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show pronounced changes in EEG spectral topologies during both NREM and REM sleep in PTSD. Importantly, the observed power changes reflect the hallmarks of PTSD sleep problems: insomnia and nightmares and may thus be specific for PTSD. A spectral index derived from these data distinguishes patients from controls with high effect size, bearing promise as a candidate biomarker.</description>

	<description>Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), which is released from the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, is essential for mediating stress response by activating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. CRF-releasing PVN neurons receive inputs from multiple brain regions that convey stressful events, but their rapid neuronal dynamics on the timescale of behavior remain unknown. Here, our optical recordings of PVN CRF neuronal activity in freely behaving mice revealed that PVN CRF neurons are activated immediately by a range of stress-inducing aversive stimuli, including predator odor. By contrast, CRF neuronal activity starts to drop within a second of exposure to appetitive stimuli, such as food. These findings suggest that PVN CRF neurons receive real-time information about aversive and appetitive stimuli. Their role in mediating the sensory detection and regulating the neuroendocrine axis resembles those of AgRP/NPY neurons and SFO neurons that regulate neurophysiology responses and mediate sensory detection of food and water.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Unified thalamic model generates multiple distinct oscillations with state-dependent entrainment by stimulation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Guoshi Li, Craig S. Henriquez, Flavio Fröhlich&lt;/p&gt;

The thalamus plays a critical role in the genesis of thalamocortical oscillations, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. To understand whether the isolated thalamus can generate multiple distinct oscillations, we developed a biophysical thalamic model to test the hypothesis that generation of and transition between distinct thalamic oscillations can be explained as a function of neuromodulation by acetylcholine (ACh) and norepinephrine (NE) and afferent synaptic excitation. Indeed, the model exhibited four distinct thalamic rhythms (delta, sleep spindle, alpha and gamma oscillations) that span the physiological states corresponding to different arousal levels from deep sleep to focused attention. Our simulation results indicate that generation of these distinct thalamic oscillations is a result of both intrinsic oscillatory cellular properties and specific network connectivity patterns. We then systematically varied the ACh/NE and input levels to generate a complete map of the different oscillatory states and their transitions. Lastly, we applied periodic stimulation to the thalamic network and found that entrainment of thalamic oscillations is highly state-dependent. Our results support the hypothesis that ACh/NE modulation and afferent excitation define thalamic oscillatory states and their response to brain stimulation. Our model proposes a broader and more central role of the thalamus in the genesis of multiple distinct thalamo-cortical rhythms than previously assumed.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jkr-v4uEYyk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Sleep loss causes profound cognitive impairments and increases the concentrations of adenosine and adenosine A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in specific regions of the brain. Time courses for performance impairment and recovery differ between acute and chronic sleep loss, but the physiological basis for these time courses is unknown. Adenosine has been implicated in pathways that generate sleepiness and cognitive impairments, but existing mathematical models of sleep and cognitive performance do not explicitly include adenosine. Here, we developed a novel receptor-ligand model of the adenosine system to test the hypothesis that changes in both adenosine and A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor concentrations can capture changes in cognitive performance during acute sleep deprivation (one prolonged wake episode), chronic sleep restriction (multiple nights with insufficient sleep), and subsequent recovery. Parameter values were estimated using biochemical data and reaction time performance on the psychomotor vigilance test (PVT). The model closely fit group-average PVT data during acute sleep deprivation, chronic sleep restriction, and recovery. We tested the model’s ability to reproduce timing and duration of sleep in a separate experiment where individuals were permitted to sleep for up to 14 hours per day for 28 days. The model accurately reproduced these data, and also correctly predicted the possible emergence of a split sleep pattern (two distinct sleep episodes) under these experimental conditions. Our findings provide a physiologically plausible explanation for observed changes in cognitive performance and sleep during sleep loss and recovery, as well as a new approach for predicting sleep and cognitive performance under planned schedules.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MU1tBjfUi9Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Alexopoulos, Tomas Olsson, Roland Martin, Friedemann Paul, Jesper Tegnér, Jordi Garcia-Ojalvo, Pablo Villoslada&lt;/p&gt;

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease driving inflammatory and degenerative processes that damage the central nervous system (CNS). However, it is not well understood how these events interact and evolve to evoke such a highly dynamic and heterogeneous disease. We established a hypothesis whereby the variability in the course of MS is driven by the very same pathogenic mechanisms responsible for the disease, the autoimmune attack on the CNS that leads to chronic inflammation, neuroaxonal degeneration and remyelination. We propose that each of these processes acts more or less severely and at different times in each of the clinical subgroups. To test this hypothesis, we developed a mathematical model that was constrained by experimental data (the expanded disability status scale [EDSS] time series) obtained from a retrospective longitudinal cohort of 66 MS patients with a long-term follow-up (up to 20 years). Moreover, we validated this model in a second prospective cohort of 120 MS patients with a three-year follow-up, for which EDSS data and brain volume time series were available. The clinical heterogeneity in the datasets was reduced by grouping the EDSS time series using an unsupervised clustering analysis. We found that by adjusting certain parameters, albeit within their biological range, the mathematical model reproduced the different disease courses, supporting the dynamic CNS damage hypothesis to explain MS heterogeneity. Our analysis suggests that the irreversible axon degeneration produced in the early stages of progressive MS is mainly due to the higher rate of myelinated axon degeneration, coupled to the lower capacity for remyelination. However, and in agreement with recent pathological studies, degeneration of chronically demyelinated axons is not a key feature that distinguishes this phenotype. Moreover, the model reveals that lower rates of axon degeneration and more rapid remyelination make relapsing MS more resilient than the progressive subtype. Therefore, our results support the hypothesis of a common pathogenesis for the different MS subtypes, even in the presence of genetic and environmental heterogeneity. Hence, MS can be considered as a single disease in which specific dynamics can provoke a variety of clinical outcomes in different patient groups. These results have important implications for the design of therapeutic interventions for MS at different stages of the disease.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Lq5z41rWIc4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

New missense mutations, for which genotype–phenotype correlations are currently unknown, are frequently reported, hampering early prediction of phenotypic severity and efficacy assessment of new disease-modifying treatments. We aimed to design a method to determine phenotypic severity early in the disease course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25069-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty-three patients were included for whom skin fibroblasts and data on disease course and mutation analysis were available. Patients were phenotypically characterized on clinical data as rapidly progressing or slowly progressing. Sulfamidase activity was measured in fibroblasts cultured at 37 °C and at 30 °C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25069-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sulfamidase activity in fibroblasts from patients homozygous or compound heterozygous for a combination of known severe mutations remained below the limit of quantification under both culture conditions. In contrast, sulfamidase activity in fibroblasts from patients homozygous or compound heterozygous for a known mild mutation increased above the limit of quantification when cultured at 30 °C. With division on the basis of the patients' phenotype, fibroblasts from slowly progressing patients could be separated from rapidly progressing patients by increase in sulfamidase activity when cultured at 30 °C (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001, sensitivity = 96%, specificity = 93%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25069-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phenotypic severity strongly correlates with the potential to increase sulfamidase activity in fibroblasts cultured at 30 °C, allowing reliable distinction between patients with rapidly progressing or slowly progressing phenotypes. This method may provide an essential tool for assessment of treatment effects and for health care and life planning decisions. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25068-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty-six patients diagnosed with MS based on the 2010 McDonald criteria (34 with the relapsing–remitting form, 2 with clinically isolated syndrome) with and without disease-modifying treatment were compared to 35 healthy age-/sex-matched volunteers. All patients underwent detailed neurological and electrophysiological examinations. Three Tesla MRN with large anatomical coverage of both legs and the lumbosacral plexus was performed by using 2-dimensional (2D) fat-saturated, T2-weighted (T2w) and dual echo turbo spin echo sequences as well as a 3D T2-weighted, fat-saturated SPACE sequence. Besides qualitative visual nerve assessment, a T2w signal quantification was performed by calculation of proton spin density and T2 relaxation time. Nerve diameter was measured as a morphometric criterion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25068-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;T2w hyperintense nerve lesions were detectable in all MS patients, with a mean lesion number at thigh level of 151.5 ± 5.7 versus 19.1 ± 2.4 in controls (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). Nerve proton spin density was higher in MS (tibial/peroneal: 371.8 ± 7.7/368.9 ± 8.2) versus controls (tibial/peroneal: 266.0 ± 11.0/276.8 ± 9.7, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). In contrast, T2 relaxation time was significantly higher in controls (tibial/peroneal: 82.0 ± 2.1/78.3 ± 1.7) versus MS (tibial/peroneal: 64.3 ± 1.0/61.2 ± 0.9, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). Proximal tibial and peroneal nerve caliber was higher in MS (tibial: 52.4 ± 2.1mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, peroneal: 25.4 ± 1.3mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) versus controls (tibial: 45.2 ± 1.4mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0015; peroneal: 21.3 ± 0.7mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.0049).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25068-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peripheral nerve lesions could be visualized and quantified in MS in vivo by high-resolution MRN. Lesions are defined by an increase of proton spin density and a decrease of T2 relaxation time, indicating changes in the microstructural organization of the extracellular matrix in peripheral nerve tissue in MS. By showing involvement of the peripheral nervous system in MS, this proof-of-concept study may offer new insights into the pathophysiology and treatment of MS.

A subset of 329 individuals had fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET. We ascertained presently existing cardiovascular and metabolic conditions (CMC) from health care records and used the summation of presence/absence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and stroke as a surrogate for vascular health. We used global amyloid from Pittsburgh compound B PET, entorhinal cortex tau uptake (ERC-tau) from tau-PET, and neurodegeneration in AD signature regions from MRI and FDG-PET as surrogates for AD pathophysiology. We dichotomized participants into CMC = 0 (CMC&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) versus CMC &amp;gt; 0 (CMC&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and tested for age-adjusted group differences in AD biomarkers. Using structural equation models (SEMs), we assessed the impact of vascular health on AD biomarker cascade (amyloid leads to tau leads to neurodegeneration) after considering the direct and indirect age, sex, and apolipoprotein E effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25071-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;CMC&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; participants had significantly greater neurodegeneration than CMC&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; participants but did not differ by amyloid or ERC-tau. The SEMs showed that (1) vascular health had a significant direct and indirect impact on neurodegeneration but not on amyloid; and (2) vascular health, specifically the presence of hyperlipidemia, had a significant direct impact on ERC-tau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Longitudinal studies are warranted to clarify the relationship between tau deposition and vascular health. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Previous studies have reported an association between human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-&lt;em&gt;DRB1&lt;/em&gt; and the risk of PD. There has also been growing interest in investigating whether inflammation-related genes interact with environmental factors such as smoking to influence PD risk. We performed a pooled analysis of the interaction between &lt;em&gt;HLA-DRB1&lt;/em&gt; and smoking in PD in 3 population-based case–control studies from Denmark and France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25065-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We included 2,056 cases and 2,723 controls from 3 PD studies (Denmark, France) that obtained information on smoking through interviews. Genotyping of the rs660895 polymorphism in the &lt;em&gt;HLA-DRB1&lt;/em&gt; region was based on saliva or blood DNA samples. To assess interactions, we used logistic regression with product terms between rs660895 and smoking. We performed random-effects meta-analysis of marginal associations and interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25065-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both carrying rs660895-G (AG vs AA: odds ratio [OR] = 0.81; GG vs AA: OR = 0.56; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-trend = 0.003) and ever smoking (OR = 0.56, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) were inversely associated with PD. A multiplicative interaction was observed between rs660895 and smoking using codominant, additive (interaction parameter = 1.37, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.005), and dominant (interaction parameter = 1.54, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001) genetic models without any heterogeneity (&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;² = 0.0%); the inverse association of rs660895-(AG+GG) with PD seen in never smokers (OR = 0.64, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) disappeared among ever smokers (OR = 1.00, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.99). Similar interactions were observed when we investigated light and heavy smokers separately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25065-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study provides the first evidence that smoking modifies the previously reported inverse association of rs660895-G with PD, and suggests that smoking and &lt;em&gt;HLA-DRB1&lt;/em&gt; are involved in common pathways, possibly related to neuroinflammation.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Deep Transfer Learning for Error Decoding from Non-Invasive EEG. (arXiv:1710.09139v1 [cs.LG])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We recorded high-density EEG in a flanker task experiment (31 subjects) and
an online BCI control paradigm (4 subjects). On these datasets, we evaluated
the use of transfer learning for error decoding with deep convolutional neural
networks (deep ConvNets). In comparison with a regularized linear discriminant
analysis (rLDA) classifier, ConvNets were significantly better in both intra-
and inter-subject decoding, achieving an average accuracy of 84.1 % within
subject and 81.7 % on unknown subjects (flanker task). Neither method was,
however, able to generalize reliably between paradigms. Visualization of
features the ConvNets learned from the data showed plausible patterns of brain
activity, revealing both similarities and differences between the different
kinds of errors. Our findings indicate that deep learning techniques are useful
to infer information about the correctness of action in BCI applications,
particularly for the transfer of pre-trained classifiers to new recording
sessions or subjects.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09118</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We formulate the computational processes of perception in the framework of
the principle of least action by postulating the theoretical action being
time-integral of the free energy in the brain sciences. The free energy
principle is accordingly rephrased as that for autopoietic reasons all viable
organisms attempt to minimize the sensory uncertainty about the unpredictable
environment over a temporal horizon. By varying the informational action, we
derive the brain's recognition dynamics which conducts the adaptive inference
of the external causes of sensory data with addressing only canonical positions
and momenta of the brain's representations of the dynamical world. To manifest
the utility of our theory, we provide how the neural computation may be
implemented biophysically at a single-cell level and subsequently be scaled up
to a large-scale functional architecture of the brain. We also present formal
solutions to the recognition dynamics for a model brain in linear regime and
analyze the perceptual trajectories about fixed points in state space.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Fast and Scalable Distributed Deep Convolutional Autoencoder for fMRI Big Data Analytics. (arXiv:1710.08961v1 [cs.DC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, analyzing task-based fMRI (tfMRI) data has become an
essential tool for understanding brain function and networks. However, due to
the sheer size of tfMRI data, its intrinsic complex structure, and lack of
ground truth of underlying neural activities, modeling tfMRI data is hard and
challenging. Previously proposed data-modeling methods including Independent
Component Analysis (ICA) and Sparse Dictionary Learning only provided a weakly
established model based on blind source separation under the strong assumption
that original fMRI signals could be linearly decomposed into time series
components with corresponding spatial maps. Meanwhile, analyzing and learning a
large amount of tfMRI data from a variety of subjects has been shown to be very
demanding but yet challenging even with technological advances in computational
hardware. Given the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a robust method for
learning high-level abstractions from low-level data such as tfMRI time series,
in this work we propose a fast and scalable novel framework for distributed
deep Convolutional Autoencoder model. This model aims to both learn the complex
hierarchical structure of the tfMRI data and to leverage the processing power
of multiple GPUs in a distributed fashion. To implement such a model, we have
created an enhanced processing pipeline on the top of Apache Spark and
Tensorflow library, leveraging from a very large cluster of GPU machines.
Experimental data from applying the model on the Human Connectome Project (HCP)
show that the proposed model is efficient and scalable toward tfMRI big data
analytics, thus enabling data-driven extraction of hierarchical neuroscientific
information from massive fMRI big data in the future.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Today digital sources supply an unprecedented component of human sensorimotor
data, the consumption of which is correlated with poorly understood maladies
such as Internet Addiction Disorder and Internet Gaming Disorder. This paper
offers a mathematical understanding of human sensorimotor processing as
multiscale, continuous-time vibratory interaction. We quantify human
informational needs using the signal processing metrics of entropy, noise,
dimensionality, continuity, latency, and bandwidth. Using these metrics, we
define the trust humans experience as a primitive statistical algorithm
processing finely grained sensorimotor data from neuromechanical interaction.
This definition of neuromechanical trust implies that artificial sensorimotor
inputs and interactions that attract low-level attention through frequent
discontinuities and enhanced coherence will decalibrate a brain's
representation of its world over the long term by violating the implicit
statistical contract for which self-calibration evolved. This approach allows
us to model addiction in general as the result of homeostatic regulation gone
awry in novel environments and digital dependency as a sub-case in which the
decalibration caused by digital sensorimotor data spurs yet more consumption of
them. We predict that institutions can use these sensorimotor metrics to
quantify media richness to improve employee well-being; that dyads and
family-size groups will bond and heal best through low-latency, high-resolution
multisensory interaction such as shared meals and reciprocated touch; and that
individuals can improve sensory and sociosensory resolution through deliberate
sensory reintegration practices. We conclude that we humans are the victims of
our own success, our hands so skilled they fill the world with captivating
things, our eyes so innocent they follow eagerly.

	<description>In resting-state BOLD imaging, synchronous ultra-slow (∼0.1 Hz) oscillations in blood oxygenation between brain areas are interpreted as “functional” neuronal connections. Mateo et al. reveals a basis for this inference: neuronal activity entrains arteriole dilation that in turn drives oxygenation.</description>

Neuroligin 2 also interacts with Slitrk3 to regulate GABAergic synaptogenesis.

	<description>To transmit information efficiently in a changing environment, the retina adapts to visual contrast by adjusting its gain, latency and mean response. Additionally, the temporal frequency selectivity, or bandwidth changes to encode the absolute intensity when the stimulus environment is noisy, and intensity differences when noise is low. We show that the On pathway of On-Off retinal amacrine and ganglion cells is required to change temporal bandwidth but not other adaptive properties. This remarkably specific adaptive mechanism arises from differential effects of contrast on the On and Off pathways. We analyzed a biophysical model fit only to a cell's membrane potential, and verified pharmacologically that it accurately revealed the two pathways. We conclude that changes in bandwidth arise mostly from differences in synaptic threshold in the two pathways, rather than differences in synaptic release dynamics. Different efficient codes are selected by different thresholds in two independently adapting neural pathways.</description>

	<description>Inhibition of nociceptor activity is important for the prevention of spontaneous pain and hyperalgesia. To identify the critical K+ channels that regulate nociceptor excitability we performed a forward genetic screen using a Drosophila larval nociception paradigm. Knockdown of three K+ channel loci, the small conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (SK), seizure and tiwaz, resulted in marked hypersensitive nociception behaviors. In more detailed studies of SK, we found that hypersensitive phenotypes could be recapitulated with a genetically null allele. Importantly, the null mutant phenotype could be rescued with tissue specific expression of an SK cDNA in nociceptors. Optical recordings from nociceptive neurons showed a significant increase in mechanically activated Ca2+ signals in SK mutant nociceptors. SK showed expression in peripheral neurons. Interestingly SK proteins localized to axons of these neurons but were not detected in dendrites. Our findings suggest a major role for SK channels in the regulation of nociceptor excitation and they are inconsistent with the hypothesis that the important site of action is within dendrites.</description>

How neuronal diversity emerges from complex patterns of gene expression remains poorly understood. Here we present an approach to understand electrophysiological diversity through gene expression by integrating pooled- and single-cell transcriptomics with intracellular electrophysiology. Using neuroinformatics methods, we compiled a brain-wide dataset of 34 neuron types with paired gene expression and intrinsic electrophysiological features from publically accessible sources, the largest such collection to date. We identified 420 genes whose expression levels significantly correlated with variability in one or more of 11 physiological parameters. We next trained statistical models to infer cellular features from multivariate gene expression patterns. Such models were predictive of gene-electrophysiological relationships in an independent collection of 12 visual cortex cell types from the Allen Institute, suggesting that these correlations might reflect general principles relating expression patterns to phenotypic diversity across very different cell types. Many associations reported here have the potential to provide new insights into how neurons generate functional diversity, and correlations of ion channel genes like &lt;i&gt;Gabrd&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Scn1a&lt;/i&gt; (Nav1.1) with resting potential and spiking frequency are consistent with known causal mechanisms. Our work highlights the promise and inherent challenges in using cell type-specific transcriptomics to understand the mechanistic origins of neuronal diversity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mxjWoj2tlEo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) mediate intercellular communication at synapses through the opening of an ion pore in response to the binding of a neurotransmitter. Despite the increasing availability of high-resolution structures of pLGICs, a detailed understanding of the functional isomerization from closed to open (gating) and back is currently missing. Here, we provide the first atomistic description of the transition from open to closed (un-gating) in the glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl) from &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis Elegans&lt;/i&gt;. Starting with the active-state structure solved in complex with the neurotransmitter L-glutamate and the positive allosteric modulator (PAM) ivermectin, we analyze the spontaneous relaxation of the channel upon removal of ivermectin by explicit solvent/membrane Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;s-long trajectories support the conclusion that ion-channel deactivation is mediated by two distinct quaternary transitions, i.e. a global receptor twisting followed by the radial expansion (or blooming) of the extracellular domain. At variance with previous models, we show that pore closing is exclusively regulated by the global twisting, which controls the position of the &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;1-&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;2 loop relative to the M2-M3 loop at the EC/TM domain interface. Additional simulations with L-glutamate restrained to the crystallographic binding mode and ivermectin removed indicate that the same twisting isomerization is regulated by agonist binding at the orthosteric site. These results provide a structural model for gating in pLGICs and suggest a plausible mechanism for the pharmacological action of PAMs in this neurotransmitter receptor family. The simulated un-gating converges to the X-ray structure of GluCl resting state both globally and locally, demonstrating the predictive character of state-of-art MD simulations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YaGafPEqC8U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Intellectual Disability and Schizophrenia Associated Transcription Factor TCF4 Is Regulated by Neuronal Activity and Protein Kinase A</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/43/10516?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transcription factor 4 (TCF4 also known as ITF2 or E2-2) is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein associated with Pitt–Hopkins syndrome, intellectual disability, and schizophrenia (SCZ). Here, we show that TCF4-dependent transcription in cortical neurons cultured from embryonic rats of both sexes is induced by neuronal activity via soluble adenylyl cyclase and protein kinase A (PKA) signaling. PKA phosphorylates TCF4 directly and a PKA phosphorylation site in TCF4 is necessary for its transcriptional activity in cultured neurons and in the developing brain &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. We also demonstrate that &lt;i&gt;Gadd45g&lt;/i&gt; (growth arrest and DNA damage inducible gamma) is a direct target of neuronal-activity-induced, TCF4-dependent transcriptional regulation and that TCF4 missense variations identified in SCZ patients alter the transcriptional activity of TCF4 in neurons. This study identifies a new role for TCF4 as a neuronal-activity-regulated transcription factor, offering a novel perspective on the association of TCF4 with cognitive disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The importance of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor transcription factor 4 (TCF4) in the nervous system is underlined by its association with common and rare cognitive disorders. In the current study, we show that TCF4-controlled transcription in primary cortical neurons is induced by neuronal activity and protein kinase A. Our results support the hypotheses that dysregulation of neuronal-activity-dependent signaling plays a significant part in the etiology of neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: MicroRNA-1906, a Novel Regulator of Toll-Like Receptor 4, Ameliorates Ischemic Injury after Experimental Stroke in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/43/10498?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a proinflammatory cascade initiator in poststroke inflammation. In this study, miR-1906, a novel regulator of TLR4, was identified via &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; analysis and microRNA profiling in male adult mice and its expression was then quantitated in the ischemic hemisphere. We found miR-1906 to be significantly brain enriched in the ischemic hemisphere and even more drastically enriched in the peri-infarct regions. Furthermore, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments demonstrated that, during oxygen–glucose deprivation, miR-1906 expression was increased in glial cells but decreased in neurons. Surprisingly, despite the augmentation of intracellular abundance, miR-1906 expression in extracellular vesicles was decreased in astrocyte cell culture supernatants, suggesting reduced sources of miR-1906 from glia to neurons. When exogenous miR-1906 was administered, decreased TLR4 protein expression was observed both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Using Cy3 labeling, exogenous miR-1906 uptake by astrocytes, microglia, and neurons was visualized directly &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Reduced infarct volumes and improved functional outcomes were observed in middle cerebral artery occlusion mice receiving miR-1906. However, the protective effects of miR-1906 disappeared with the genetic knock-out of TLR4, suggesting that TLR4 is a major target of miR-1906 through which the microRNA exerts its therapeutic effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The current study identified miR-1906 as a novel specific regulator of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and depicted its distinct expression patterns in different cerebral regions and cell types during ischemic attack. Therefore, the therapeutic supplementation of miR-1906 can be beneficial in the modulation of poststroke inflammation. Using Cy3 labeling, exogenous miR-1906 expression was visualized and shown to enter astrocytes, microglia, and neurons successfully &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Supplemental therapeutic miR-1906 resulted in reduced TLR4 expression and improved outcomes after middle cerebral artery occlusion in a mouse model, but its neuroprotective function was TLR4 dependent, suggesting that TLR4 is a major target of miR-1906.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Weak Higher-Order Interactions in Macroscopic Functional Networks of the Resting Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/43/10481?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/43/10481?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Interactions among different brain regions are usually examined through functional connectivity (FC) analysis, which is exclusively based on measuring pairwise correlations in activities. However, interactions beyond the pairwise level, that is, higher-order interactions (HOIs), are vital in understanding the behavior of many complex systems. So far, whether HOIs exist among brain regions and how they can affect the brain's activities remains largely elusive. To address these issues, here, we analyzed blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals recorded from six typical macroscopic functional networks of the brain in 100 human subjects (46 males and 54 females) during the resting state. Through examining the binarized BOLD signals, we found that HOIs within and across individual networks were both very weak regardless of the network size, topology, degree of spatial proximity, spatial scales, and whether the global signal was regressed. To investigate the potential mechanisms underlying the weak HOIs, we analyzed the dynamics of a network model and also found that HOIs were generally weak within a wide range of key parameters provided that the overall dynamic feature of the model was similar to the empirical data and it was operating close to a linear fluctuation regime. Our results suggest that weak HOI may be a general property of brain's macroscopic functional networks, which implies the dominance of pairwise interactions in shaping brain activities at such a scale and warrants the validity of widely used pairwise-based FC approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; To explain how activities of different brain areas are coordinated through interactions is essential to revealing the mechanisms underlying various brain functions. Traditionally, such an interaction structure is commonly studied using pairwise-based functional network analyses. It is unclear whether the interactions beyond the pairwise level (higher-order interactions or HOIs) play any role in this process. Here, we show that HOIs are generally weak in macroscopic brain networks. We also suggest a possible dynamical mechanism that may underlie this phenomenon. These results provide plausible explanation for the effectiveness of widely used pairwise-based approaches in analyzing brain networks. More importantly, it reveals a previously unknown, simple organization of the brain's macroscopic functional systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Spatial Structure of Synchronized Inhibition in the Olfactory Bulb</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/43/10468?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Olfactory sensory input is detected by receptor neurons in the nose, which then send information to the olfactory bulb (OB), the first brain region for processing olfactory information. Within the OB, many local circuit interneurons, including axonless granule cells, function to facilitate fine odor discrimination. How interneurons interact with principal cells to affect bulbar processing is not known, but the mechanism is likely to be different from that in sensory cortical regions because the OB lacks an obvious topographical organization. Neighboring glomerular columns, representing inputs from different receptor neuron subtypes, typically have different odor tuning. Determining the spatial scale over which interneurons such as granule cells can affect principal cells is a critical step toward understanding how the OB operates. We addressed this question by assaying inhibitory synchrony using intracellular recordings from pairs of principal cells with different intersomatic spacing. We found, in acute rat OB slices from both sexes, that inhibitory synchrony is evident in the spontaneous synaptic input in mitral cells (MCs) separated up to 220 μm (300 μm with elevated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). At all intersomatic spacing assayed, inhibitory synchrony was dependent on Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels, suggesting that action potentials in granule cells function to coordinate GABA release at relatively distant dendrodendritic synapses formed throughout the dendritic arbor. Our results suggest that individual granule cells are able to influence relatively large groups of MCs and tufted cells belonging to clusters of at least 15 glomerular modules, providing a potential mechanism to integrate signals reflecting a wide variety of odorants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Inhibitory circuits in the olfactory bulb (OB) play a major role in odor processing, especially during fine odor discrimination. However, how inhibitory networks enhance olfactory function, and over what spatial scale they operate, is not known. Interneurons are potentially able to function on both a highly localized, synapse-specific level and on a larger, spatial scale that encompasses many different glomerular channels. Although recent indirect evidence has suggested a relatively localized functional role for most inhibition in the OB, in the present study, we used paired intracellular recordings to demonstrate directly that inhibitory local circuits operate over large spatial scales by using fast action potentials to link GABA release at many different synaptic contacts formed with principal cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Signatures of Somatic Inhibition and Dendritic Excitation in Auditory Brainstem Field Potentials</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Extracellular voltage recordings (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;; field potentials) provide an accessible view of &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; neural activity, but proper interpretation of field potentials is a long-standing challenge. Computational modeling can aid in identifying neural generators of field potentials. In the auditory brainstem of cats, spatial patterns of sound-evoked &lt;i&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; can resemble, strikingly, &lt;i&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; generated by current dipoles. Previously, we developed a biophysically-based model of a binaural brainstem nucleus, the medial superior olive (MSO), that accounts qualitatively for observed dipole-like &lt;i&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; patterns in sustained responses to monaural tones with frequencies &amp;gt;~1000 Hz (Goldwyn et al., 2014). We have observed, however, that &lt;i&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; patterns in cats of both sexes appear more monopole-like for lower-frequency tones. Here, we enhance our theory to accurately reproduce dipole and non-dipole features of &lt;i&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; responses to monaural tones with frequencies ranging from 600 to 1800 Hz. By applying our model to data, we estimate time courses of paired input currents to MSO neurons. We interpret these inputs as dendrite-targeting excitation and soma-targeting inhibition (the latter contributes non-dipole-like features to &lt;i&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; responses). Aspects of inferred inputs are consistent with synaptic inputs to MSO neurons including the tendencies of inhibitory inputs to attenuate in response to high-frequency tones and to precede excitatory inputs. Importantly, our updated theory can be tested experimentally by blocking synaptic inputs. MSO neurons perform a critical role in sound localization and binaural hearing. By solving an inverse problem to uncover synaptic inputs from &lt;i&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; patterns we provide a new perspective on MSO physiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Extracellular voltages (field potentials) are a common measure of brain activity. Ideally, one could infer from these data the activity of neurons and synapses that generate field potentials, but this &quot;inverse problem&quot; is not easily solved. We study brainstem field potentials in the region of the medial superior olive (MSO); a critical center in the auditory pathway. These field potentials exhibit distinctive spatial and temporal patterns in response to pure tone sounds. We use mathematical modeling in combination with physiological and anatomical knowledge of MSO neurons to plausibly explain how dendrite-targeting excitation and soma-targeting inhibition generate these field potentials. Inferring putative synaptic currents from field potentials advances our ability to study neural processing of sound in the MSO.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Valence, Not Utility, Underlies Reward-Driven Prioritization in Human Vision</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/43/10438?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/43/10438?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objects associated with reward draw attention and evoke enhanced activity in visual cortex. What is the underlying mechanism? One possibility is that reward's impact on vision is mediated by unique circuitry that modulates sensory processing, selectively increasing the salience of reward-associated stimuli. Alternatively, effects of reward may be part of a more general mechanism that prioritizes the processing of any beneficial object, importantly including stimuli that are associated with the evasion of loss. Here, we test these competing hypotheses by having male and female humans detect naturalistic objects associated with monetary reward, the evasion of equivalent loss, or neither of these. If vision is economically normative, processing of objects associated with reward and evasion of loss should be prioritized relative to neutral stimuli. Results from fMRI and behavioral experiments show that this is not the case: whereas objects associated with reward were better detected and represented in ventral visual cortex, detection and representation of stimuli associated with the evasion of loss were degraded. Representations in parietal cortex reveal a notable exception to this pattern, showing enhanced encoding of both reward- and loss-associated stimuli. Experience-driven visual prioritization can thus be economically irrational, driven by valence rather than objective utility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Normative economic models propose that gain should have the same value as evasion of equivalent loss. Is human vision rational in this way? Objects associated with reward draw attention and are well represented in visual cortex. This is thought to have evolutionary origins, highlighting objects likely to provide benefit in the future. But benefit can be conferred not only through gain, but also through evasion of loss. Here we demonstrate that the visual system prioritizes real-world objects presented in images of natural scenes only when these objects have been associated with reward, not when they have provided the opportunity to evade financial loss. Visual selection is thus non-normative and economically irrational, driven by valence rather than objective utility.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: MEG Insight into the Spectral Dynamics Underlying Steady Isometric Muscle Contraction</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;To gain fundamental knowledge on how the brain controls motor actions, we studied in detail the interplay between MEG signals from the primary sensorimotor (SM1) cortex and the contraction force of 17 healthy adult humans (7 females, 10 males). SM1 activity was coherent at ~20 Hz with surface electromyogram (as already extensively reported) but also with contraction force. In both cases, the effective coupling was dominant in the efferent direction. Across subjects, the level of ~20 Hz coherence between cortex and periphery positively correlated with the &quot;burstiness&quot; of ~20 Hz SM1 (Pearson &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;  0.65) and peripheral fluctuations (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;  0.9). Thus, ~20 Hz coherence between cortex and periphery is tightly linked to the presence of ~20 Hz bursts in SM1 and peripheral activity. However, the very high correlation with peripheral fluctuations suggests that the periphery is the limiting factor. At frequencies &amp;lt;3 Hz, both SM1 signals and ~20 Hz SM1 envelope were coherent with both force and its absolute change rate. The effective coupling dominated in the efferent direction between (1) force and the ~20 Hz SM1 envelope and (2) the absolute change rate of the force and SM1 signals. Together, our data favor the view that ~20 Hz coherence between cortex and periphery during isometric contraction builds on the presence of ~20 Hz SM1 oscillations and needs not rely on feedback from the periphery. They also suggest that effective cortical proprioceptive processing operates at &amp;lt;3 Hz frequencies, even during steady isometric contractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Accurate motor actions are made possible by continuous communication between the cortex and spinal motoneurons, but the neurophysiological basis of this communication is poorly understood. Using MEG recordings in humans maintaining steady isometric muscle contractions, we found evidence that the cortex sends population-level motor commands that tend to structure according to the ~20 Hz sensorimotor rhythm, and that it dynamically adapts these commands based on the &amp;lt;3 Hz fluctuations of proprioceptive feedback. To our knowledge, this is the first report to give a comprehensive account of how the human brain dynamically handles the flow of proprioceptive information and converts it into appropriate motor command to keep the contraction force steady.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Timing of Reward-Seeking Action Tracks Visually Cued Theta Oscillations in Primary Visual Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/43/10408?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;An emerging body of work challenges the view that primary visual cortex (V1) represents the visual world faithfully. Theta oscillations in the local field potential (LFP) of V1 have been found to convey temporal expectations and, specifically, to express the delay between a visual stimulus and the reward that it portends. We extend this work by showing how these oscillatory states in male, wild-type rats can even relate to the timing of a visually cued reward-seeking behavior. In particular, we show that, with training, high precision and accuracy in behavioral timing tracks the power of these oscillations and the time of action execution covaries with their duration. These LFP oscillations are also intimately related to spiking responses at the single-unit level, which themselves carry predictive timing information. Together, these observations extend our understanding of the role of cortical oscillations in timing generally and the role of V1 in the timing of visually cued behaviors specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Traditionally, primary visual cortex (V1) has been regarded as playing a purely perceptual role in stimulus-driven behaviors. Recent work has challenged that view by showing that theta oscillations in rodent V1 may come to convey timed expectations. Here, we show that these theta oscillations carry predictive information about timed reward-seeking actions, thus elucidating a behavioral role for theta oscillations in V1 and extending our understanding of the role of V1 in decision making.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Interneuronal Network Activity at the Onset of Seizure-Like Events in Entorhinal Cortex Slices</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/43/10398?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/43/10398?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The onset of focal seizures in humans and in different animal models of focal epilepsy correlates with reduction of neuronal firing and enhanced interneuronal network activity. Whether this phenomenon contributes to seizure generation is still unclear. We used the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; entorhinal cortex slices bathed in 4-aminopirydine (4-AP) as an experimental paradigm model to evaluate the correlation between interneuronal GABAergic network activity and seizure-like events. Epileptiform discharges were recorded in layer V–VI pyramidal neurons and fast-spiking interneurons in slices from male and female mice and in the isolated female guinea pig brain preparation during perfusion with 4-AP. We observed that 90% of seizure-like events recorded in principal cells were preceded by outward currents coupled with extracellular potassium shifts, abolished by pharmacological blockade of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. Potassium elevations associated to GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-mediated population events were confirmed in the entorhinal cortex of the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; isolated whole guinea pig brain. Fast-rising and sustained extracellular potassium increases associated to interneuronal network activity consistently preceded the initiation of seizure-like events. We conclude that in the 4-AP seizure model, interneuronal network activity occurs before 4-AP-induced seizures and therefore supports a role of interneuron activity in focal seizure generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The paper focuses on the mechanisms of ictogenesis, a topic that requires a step beyond the simplistic view that seizures, and epilepsy, are due to an increase of excitatory network activity. Focal temporal lobe seizures in humans and in several experimental epilepsies likely correlate with a prevalent activation of interneurons. The potassium channel blocker 4-aminopyridine reliably induces seizure-like events in temporal lobe structures. Herein, we show that a majority of seizures in the entorhinal cortex starts with interneuronal network activity accompanied by a fast and sustained increase in extracellular potassium. Our new findings reinforce and add a new piece of evidence to the proposal that limbic seizures can be supported by GABAergic hyperactivity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Multilevel Functional Study of a SNAP25 At-Risk Variant for Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/43/10389?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The synaptosomal-associated protein SNAP25 is a key player in synaptic vesicle docking and fusion and has been associated with multiple psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. We recently identified a promoter variant in &lt;i&gt;SNAP25&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;rs6039769&lt;/i&gt;, that is associated with early-onset bipolar disorder and a higher gene expression level in human prefrontal cortex. In the current study, we showed that this variant was associated both in males and females with schizophrenia in two independent cohorts. We then combined &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; approaches in humans to understand the functional impact of the at-risk allele. Thus, we showed &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; that the &lt;i&gt;rs6039769&lt;/i&gt; C allele was sufficient to increase the &lt;i&gt;SNAP25&lt;/i&gt; transcription level. In a postmortem expression analysis of 33 individuals affected with schizophrenia and 30 unaffected control subjects, we showed that the &lt;i&gt;SNAP25b&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;SNAP25a&lt;/i&gt; ratio was increased in schizophrenic patients carrying the &lt;i&gt;rs6039769&lt;/i&gt; at-risk allele. Last, using genetics imaging in a cohort of 71 subjects, we showed that male risk carriers had an increased amygdala–ventromedial prefrontal cortex functional connectivity and a larger amygdala than non-risk carriers. The latter association has been replicated in an independent cohort of 121 independent subjects. Altogether, results from these multilevel functional studies are bringing strong evidence for the functional consequences of this allelic variation of &lt;i&gt;SNAP25&lt;/i&gt; on modulating the development and plasticity of the prefrontal–limbic network, which therefore may increase the vulnerability to both early-onset bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Functional characterization of disease-associated variants is a key challenge in understanding neuropsychiatric disorders and will open an avenue in the development of personalized treatments. Recent studies have accumulated evidence that the SNARE complex, and more specifically the SNAP25 protein, may be involved in psychiatric disorders. Here, our multilevel functional studies are bringing strong evidence for the functional consequences of an allelic variation of &lt;i&gt;SNAP25&lt;/i&gt; on modulating the development and plasticity of the prefrontal–limbic network. These results demonstrate a common genetically driven functional alteration of a synaptic mechanism both in schizophrenia and early-onset bipolar disorder and confirm the shared genetic vulnerability between these two disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Serotonin 2B Receptors in Mesoaccumbens Dopamine Pathway Regulate Cocaine Responses</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/43/10372?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Addiction is a maladaptive pattern of behavior following repeated use of reinforcing drugs in predisposed individuals, leading to lifelong changes. Common among these changes are alterations of neurons releasing dopamine in the ventral and dorsal territories of the striatum. The serotonin 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor has been involved in various behaviors, including impulsivity, response to antidepressants, and response to psychostimulants, pointing toward putative interactions with the dopamine system. Despite these findings, it remains unknown whether 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B&lt;/sub&gt; receptors directly modulate dopaminergic activity and the possible mechanisms involved. To answer these questions, we investigated the contribution of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B&lt;/sub&gt; receptors to cocaine-dependent behavioral responses. Male mice permanently lacking 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, even restricted to dopamine neurons, developed heightened cocaine-induced locomotor responses. Retrograde tracing combined with single-cell mRNA amplification indicated that 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B&lt;/sub&gt; receptors are expressed by mesolimbic dopamine neurons. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiological recordings showed that 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B&lt;/sub&gt;-receptor inactivation in dopamine neurons affects their neuronal activity and increases AMPA-mediated over NMDA-mediated excitatory synaptic currents. These changes are associated with lower ventral striatum dopamine activity and blunted cocaine self-administration. These data identify the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor as a pharmacological intermediate and provide mechanistic insight into attenuated dopamine tone following exposure to drugs of abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Here we report that mice lacking 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B&lt;/sub&gt; receptors totally or exclusively in dopamine neurons exhibit heightened cocaine-induced locomotor responses. Despite the sensitized state of these mice, we found that associated changes include lower ventral striatum dopamine activity and lower cocaine operant self-administration. We described the selective expression of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in a subpopulation of dopamine neurons sending axons to the ventral striatum. Increased bursting &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; properties of these dopamine neurons and a concomitant increase in AMPA synaptic transmission to &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; dopamine neurons were found in mice lacking 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. These data support the idea that the chronic 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B&lt;/sub&gt;-receptor inhibition makes mice behave like animals already exposed to cocaine with higher cocaine-induced locomotion associated with changes in dopamine neuron reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Identification of Two Classes of Somatosensory Neurons That Display Resistance to Retrograde Infection by Rabies Virus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/43/10358?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Glycoprotein-deleted rabies virus-mediated monosynaptic tracing has become a standard method for neuronal circuit mapping, and is applied to virtually all parts of the rodent nervous system, including the spinal cord and primary sensory neurons. Here we identified two classes of unmyelinated sensory neurons (nonpeptidergic and C-fiber low-threshold mechanoreceptor neurons) resistant to direct and trans-synaptic infection from the spinal cord with rabies viruses that carry glycoproteins in their envelopes and that are routinely used for infection of CNS neurons (SAD-G and N2C-G). However, the same neurons were susceptible to infection with EnvA-pseudotyped rabies virus in tumor virus A receptor transgenic mice, indicating that resistance to retrograde infection was due to impaired virus adsorption rather than to deficits in subsequent steps of infection. These results demonstrate an important limitation of rabies virus-based retrograde tracing of sensory neurons in adult mice, and may help to better understand the molecular machinery required for rabies virus spread in the nervous system. In this study, mice of both sexes were used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; To understand the neuronal bases of behavior, it is important to identify the underlying neural circuitry. Rabies virus-based monosynaptic tracing has been used to identify neuronal circuits in various parts of the nervous system. This has included connections between peripheral sensory neurons and their spinal targets. These connections form the first synapse in the somatosensory pathway. Here we demonstrate that two classes of unmyelinated sensory neurons, which account for &amp;gt;40% of dorsal root ganglia neurons, display resistance to rabies infection. Our results are therefore critical for interpreting monosynaptic rabies-based tracing in the sensory system. In addition, identification of rabies-resistant neurons might provide a means for future studies addressing rabies pathobiology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Attention to Color Sharpens Neural Population Tuning via Feedback Processing in the Human Visual Cortex Hierarchy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/43/10346?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Attention can facilitate the selection of elementary object features such as color, orientation, or motion. This is referred to as feature-based attention and it is commonly attributed to a modulation of the gain and tuning of feature-selective units in visual cortex. Although gain mechanisms are well characterized, little is known about the cortical processes underlying the sharpening of feature selectivity. Here, we show with high-resolution magnetoencephalography in human observers (men and women) that sharpened selectivity for a particular color arises from feedback processing in the human visual cortex hierarchy. To assess color selectivity, we analyze the response to a color probe that varies in color distance from an attended color target. We find that attention causes an initial gain enhancement in anterior ventral extrastriate cortex that is coarsely selective for the target color and transitions within ~100 ms into a sharper tuned profile in more posterior ventral occipital cortex. We conclude that attention sharpens selectivity over time by attenuating the response at lower levels of the cortical hierarchy to color values neighboring the target in color space. These observations support computational models proposing that attention tunes feature selectivity in visual cortex through backward-propagating attenuation of units less tuned to the target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Whether searching for your car, a particular item of clothing, or just obeying traffic lights, in everyday life, we must select items based on color. But how does attention allow us to select a specific color? Here, we use high spatiotemporal resolution neuromagnetic recordings to examine how color selectivity emerges in the human brain. We find that color selectivity evolves as a coarse to fine process from higher to lower levels within the visual cortex hierarchy. Our observations support computational models proposing that feature selectivity increases over time by attenuating the responses of less-selective cells in lower-level brain areas. These data emphasize that color perception involves multiple areas across a hierarchy of regions, interacting with each other in a complex, recursive manner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Drosophila Neprilysin 1 Rescues Memory Deficits Caused by Amyloid-{beta} Peptide</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/43/10334?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/43/10334?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neprilysins are Type II metalloproteinases known to degrade and inactivate a number of small peptides, in particular the mammalian amyloid-β peptide (Aβ). In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, several neprilysins expressed in the brain are required for middle-term (MTM) and long-term memory (LTM) in the dorsal paired medial (DPM) neurons, a pair of large neurons that broadly innervate the mushroom bodies (MB), the center of olfactory memory. These data indicate that one or several peptides need to be degraded for MTM and LTM. We have previously shown that the fly amyloid precursor protein (APPL) is required for memory in the MB. We show here that APPL is also required in adult DPM neurons for MTM and LTM formation. This finding prompted us to search for an interaction between neprilysins and &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Aβ (dAβ), a cleavage product of APPL. To find out whether dAβ was a neprilysin's target, we used inducible drivers to modulate neprilysin 1 (Nep1) and dAβ expression in adult DPM neurons. Experiments were conducted either in both sexes or in females. We show that Nep1 inhibition makes dAβ expression detrimental to both MTM and LTM. Conversely, memory deficits displayed by dAβ-expressing flies are rescued by Nep1 overexpression. Consistent with behavioral data, biochemical analyses confirmed that Nep1 degrades dAβ. Together, our findings establish that Nep1 and dAβ expressed in DPM neurons are functionally linked for memory processes, suggesting that dAβ is a physiological target for Nep1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neprilysins are endopeptidases known to degrade a number of small peptides and in particular the amyloid peptide. We previously showed that all four neprilysins expressed in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; brain are involved in specific phases of olfactory memory. Here we show that an increase in the level of the neprilysin 1 peptidase overcomes memory deficits induced by amyloid peptide in young flies. Together, the data reveal a functional interaction between neprilysin 1 and amyloid peptide, suggesting that neprilysin 1 degrades amyloid peptide. These findings raise the possibility that, under nonpathological conditions, mammalian neprilysins degrade amyloid peptide to ensure memory formation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Top-Down Modulation of Auditory-Motor Integration during Speech Production: The Role of Working Memory</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/43/10323?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/43/10323?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although working memory (WM) is considered as an emergent property of the speech perception and production systems, the role of WM in sensorimotor integration during speech processing is largely unknown. We conducted two event-related potential experiments with female and male young adults to investigate the contribution of WM to the neurobehavioural processing of altered auditory feedback during vocal production. A delayed match-to-sample task that required participants to indicate whether the pitch feedback perturbations they heard during vocalizations in test and sample sequences matched, elicited significantly larger vocal compensations, larger N1 responses in the left middle and superior temporal gyrus, and smaller P2 responses in the left middle and superior temporal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, somatosensory cortex, right inferior frontal gyrus, and insula compared with a control task that did not require memory retention of the sequence of pitch perturbations. On the other hand, participants who underwent extensive auditory WM training produced suppressed vocal compensations that were correlated with improved auditory WM capacity, and enhanced P2 responses in the left middle frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, right inferior frontal gyrus, and insula that were predicted by pretraining auditory WM capacity. These findings indicate that WM can enhance the perception of voice auditory feedback errors while inhibiting compensatory vocal behavior to prevent voice control from being excessively influenced by auditory feedback. This study provides the first evidence that auditory-motor integration for voice control can be modulated by top-down influences arising from WM, rather than modulated exclusively by bottom-up and automatic processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; One outstanding question that remains unsolved in speech motor control is how the mismatch between predicted and actual voice auditory feedback is detected and corrected. The present study provides two lines of converging evidence, for the first time, that working memory cannot only enhance the perception of vocal feedback errors but also exert inhibitory control over vocal motor behavior. These findings represent a major advance in our understanding of the top-down modulatory mechanisms that support the detection and correction of prediction-feedback mismatches during sensorimotor control of speech production driven by working memory. Rather than being an exclusively bottom-up and automatic process, auditory-motor integration for voice control can be modulated by top-down influences arising from working memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Cross Talk between Neuronal Urokinase-type Plasminogen Activator (uPA) and Astrocytic uPA Receptor (uPAR) Promotes Astrocytic Activation and Synaptic Recovery in the Ischemic Brain</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) is a serine proteinase that, upon binding to its receptor (uPAR), catalyzes the conversion of plasminogen into plasmin on the cell surface. Our previous studies indicate that uPA and uPAR expression increase in the ischemic brain during the recovery phase from an acute ischemic injury and that uPA binding to uPAR promotes neurological recovery after an acute ischemic stroke. Here, we used male mice genetically deficient on either uPA (uPA&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;) or uPAR (uPAR&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;) or with a four-amino acid substitution into the growth factor domain of uPA that abrogates its binding to uPAR (&lt;i&gt;Plat&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;GFDhu/GFDhu&lt;/sup&gt;) to investigate the mechanism whereby uPA promotes neurorepair in the ischemic brain. We found that neurons release uPA and astrocytes recruit uPAR to their plasma membrane during the recovery phase from a hypoxic injury and that binding of neuronal uPA to astrocytic uPAR induces astrocytic activation by a mechanism that does not require plasmin generation, but instead is mediated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)-regulated phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). We report that uPA/uPAR binding is necessary and sufficient to induce astrocytic activation in the ischemic brain and that astrocytes activated by neuronal uPA promote synaptic recovery in neurons that have suffered an acute hypoxic injury via a mechanism mediated by astrocytic thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) and synaptic low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1). In summary, we show that uPA/uPAR-induced astrocytic activation mediates a cross talk between astrocytes and injured neurons that promotes synaptic recovery in the ischemic brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; To date, there is no therapeutic strategy to promote synaptic recovery in the injured brain. Here, we show that neurons release urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and astrocytes recruit the uPA receptor (uPAR) to their plasma membrane during the recovery phase from a hypoxic injury. We found that binding of neuronal uPA to astrocytic uPAR promotes astrocytic activation and that astrocytes activated by uPA–uPAR binding promote synaptic recovery in neurons that have suffered a hypoxic injury by a mechanism that does not require plasmin generation, but instead is mediated by ERK1/2-regulated STAT3 phosphorylation, astrocytic thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) and synaptic low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1). Our work unveils a new biological function for uPA–uPAR as mediator of a neuron–astrocyte cross talk that promotes synaptic recovery in the ischemic brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Chd7 Collaborates with Sox2 to Regulate Activation of Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells after Spinal Cord Injury</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) act as a reservoir of new oligodendrocytes (OLs) in homeostatic and pathological conditions. OPCs are activated in response to injury to generate myelinating OLs, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we show that chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7 (Chd7) regulates OPC activation after spinal cord injury (SCI). Chd7 is expressed in OPCs in the adult spinal cord and its expression is upregulated with a concomitant increase in Sox2 expression after SCI. OPC-specific ablation of Chd7 in injured mice leads to reduced OPC proliferation, the loss of OPC identity, and impaired OPC differentiation. Ablation of Chd7 or Sox2 in cultured OPCs shows similar phenotypes to those observed in &lt;i&gt;Chd7&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mice. Chd7 and Sox2 form a complex in OPCs and bind to the promoters or enhancers of the &lt;i&gt;regulator of cell cycle&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Rgcc&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;protein kinase C&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;PKC&lt;/i&gt;) genes, thereby inducing their expression. The expression of Rgcc and PKC is reduced in the OPCs of the injured &lt;i&gt;Chd7&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mice. In cultured OPCs, overexpression and knock-down of Rgcc or PKC promote and suppress OPC proliferation, respectively. Furthermore, overexpression of both Rgcc and PKC rescues the Chd7 deletion phenotypes. Chd7 is thus a key regulator of OPC activation, in which it cooperates with Sox2 and acts via direct induction of Rgcc and PKC expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to oligodendrocyte (OL) loss and demyelination, along with neuronal death, resulting in impairment of motor or sensory functions. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) activated in response to injury are potential sources of OL replacement and are thought to contribute to remyelination and functional recovery after SCI. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying OPC activation, especially its epigenetic regulation, remain largely unclear. We demonstrate here that the chromatin remodeler chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7 (Chd7) regulates the proliferation and identity of OPCs after SCI. We have further identified regulator of cell cycle (Rgcc) and protein kinase C (PKC) as novel targets of Chd7 for OPC activation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Inhibition of IL-1{beta} Signaling Normalizes NMDA-Dependent Neurotransmission and Reduces Seizure Susceptibility in a Mouse Model of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by prion protein (PrP) misfolding, clinically recognized by cognitive and motor deficits, electroencephalographic abnormalities, and seizures. Its neurophysiological bases are not known. To assess the potential involvement of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) dysfunction, we analyzed NMDA-dependent synaptic plasticity in hippocampal slices from Tg(CJD) mice, which model a genetic form of CJD. Because PrP depletion may result in functional upregulation of NMDARs, we also analyzed PrP knock-out (KO) mice. Long-term potentiation (LTP) at the Schaffer collateral–commissural synapses in the CA1 area of ~100-d-old Tg(CJD) mice was comparable to that of wild-type (WT) controls, but there was an inversion of metaplasticity, with increased GluN2B phosphorylation, which is indicative of enhanced NMDAR activation. Similar but less marked changes were seen in PrP KO mice. At ~300 d of age, the magnitude of LTP increased in Tg(CJD) mice but decreased in PrP KO mice, indicating divergent changes in hippocampal synaptic responsiveness. Tg(CJD) but not PrP KO mice were intrinsically more susceptible than WT controls to focal hippocampal seizures induced by kainic acid. IL-1β-positive astrocytes increased in the Tg(CJD) hippocampus, and blocking IL-1 receptor signaling restored normal synaptic responses and reduced seizure susceptibility. These results indicate that alterations in NMDA-dependent glutamatergic transmission in Tg(CJD) mice do not depend solely on PrP functional loss. Moreover, astrocytic IL-1β plays a role in the enhanced synaptic responsiveness and seizure susceptibility, suggesting that targeting IL-1β signaling may offer a novel symptomatic treatment for CJD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Dementia and myoclonic jerks develop in individuals with Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD), an incurable brain disorder caused by alterations in prion protein structure. These individuals are prone to seizures and have high brain levels of the inflammatory cytokine IL-1β. Here we show that blocking IL-1β receptors with anakinra, the human recombinant form of the endogenous IL-1 receptor antagonist used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, normalizes hippocampal neurotransmission and reduces seizure susceptibility in a CJD mouse model. These results link neuroinflammation to defective neurotransmission and the enhanced susceptibility to seizures in CJD and raise the possibility that targeting IL-1β with clinically available drugs may be beneficial for symptomatic treatment of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neutrophils Are Critical for Myelin Removal in a Peripheral Nerve Injury Model of Wallerian Degeneration</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/43/10258?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/43/10258?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Wallerian degeneration (WD) is considered an essential preparatory stage to the process of axonal regeneration. In the peripheral nervous system, infiltrating monocyte-derived macrophages, which use the chemokine receptor CCR2 to gain entry to injured tissues from the bloodstream, are purportedly necessary for efficient WD. However, our laboratory has previously reported that myelin clearance in the injured sciatic nerve proceeds unhindered in the &lt;i&gt;Ccr2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mouse model. Here, we extensively characterize WD in male &lt;i&gt;Ccr2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice and identify a compensatory mechanism of WD that is facilitated primarily by neutrophils. In response to the loss of CCR2, injured &lt;i&gt;Ccr2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; sciatic nerves demonstrate prolonged expression of neutrophil chemokines, a concomitant extended increase in the accumulation of neutrophils in the nerve, and elevated phagocytosis by neutrophils. Neutrophil depletion substantially inhibits myelin clearance after nerve injury in both male WT and &lt;i&gt;Ccr2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice, highlighting a novel role for these cells in peripheral nerve degeneration that spans genotypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The accepted view in the basic and clinical neurosciences is that the clearance of axonal and myelin debris after a nerve injury is directed primarily by inflammatory CCR2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; macrophages. However, we demonstrate that this clearance is nearly identical in WT and &lt;i&gt;Ccr2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice, and that neutrophils replace CCR2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; macrophages as the primary phagocytic cell. We find that neutrophils play a major role in myelin clearance not only in &lt;i&gt;Ccr2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice but also in WT mice, highlighting their necessity during nerve degeneration in the peripheral nervous system. These degeneration studies may propel improvements in nerve regeneration and draw critical parallels to mechanisms of nerve degeneration and regeneration in the CNS and in the context of peripheral neuropathies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Activity-regulated genes sculpt neural circuits in response to sensory experience. These calcium-sensitive genes generally fall into two categories: transcription factors and proteins that function at synapses. Yet little is known about activity-regulated, cytosolic proteins that transduce signals between the neuronal membrane and the nucleus. Using the visual system as a model, we investigated the role of the activity-regulated, non-canonical Ras-like GTPase Rem2 in vivo. We demonstrate that Rem2-/-mice fail to exhibit normal ocular dominance plasticity during the critical period. At the circuit level, cortical layer 2/3 neurons in Rem2-/- mice show deficits in both postsynaptic scaling up of excitatory synapses and misregulation of intrinsic excitability. Further, we reveal that Rem2 plays a novel, cell-autonomous role in regulating neuronal intrinsic excitability. Thus, Rem2 is a critical regulator of neural circuit function and distinct homeostatic plasticity mechanisms in vivo.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Neural field model to reconcile structure with function in primary visual cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by James Rankin, Frédéric Chavane&lt;/p&gt;

Voltage-sensitive dye imaging experiments in primary visual cortex (V1) have shown that local, oriented visual stimuli elicit stable orientation-selective activation within the stimulus retinotopic footprint. The cortical activation dynamically extends far beyond the retinotopic footprint, but the peripheral spread stays non-selective—a surprising finding given a number of anatomo-functional studies showing the orientation specificity of long-range connections. Here we use a computational model to investigate this apparent discrepancy by studying the expected population response using known published anatomical constraints. The dynamics of input-driven localized states were simulated in a planar neural field model with multiple sub-populations encoding orientation. The realistic connectivity profile has parameters controlling the clustering of long-range connections and their orientation bias. We found substantial overlap between the anatomically relevant parameter range and a steep decay in orientation selective activation that is consistent with the imaging experiments. In this way our study reconciles the reported orientation bias of long-range connections with the functional expression of orientation selective neural activity. Our results demonstrate this sharp decay is contingent on three factors, that long-range connections are sufficiently diffuse, that the orientation bias of these connections is in an intermediate range (consistent with anatomy) and that excitation is sufficiently balanced by inhibition. Conversely, our modelling results predict that, for reduced global inhibition strength, spurious orientation selective activation could be generated through long-range lateral connections. Furthermore, if the orientation bias of lateral connections is very strong, or if inhibition is particularly weak, the network operates close to an instability leading to unbounded cortical activation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AlzACQQ1LC8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Autophagy is a physiological process for the recycling and degradation of cellular materials. Forming the autophagosome from the phagophore, a cup-shaped double-membrane vesicle, is a critical step in autophagy. The origin of the cup shape of the phagophore is poorly understood. In yeast, fusion of a small number of Atg9-containing vesicles is considered a key step in autophagosome biogenesis, aided by Atg1 complexes (ULK1 in mammals) localized at the preautophagosomal structure (PAS). In particular, the S-shaped Atg17-Atg31-Atg29 subcomplex of Atg1 is critical for phagophore nucleation at the PAS. To study this process, we simulated membrane remodeling processes in the presence and absence of membrane associated Atg17. We show that at least three vesicles need to fuse to induce the phagophore shape, consistent with experimental observations. However, fusion alone is not sufficient. Interactions with 34-nm long, S-shaped Atg17 complexes are required to overcome a substantial kinetic barrier in the transition to the cup-shaped phagophore. Our finding rationalizes the recruitment of Atg17 complexes to the yeast PAS, and their unusual shape. In control simulations without Atg17, with weakly binding Atg17, or with straight instead of S-shaped Atg17, the membrane shape transition did not occur. We confirm the critical role of Atg17-membrane interactions experimentally by showing that mutations of putative membrane interaction sites result in reduction or loss of autophagic activity in yeast. Fusion of a small number of vesicles followed by Atg17-guided membrane shape-remodeling thus emerges as a viable route to phagophore formation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Gou_spmEWOQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Identification of immune signatures predictive of clinical protection from malaria</title>

Antibodies are thought to play an essential role in naturally acquired immunity to malaria. Prospective cohort studies have frequently shown how continuous exposure to the malaria parasite &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; cause an accumulation of specific responses against various antigens that correlate with a decreased risk of clinical malaria episodes. However, small effect sizes and the often polymorphic nature of immunogenic parasite proteins make the robust identification of the true targets of protective immunity ambiguous. Furthermore, the degree of individual-level protection conferred by elevated responses to these antigens has not yet been explored. Here we applied a machine learning approach to identify immune signatures predictive of individual-level protection against clinical disease. We find that commonly assumed immune correlates are poor predictors of clinical protection in children. On the other hand, antibody profiles predictive of an individual’s malaria protective status can be found in data comprising responses to a large set of diverse parasite proteins. We show that this pattern emerges only after years of continuous exposure to the malaria parasite, whereas susceptibility to clinical episodes in young hosts (&amp;lt; 10 years) cannot be ascertained by measured antibody responses alone.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/W0AMhkL-UzU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Prediction of HIV-1 sensitivity to broadly neutralizing antibodies shows a trend towards resistance over time</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005789</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Anna Hake, Nico Pfeifer&lt;/p&gt;

Treatment with broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) has proven effective against HIV-1 infections in humanized mice, non-human primates, and humans. Due to the high mutation rate of HIV-1, resistance testing of the patient’s viral strains to the bNAbs is still inevitable. So far, bNAb resistance can only be tested in expensive and time-consuming neutralization experiments. Here, we introduce well-performing computational models that predict the neutralization response of HIV-1 to bNAbs given only the envelope sequence of the virus. Using non-linear support vector machines based on a string kernel, the models learnt even the important binding sites of bNAbs with more complex epitopes, i.e., the CD4 binding site targeting bNAbs, proving thereby the biological relevance of the models. To increase the interpretability of the models, we additionally provide a new kind of motif logo for each query sequence, visualizing those residues of the test sequence that influenced the prediction outcome the most. Moreover, we predicted the neutralization sensitivity of around 34,000 HIV-1 samples from different time points to a broad range of bNAbs, enabling the first analysis of HIV resistance to bNAbs on a global scale. The analysis showed for many of the bNAbs a trend towards antibody resistance over time, which had previously only been discovered for a small non-representative subset of the global HIV-1 population.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CuoAbJcJYyE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Hypothyroidism, a metabolic disease characterized by low thyroid hormone (TH) and high thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in the serum, is strongly associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Hypothyroidism-induced NAFLD has generally been attributed to reduced TH signaling in the liver with a consequent decrease in lipid utilization. Here, we...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/Sy7zN68QrGU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system produce myelin, a lipid-rich, multilamellar sheath that surrounds axons and promotes the rapid propagation of action potentials. A critical component of myelin is myelin basic protein (MBP), expression of which requires anterograde mRNA transport followed by local translation at the developing myelin sheath.

	<description>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) comprises multifactorial ailments for which current therapeutic strategies remain insufficient to broadly address the underlying pathophysiology. Epigenetic gene regulation relies upon multifactorial processes that regulate multiple gene and protein pathways, including those involved in AD.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We seek general principles of the structure of the cellular collective
activity associated with conscious awareness. Can we obtain evidence for
features of the optimal brain organization that allows for adequate processing
of stimuli and that may guide the emergence of cognition and consciousness?
Analysing brain recordings in conscious and unconscious states, we followed
initially the classic approach in physics when it comes to understanding
collective behaviours of systems composed of a myriad of units: the assessment
of the number of possible configurations (microstates) that the system can
adopt, for which we use a global entropic measure associated with the number of
connected brain regions. Having found maximal entropy in conscious states, we
then inspected the microscopic nature of the configurations of connections
using an adequate complexity measure, and found higher complexity in states
characterised not only by conscious awareness but also by subconscious
cognitive processing, such as sleep stages. Our observations indicate that
conscious awareness is associated with maximal global (macroscopic) entropy and
with the short time scale (microscopic) complexity of the configurations of
connected brain networks in pathological unconscious states (seizures and
coma), but the microscopic view captures the high complexity in physiological
unconscious states (sleep) where there is information processing. As such, our
results support the global nature of conscious awareness, as advocated by
several theories of cognition. We thus hope that our studies represent
preliminary steps to reveal aspects of the structure of cognition that leads to
conscious awareness.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Phase Locking Value revisited: teaching new tricks to an old dog. (arXiv:1710.08037v1 [eess.SP])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;When the concept of functional connectivity was first introduced in 1994, the
study of brain synchronization seemed to be an unachievable goal. Yet, the
advances in computer science and the increase in calculation power have allowed
for the application of connectivity metrics to brain activity, first in sensor
level and, over the last years, in source space. However, the study of source
space synchronization is still a tedious task, as the high computational cost
of the algorithm escalates with the square of the number of signals evaluated.
In this work, we take the original implementation of Phase Locking Value (PLV)
and re-formulate it in a highly computational efficient way. This new
implementation avoids some highly CPU-expensive operations, achieving a
100-fold speedup over the original algorithm. This speedup makes possible to
calculate whole-brain connectivity in source space in reasonable times. In
addition, this reformulation presents a strong symmetry with coherence, which
allows the direct comparison of both metrics. In our simulations, both metrics
have a similar behavior. Nonetheless, PLV proves best to evaluate oscillators
over a band, whereas coherence shows similar behavior when the synchronization
occurs at only one frequency. We used this symmetry to introduce two new
derived metrics insensitive to zero lag synchronization, the imaginary part of
PLV (iPLV) and corrected imaginary part of PLV (ciPLV). Our simulations prove
that these metrics, especially ciPLV, are highly robust in the presence of
volume conduction. ciPLV, in particular, proves capable of ignoring zero-lag
connectivity, while correctly estimating nonzero-lag connectivity. These
results suggest that this metric is ideal to measure synchronization in the
presence of volume conduction.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Superposed Episodic and Semantic Memory via Sparse Distributed Representation. (arXiv:1710.07829v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07829</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The abilities to perceive, learn, and use generalities, similarities,
classes, i.e., semantic memory (SM), is central to cognition. Machine learning
(ML), neural network, and AI research has been primarily driven by tasks
requiring such abilities. However, another central facet of cognition,
single-trial formation of permanent memories of experiences, i.e., episodic
memory (EM), has had relatively little focus. Only recently has EM-like
functionality been added to Deep Learning (DL) models, e.g., Neural Turing
Machine, Memory Networks. However, in these cases: a) EM is implemented as a
separate module, which entails substantial data movement (and so, time and
power) between the DL net itself and EM; and b) individual items are stored
localistically within the EM, precluding realizing the exponential
representational efficiency of distributed over localist coding. We describe
Sparsey, an unsupervised, hierarchical, spatial/spatiotemporal associative
memory model differing fundamentally from mainstream ML models, most crucially,
in its use of sparse distributed representations (SDRs), or, cell assemblies,
which admits an extremely efficient, single-trial learning algorithm that maps
input similarity into code space similarity (measured as intersection). SDRs of
individual inputs are stored in superposition and because similarity is
preserved, the patterns of intersections over the assigned codes reflect the
similarity, i.e., statistical, structure, of all orders, not simply pairwise,
over the inputs. Thus, SM, i.e., a generative model, is built as a
computationally free side effect of the act of storing episodic memory traces
of individual inputs, either spatial patterns or sequences. We report initial
results on MNIST and on the Weizmann video event recognition benchmarks. While
we have not yet attained SOTA class accuracy, learning takes only minutes on a
single CPU.

	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07705</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07705</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Posturography is routinely used to qualitatively assess one of the cardinal
symptoms of Parkinson's disease -- postural instability. While most measures of
balance control are derived from displacement of the center of pressure there
is evidence that such control is more likely to be velocity-based. We performed
static posturographic tests (eyes open and eyes closed) during quiet standing
in narrow stance for n=30 patients with Parkinson's disease (PDP) in the ON
state and compared the results with those of n=30 age-matched senior controls
(HSC) and n=60 young controls (HYC). We used differentiator filters to generate
time series of low-frequency fluctuations of sway velocity and calculated their
Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC). With eyes closed, the mediolateral LZC of HSC 0.21
(0.02) was significantly higher than those of HYC 0.19 (0.02) and PDP 0.18
(002). Thus aging and PD have opposite effects on mediolateral LZC which
strongly differentiates between HSC and PDP (92% sensitivity and 87%
specificity).

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07659</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The mathematical model underlying the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF)
expresses neuronal input as a linear combination of synaptic currents. However,
in biology, synapses are not perfect current sources and are thus nonlinear.
Detailed synapse models are based on channel conductances instead of currents,
which require independent handling of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. This,
in particular, significantly affects the influence of inhibitory signals on the
neuronal dynamics. In this technical report we first summarize the relevant
portions of the NEF and conductance-based synapse models. We then discuss a
na\&quot;ive translation between populations of LIF neurons with current- and
conductance-based synapses based on an estimation of an average membrane
potential. Experiments show that this simple approach works relatively well for
feed-forward communication channels, yet performance degrades for NEF networks
describing more complex dynamics, such as integration.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Directed information transmission is paramount for many social, physical, and
biological systems. For neural systems, scientists have studied this problem
under the paradigm of feedforward networks for decades. In most models of
feedforward networks, activity is exclusively driven by excitatory neurons and
the wiring patterns between them, while inhibitory neurons play only a
stabilizing role for the network dynamics. Motivated by recent experimental
discoveries of hippocampal circuitry, cortical circuitry, and the diversity of
inhibitory neurons throughout the brain, here we illustrate that one can
construct such networks even if the connectivity between the excitatory units
in the system remains random. This is achieved by endowing inhibitory nodes
with a more active role in the network. Our findings demonstrate that apparent
feedforward activity can be caused by a much broader network-architectural
basis than often assumed.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Microglial dysfunction as a key pathologic change in adrenomyeloneuropathy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25085</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Mutations in ABCD1 cause the neurodegenerative disease adrenoleukodystrophy, which manifests as the spinal cord axonopathy adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) in nearly all males surviving into adulthood. Microglial dysfunction has long been implicated in pathogenesis of brain disease but its role in the spinal cord is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We assessed spinal cord microglia in humans and mice with AMN and investigated the role of ABCD1 in microglial activity toward neuronal phagocytosis in cell culture. As mutations in ABCD1 lead to incorporation of very long chain fatty acids into phospholipids, we separately examined the effects of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) upon microglia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Within the spinal cord of humans and mice with AMN, upregulation of several phagocytosis-related markers such as MFGE8 and TREM2 precedes complement activation and synapse loss. Unexpectedly, this occurs in the absence of overt inflammation. LPC C26:0 added to ABCD1-deficient microglia in culture further enhances MFGE8 expression, aggravates phagocytosis and leads to neuronal injury. Furthermore, exposure to a MFGE8 blocking antibody reduces phagocytic activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Spinal cord microglia lacking ABCD1 are primed for phagocytosis, affecting neurons within an altered metabolic milieu. Blocking phagocytosis or specific phagocytic receptors may alleviate synapse loss and axonal degeneration. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Stimulation of the mesencephalic locomotor region for gait recovery after stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25086</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: One-third of all stroke survivors are unable to walk, even after intensive physiotherapy. Thus, other concepts to restore walking are needed. Since electrical stimulation of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) is known to elicit gait movements, this area might be a promising target for restorative neurostimulation in stroke patients with gait disability. The present study aims to delineate the effect of high-frequency stimulation of the MLR (MLR-HFS) on gait impairment in a rodent stroke model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Male Wistar rats underwent photothrombotic stroke of the right sensorimotor cortex and chronic implantation of a stimulating electrode into the right MLR. Gait was assessed using clinical scoring of the beam walking test and videokinematic analysis (CatWalk™) at baseline and on days 3 and 4 after experimental stroke with and without MLR-HFS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Kinematic analysis revealed significant changes in several dynamic and static gait parameters resulting in overall reduced gait velocity. All rats exhibited major coordination deficits during the beam walking challenge and were unable to cross the beam. Simultaneous to the onset of MLR-HFS, a significantly higher walking speed and improvements in several dynamic gait parameters were detected by the Catwalk™-system. Rats regained the ability to cross the beam unassisted showing a reduced number of paw slips and misses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: MLR-HFS can improve disordered locomotor function in a rodent stroke model. It may act by shielding brainstem and spinal locomotor centers from abnormal cortical input after stroke, thus allowing for compensatory and independent action of these circuits.

Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) constitutes a global health burden. Efforts to uncover predisposing genetic variation have been considerable, yet detailed knowledge of the underlying pathogenesis remains poor. Here, we constructed a T2D phenotypic-linkage network (T2D-PLN), by integrating diverse gene functional information that highlight genes, which when disrupted in mice, elicit similar T2D-relevant phenotypes. Sensitising the network to T2D-relevant phenotypes enabled significant functional convergence to be detected between genes implicated in monogenic or syndromic diabetes and genes lying within genomic regions associated with T2D common risk. We extended these analyses to a recent multiethnic T2D case-control exome of 12,940 individuals that found no evidence of T2D risk association for rare frequency variants outside of previously known T2D risk loci. Examining associations involving protein-truncating variants (PTV), most at low population frequencies, the T2D-PLN was able to identify a convergent set of biological pathways that were perturbed within four of five independent T2D case/control ethnic sets of 2000 to 5000 exomes each. These same pathways were found to be over-represented among both known monogenic or syndromic diabetes genes and genes within T2D-associated common risk loci. Our study demonstrates convergent biology amongst variants representing different classes of T2D genetic risk. Although convergence was observed at the pathway level, few of the contributing genes were found in common between different cohorts or variant classes, most notably between the exome variant sets which suggests that future rare variant studies may be better focusing their power onto a single population of recent common ancestry.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uL3g2LDd_uc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

With increasing appreciation for the extent and importance of intratumor heterogeneity, much attention in cancer research has focused on profiling heterogeneity on a single patient level. Although true single-cell genomic technologies are rapidly improving, they remain too noisy and costly at present for population-level studies. Bulk sequencing remains the standard for population-scale tumor genomics, creating a need for computational tools to separate contributions of multiple tumor clones and assorted stromal and infiltrating cell populations to pooled genomic data. All such methods are limited to coarse approximations of only a few cell subpopulations, however. In prior work, we demonstrated the feasibility of improving cell type deconvolution by taking advantage of substructure in genomic mixtures via a strategy called simplicial complex unmixing. We improve on past work by introducing enhancements to automate learning of substructured genomic mixtures, with specific emphasis on genome-wide copy number variation (CNV) data, as well as the ability to process quantitative RNA expression data, and heterogeneous combinations of RNA and CNV data. We introduce methods for dimensionality estimation to better decompose mixture model substructure; fuzzy clustering to better identify substructure in sparse, noisy data; and automated model inference methods for other key model parameters. We further demonstrate their effectiveness in identifying mixture substructure in true breast cancer CNV data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

There is growing interest in studying and engineering integral membrane proteins (MPs) that play key roles in sensing and regulating cellular response to diverse external signals. A MP must be expressed, correctly inserted and folded in a lipid bilayer, and trafficked to the proper cellular location in order to function. The sequence and structural determinants of these processes are complex and highly constrained. Here we describe a predictive, machine-learning approach that captures this complexity to facilitate successful MP engineering and design. Machine learning on carefully-chosen training sequences made by structure-guided SCHEMA recombination has enabled us to accurately predict the rare sequences in a diverse library of channelrhodopsins (ChRs) that express and localize to the plasma membrane of mammalian cells. These light-gated channel proteins of microbial origin are of interest for neuroscience applications, where expression and localization to the plasma membrane is a prerequisite for function. We trained Gaussian process (GP) classification and regression models with expression and localization data from 218 ChR chimeras chosen from a 118,098-variant library designed by SCHEMA recombination of three parent ChRs. We use these GP models to identify ChRs that express and localize well and show that our models can elucidate sequence and structure elements important for these processes. We also used the predictive models to convert a naturally occurring ChR incapable of mammalian localization into one that localizes well.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gj1Kwu8MDXg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

A central goal of cognitive neuroscience is to decode human brain activity—that is, to infer mental processes from observed patterns of whole-brain activation. Previous decoding efforts have focused on classifying brain activity into a small set of discrete cognitive states. To attain maximal utility, a decoding framework must be open-ended, systematic, and context-sensitive—that is, capable of interpreting numerous brain states, presented in arbitrary combinations, in light of prior information. Here we take steps towards this objective by introducing a probabilistic decoding framework based on a novel topic model—Generalized Correspondence Latent Dirichlet Allocation—that learns latent topics from a database of over 11,000 published fMRI studies. The model produces highly interpretable, spatially-circumscribed topics that enable flexible decoding of whole-brain images. Importantly, the Bayesian nature of the model allows one to “seed” decoder priors with arbitrary images and text—enabling researchers, for the first time, to generate quantitative, context-sensitive interpretations of whole-brain patterns of brain activity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dibFMIfhdCo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective&lt;/em&gt;: We aimed to 1) assess the concordance between various PMG types and the associated epileptogenic zone (EZ), as defined by stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG), and 2) determine the postsurgical seizure outcome in PMG-related drug-resistant epilepsy. &lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;: We retrospectively analyzed 58 cases: 49 had SEEG and 39 corticectomy or hemispherotomy. &lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;: Mean age at SEEG or surgery was 28.3 years (range 2-50). PMG was bilateral in 9 (16%) patients and unilateral in 49, including 17 (29%) unilobar, 12 (21%) multilobar, 15 (26%) perisylvian, and only 5 (9%) hemispheric. Twenty-eight (48%) patients additionally had schizencephaly, heterotopia or focal cortical dysplasia. The SEEG-determined EZ was fully concordant with the PMG in only 8 (16%) cases, partially concordant in 74% and discordant in 10%. The EZ included remote cortical areas in 21 (43%) cases and was primarily localized in those in 5 (10%), all related to the mesial temporal structures. All but one PMG patients with corticectomy or hemispherotomy had a unilateral PMG. At last follow-up (mean 4.6 years, range 1-16), 28 (72%) patients remained seizure free. Shorter epilepsy duration to surgery was an independent predictor of seizure freedom. &lt;em&gt;Interpretation&lt;/em&gt;: PMG-related drug-resistant epilepsy warrants a comprehensive presurgical evaluation, including SEEG investigations in most cases, since the EZ may only partially overlap with the PMG or include solely remote cortical areas. Seizure freedom is feasible in a large proportion of patients. PMG extent should not deter from exploring the possibility of epilepsy surgery. Our data support the early consideration of epilepsy surgery in this patient group. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Differential diagnosis of autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias can be challenging. A ranking algorithm that predicts the molecular diagnosis based on the clinical phenotype of a patient has been developed to guide genetic testing and to align genetic findings with the clinical context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: An algorithm that follows clinical practice, including patient history, clinical, MRI, electromyography and biomarker features, was developed following a review of the literature on 67 autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias and personal clinical experience. Frequency and specificity of each feature were defined for each autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia, and corresponding prediction scores assigned. Clinical and paraclinical features of patients are entered into the algorithm, and a patient's total score for each autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia is calculated, producing a ranking of possible diagnoses. Sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm were assessed by blinded analysis of a multinational cohort of 834 patients with molecularly confirmed autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia. The performance of the algorithm was assessed versus a blinded panel of autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: The correct diagnosis was ranked within the top 3 highest-scoring diagnoses at a sensitivity or specificity of &amp;gt;90% for 84% and 91% of the evaluated genes, respectively. Mean sensitivity and specificity of the top 3 highest-scoring diagnoses were 92% and 95%, respectively. The algorithm outperformed the panel of ataxia experts (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Our algorithm is highly sensitive and specific, accurately predicting the underlying molecular diagnoses of autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias, thereby guiding targeted sequencing or facilitating interpretation of next-generation sequencing data.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Molecular-based diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis and its progressive stage</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25083</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Biomarkers aid diagnosis, allow inexpensive screening of therapies and guide selection of patient-specific therapeutic regimens in most internal medicine disciplines. In contrast, neurology lacks validated measurements of the physiological status, or dysfunction(s) of cells of the central nervous system (CNS). Accordingly, patients with chronic neurological diseases are often treated with a single disease-modifying therapy without understanding patient-specific drivers of disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, using multiple sclerosis (MS) as an example of a complex polygenic neurological disease, we sought to determine if cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers are intra-individually stable, cell type-, disease- and/or process-specific and responsive to therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We used statistical learning in a modeling cohort (n=225) to develop diagnostic classifiers from DNA-aptamer-based measurements of 1128 CSF proteins. An independent validation cohort (n=85) assessed the reliability of derived classifiers. The biological interpretation resulted from in-vitro modeling of primary or stem cell-derived human CNS cells and cell lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: The classifier that differentiates MS from CNS diseases that mimic MS clinically, pathophysiologically and on imaging, achieved a validated area under receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.98, while the classifier that differentiates relapsing-remitting from progressive MS achieved a validated AUROC of 0.91. No classifiers could differentiate primary- from secondary-progressive MS better than random guessing. Treatment-induced changes in biomarkers greatly exceeded intra-individual- and technical variabilities of the assay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: CNS biological processes reflected by CSF biomarkers are robust, stable, and disease- or even disease-stage specific. This opens opportunities for broad utilization of CSF biomarkers in drug development and precision medicine for CNS disorders. This article is protected by copyright.

We compared in vivo &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flortaucipir uptake in patients meeting clinical research criteria for PSP (n = 33) to normal controls (n = 46) and patients meeting criteria for Parkinson disease (PD; n = 26).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25060-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography for amyloid-β (&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C-PiB or &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-florbetapir) and tau (&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flortaucipir). &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flortaucipir standardized uptake value ratios were calculated (&lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; = 80–100 minutes, cerebellum gray matter reference). Voxelwise and region-of-interest group comparisons were performed in template space, with receiver operating characteristic curve analyses to assess single-subject discrimination. Qualitative comparisons with postmortem tau are reported in 1 patient who died 9 months after &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flortaucipir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25060-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical PSP patients showed bilaterally elevated &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flortaucipir uptake in globus pallidus, putamen, subthalamic nucleus, midbrain, and dentate nucleus relative to controls and PD patients (voxelwise &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05 family wise error corrected). Globus pallidus binding best distinguished PSP patients from controls and PD (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.872 vs controls, AUC = 0.893 vs PD). PSP clinical severity did not correlate with &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flortaucipir in any region. A patient with clinical PSP and pathological diagnosis of corticobasal degeneration had severe tau pathology in PSP-related brain structures with good correspondence between in vivo &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flortaucipir and postmortem tau neuropathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Quantum field inspired model of decision making: Asymptotic stabilization of belief state via interaction with surrounding mental environment. (arXiv:1710.07613v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07613</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07613</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper is devoted to justification of quantum-like models of the process
of decision making based on the theory of open quantum systems, i.e. decision
making is considered as decoherence. This process is modeled as interaction of
a decision maker, Alice, with a mental (information) environment ${\cal R}$
surrounding her. Such an interaction generates &quot;dissipation of uncertainty&quot;
from Alice's belief-state $\rho(t)$ into ${\cal R}$ and asymptotic
stabilization of $\rho(t)$ to a steady belief-state. The latter is treated as
the decision state. Mathematically the problem under study is about finding
constraints on ${\cal R}$ guaranteeing such stabilization. We found a partial
solution of this problem (in the form of sufficient conditions). We present the
corresponding decision making analysis for one class of mental environments,
the so-called &quot;almost homogeneous environments&quot;, with the illustrative
examples: a) behavior of electorate interacting with the mass-media
&quot;reservoir&quot;, b) consumers' persuasion. We also comment on other classes of
mental environments.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Spoken Language Biomarkers for Detecting Cognitive Impairment. (arXiv:1710.07551v1 [cs.AI])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07551</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07551</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this study we developed an automated system that evaluates speech and
language features from audio recordings of neuropsychological examinations of
92 subjects in the Framingham Heart Study. A total of 265 features were used in
an elastic-net regularized binomial logistic regression model to classify the
presence of cognitive impairment, and to select the most predictive features.
We compared performance with a demographic model from 6,258 subjects in the
greater study cohort (0.79 AUC), and found that a system that incorporated both
audio and text features performed the best (0.92 AUC), with a True Positive
Rate of 29% (at 0% False Positive Rate) and a good model fit (Hosmer-Lemeshow
test &amp;gt; 0.05). We also found that decreasing pitch and jitter, shorter segments
of speech, and responses phrased as questions were positively associated with
cognitive impairment.

	<description>The brain changes as we age and these changes are associated with functional deterioration and neurodegenerative disease. It is vital that we better understand individual differences in the brain ageing process; hence, techniques for making individualised predictions of brain ageing have been developed. We present evidence supporting the use of neuroimaging-based ‘brain age’ as a biomarker of an individual’s brain health. Increasingly, research is showing how brain disease or poor physical health negatively impacts brain age.</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Individuals, Institutions, and Innovation in the Debates of the French Revolution. (arXiv:1710.06867v1 [physics.soc-ph])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06867</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06867</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The French Revolution brought principles of &quot;liberty, equality, and
brotherhood&quot; to bear on the day-to-day challenges of governing what was then
the largest country in Europe. Its experiments provided a model for future
revolutions and democracies across the globe, but this first modern revolution
had no model to follow. Using reconstructed transcripts of debates held in the
Revolution's first parliament, we present a quantitative analysis of how this
system managed innovation. We use information theory to track the creation,
transmission, and destruction of patterns of word-use across over 40,000
speeches and more than one thousand speakers. The parliament as a whole was
biased toward the adoption of new patterns, but speakers' individual qualities
could break these overall trends. Speakers on the left innovated at higher
rates while speakers on the right acted, often successfully, to preserve prior
patterns. Key players such as Robespierre (on the left) and Abb\'e Maury (on
the right) played information-processing roles emblematic of their politics.
Newly-created organizational functions---such as the Assembly's President and
committee chairs---had significant effects on debate outcomes, and a distinct
transition appears mid-way through the parliament when committees, external to
the debate process, gain new powers to &quot;propose and dispose&quot; to the body as a
whole. Taken together, these quantitative results align with existing
qualitative interpretations but also reveal crucial information-processing
dynamics that have hitherto been overlooked. Great orators had the public's
attention, but deputies (mostly on the political left) who mastered the
committee system gained new powers to shape revolutionary legislation.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Distinct prediction errors in mesostriatal circuits of the human brain mediate learning about the values of both states and actions: evidence from high-resolution fMRI</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005810</guid>

Prediction-error signals consistent with formal models of “reinforcement learning” (RL) have repeatedly been found within dopaminergic nuclei of the midbrain and dopaminoceptive areas of the striatum. However, the precise form of the RL algorithms implemented in the human brain is not yet well determined. Here, we created a novel paradigm optimized to dissociate the subtypes of reward-prediction errors that function as the key computational signatures of two distinct classes of RL models—namely, “actor/critic” models and action-value-learning models (e.g., the Q-learning model). The state-value-prediction error (SVPE), which is independent of actions, is a hallmark of the actor/critic architecture, whereas the action-value-prediction error (AVPE) is the distinguishing feature of action-value-learning algorithms. To test for the presence of these prediction-error signals in the brain, we scanned human participants with a high-resolution functional magnetic-resonance imaging (fMRI) protocol optimized to enable measurement of neural activity in the dopaminergic midbrain as well as the striatal areas to which it projects. In keeping with the actor/critic model, the SVPE signal was detected in the substantia nigra. The SVPE was also clearly present in both the ventral striatum and the dorsal striatum. However, alongside these purely state-value-based computations we also found evidence for AVPE signals throughout the striatum. These high-resolution fMRI findings suggest that model-free aspects of reward learning in humans can be explained algorithmically with RL in terms of an actor/critic mechanism operating in parallel with a system for more direct action-value learning.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/U1RXkdLa_Aw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Quantifying the strength of quorum sensing crosstalk within microbial communities</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005809</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Kalinga Pavan T. Silva, Prithiviraj Chellamuthu, James Q. Boedicker&lt;/p&gt;

In multispecies microbial communities, the exchange of signals such as acyl-homoserine lactones (AHL) enables communication within and between species of Gram-negative bacteria. This process, commonly known as quorum sensing, aids in the regulation of genes crucial for the survival of species within heterogeneous populations of microbes. Although signal exchange was studied extensively in well-mixed environments, less is known about the consequences of crosstalk in spatially distributed mixtures of species. Here, signaling dynamics were measured in a spatially distributed system containing multiple strains utilizing homologous signaling systems. Crosstalk between strains containing the &lt;i&gt;lux&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;las&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;rhl&lt;/i&gt; AHL-receptor circuits was quantified. In a distributed population of microbes, the impact of community composition on spatio-temporal dynamics was characterized and compared to simulation results using a modified reaction-diffusion model. After introducing a single term to account for crosstalk between each pair of signals, the model was able to reproduce the activation patterns observed in experiments. We quantified the robustness of signal propagation in the presence of interacting signals, finding that signaling dynamics are largely robust to interference. The ability of several wild isolates to participate in AHL-mediated signaling was investigated, revealing distinct signatures of crosstalk for each species. Our results present a route to characterize crosstalk between species and predict systems-level signaling dynamics in multispecies communities.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/a4Fhw6RTNQ8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Deconvolving sequence features that discriminate between overlapping regulatory annotations</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Akshay Kakumanu, Silvia Velasco, Esteban Mazzoni, Shaun Mahony&lt;/p&gt;

Genomic loci with regulatory potential can be annotated with various properties. For example, genomic sites bound by a given transcription factor (TF) can be divided according to whether they are proximal or distal to known promoters. Sites can be further labeled according to the cell types and conditions in which they are active. Given such a collection of labeled sites, it is natural to ask what sequence features are associated with each annotation label. However, discovering such label-specific sequence features is often confounded by overlaps between the labels; e.g. if regulatory sites specific to a given cell type are also more likely to be promoter-proximal, it is difficult to assess whether motifs identified in that set of sites are associated with the cell type or associated with promoters. In order to meet this challenge, we developed SeqUnwinder, a principled approach to deconvolving interpretable discriminative sequence features associated with overlapping annotation labels. We demonstrate the novel analysis abilities of SeqUnwinder using three examples. Firstly, SeqUnwinder is able to unravel sequence features associated with the dynamic binding behavior of TFs during motor neuron programming from features associated with chromatin state in the initial embryonic stem cells. Secondly, we characterize distinct sequence properties of multi-condition and cell-specific TF binding sites after controlling for uneven associations with promoter proximity. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of SeqUnwinder to discover cell-specific sequence features from over one hundred thousand genomic loci that display DNase I hypersensitivity in one or more ENCODE cell lines.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AwU73jNUxzw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Unmet needs for analyzing biological big data: A survey of 704 NSF principal investigators</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Lindsay Barone, Jason Williams, David Micklos&lt;/p&gt;

In a 2016 survey of 704 National Science Foundation (NSF) Biological Sciences Directorate principal investigators (BIO PIs), nearly 90% indicated they are currently or will soon be analyzing large data sets. BIO PIs considered a range of computational needs important to their work, including high performance computing (HPC), bioinformatics support, multistep workflows, updated analysis software, and the ability to store, share, and publish data. Previous studies in the United States and Canada emphasized infrastructure needs. However, BIO PIs said the most pressing unmet needs are training in data integration, data management, and scaling analyses for HPC—acknowledging that data science skills will be required to build a deeper understanding of life. This portends a growing data knowledge gap in biology and challenges institutions and funding agencies to redouble their support for computational training in biology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Dfm4xpI2oyE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Seasonality in risk of pandemic influenza emergence</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Spencer J. Fox, Joel C. Miller, Lauren Ancel Meyers&lt;/p&gt;

Influenza pandemics can emerge unexpectedly and wreak global devastation. However, each of the six pandemics since 1889 emerged in the Northern Hemisphere just after the flu season, suggesting that pandemic timing may be predictable. Using a stochastic model fit to seasonal flu surveillance data from the United States, we find that seasonal flu leaves a transient wake of heterosubtypic immunity that impedes the emergence of novel flu viruses. This refractory period provides a simple explanation for not only the spring-summer timing of historical pandemics, but also early increases in pandemic severity and multiple waves of transmission. Thus, pandemic risk may be seasonal and predictable, with the accuracy of pre-pandemic and real-time risk assessments hinging on reliable seasonal influenza surveillance and precise estimates of the breadth and duration of heterosubtypic immunity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zp16YclDt28&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Classification and Geometry of General Perceptual Manifolds. (arXiv:1710.06487v1 [cond-mat.dis-nn])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Perceptual manifolds arise when a neural population responds to an ensemble
of sensory signals associated with different physical features (e.g.,
orientation, pose, scale, location, and intensity) of the same perceptual
object. Object recognition and discrimination requires classifying the
manifolds in a manner that is insensitive to variability within a manifold. How
neuronal systems give rise to invariant object classification and recognition
is a fundamental problem in brain theory as well as in machine learning. Here
we study the ability of a readout network to classify objects from their
perceptual manifold representations. We develop a statistical mechanical theory
for the linear classification of manifolds with arbitrary geometry revealing a
remarkable relation to the mathematics of conic decomposition. Novel
geometrical measures of manifold radius and manifold dimension are introduced
which can explain the classification capacity for manifolds of various
geometries. The general theory is demonstrated on a number of representative
manifolds, including L2 ellipsoids prototypical of strictly convex manifolds,
L1 balls representing polytopes consisting of finite sample points, and
orientation manifolds which arise from neurons tuned to respond to a continuous
angle variable, such as object orientation. The effects of label sparsity on
the classification capacity of manifolds are elucidated, revealing a scaling
relation between label sparsity and manifold radius. Theoretical predictions
are corroborated by numerical simulations using recently developed algorithms
to compute maximum margin solutions for manifold dichotomies. Our theory and
its extensions provide a powerful and rich framework for applying statistical
mechanics of linear classification to data arising from neuronal responses to
object stimuli, as well as to artificial deep networks trained for object
recognition tasks.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Topological Schemas of Memory Spaces. (arXiv:1710.05967v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal cognitive map---a neuronal representation of the spatial
environment---is broadly discussed in the computational neuroscience literature
for decades. More recent studies point out that hippocampus plays a major role
in producing yet another cognitive framework that incorporates not only
spatial, but also nonspatial memories---the memory space. However, unlike
cognitive maps, memory spaces have been barely studied from a theoretical
perspective. Here we propose an approach for modeling hippocampal memory spaces
as an epiphenomenon of neuronal spiking activity. First, we suggest that the
memory space may be viewed as a finite topological space---a hypothesis that
allows treating both spatial and nonspatial aspects of hippocampal function on
equal footing. We then model the topological properties of the memory space to
demonstrate that this concept naturally incorporates the notion of a cognitive
map. Lastly, we suggest a formal description of the memory consolidation
process and point out a connection between the proposed model of the memory
spaces to the so-called Morris' schemas, which emerge as the most compact
representation of the memory structure.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Rats optimally accumulate and discount evidence in a dynamic environment. (arXiv:1710.05945v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05945</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;How choices are made within noisy environments is a central question in the
neuroscience of decision making. Previous work has characterized temporal
accumulation of evidence for decision-making in static environments. However,
real-world decision-making involves environments with statistics that change
over time. This requires discounting old evidence that may no longer inform the
current state of the world. Here we designed a rat behavioral task with a
dynamic environment, to probe whether rodents can optimally discount evidence
by adapting the timescale over which they accumulate it. Extending existing
results about optimal inference in a dynamic environment, we show that the
optimal timescale for evidence discounting depends on both the stimulus
statistics and noise in sensory processing. We found that when both of these
components were taken into account, rats accumulated and temporally discounted
evidence almost optimally. Furthermore, we found that by changing the dynamics
of the environment, experimenters could control the rats' accumulation
timescale, switching them from accumulating over short timescales to
accumulating over long timescales and back. The theoretical framework also
makes quantitative predictions regarding the timing of changes of mind in the
dynamic environment. This study establishes a quantitative behavioral framework
to control and investigate neural mechanisms underlying the adaptive nature of
evidence accumulation timescales and changes of mind.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A complete mean-field theory for dynamics of binary recurrent neural networks. (arXiv:1701.07128v2 [physics.bio-ph] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07128</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07128</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We develop a unified theory that encompasses the macroscopic dynamics of
recurrent interactions of binary units within arbitrary network architectures.
Using the martingale theory, our mathematical analysis provides a complete
description of nonequilibrium fluctuations in networks with finite size and
finite degree of interactions. Our approach allows the investigation of systems
for which a deterministic mean-field theory breaks down. To demonstrate this,
we uncover a novel dynamic state in which a recurrent network of binary units
with statistically inhomogeneous interactions, along with an asynchronous
behavior, also exhibits collective nontrivial stochastic fluctuations in the
thermodynamical limit.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Correlated microtiming deviations in jazz and rock music. (arXiv:1710.05608v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05608</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05608</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Musical rhythms performed by humans typically show temporal fluctuations.
While they have been characterized in simple rhythmic tasks, it is an open
question what is the nature of temporal fluctuations, when several musicians
perform music jointly in all its natural complexity. To study such fluctuations
in over 100 original jazz and rock/pop recordings played with and without
metronome we developed a semi-automated workflow allowing the extraction of
cymbal beat onsets with millisecond precision. Analyzing the inter-beat
interval (IBI) time series revealed evidence for two long-range correlated
processes characterized by power laws in the IBI power spectral densities. One
process dominates on short timescales ($t &amp;lt; 8$ beats) and reflects microtiming
variability in the generation of single beats. The other dominates on longer
timescales and reflects slow tempo variations. Whereas the latter did not show
differences between musical genres (jazz vs. rock/pop), the process on short
timescales showed higher variability for jazz recordings, indicating that jazz
makes stronger use of microtiming fluctuations within a measure than rock/pop.
Our results elucidate principles of rhythmic performance and can inspire
algorithms for artificial music generation. By studying microtiming
fluctuations in original music recordings, we bridge the gap between
minimalistic tapping paradigms and expressive rhythmic performances.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Activation of planarian TRPA1 by reactive oxygen species reveals a conserved mechanism for animal nociception&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature Neuroscience, Published online: 16 October 2017; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-017-0005-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-017-0005-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animals must detect noxious stimuli to initiate protective behavior, but the evolutionary origin of nociceptive systems is poorly understood. The authors reveal a core function for TRPA1 in noxious heat transduction based on sensing H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ROS and demonstrate its conservation from planarians to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/ElW5YkvsSA0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thalamic inhibition regulates critical-period plasticity in visual cortex and thalamus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature Neuroscience, Published online: 16 October 2017; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-017-0002-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-017-0002-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The critical period of ocular dominance (OD) plasticity in the visual cortex is initiated by maturation of inhibition. The authors show that thalamic relay neurons in mouse dorsolateral geniculate nucleus also undergo OD plasticity. This process depends on thalamic inhibition and is required for consolidating the OD shift in visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/sWotsWoliwo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Neuron: Differential Regulation of Evoked and Spontaneous Release by Presynaptic NMDA Receptors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30874-7?rss=yes</guid>
	<link>http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30874-7?rss=yes</link>
	<description>A long-standing question has been how presynaptic NMDA receptors influence high-frequency evoked neurotransmission but spontaneous release at low rates. Providing resolution, Abrahamsson et al. show that these receptors regulate evoked and spontaneous release via distinct RIM1αβ- and JNK2-dependent mechanisms, respectively.</description>

	<title>Neuron: Exciting Times Ahead</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30929-7?rss=yes</guid>
	<link>http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30929-7?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Neuroscience as a broad and growing discipline encompasses many fields of study, from molecular to systems-level, including cognitive and theoretical domains. These are exciting times for neuroscience, when many of these traditionally separate efforts are beginning to converge, and one can envision the day we may be able to respond to some fundamental questions, such as how molecules, cells, and circuits interplay to make us feel, act, and ultimately understand who we are. I am delighted to be the new Editor-in-Chief of Neuron, whose mission is to continue to disseminate the highest quality work in neuroscience.</description>

	<title>Neuron: Nuclear Pore Protein Meets Transcription Factor in Neural Fate</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30928-5?rss=yes</guid>
	<link>http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30928-5?rss=yes</link>
	<description>How nuclear architecture contributes to transcriptional regulation in neural progenitor cells (NeuPCs) is poorly understood. A study by Toda et al. (2017) now shows that the nuclear pore protein Nup153 associates with the Sox2 transcription factor in the regulation of NeuPC maintenance and neural fate.</description>

	<link>http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30922-4?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Astrocytes are important regulators of synapse formation. Farhy-Tselnicker et al. identify the molecular pathway of active neuronal synapse formation induced by astrocyte-secreted glypican 4. These data functionally link astrocytes to signaling cascades activated in both pre- and postsynaptic neurons.</description>

	<link>http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30918-2?rss=yes</link>
	<description>In this issue, Loonis et al. provide the first description of unique synchrony patterns differentiating implicit and explicit forms of learning in monkey prefrontal networks. Their results have broad implications for how prefrontal networks integrate the two learning mechanisms to control behavior.</description>

	<link>http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30917-0?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Barack et al. report that foraging salience motivated strategic disengagement in two distinct tasks. Posterior cingulate neurons preferentially signaled salience and forecast divergent choices when reward rates were low, suggesting a role in the strategic control of behavior.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Making Dopamine Connections in Adolescence</title>

	<description>A dramatic maturational process ongoing in adolescence is prefrontal cortex development, including its dopamine innervation. Dopamine axons grow from the striatum to the prefrontal cortex, the only known case of long-distance axon growth during adolescence. This is coordinated by the Netrin-1 guidance cue receptor DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer), which in turn controls the intrinsic development of the prefrontal cortex itself. Stimulant drugs in adolescence alter DCC in dopamine neurons and, in turn prefrontal cortex maturation, impacting cognitive abilities.</description>

	<description>The hippocampus community, and the wider groups of neuroscientists studying learning and memory, were shocked to learn of the sudden and unexpected death of Dr Howard Eichenbaum on 21 July 2017. An immensely respected and well-liked figure, Howard made major contributions to our understanding of the neurobiology of memory at a systems level. In addition to his scientific contributions, he was also a diligent member and steward of the neuroscience community as Editor of the journal Hippocampus and in many other ways.</description>

	<description>Inhibitory interneurons comprise a diverse subpopulation of cells that are critical to circuit function. How distinct inhibitory microcircuits control long-range projections remains poorly understood. A recent study by Lu and colleagues uncovered a unidirectional microcircuit of prefrontal chandelier cells that preferentially innervate and suppress long-range amygdala-projecting pyramidal cells.</description>

	<description>Self representation is fundamental to mental functions. While the self has mostly been studied in traditional psychophilosophical terms (‘self as subject’), recent laboratory work suggests that the self can be measured quantitatively by assessing biases towards self-associated stimuli (‘self as object’). Here, we summarize new quantitative paradigms for assessing the self, drawn from psychology, neuroeconomics, embodied cognition, and social neuroscience. We then propose a neural model of the self as an emerging property of interactions between a core ‘self network’ (e.g., medial prefrontal cortex; mPFC), a cognitive control network [e.g., dorsolateral (dl)PFC], and a salience network (e.g., insula).</description>

Silencing these interneurons following fear memory extinction caused a reemergence of fear expression that was accompanied by increased activation of fear-encoding neurons and fear-associated 3–6 Hz oscillations within a basolateral amygdala–prefrontal cortex circuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/xDjGd1BX3zU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Here we rely on recent genetic and cellular findings to construct a model proposing that traffic jams in the early endosome can act as an upstream pathogenic hub in AD. We also rely on an independent series of findings to suggest how the traffic jams can act as a unified mediator of downstream pathophysiology. The model predicts, therefore, that interventions designed to unjam the endosome carry high therapeutic promise.</description>

	<description>Over the past few years our understanding of estrogen signaling in the brain has expanded rapidly. Estrogens are synthesized in the periphery and in the brain, acting on multiple receptors to regulate gene transcription, neural function, and behavior. Various estrogen-sensitive signaling pathways often operate in concert within the same cell, increasing the complexity of the system. In females, estrogen concentrations fluctuate over the estrous/menstrual cycle, dynamically modulating estrogen receptor (ER) expression, activity, and trafficking.</description>
