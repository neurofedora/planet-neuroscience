As a consequence, DHA is significantly reduced in the serum of SCA38 subjects. In the present study, we evaluated the safety of DHA supplementation, its efficacy for clinical symptoms, and changes of brain functional imaging in SCA38 patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25059-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We enrolled 10 SCA38 patients, and carried out a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study for 16 weeks, followed by an open-label study with overall 40-week DHA treatment. At baseline and at follow-up visit, patients underwent standardized clinical assessment, brain 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, electroneurography, and &lt;em&gt;ELOVL5&lt;/em&gt; expression analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

At 40-week treatment, clinical improvement was found significant by both SARA (MD = +2.2, 95% CI = +0.93 to + 3.46, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.008) and International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (MD = +3.8, 95% CI = +1.39 to + 6.41, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.02) scores; clinical data were corroborated by significant improvement of cerebellar hypometabolism (statistical parametric mapping analyses, false discovery rate corrected). We also showed a decreased expression of &lt;em&gt;ELOVL5&lt;/em&gt; in patients’ blood at 40 weeks as compared to baseline. No side effect was recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Dendritic spines provide cognitive resilience against Alzheimer's disease</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25049-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging and other biomarker assays suggest that the pathological processes of Alzheimer's disease (AD) begin years prior to clinical dementia onset. However, some 30 to 50% of older individuals who harbor AD pathology do not become symptomatic in their lifetime. It is hypothesized that such individuals exhibit cognitive resilience that protects against AD dementia. We hypothesized that in cases with AD pathology, structural changes in dendritic spines would distinguish individuals who had or did not have clinical dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25049-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We compared dendritic spines within layer II and III pyramidal neuron dendrites in Brodmann area 46 dorsolateral prefrontal cortex using the Golgi–Cox technique in 12 age-matched pathology-free controls, 8 controls with AD pathology (CAD), and 21 AD cases. We used highly optimized methods to trace impregnated dendrites from bright-field microscopy images that enabled accurate 3-dimensional digital reconstruction of dendritic structure for morphologic analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25049-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spine density was similar among control and CAD cases but was reduced significantly in AD. Thin and mushroom spines were reduced significantly in AD compared to CAD brains, whereas stubby spine density was decreased significantly in CAD and AD compared to controls. Increased spine extent distinguished CAD cases from controls and AD. Linear regression analysis of all cases indicated that spine density was not associated with neuritic plaque score but did display negative correlation with Braak staging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25049-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;These observations provide cellular evidence to support the hypothesis that dendritic spine plasticity is a mechanism of cognitive resilience that protects older individuals with AD pathology from developing dementia.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Quantum field inspired model of decision making: Asymptotic stabilization of belief state via interaction with surrounding mental environment. (arXiv:1710.07613v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07613</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07613</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper is devoted to justification of quantum-like models of the process
of decision making based on the theory of open quantum systems, i.e. decision
making is considered as decoherence. This process is modeled as interaction of
a decision maker, Alice, with a mental (information) environment ${\cal R}$
surrounding her. Such an interaction generates &quot;dissipation of uncertainty&quot;
from Alice's belief-state $\rho(t)$ into ${\cal R}$ and asymptotic
stabilization of $\rho(t)$ to a steady belief-state. The latter is treated as
the decision state. Mathematically the problem under study is about finding
constraints on ${\cal R}$ guaranteeing such stabilization. We found a partial
solution of this problem (in the form of sufficient conditions). We present the
corresponding decision making analysis for one class of mental environments,
the so-called &quot;almost homogeneous environments&quot;, with the illustrative
examples: a) behavior of electorate interacting with the mass-media
&quot;reservoir&quot;, b) consumers' persuasion. We also comment on other classes of
mental environments.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this study we developed an automated system that evaluates speech and
language features from audio recordings of neuropsychological examinations of
92 subjects in the Framingham Heart Study. A total of 265 features were used in
an elastic-net regularized binomial logistic regression model to classify the
presence of cognitive impairment, and to select the most predictive features.
We compared performance with a demographic model from 6,258 subjects in the
greater study cohort (0.79 AUC), and found that a system that incorporated both
audio and text features performed the best (0.92 AUC), with a True Positive
Rate of 29% (at 0% False Positive Rate) and a good model fit (Hosmer-Lemeshow
test &amp;gt; 0.05). We also found that decreasing pitch and jitter, shorter segments
of speech, and responses phrased as questions were positively associated with
cognitive impairment.

	<description>Human brain activity can be studied at different spatial and temporal scales using fMRI, ECoG and EEG. To assess how reliably these imaging methods reflect brain responses related to a complex audio-visual stimulus and how similar stimulus-related responses are across methods, we presented a movie clip twice to three different cohorts of subjects (NEEG = 45, NfMRI = 11, NECoG = 5) and assessed correlations across viewings and imaging methods within a standardized brain space. Grand-average broad-band EEG and low-frequency (4-28 Hz) EEG power reached similar levels of inter-subject reliability as grand-average fMRI and single-subject high-frequency (28-116 Hz) ECoG power. ECoG power was negatively correlated with fMRI in low frequencies and positively correlated in high frequencies in temporal and occipital brain areas. Low-frequency EEG power was negatively correlated with fMRI in occipital and parietal, but positively correlated in temporal areas. We also observed strong correlations between fMRI and infra-slow EEG voltage fluctuations.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Majority of choice-related variability in perceptual decisions is present in early sensory cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/207357v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/207357v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>While performing challenging perceptual tasks such as detecting a barely visible target, our perceptual reports vary across presentations of identical stimuli. How much of the neural variability that correlates with the perceptual variability is present in the primary visual cortex (V1), the first cortical processing stage of visual information? To address this question, we recorded neural population responses from V1 using voltage-sensitive dye imaging while monkeys performed a challenging reaction-time visual detection task. We found that V1 responses in the period leading to the decision correspond more closely to the monkey's report than to the visual stimulus. These results, together with a simple computational model that allows one to quantify the captured choice-related variability, suggest that most this variability is present in V1, and that areas outside of V1 contain relatively little independent choice-related variability.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Estradiol and luteinizing hormone reverse memory loss in phencyclidine model of schizophrenia: Evidence for hippocampal GABA action</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/207159v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/207159v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia are poorly understood and difficult to treat. Estrogens may mitigate these symptoms via unknown mechanisms. To examine these mechanisms, we tested whether increasing estradiol (E) or decreasing luteinizing hormone (LH) could rescue declarative memory in a phencyclidine (PCP) model of schizophrenia. We then assessed whether changes in cortical or hippocampal GABA may underlie these effects. Female rats were ovariectomized and injected subchronically with PCP. To modulate E and LH, animals received hormone capsules or Antide injections. Short-term episodic memory was assessed using the novel object recognition task. Brain expression of GAD67 was analyzed via western blot, and parvalbumin-containing cells were counted using immunohistochemistry. Some rats received hippocampal infusions of a GABAA agonist, GABAA antagonist, or GAD inhibitor before behavioral testing. We found that PCP reduced hippocampal GAD67 and abolished object recognition. Antide restored hippocampal GAD67 and rescued recognition memory in PCP-treated animals. Estradiol reversed PCP's amnesic effect but failed to restore hippocampal GAD67. PCP did not cause significant differences in number of parvalbumin-expressing cells or cortical expression of GAD67. Hippocampal infusions of a GABAA agonist restored memory in PCP-treated rats. Blocking hippocampal GAD or GABAA receptors in ovx animals reproduced memory loss similar to PCP and inhibited estradiol's memory rescue in PCP-treated animals. In summary, decreasing LH or increasing E can reverse memory loss in a PCP model of schizophrenia. Alterations in hippocampal GABA may contribute to both PCP's effects on declarative memory and the hormones' ability to reverse them.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Specific hippocampal representations are linked to generalized cortical representations in memory.</title>

	<description>Memories link information about specific experiences to more general knowledge that is abstracted from and contextualizes those experiences, but how neuronal activity patterns support this link is not known. Here we show that during memory reactivation in a foraging task with multiple spatial paths, specific hippocampal place representations are concurrently and preferentially reactivated with a subset of prefrontal cortical task representations that generalize across different paths. This link between specific and general representations may serve as a neural substrate for abstraction and task guidance in mammals.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Hub connectivity, neuronal diversity, and gene expression in the C. elegans connectome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/207134v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/207134v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Studies of nervous system connectivity, in a wide variety of species and at different scales of resolution, have identified several highly conserved motifs of network organization. One such motif is a heterogeneous distribution of connectivity across neural elements, such that some elements act as highly connected and functionally important network hubs. These brain network hubs are also densely interconnected, forming a so-called rich-club. Recent work in mouse has identified a distinctive transcriptional signature of neural hubs, characterized by tightly coupled expression of oxidative metabolism genes, with similar genes characterizing macroscale inter-modular hub regions of the human cortex. Here, we sought to determine whether hubs of the neuronal C. elegans connectome also show tightly coupled gene expression. Using open data on the chemical and electrical connectivity of 279 C. elegans neurons, and binary gene expression data for each neuron across 948 genes, we computed a correlated gene expression score for each pair of neurons, providing a measure of their gene expression similarity. We demonstrate that connections between hub neurons are the most similar in their gene expression while connections between nonhubs are the least similar. Genes with the greatest contribution to this effect are involved in glutamatergic and cholinergic signaling, and other communication processes. We further show that coupled expression between hub neurons cannot be explained by their neuronal subtype (i.e., sensory, motor, or interneuron), separation distance, chemically secreted neurotransmitter, birth time, pairwise lineage distance, or their topological module affiliation. Instead, this coupling is intrinsically linked to the identity of most hubs as command interneurons, a specific class of interneurons that regulates locomotion. Our results suggest that neural hubs may possess a distinctive transcriptional signature, preserved across scales and species, that is related to the involvement of hubs in regulating the higher-order behaviors of a given organism.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Distinct glycosaminoglycan chain length and sulfation patterns required for cellular uptake of Tau, A{beta}, and {alpha}-Synuclein</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/207035v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Transcellular propagation of aggregate seeds has been proposed to mediate progression of neurodegenerative diseases in tauopathies and -synucleinopathies. We have previously determined that tau and -synuclein aggregates bind heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) on the cell surface. This mediates uptake and intracellular seeding. The specificity and mode of binding to HSPGs has been unknown. We used modified heparins to determine the size and sulfation requirements of glycosaminoglycan (GAGs) binding to aggregates in biochemical and cell uptake and seeding assays. Aggregates of tau require a precise GAG architecture with defined sulfate moieties in the N- and 6-O-positions, whereas -synuclein and A{beta} rely slightly more on overall charge on the GAGs. To determine the genetic requirements for aggregate uptake, we individually knocked out the major genes of the HSPG synthesis pathway using CRISPR/Cas9 in HEK293T cells. Knockout of EXT1, EXT2 and EXTL3, N-sulfotransferase (NDST1), and 6-O-sulfotransferase (HS6ST2) significantly reduced tau uptake. -Synuclein was not sensitive to HS6ST2 knockout. Good correlation between pharmacologic and genetic manipulation of GAG binding by tau and -synuclein indicates specificity that may help elucidate a path to mechanism-based inhibition of transcellular propagation of pathology.</description>

	<description>Neural stem cells in the adult murine brain have only a limited capacity to self-renew, and the number of neurons they generate drastically declines with age. How cellular dynamics sustain neurogenesis and how alterations with age may result in this decline, are both unresolved issues. Therefore, we clonally traced neural stem cell lineages using confetti reporters in young and old adult mice. To understand underlying mechanisms, we derived mathematical population models of adult neurogenesis that explain the observed clonal cell type abundances. Models fitting the data best consistently show self renewal of transit amplifying progenitors and rapid neuroblast cell cycle exit. Most importantly, we identified an increase of asymmetric stem cell divisions at the expense of symmetric stem cell differentiation with age. Beyond explaining existing longitudinal population data, our model identifies a particular cellular strategy underlying adult neural stem cell homeostasis that gives insights into the aging of a stem cell compartment.</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Individuals, Institutions, and Innovation in the Debates of the French Revolution. (arXiv:1710.06867v1 [physics.soc-ph])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06867</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06867</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The French Revolution brought principles of &quot;liberty, equality, and
brotherhood&quot; to bear on the day-to-day challenges of governing what was then
the largest country in Europe. Its experiments provided a model for future
revolutions and democracies across the globe, but this first modern revolution
had no model to follow. Using reconstructed transcripts of debates held in the
Revolution's first parliament, we present a quantitative analysis of how this
system managed innovation. We use information theory to track the creation,
transmission, and destruction of patterns of word-use across over 40,000
speeches and more than one thousand speakers. The parliament as a whole was
biased toward the adoption of new patterns, but speakers' individual qualities
could break these overall trends. Speakers on the left innovated at higher
rates while speakers on the right acted, often successfully, to preserve prior
patterns. Key players such as Robespierre (on the left) and Abb\'e Maury (on
the right) played information-processing roles emblematic of their politics.
Newly-created organizational functions---such as the Assembly's President and
committee chairs---had significant effects on debate outcomes, and a distinct
transition appears mid-way through the parliament when committees, external to
the debate process, gain new powers to &quot;propose and dispose&quot; to the body as a
whole. Taken together, these quantitative results align with existing
qualitative interpretations but also reveal crucial information-processing
dynamics that have hitherto been overlooked. Great orators had the public's
attention, but deputies (mostly on the political left) who mastered the
committee system gained new powers to shape revolutionary legislation.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Context-invariant encoding of reward location in a distinct hippocampal population</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/207043v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>The hippocampus plays a critical role in goal-directed navigation. Across different environments, however, the hippocampal map seems to be randomized, making it unclear how goal locations might be encoded. To address this question, we trained mice to seek reward at several locations on virtual linear tracks, and optical recordings of calcium activity were made at cellular resolution from two major hippocampal output structures, CA1 and the subiculum. These experiments revealed a population of neurons that were consistently active near reward locations. Their pattern of activity sharply contrasted with simultaneously-recorded place cells and even persisted across environments, when other cells remapped randomly. Their timing was closely correlated with reward anticipation behaviors, yet could not be explained by the behaviors themselves, raising the possibility that reward-associated cell signals were used by mice to identify the reward location. These results demonstrate that the hippocampus employs a context-invariant marker of goal locations, and reveal a novel target for studying how the hippocampus contributes to navigation.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Balancing Strengths and Weaknesses in Dimensional Psychiatry</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/207019v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/207019v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Objective: To evaluate the feasibility and value of creating an extensible framework for psychiatric phenotyping that indexes both strengths and weaknesses of behavioral dimensions. The Extended Strengths and Weaknesses Assessment of Normal Behavior (E-SWAN) reconceptualizes each diagnostic criterion for selected DSM-5 disorders as a behavior, which can range from high (strengths) to low (weaknesses). Initial efforts have focused on Panic Disorder, Social Anxiety, Major Depression, and Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder. Methods: Data were collected from 523 participants (ages: 5-21 years old) in the Child Mind Institute Healthy Brain Network - an ongoing community-referred study. Parents completed each of the four E-SWAN scales and traditional unidirectional scales addressing the same disorders. Distributional properties, Item Response Theory Analysis (IRT) and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves (for diagnostic prediction) were used to assess and compare the performance of E-SWAN and traditional scales. Results: In contrast to the traditional scales, which exhibited truncated distributions, all four E-SWAN scales were found to have near-normal distributions. IRT analyses indicate the E-SWAN subscales provided reliable information about respondents throughout the population distribution; in contrast, traditional scales only provided reliable information about respondents at the high end of the distribution. Predictive value for DSM-5 diagnoses was comparable to prior scales. Conclusion: E-SWAN bidirectional scales can capture the full spectrum of the population distribution for DSM disorders. The additional information provided can better inform examination of inter-individual variation in population studies, as well as facilitate the identification of factors related to resiliency in clinical samples.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention: A Review of findings and current directions</title>

	<description>The Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (WRAP) is a longitudinal observational cohort study enriched with persons with a parental history (PH) of probable Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Since late 2001, WRAP has enrolled 1,561 people at a mean baseline age of 54. Participants return for a second visit four years after baseline and subsequent visits occur every two years. Eighty-one percent (1270) of participants remain active in the study at a current mean age of 64 and 9 years of follow-up. Serially assessed cognition, self-reported medical and lifestyle histories (e.g. diet, physical and cognitive activity, sleep, and mood), laboratory tests, genetics, and linked studies comprising molecular imaging, structural imaging and cerebrospinal fluid data, have yielded many important findings. In this cohort, PH of AD is associated with 46% APOE {varepsilon}4 positivity, more than twice the rate of 22% among persons without PH. Subclinical or worse cognitive decline relative to internal normative data has been observed in 17.6% of the cohort. Twenty-eight percent exhibit amyloid and/or tau positivity. Biomarker elevations, but not APOE or PH status, are associated with cognitive decline. Salutary health and lifestyle factors are associated with better cognition and brain structure, and lower AD pathophysiologic burden. Of paramount importance is establishing the amyloid and tau AD endophenotypes to which cognitive outcomes can be linked. Such data will provide new knowledge on the early temporal course of AD pathophysiology and inform the design of secondary prevention clinical trials.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Tracking Individual Differences in Perception by TMS-EEG Intrinsic Effective Connectivity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/206797v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/206797v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Non-invasive human electroencephalography (EEG) coupled with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is currently used to measure coarse stimulus-response relationships in brain physiology during behavior. However, with key modifications, the TMS-EEG technique holds even greater promise for monitoring fine-scale neural signatures of human behavior. Here, we demonstrate that a novel TMS-EEG co-registration technique can dynamically monitor individual human variation in perception based solely on EEG resting-state intrinsic effective connectivity probed by TMS-based phase resetting of ongoing activity. We used a bistable stimulus task, where the percept is perceived as either horizontal or vertical apparent motion, to record gamma band interhemispheric integration of information. Fine-grained inter-individual behavioral differences in horizontal motion bias could be measured by tracking resting-state gamma-band effective connectivity from right hMT+ to left hMT+. Thus, our method of triggering intrinsic resting-state effective connectivity in oscillatory dynamics can monitor individual differences in perception via the long-range integration of information. This technique will be useful for the manipulative dissection of individual-scale human cognition mediated by neural dynamics and may also expand neurofeedback approaches.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Overnight memory consolidation facilitates rather than interferes with new learning of similar materials - a study probing NMDA-receptors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/206771v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/206771v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Whereas sleep-dependent consolidation and its neurochemical underpinnings have been strongly researched, less is known about how consolidation during sleep affects subsequent learning. Since sleep enhances memory, it can be expected to pro-actively interfere with learning after sleep, in particular of similar materials. This pro-active interference should be enhanced by substances that benefit consolidation during sleep, such as D-cycloserine. We tested this hypothesis in two groups (Sleep, Wake) of young healthy participants receiving on one occasion D-cycloserine (175 mg) and on another occasion placebo, according to a double-blind balanced cross-over design. Treatment was administered after participants had learned a set of word-pairs (A-B list) and before nocturnal retention periods of sleep vs. wakefulness. After D-cycloserine blood plasma levels had dropped to negligible amounts, i.e., the next day in the evening, participants learned, in three sequential runs, new sets of word-pairs. One list - to enhance interference - consisted of the same cue words as the original set paired with a new target word (A-C list) and the other of completely new cue words (D-E set). Unexpectedly, during post-retention learning the A-C interference list was generally better learned than the completely new D-E list, which suggests that consolidation of previously encoded similar material enhances memory integration rather than pro-active interference. Consistent with this view, new learning of word pairs was better after sleep than wakefulness. Similarly, D-cycloserine generally enhanced learning of new word-pairs, compared to placebo. This effect being independent of sleep or wakefulness, leads us to speculate that D-cycloserine, in addition to enhancing sleep-dependent consolidation, might mediate a time-dependent process of active forgetting.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: GABA regulates resonance and spike rate encoding via a universal mechanism that underlies the modulation of action potential generation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/206581v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/206581v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Different mechanisms for action potential (AP) generation exist that shape neuronal coding and network dynamics. The neuro-transmitter GABA regulates neuronal activity but its role in modulating AP dynamics itself is unclear. Here we show that GABA indeed changes the AP mechanism: it causes regularly firing hippocampal CA3 neurons to bistably switch between spiking and quiescence, converts graded discharge-to-current relationships to have abrupt onsets, and induces resonance. Modeling reveals that A-currents enable these GABA-induced transitions. Mathematically, we prove that this transition sequence originates from a single universal principle that generically underlies the modulation of AP dynamics in any conductance-based neuron model. Conductance clamp experiments in hippocampal and brainstem neurons show the same transitions, confirming the universal theory. In simulated networks, synaptically controlled AP dynamics, permits dynamic gating of signals and targeted synchronization of neuronal sub-ensembles. These results advance the systematic understanding of AP modulation and its role in neuronal and network function.</description>

	<description>There are numerous ways to reach for an apple hanging from a tree. Yet, our motor system uses a specific muscle activity pattern to generate reaching movements that have similar characteristics. For many decades, we know that this pattern features activity bursts and silent periods. We suggest that these bursts are a strong evidence against the common view that the brain continuously controls the commands to the muscles. Instead, we suggest a model that changes these commands in a discrete way. We use unsupervised machine learning to identify transitions in the state of the muscles, and show that fitting a discrete model to the kinematics of movement using only one parameter predicts the transitions in the state of the muscles. Such discrete controller suggests that the brain reduces the complexity of the motor control problem as well as the wear-and-tear of the muscles by sending commands to the muscles at sparse times. Identifying this discrete controller can be applied in the control of prostheses and physical human-robot interaction systems such as exoskeletons and assistive devices.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Simulation of visual perception and learning with a retinal prosthesis</title>

	<description>The nature of artificial vision with a retinal prosthesis, and the degree to which the brain can adapt to the unnatural input from such a device, are poorly understood. Therefore, the development of current and future devices may be aided by theory and simulations that help to infer and understand what patients see. A novel computational framework was developed to predict visual perception and the effect of learning with a subretinal prosthesis. The framework is based on the idea that the central visual system efficiently reconstructs the incident image from the retinal output. To implement this idea, a simulation of the normal responses of the major retinal ganglion cell types was used to deduce the optimal linear reconstruction of the visual stimulus from retinal activity. The result was then used to make inferences about visual experience with simulated retinal activation by a subretinal prosthesis. The inferred visual perception obtained with prosthesis activation was substantially degraded compared to the inferred perception obtained with normal retinal responses, as expected given the limited resolution and lack of cell type specificity of the prosthesis. Consistent with the importance of cell type specificity, reconstruction using only ON cells, and not OFF cells, was substantially more accurate. Finally, when reconstruction was re-optimized for electrical stimulation, simulating learning by the patient, the accuracy of inferred perception with prosthesis stimulation was closer to that of natural vision. The reconstruction approach provides a framework for interpreting patient data in clinical trials, and may be useful for improving prosthesis design.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: An olfactogenetic approach identifies olfactory neurons and brain centers directing negative oviposition decisions in Drosophila.</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/206342v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>The sense of smell influences behaviors in animals, yet how odors are represented in the brain remains unclear. The nose contains different types of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), each expressing a particular odorant receptor, and OSNs expressing the same receptors converge their axons on a brain region called a glomerulus. In Drosophila, second order neurons (projection neurons) typically innervate a single glomerulus and send stereotyped axonal projections to the lateral horn. One of the greatest challenges to studying olfaction is the lack of methods allowing activation of specific types of olfactory neurons in an ethologically relevant setting. Most odorants activate many olfactory neurons, and many olfactory neurons are activated by a variety of odorants. As such, it is difficult to identify if individual types of olfactory neurons directly influence a behavior. To address this, we developed a genetic method in Drosophila called olfactogenetics in which a narrowly tuned odorant receptor, Or56a, is ectopically expressed in different olfactory neuron types. Stimulation with geosmin (the only known Or56a ligand), in an Or56a mutant background leads to specific activation of only the target olfactory neuron type. We used this approach to identify which types of olfactory neurons can directly guide oviposition decisions. We identified 5 OSN-types (Or71a, Or47b, Or49a, Or67b, and Or7a) that, when activated alone, suppress oviposition. Projection neurons partnering with these OSNs share a region of innervation in the lateral horn, suggesting that oviposition site-selection might be encoded in this brain region.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Ongoing brain rhythms shape I-wave properties in a computational model [Revised]</title>

	<description>Background: Responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) are notoriously variable. Previous studies have observed a dependence of TMS-induced responses on ongoing brain activity, for instance sensorimotor rhythms. This suggests an opportunity for the development of more effective stimulation protocols through closed-loop TMS-EEG. However, it is not yet clear how features of ongoing activity affect the responses of cortical circuits to TMS. Objective: Here we investigate the dependence of TMS-responses on power and phase of ongoing oscillatory activity in a computational model of TMS-induced I-waves. Methods: The model comprises populations of cortical layer 2/3 (L2/3) neurons and a population of cortical layer 5 (L5) neurons and generates I-waves in response to TMS. Oscillatory input to the L2/3 neurons induces rhythmic fluctuations in activity of L5 neurons. TMS pulses are simulated at different phases and amplitudes of the ongoing rhythm. Results: The model shows a robust dependence of I-wave properties on phase and power of ongoing rhythms, with the strongest response occurring for TMS at maximal L5 depolarization. The amount of phase-modulation depends on stimulation intensity, with stronger modulation for lower intensity. Conclusion: The model predicts that responses to TMS are highly variable for low stimulation intensities if ongoing brain rhythms are not taken into account. Closed-loop TMS-EEG holds promise for obtaining more reliable TMS effects.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Distinct prediction errors in mesostriatal circuits of the human brain mediate learning about the values of both states and actions: evidence from high-resolution fMRI</title>

Prediction-error signals consistent with formal models of “reinforcement learning” (RL) have repeatedly been found within dopaminergic nuclei of the midbrain and dopaminoceptive areas of the striatum. However, the precise form of the RL algorithms implemented in the human brain is not yet well determined. Here, we created a novel paradigm optimized to dissociate the subtypes of reward-prediction errors that function as the key computational signatures of two distinct classes of RL models—namely, “actor/critic” models and action-value-learning models (e.g., the Q-learning model). The state-value-prediction error (SVPE), which is independent of actions, is a hallmark of the actor/critic architecture, whereas the action-value-prediction error (AVPE) is the distinguishing feature of action-value-learning algorithms. To test for the presence of these prediction-error signals in the brain, we scanned human participants with a high-resolution functional magnetic-resonance imaging (fMRI) protocol optimized to enable measurement of neural activity in the dopaminergic midbrain as well as the striatal areas to which it projects. In keeping with the actor/critic model, the SVPE signal was detected in the substantia nigra. The SVPE was also clearly present in both the ventral striatum and the dorsal striatum. However, alongside these purely state-value-based computations we also found evidence for AVPE signals throughout the striatum. These high-resolution fMRI findings suggest that model-free aspects of reward learning in humans can be explained algorithmically with RL in terms of an actor/critic mechanism operating in parallel with a system for more direct action-value learning.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/U1RXkdLa_Aw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Quantifying the strength of quorum sensing crosstalk within microbial communities</title>

In multispecies microbial communities, the exchange of signals such as acyl-homoserine lactones (AHL) enables communication within and between species of Gram-negative bacteria. This process, commonly known as quorum sensing, aids in the regulation of genes crucial for the survival of species within heterogeneous populations of microbes. Although signal exchange was studied extensively in well-mixed environments, less is known about the consequences of crosstalk in spatially distributed mixtures of species. Here, signaling dynamics were measured in a spatially distributed system containing multiple strains utilizing homologous signaling systems. Crosstalk between strains containing the &lt;i&gt;lux&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;las&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;rhl&lt;/i&gt; AHL-receptor circuits was quantified. In a distributed population of microbes, the impact of community composition on spatio-temporal dynamics was characterized and compared to simulation results using a modified reaction-diffusion model. After introducing a single term to account for crosstalk between each pair of signals, the model was able to reproduce the activation patterns observed in experiments. We quantified the robustness of signal propagation in the presence of interacting signals, finding that signaling dynamics are largely robust to interference. The ability of several wild isolates to participate in AHL-mediated signaling was investigated, revealing distinct signatures of crosstalk for each species. Our results present a route to characterize crosstalk between species and predict systems-level signaling dynamics in multispecies communities.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/a4Fhw6RTNQ8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Deconvolving sequence features that discriminate between overlapping regulatory annotations</title>

Genomic loci with regulatory potential can be annotated with various properties. For example, genomic sites bound by a given transcription factor (TF) can be divided according to whether they are proximal or distal to known promoters. Sites can be further labeled according to the cell types and conditions in which they are active. Given such a collection of labeled sites, it is natural to ask what sequence features are associated with each annotation label. However, discovering such label-specific sequence features is often confounded by overlaps between the labels; e.g. if regulatory sites specific to a given cell type are also more likely to be promoter-proximal, it is difficult to assess whether motifs identified in that set of sites are associated with the cell type or associated with promoters. In order to meet this challenge, we developed SeqUnwinder, a principled approach to deconvolving interpretable discriminative sequence features associated with overlapping annotation labels. We demonstrate the novel analysis abilities of SeqUnwinder using three examples. Firstly, SeqUnwinder is able to unravel sequence features associated with the dynamic binding behavior of TFs during motor neuron programming from features associated with chromatin state in the initial embryonic stem cells. Secondly, we characterize distinct sequence properties of multi-condition and cell-specific TF binding sites after controlling for uneven associations with promoter proximity. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of SeqUnwinder to discover cell-specific sequence features from over one hundred thousand genomic loci that display DNase I hypersensitivity in one or more ENCODE cell lines.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AwU73jNUxzw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Unmet needs for analyzing biological big data: A survey of 704 NSF principal investigators</title>

In a 2016 survey of 704 National Science Foundation (NSF) Biological Sciences Directorate principal investigators (BIO PIs), nearly 90% indicated they are currently or will soon be analyzing large data sets. BIO PIs considered a range of computational needs important to their work, including high performance computing (HPC), bioinformatics support, multistep workflows, updated analysis software, and the ability to store, share, and publish data. Previous studies in the United States and Canada emphasized infrastructure needs. However, BIO PIs said the most pressing unmet needs are training in data integration, data management, and scaling analyses for HPC—acknowledging that data science skills will be required to build a deeper understanding of life. This portends a growing data knowledge gap in biology and challenges institutions and funding agencies to redouble their support for computational training in biology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Dfm4xpI2oyE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Seasonality in risk of pandemic influenza emergence</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Spencer J. Fox, Joel C. Miller, Lauren Ancel Meyers&lt;/p&gt;

Influenza pandemics can emerge unexpectedly and wreak global devastation. However, each of the six pandemics since 1889 emerged in the Northern Hemisphere just after the flu season, suggesting that pandemic timing may be predictable. Using a stochastic model fit to seasonal flu surveillance data from the United States, we find that seasonal flu leaves a transient wake of heterosubtypic immunity that impedes the emergence of novel flu viruses. This refractory period provides a simple explanation for not only the spring-summer timing of historical pandemics, but also early increases in pandemic severity and multiple waves of transmission. Thus, pandemic risk may be seasonal and predictable, with the accuracy of pre-pandemic and real-time risk assessments hinging on reliable seasonal influenza surveillance and precise estimates of the breadth and duration of heterosubtypic immunity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zp16YclDt28&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A deep convolutional neural network for classification of red blood cells in sickle cell anemia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005746</guid>

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a hematological disorder leading to blood vessel occlusion accompanied by painful episodes and even death. Red blood cells (RBCs) of SCD patients have diverse shapes that reveal important biomechanical and bio-rheological characteristics, &lt;i&gt;e.g.&lt;/i&gt; their density, fragility, adhesive properties, etc. Hence, having an objective and effective way of RBC shape quantification and classification will lead to better insights and eventual better prognosis of the disease. To this end, we have developed an automated, high-throughput, ex-vivo RBC shape classification framework that consists of three stages. First, we present an automatic hierarchical RBC extraction method to detect the RBC region (ROI) from the background, and then separate touching RBCs in the ROI images by applying an improved random walk method based on automatic seed generation. Second, we apply a mask-based RBC patch-size normalization method to normalize the variant size of segmented single RBC patches into uniform size. Third, we employ deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to realize RBC classification; the alternating convolution and pooling operations can deal with non-linear and complex patterns. Furthermore, we investigate the specific shape factor quantification for the classified RBC image data in order to develop a general multiscale shape analysis. We perform several experiments on raw microscopy image datasets from 8 SCD patients (over 7,000 single RBC images) through a 5-fold cross validation method both for oxygenated and deoxygenated RBCs. We demonstrate that the proposed framework can successfully classify sickle shape RBCs in an automated manner with high accuracy, and we also provide the corresponding shape factor analysis, which can be used synergistically with the CNN analysis for more robust predictions. Moreover, the trained deep CNN exhibits good performance even for a deoxygenated dataset and distinguishes the subtle differences in texture alteration inside the oxygenated and deoxygenated RBCs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-4Z6i6XGCGU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Perceptual manifolds arise when a neural population responds to an ensemble
of sensory signals associated with different physical features (e.g.,
orientation, pose, scale, location, and intensity) of the same perceptual
object. Object recognition and discrimination requires classifying the
manifolds in a manner that is insensitive to variability within a manifold. How
neuronal systems give rise to invariant object classification and recognition
is a fundamental problem in brain theory as well as in machine learning. Here
we study the ability of a readout network to classify objects from their
perceptual manifold representations. We develop a statistical mechanical theory
for the linear classification of manifolds with arbitrary geometry revealing a
remarkable relation to the mathematics of conic decomposition. Novel
geometrical measures of manifold radius and manifold dimension are introduced
which can explain the classification capacity for manifolds of various
geometries. The general theory is demonstrated on a number of representative
manifolds, including L2 ellipsoids prototypical of strictly convex manifolds,
L1 balls representing polytopes consisting of finite sample points, and
orientation manifolds which arise from neurons tuned to respond to a continuous
angle variable, such as object orientation. The effects of label sparsity on
the classification capacity of manifolds are elucidated, revealing a scaling
relation between label sparsity and manifold radius. Theoretical predictions
are corroborated by numerical simulations using recently developed algorithms
to compute maximum margin solutions for manifold dichotomies. Our theory and
its extensions provide a powerful and rich framework for applying statistical
mechanics of linear classification to data arising from neuronal responses to
object stimuli, as well as to artificial deep networks trained for object
recognition tasks.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Neural decoding of bistable sounds reveals an effect of intention on perceptual organization</title>

	<description>Auditory signals arrive at the ear as a mixture that the brain must decompose into distinct sources, based to a large extent on acoustic properties of the sounds. An important question concerns whether listeners have voluntary control over how many sources they perceive. This has been studied using pure tones H and L presented in the repeating pattern HLH-HLH-, which can form a bistable percept, heard either as an integrated whole (HLH-) or as segregated into high (H-H-) and low (-L--) sequences. Although instructing listeners to try to integrate or segregate sounds affects reports of what they hear, this could reflect a response bias rather than an underlying perceptual effect. We had human listeners continuously report their perception of such sequences while we recorded neural activity using magneto-encephelography. During neutral listening, a classifier trained on patterns of neural activity distinguished between periods of integrated and segregated perception. In other conditions, participants tried to influence their perception by allocating attention either to the whole sequence, or to a subset of the sounds. They reported hearing the desired percept for a greater proportion of time than when listening neutrally. Critically, neural activity supported these reports; stimulus-locked brain responses in auditory cortex were more likely to resemble the signature of segregation when participants tried to hear segregation than when attempting to perceive integration. These results indicate that listeners can influence how many sound sources they perceive, as reflected in neural responses that track both the input and its perceptual organization.</description>

	<description>Understanding complex systems such as the human brain requires characterization of the system's architecture across multiple levels of organization - from neurons, to local circuits, to brain regions, and ultimately large-scale brain networks. Here we focus on characterizing the human brain's comprehensive large-scale network organization, as it provides an overall framework for the organization of all other levels. We leveraged the Human Connectome Project dataset to identify network communities across cortical regions, replicating well-known networks and revealing several novel but robust networks, including a left-lateralized language network. We expanded these cortical networks to subcortex, revealing 288 highly-organized subcortical segments that take part in forming whole-brain functional networks. This whole-brain network atlas - released as an open resource for the neuroscience community - places all brain structures across both cortex and subcortex in a single large-scale functional framework, substantially advancing existing atlases to provide a brain-wide functional network characterization in humans.</description>

	<description>The motor system's ability to adapt to changes in the environment is essential for maintaining accurate movements. During such adaptation several distinct systems are recruited: cerebellar sensory-prediction error learning, success-based reinforcement, and explicit strategy-use. Although much work has focused on the relationship between cerebellar learning and strategy-use, there is little research regarding how reinforcement and strategy-use interact. To address this, participants first learnt a 20 degrees visuomotor displacement. After reaching asymptotic performance, binary, hit-or-miss feedback (BF) was introduced either with or without visual feedback, the latter promoting reinforcement. Subsequently, retention was assessed using no-feedback trials, with half of the participants in each group being instructed to stop using any strategy. Although BF led to an increase in retention of the visuomotor displacement, instructing participants to remove their strategy nullified this effect, suggesting strategy-use is critical to BF-based reinforcement. In a second experiment, we prevented the expression or development of a strategy during BF performance, by either constraining participants to a short preparation time (expression) or by introducing the displacement gradually (development). As both strongly impaired BF performance, it suggests reinforcement requires both the development and expression of a strategy. These results emphasise a pivotal role of strategy-use during reinforcement-based motor learning.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Bayesian refinement of protein structures and ensembles against SAXS data using molecular dynamics</title>

Small-angle X-ray scattering is an increasingly popular technique used to detect protein structures and ensembles in solution. However, the refinement of structures and ensembles against SAXS data is often ambiguous due to the low information content of SAXS data, unknown systematic errors, and unknown scattering contributions from the solvent. We offer a solution to such problems by combining Bayesian inference with all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and explicit-solvent SAXS calculations. The Bayesian formulation correctly weights the SAXS data versus prior physical knowledge, it quantifies the precision or ambiguity of fitted structures and ensembles, and it accounts for unknown systematic errors due to poor buffer matching. The method further provides a probabilistic criterion for identifying the number of states required to explain the SAXS data. The method is validated by refining ensembles of a periplasmic binding protein against calculated SAXS curves. Subsequently, we derive the solution ensembles of the eukaryotic chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) against experimental SAXS data. We find that the SAXS data of the apo state of Hsp90 is compatible with a single wide-open conformation, whereas the SAXS data of Hsp90 bound to ATP or to an ATP-analogue strongly suggests heterogenous ensembles of a closed and a wide-open state.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TGqmqUk3vGI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Accurate gene or protein function prediction is a key challenge in the post-genome era. Most current methods perform well on molecular function prediction, but struggle to provide useful annotations relating to biological process functions due to the limited power of sequence-based features in that functional domain. In this work, we systematically evaluate the predictive power of temporal transcription expression profiles for protein function prediction in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;. Our results show significantly better performance on predicting protein function when transcription expression profile-based features are integrated with sequence-derived features, compared with the sequence-derived features alone. We also observe that the combination of expression-based and sequence-based features leads to further improvement of accuracy on predicting all three domains of gene function. Based on the optimal feature combinations, we then propose a novel multi-classifier-based function prediction method for &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; proteins, FFPred-fly+. Interpreting our machine learning models also allows us to identify some of the underlying links between biological processes and developmental stages of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ODoUz0HshHs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Multiple Signaling Pathways Coordinately Regulate Forgetting of Olfactory Adaptation through Control of Sensory Responses in Caenorhabditis elegans</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Forgetting memories is important for animals to properly respond to continuously changing environments. To elucidate the mechanisms of forgetting, we used one of the behavioral plasticities of &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; hermaphrodite, olfactory adaptation to an attractive odorant, diacetyl, as a simple model of learning. In &lt;i&gt;C. elegans,&lt;/i&gt; the TIR-1/JNK-1 pathway accelerates forgetting of olfactory adaptation by facilitating neural secretion from AWC sensory neurons. In this study, to identify the downstream effectors of the TIR-1/JNK-1 pathway, we conducted a genetic screen for suppressors of the gain-of-function mutant of &lt;i&gt;tir-1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;ok1052&lt;/i&gt;), which shows excessive forgetting. Our screening showed that three proteins—a membrane protein, MACO-1; a receptor tyrosine kinase, SCD-2; and its putative ligand, HEN-1—regulated forgetting downstream of the TIR-1/JNK-1 pathway. We further demonstrated that MACO-1 and SCD-2/HEN-1 functioned in parallel genetic pathways, and only MACO-1 regulated forgetting of olfactory adaptation to isoamyl alcohol, which is an attractive odorant sensed by different types of sensory neurons. In olfactory adaptation, odor-evoked Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; responses in olfactory neurons are attenuated by conditioning and recovered thereafter. A Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging study revealed that this attenuation is sustained longer in &lt;i&gt;maco-1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;scd-2&lt;/i&gt; mutant animals than in wild-type animals like the TIR-1/JNK-1 pathway mutants. Furthermore, temporal silencing by histamine-gated chloride channels revealed that the neuronal activity of AWC neurons after conditioning is important for proper forgetting. We propose that distinct signaling pathways, each of which has a specific function, may coordinately and temporally regulate forgetting by controlling sensory responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Active forgetting is an important process to understand the whole mechanisms of memories. Recent papers have reported that the noncell autonomous regulations are required for proper forgetting in invertebrates. We found that in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; hermaphrodite, the noncell autonomous regulations of forgetting of olfactory adaptation is regulated by three conserved proteins: a membrane protein, MACO-1; a receptor tyrosine kinase, SCD-2: and its ligand, HEN-1. MACO-1 and SCD-2/HEN-1, working in coordination, accelerate forgetting by controlling sensory responses in parallel. Furthermore, temporal regulation of neuronal activity is important for proper forgetting. We suggest that multiple pathways may coordinately and temporally regulate forgetting through control of sensory responses. This study should lead to a better understanding of forgetting in higher organisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Enhanced Nociception in Angelman Syndrome Model Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/42/10230?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Angelman syndrome (AS) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutation or deletion of the maternal &lt;i&gt;UBE3A&lt;/i&gt; allele. The maternal &lt;i&gt;UBE3A&lt;/i&gt; allele is expressed in nearly all neurons of the brain and spinal cord, whereas the paternal &lt;i&gt;UBE3A&lt;/i&gt; allele is repressed by an extremely long antisense transcript (&lt;i&gt;UBE3A-ATS&lt;/i&gt;). Little is known about expression of &lt;i&gt;UBE3A&lt;/i&gt; in the peripheral nervous system, where loss of maternal &lt;i&gt;UBE3A&lt;/i&gt; might contribute to AS phenotypes. Here we sought to examine maternal and paternal &lt;i&gt;Ube3a&lt;/i&gt; expression in DRGs neurons and to evaluate whether nociceptive responses were affected in AS model mice (global deletion of maternal &lt;i&gt;Ube3a&lt;/i&gt; allele; &lt;i&gt;Ube3a&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;–/&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). We found that most large-diameter proprioceptive and mechanosensitive DRG neurons expressed maternal &lt;i&gt;Ube3a&lt;/i&gt; and paternal &lt;i&gt;Ube3a-ATS&lt;/i&gt;. In contrast, most small-diameter neurons expressed &lt;i&gt;Ube3a&lt;/i&gt; biallelically and had low to undetectable levels of &lt;i&gt;Ube3a-ATS&lt;/i&gt;. Analysis of single-cell DRG transcriptomes further suggested that &lt;i&gt;Ube3a&lt;/i&gt; is expressed monoallelically in myelinated large-diameter neurons and biallelically in unmyelinated small-diameter neurons. Behavioral responses to some noxious thermal and mechanical stimuli were enhanced in male and female AS model mice; however, nociceptive responses were not altered by the conditional deletion of maternal &lt;i&gt;Ube3a&lt;/i&gt; in the DRG. These data suggest that the enhanced nociceptive responses in AS model mice are due to loss of maternal &lt;i&gt;Ube3a&lt;/i&gt; in the central, but not peripheral, nervous system. Our study provides new insights into sensory processing deficits associated with AS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by loss or mutation of the maternal &lt;i&gt;UBE3A&lt;/i&gt; allele. While sensory processing deficits are frequently associated with AS, it is currently unknown whether &lt;i&gt;Ube3a&lt;/i&gt; is expressed in peripheral sensory neurons or whether maternal deletion of &lt;i&gt;Ube3a&lt;/i&gt; affects somatosensory responses. Here, we found that &lt;i&gt;Ube3a&lt;/i&gt; is primarily expressed from the maternally inherited allele in myelinated large-diameter sensory neurons and biallelically expressed in unmyelinated small-diameter neurons. Nociceptive responses to select noxious thermal and mechanical stimuli were enhanced following global, but not sensory neuron-specific, deletion of maternal &lt;i&gt;Ube3a&lt;/i&gt; in mice. These data suggest that maternal loss of &lt;i&gt;Ube3a&lt;/i&gt; affects nociception via a central, but not peripheral mechanism, with implications for AS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Neural Basis of Aversive Pavlovian Guidance during Planning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/42/10215?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Important real-world decisions are often arduous as they frequently involve sequences of choices, with initial selections affecting future options. Evaluating every possible combination of choices is computationally intractable, particularly for longer multistep decisions. Therefore, humans frequently use heuristics to reduce the complexity of decisions. We recently used a goal-directed planning task to demonstrate the profound behavioral influence and ubiquity of one such shortcut, namely aversive pruning, a reflexive Pavlovian process that involves neglecting parts of the decision space residing beyond salient negative outcomes. However, how the brain implements this important decision heuristic and what underlies individual differences have hitherto remained unanswered. Therefore, we administered an adapted version of the same planning task to healthy male and female volunteers undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine the neural basis of aversive pruning. Through both computational and standard categorical fMRI analyses, we show that when planning was influenced by aversive pruning, the subgenual cingulate cortex was robustly recruited. This neural signature was distinct from those associated with general planning and valuation, two fundamental cognitive components elicited by our task but which are complementary to aversive pruning. Furthermore, we found that individual variation in levels of aversive pruning was associated with the responses of insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices to the receipt of large monetary losses, and also with subclinical levels of anxiety. In summary, our data reveal the neural signatures of an important reflexive Pavlovian process that shapes goal-directed evaluations and thereby determines the outcome of high-level sequential cognitive processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Multistep decisions are complex because initial choices constrain future options. Evaluating every path for long decision sequences is often impractical; thus, cognitive shortcuts are often essential. One pervasive and powerful heuristic is aversive pruning, in which potential decision-making avenues are curtailed at immediate negative outcomes. We used neuroimaging to examine how humans implement such pruning. We found it to be associated with activity in the subgenual cingulate cortex, with neural signatures that were distinguishable from those covarying with planning and valuation. Individual variations in aversive pruning levels related to subclinical anxiety levels and insular cortex activation. These findings reveal the neural mechanisms by which basic negative Pavlovian influences guide decision-making during planning, with implications for disrupted decision-making in psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sublaminar Subdivision of Mouse Auditory Cortex Layer 2/3 Based on Functional Translaminar Connections</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/42/10200?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The cerebral cortex is subdivided into six layers based on morphological features. The supragranular layers 2/3 (L2/3) contain morphologically and genetically diverse populations of neurons, suggesting the existence of discrete classes of cells. In primates and carnivores L2/3 can be subdivided morphologically, but cytoarchitectonic divisions are less clear in rodents. Nevertheless, discrete classes of cells could exist based on their computational requirement, which might be linked to their associated functional microcircuits. Through &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; slice recordings coupled with laser-scanning photostimulation we investigated whether L2/3 of male mouse auditory cortex contains discrete subpopulations of cells with specific functional microcircuits. We use hierarchical clustering on the laminar connection patterns to reveal the existence of multiple distinct classes of L2/3 neurons. The classes of L2/3 neurons are distinguished by the pattern of their laminar and columnar inputs from within A1 and their location within L2/3. Cells in superficial L2 show more extensive columnar integration than deeper L3 cells. Moreover, L3 cells receive more translaminar input from L4. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; imaging in awake mice revealed that L2 cells had higher bandwidth than L3 cells, consistent with the laminar differences in columnar integration. These results suggest that similar to higher mammals, rodent L2/3 is not a homogenous layer but contains several parallel microcircuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Layer 2/3 of auditory cortex is functionally diverse. We investigated whether L2/3 cells form classes based on their functional connectivity. We used &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; whole-cell patch-clamp recordings with laser-scanning photostimulation and performed unsupervised clustering on the resulting excitatory and inhibitory connection patterns. Cells within each class were located in different sublaminae. Superficial cells showed wider integration along the tonotopic axis and the amount of L4 input varied with sublaminar location. To identify whether sensory responses varied with sublaminar location, we performed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging and found that L2 cells were less frequency-selective than L3 cells. Our results show that the diversity of receptive fields in L2/3 is likely due to diversity in the underlying functional circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Mitochondrial DNA Double-Strand Breaks in Oligodendrocytes Cause Demyelination, Axonal Injury, and CNS Inflammation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/42/10185?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders, including multiple sclerosis (MS). To date, the investigation of mitochondrial dysfunction in MS has focused exclusively on neurons, with no studies exploring whether dysregulation of mitochondrial bioenergetics and/or genetics in oligodendrocytes might be associated with the etiopathogenesis of MS and other demyelinating syndromes. To address this question, we established a mouse model where mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) double-strand breaks (DSBs) were specifically induced in myelinating oligodendrocytes (PLP:mtPstI mice) by expressing a mitochondrial-targeted endonuclease, mtPstI, starting at 3 weeks of age. In both female and male mice, DSBs of oligodendroglial mtDNA caused impairment of locomotor function, chronic demyelination, glial activation, and axonal degeneration, which became more severe with time of induction. In addition, after short transient induction of mtDNA DSBs, PLP:mtPstI mice showed an exacerbated response to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Together, our data demonstrate that mtDNA damage can cause primary oligodendropathy, which in turn triggers demyelination, proving PLP:mtPstI mice to be a useful tool to study the pathological consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction in oligodendrocytes. In addition, the demyelination and axonal loss displayed by PLP:mtPstI mice recapitulate some of the key features of chronic demyelinating syndromes, including progressive MS forms, which are not accurately reproduced in the models currently available. For this reason, the PLP:mtPstI mouse represents a unique and much needed platform for testing remyelinating therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In this study, we show that oligodendrocyte-specific mitochondrial DNA double-strand breaks in PLP:mtPstI mice cause oligodendrocyte death and demyelination associated with axonal damage and glial activation. Hence, PLP:mtPstI mice represent a unique tool to study the pathological consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction in oligodendrocytes, as well as an ideal platform to test remyelinating and neuroprotective agents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Individual Alpha Peak Frequency Predicts 10 Hz Flicker Effects on Selective Attention</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/42/10173?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Rhythmic visual stimulation (&quot;flicker&quot;) is primarily used to &quot;tag&quot; processing of low-level visual and high-level cognitive phenomena. However, preliminary evidence suggests that flicker may also entrain endogenous brain oscillations, thereby modulating cognitive processes supported by those brain rhythms. Here we tested the interaction between 10 Hz flicker and endogenous alpha-band (~10 Hz) oscillations during a selective visuospatial attention task. We recorded EEG from human participants (both genders) while they performed a modified Eriksen flanker task in which distractors and targets flickered within (10 Hz) or outside (7.5 or 15 Hz) the alpha band. By using a combination of EEG source separation, time-frequency, and single-trial linear mixed-effects modeling, we demonstrate that 10 Hz flicker interfered with stimulus processing more on incongruent than congruent trials (high vs low selective attention demands). Crucially, the effect of 10 Hz flicker on task performance was predicted by the distance between 10 Hz and individual alpha peak frequency (estimated during the task). Finally, the flicker effect on task performance was more strongly predicted by EEG flicker responses during stimulus processing than during preparation for the upcoming stimulus, suggesting that 10 Hz flicker interfered more with reactive than proactive selective attention. These findings are consistent with our hypothesis that visual flicker entrained endogenous alpha-band networks, which in turn impaired task performance. Our findings also provide novel evidence for frequency-dependent exogenous modulation of cognition that is determined by the correspondence between the exogenous flicker frequency and the endogenous brain rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Here we provide novel evidence that the interaction between exogenous rhythmic visual stimulation and endogenous brain rhythms can have frequency-specific behavioral effects. We show that alpha-band (10 Hz) flicker impairs stimulus processing in a selective attention task when the stimulus flicker rate matches individual alpha peak frequency. The effect of sensory flicker on task performance was stronger when selective attention demands were high, and was stronger during stimulus processing and response selection compared with the prestimulus anticipatory period. These findings provide novel evidence that frequency-specific sensory flicker affects online attentional processing, and also demonstrate that the correspondence between exogenous and endogenous rhythms is an overlooked prerequisite when testing for frequency-specific cognitive effects of flicker.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Site-Specific Regulation of P2X7 Receptor Function in Microglia Gates Morphine Analgesic Tolerance</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/42/10154?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Tolerance to the analgesic effects of opioids is a major problem in chronic pain management. Microglia are implicated in opioid tolerance, but the core mechanisms regulating their response to opioids remain obscure. By selectively ablating microglia in the spinal cord using a saporin-conjugated antibody to Mac1, we demonstrate a causal role for microglia in the development, but not maintenance, of morphine tolerance in male rats. Increased P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) activity is a cardinal feature of microglial activation, and in this study we found that morphine potentiates P2X7R-mediated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; responses in resident spinal microglia acutely isolated from morphine tolerant rats. The increased P2X7R function was blocked in cultured microglia by PP2, a Src family protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor. We identified Src family kinase activation mediated by μ-receptors as a key mechanistic step required for morphine potentiation of P2X7R function. Furthermore, we show by site-directed mutagenesis that tyrosine (Y&lt;sub&gt;382–384&lt;/sub&gt;) within the P2X7R C-terminus is differentially modulated by repeated morphine treatment and has no bearing on normal P2X7R function. Intrathecal administration of a palmitoylated peptide corresponding to the Y&lt;sub&gt;382–384&lt;/sub&gt; site suppressed morphine-induced microglial reactivity and preserved the antinociceptive effects of morphine in male rats. Thus, site-specific regulation of P2X7R function mediated by Y&lt;sub&gt;382–384&lt;/sub&gt; is a novel cellular determinant of the microglial response to morphine that critically underlies the development of morphine analgesic tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Controlling pain is one of the most difficult challenges in medicine and its management is a requirement of a large diversity of illnesses. Although morphine and other opioids offer dramatic and impressive relief of pain, their impact is truncated by loss of efficacy (analgesic tolerance). Understanding why this occurs and how to prevent it are of critical importance in improving pain therapies. We uncovered a novel site (Y&lt;sub&gt;382–384&lt;/sub&gt;) within the P2X7 receptor that can be targeted to blunt the development of morphine analgesic tolerance, without affecting normal P2X7 receptor function. Our findings provide a critical missing mechanistic piece, site-specific modulation by Y&lt;sub&gt;382–384&lt;/sub&gt;, that unifies P2X7R function to the activation of spinal microglia and the development of morphine tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Primary Generators of Visually Evoked Field Potentials Recorded in the Macaque Auditory Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Prior studies have reported &quot;local&quot; field potential (LFP) responses to faces in the macaque auditory cortex and have suggested that such face-LFPs may be substrates of audiovisual integration. However, although field potentials (FPs) may reflect the synaptic currents of neurons near the recording electrode, due to the use of a distant reference electrode, they often reflect those of synaptic activity occurring in distant sites as well. Thus, FP recordings within a given brain region (e.g., auditory cortex) may be &quot;contaminated&quot; by activity generated elsewhere in the brain. To determine whether face responses are indeed generated within macaque auditory cortex, we recorded FPs and concomitant multiunit activity with linear array multielectrodes across auditory cortex in three macaques (one female), and applied current source density (CSD) analysis to the laminar FP profile. CSD analysis revealed no appreciable local generator contribution to the visual FP in auditory cortex, although we did note an increase in the amplitude of visual FP with cortical depth, suggesting that their generators are located below auditory cortex. In the underlying inferotemporal cortex, we found polarity inversions of the main visual FP components accompanied by robust CSD responses and large-amplitude multiunit activity. These results indicate that face-evoked FP responses in auditory cortex are not generated locally but are volume-conducted from other face-responsive regions. In broader terms, our results underscore the caution that, unless far-field contamination is removed, LFPs in general may reflect such &quot;far-field&quot; activity, in addition to, or in absence of, local synaptic responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Field potentials (FPs) can index neuronal population activity that is not evident in action potentials. However, due to volume conduction, FPs may reflect activity in distant neurons superimposed upon that of neurons close to the recording electrode. This is problematic as the default assumption is that FPs originate from local activity, and thus are termed &quot;local&quot; (LFP). We examine this general problem in the context of previously reported face-evoked FPs in macaque auditory cortex. Our findings suggest that face-FPs are indeed generated in the underlying inferotemporal cortex and volume-conducted to the auditory cortex. The note of caution raised by these findings is of particular importance for studies that seek to assign FP/LFP recordings to specific cortical layers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Contralateral Bias of High Spatial Frequency Tuning and Cardinal Direction Selectivity in Mouse Visual Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/42/10125?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Binocular mechanisms for visual processing are thought to enhance spatial acuity by combining matched input from the two eyes. Studies in the primary visual cortex of carnivores and primates have confirmed that eye-specific neuronal response properties are largely matched. In recent years, the mouse has emerged as a prominent model for binocular visual processing, yet little is known about the spatial frequency tuning of binocular responses in mouse visual cortex. Using calcium imaging in awake mice of both sexes, we show that the spatial frequency preference of cortical responses to the contralateral eye is ~35% higher than responses to the ipsilateral eye. Furthermore, we find that neurons in binocular visual cortex that respond only to the contralateral eye are tuned to higher spatial frequencies. Binocular neurons that are well matched in spatial frequency preference are also matched in orientation preference. In contrast, we observe that binocularly mismatched cells are more mismatched in orientation tuning. Furthermore, we find that contralateral responses are more direction-selective than ipsilateral responses and are strongly biased to the cardinal directions. The contralateral bias of high spatial frequency tuning was found in both awake and anesthetized recordings. The distinct properties of contralateral cortical responses may reflect the functional segregation of direction-selective, high spatial frequency-preferring neurons in earlier stages of the central visual pathway. Moreover, these results suggest that the development of binocularity and visual acuity may engage distinct circuits in the mouse visual system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Seeing through two eyes is thought to improve visual acuity by enhancing sensitivity to fine edges. Using calcium imaging of cellular responses in awake mice, we find surprising asymmetries in the spatial processing of eye-specific visual input in binocular primary visual cortex. The contralateral visual pathway is tuned to higher spatial frequencies than the ipsilateral pathway. At the highest spatial frequencies, the contralateral pathway strongly prefers to respond to visual stimuli along the cardinal (horizontal and vertical) axes. These results suggest that monocular, and not binocular, mechanisms set the limit of spatial acuity in mice. Furthermore, they suggest that the development of visual acuity and binocularity in mice involves different circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Interplay between Long- and Short-Range Temporal Correlations Shapes Cortex Dynamics across Vigilance States</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/42/10114?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Increasing evidence suggests that cortical dynamics during wake exhibits long-range temporal correlations suitable to integrate inputs over extended periods of time to increase the signal-to-noise ratio in decision making and working memory tasks. Accordingly, sleep has been suggested as a state characterized by a breakdown of long-range correlations. However, detailed measurements of neuronal timescales that support this view have so far been lacking. Here, we show that the cortical timescales measured at the individual neuron level in freely behaving male rats change as a function of vigilance state and time awake. Although quiet wake and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep are characterized by similar, long timescales, these long timescales are abrogated in non-REM sleep. We observe that cortex dynamics exhibits rapid transitions between long-timescale states and sleep-like states governed by short timescales even during wake. This becomes particularly evident during sleep deprivation, when the interplay between these states can lead to an increasing disruption of long timescales that are restored after sleep. Experiments and modeling identify the intrusion of neuronal offline periods as a mechanism that disrupts the long timescales arising from reverberating cortical network activity. Our results provide novel mechanistic and functional links among behavioral manifestations of sleep, wake, and sleep deprivation and specific measurable changes in the network dynamics relevant for characterizing the brain's changing information-processing capabilities. They suggest a network-level function of sleep to reorganize cortical networks toward states governed by long timescales to ensure efficient information integration for the time awake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Lack of sleep deteriorates several key cognitive functions, yet the neuronal underpinnings of these deficits have remained elusive. Cognitive capabilities are generally believed to benefit from a neural circuit's ability to reliably integrate information. Persistent network activity characterized by long timescales may provide the basis for this integration in cortex. Here, we show that long-range temporal correlations indicated by slowly decaying autocorrelation functions in neuronal activity are dependent on vigilance states. Although wake and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep exhibit long timescales, these long-range correlations break down during non-REM sleep. Our findings thus suggest two distinct states in terms of timescale dynamics. During extended wake, the rapid switching to sleep-like states with short timescales can lead to an overall decline in cortical timescales.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Approaching the Ground Truth: Revealing the Functional Organization of Human Multisensory STC Using Ultra-High Field fMRI</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Integrating inputs across sensory systems is a property of the brain that is vitally important in everyday life. More than two decades of fMRI research have revealed crucial insights on multisensory processing, yet the multisensory operations at the neuronal level in humans have remained largely unknown. Understanding the fine-scale spatial organization of multisensory brain regions is fundamental to shed light on their neuronal operations. Monkey electrophysiology revealed that the bimodal superior temporal cortex (bSTC) is topographically organized according to the modality preference (visual, auditory, and bimodal) of its neurons. In line with invasive studies, a previous 3 Tesla fMRI study suggests that the human bSTC is also topographically organized according to modality preference (visual, auditory, and bimodal) when analyzed at 1.6 &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; 1.6 &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; 1.6 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; voxel resolution. However, it is still unclear whether this resolution is able to unveil an accurate spatial organization of the human bSTC. This issue was addressed in the present study by investigating the spatial organization of functional responses of the bSTC in 10 participants (from both sexes) at 1.5 &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; 1.5 &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; 1.5 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and 1.1 &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; 1.1 &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; 1.1 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; using ultra-high field fMRI (at 7 Tesla). Relative to 1.5 &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; 1.5 &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; 1.5 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, the bSTC at 1.1 &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; 1.1 &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; 1.1 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; resolution was characterized by a larger selectivity for visual and auditory modalities, stronger integrative responses in bimodal voxels, and it was organized in more distinct functional clusters indicating a more precise separation of underlying neuronal clusters. Our findings indicate that increasing the spatial resolution may be necessary and sufficient to achieve a more accurate functional topography of human multisensory integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The bimodal superior temporal cortex (bSTC) is a brain region that plays a crucial role in the integration of visual and auditory inputs. The aim of the present study was to investigate the fine-scale spatial organization of the bSTC by using ultra-high magnetic field fMRI at 7 Tesla. Mapping the functional topography of bSTC at a resolution of 1.1 &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; 1.1 &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; 1.1 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; revealed more accurate representations than at lower resolutions. This result indicates that standard-resolution fMRI may lead to wrong conclusions about the functional organization of the bSTC, whereas high spatial resolution is essential to more accurately approach neuronal operations of human multisensory integration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Visual Experience Shapes the Neural Networks Remapping Touch into External Space</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Localizing touch relies on the activation of skin-based and externally defined spatial frames of reference. Psychophysical studies have demonstrated that early visual deprivation prevents the automatic remapping of touch into external space. We used fMRI to characterize how visual experience impacts the brain circuits dedicated to the spatial processing of touch. Sighted and congenitally blind humans performed a tactile temporal order judgment (TOJ) task, either with the hands uncrossed or crossed over the body midline. Behavioral data confirmed that crossing the hands has a detrimental effect on TOJ judgments in sighted but not in early blind people. Crucially, the crossed hand posture elicited enhanced activity, when compared with the uncrossed posture, in a frontoparietal network in the sighted group only. Psychophysiological interaction analysis revealed, however, that the congenitally blind showed enhanced functional connectivity between parietal and frontal regions in the crossed versus uncrossed hand postures. Our results demonstrate that visual experience scaffolds the neural implementation of the location of touch in space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In daily life, we seamlessly localize touch in external space for action planning toward a stimulus making contact with the body. For efficient sensorimotor integration, the brain has therefore to compute the current position of our limbs in the external world. In the present study, we demonstrate that early visual deprivation alters the brain activity in a dorsal parietofrontal network typically supporting touch localization in the sighted. Our results therefore conclusively demonstrate the intrinsic role that developmental vision plays in scaffolding the neural implementation of touch perception.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Rubrocerebellar Feedback Loop Isolates the Interposed Nucleus as an Independent Processor of Corollary Discharge Information in Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding cerebellar contributions to motor coordination requires deeper insight into how the output structures of the cerebellum, the cerebellar nuclei, integrate their inputs and influence downstream motor pathways. The magnocellular red nucleus (RNm), a brainstem premotor structure, is a major target of the interposed nucleus (IN), and has also been described in previous studies to send feedback collaterals to the cerebellum. Because such a pathway is in a key position to provide motor efferent information to the cerebellum, satisfying predictions about the use of corollary discharge in cerebellar computations, we studied it in mice of both sexes. Using anterograde viral tracing, we show that innervation of cerebellum by rubrospinal neuron collaterals is remarkably selective for the IN compared with the cerebellar cortex. Optogenetic activation of the pathway in acute mouse brain slices drove IN activity despite small amplitude synaptic currents, suggesting an active role in IN information processing. Monosynaptic transsynaptic rabies tracing indicated the pathway contacts multiple cell types within the IN. By contrast, IN inputs to the RNm targeted a region that lacked inhibitory neurons. Optogenetic drive of IN inputs to the RNm revealed strong, direct excitation but no inhibition of RNm neurons. Together, these data indicate that the cerebellar nuclei are under afferent control independent of the cerebellar cortex, potentially diversifying its roles in motor control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The common assumption that all cerebellar mossy fibers uniformly collateralize to the cerebellar nuclei and cortex underlies classic models of convergent Purkinje influence on cerebellar output. Specifically, mossy fibers are thought to both directly excite nuclear neurons and drive polysynaptic feedforward inhibition via Purkinje neurons, setting up a fundamental computational unit. Here we present data that challenge this rule. A dedicated cerebellar nuclear afferent comprised of feedback collaterals from premotor rubrospinal neurons can directly modulate IN output independent of Purkinje cell modulation. In contrast to the IN-RNm pathway, the RNm-IN feedback pathway targets multiple cell types, potentially influencing both motor output pathways and nucleo-olivary feedback.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Visual Motion Discrimination by Propagating Patterns in Primate Cerebral Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Visual stimuli can evoke waves of neural activity that propagate across the surface of visual cortical areas. The relevance of these waves for visual processing is unknown. Here, we measured the phase and amplitude of local field potentials (LFPs) in electrode array recordings from the motion-processing medial temporal (MT) area of anesthetized male marmosets. Animals viewed grating or dot-field stimuli drifting in different directions. We found that, on individual trials, the direction of LFP wave propagation is sensitive to the direction of stimulus motion. Propagating LFP patterns are also detectable in trial-averaged activity, but the trial-averaged patterns exhibit different dynamics and behaviors from those in single trials and are similar across motion directions. We show that this difference arises because stimulus-sensitive propagating patterns are present in the phase of single-trial oscillations, whereas the trial-averaged signal is dominated by additive amplitude effects. Our results demonstrate that propagating LFP patterns can represent sensory inputs at timescales relevant to visually guided behaviors and raise the possibility that propagating activity patterns serve neural information processing in area MT and other cortical areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Propagating wave patterns are widely observed in the cortex, but their functional relevance remains unknown. We show here that visual stimuli generate propagating wave patterns in local field potentials (LFPs) in a movement-sensitive area of the primate cortex and that the propagation direction of these patterns is sensitive to stimulus motion direction. We also show that averaging LFP signals across multiple stimulus presentations (trial averaging) yields propagating patterns that capture different dynamic properties of the LFP response and show negligible direction sensitivity. Our results demonstrate that sensory stimuli can modulate propagating wave patterns reliably in the cortex. The relevant dynamics are normally masked by trial averaging, which is a conventional step in LFP signal processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dopamine D2 Receptors Modulate Pyramidal Neurons in Mouse Medial Prefrontal Cortex through a Stimulatory G-Protein Pathway</title>

	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/42/10063?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dopaminergic modulation of prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to play key roles in many cognitive functions and to be disrupted in pathological conditions, such as schizophrenia. We have previously described a phenomenon whereby dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) activation elicits afterdepolarizations (ADPs) in subcortically projecting (SC) pyramidal neurons within L5 of the PFC. These D2R-induced ADPs only occur following synaptic input, which activates NMDARs, even when the delay between the synaptic input and ADPs is relatively long (e.g., several hundred milliseconds). Here, we use a combination of electrophysiological, optogenetic, pharmacological, transgenic, and chemogenetic approaches to elucidate cellular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon in male and female mice. We find that knocking out D2Rs eliminates the ADP in a cell-autonomous fashion, confirming that this ADP depends on D2Rs. Hyperpolarizing current injection, but not AMPA receptor blockade, prevents synaptic stimulation from facilitating D2R-induced ADPs, suggesting that this phenomenon depends on the recruitment of voltage-dependent currents (e.g., NMDAR-mediated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx) by synaptic input. Finally, the D2R-induced ADP is blocked by inhibitors of cAMP/PKA signaling, insensitive to pertussis toxin or β-arrestin knock-out, and mimicked by G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;-DREADD stimulation, suggesting that D2R activation elicits the ADP by stimulating cAMP/PKA signaling. These results show that this unusual physiological phenomenon, in which D2Rs enhance cellular excitability in a manner that depends on synaptic input, is mediated at the cellular level through the recruitment of signaling pathways associated with G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;, rather than the G&lt;sub&gt;i/o&lt;/sub&gt;-associated mechanisms that have classically been ascribed to D2Rs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are thought to play important roles in behaviors, including working memory and cognitive flexibility. Variation in D2Rs has also been implicated in schizophrenia, Tourette syndrome, and bipolar disorder. Recently, we described a new mechanism through which D2R activation can enhance the excitability of pyramidal neurons in the PFC. Here, we explore the underlying cellular mechanisms. Surprisingly, although D2Rs are classically assumed to signal through G&lt;sub&gt;i/o&lt;/sub&gt;-coupled G-proteins and/or scaffolding proteins, such as β-arrestin, we find that the effects of D2Rs on prefrontal pyramidal neurons are actually mediated by pathways associated with G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated signaling. Furthermore, we show how, via this D2R-dependent phenomenon, synaptic input can enhance the excitability of prefrontal neurons over timescales on the order of seconds. These results elucidate cellular mechanisms underlying a novel signaling pathway downstream of D2Rs that may contribute to prefrontal function under normal and pathological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Disruption of Bmal1 Impairs Blood-Brain Barrier Integrity via Pericyte Dysfunction</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/42/10052?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Circadian rhythm disturbances are well established in neurological diseases. However, how these disruptions cause homeostatic imbalances remains poorly understood. Brain and muscle aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein 1 (Bmal1) is a major circadian clock transcriptional activator, and Bmal1 deficiency in male &lt;i&gt;Bmal1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;nestin&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice induced marked astroglial activation without affecting the number of astrocytes in the brain and spinal cord. Bmal1 deletion caused blood–brain barrier (BBB) hyperpermeability with an age-dependent loss of pericyte coverage of blood vessels in the brain. Using Nestin-green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic mice, we determined that pericytes are Nestin-GFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in the adult brain. Bmal1 deletion caused Nestin-GFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; pericyte dysfunction, including the downregulation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ), a protein necessary for maintaining BBB integrity. Knockdown of Bmal1 downregulated PDGFRβ transcription in the brain pericyte cell line. Thus, the circadian clock component Bmal1 maintains BBB integrity via regulating pericytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Circadian rhythm disturbances may play a role in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. Our results revealed that one of the circadian clock components maintains the integrity of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) by regulating vascular-embedded pericytes. These cells were recently identified as a vital component for the control of BBB permeability and cerebral blood flow. Our present study demonstrates the involvement of circadian clock component Bmal1 in BBB homeostasis and highlights the role of Bmal1 dysfunction in multiple neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Conditional Deletion of the L-Type Calcium Channel Cav1.2 in NG2-Positive Cells Impairs Remyelination in Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Exploring the molecular mechanisms that drive the maturation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) during the remyelination process is essential to developing new therapeutic tools to intervene in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. To determine whether L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (L-VGCCs) are required for OPC development during remyelination, we generated an inducible conditional knock-out mouse in which the L-VGCC isoform Cav1.2 was deleted in NG2-positive OPCs (Cav1.2&lt;sup&gt;KO&lt;/sup&gt;). Using the cuprizone (CPZ) model of demyelination and mice of either sex, we establish that Cav1.2 deletion in OPCs leads to less efficient remyelination of the adult brain. Specifically, Cav1.2&lt;sup&gt;KO&lt;/sup&gt; OPCs mature slower and produce less myelin than control oligodendrocytes during the recovery period after CPZ intoxication. This reduced remyelination was accompanied by an important decline in the number of myelinating oligodendrocytes and in the rate of OPC proliferation. Furthermore, during the remyelination phase of the CPZ model, the corpus callosum of Cav1.2&lt;sup&gt;KO&lt;/sup&gt; animals presented a significant decrease in the percentage of myelinated axons and a substantial increase in the mean g-ratio of myelinated axons compared with controls. In addition, in a mouse line in which the Cav1.2&lt;sup&gt;KO&lt;/sup&gt; OPCs were identified by a &lt;i&gt;Cre&lt;/i&gt; reporter, we establish that Cav1.2&lt;sup&gt;KO&lt;/sup&gt; OPCs display a reduced maturational rate through the entire remyelination process. These results suggest that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx mediated by L-VGCCs in oligodendroglial cells is necessary for normal remyelination and is an essential Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel for OPC maturation during the remyelination of the adult brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Ion channels implicated in oligodendrocyte differentiation and maturation may induce positive signals for myelin recovery. Voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels (VGCCs) are important for normal myelination by acting at several critical steps during oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) development. To determine whether voltage Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry is involved in oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination, we used a conditional knockout mouse for VGCCs in OPCs. Our results indicate that VGCCs can modulate oligodendrocyte maturation in the demyelinated brain and suggest that voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx in OPCs is critical for remyelination. These findings could lead to novel approaches for obtaining a better understanding of the factors that control OPC maturation in order to stimulate this pool of progenitors to replace myelin in demyelinating diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal cognitive map---a neuronal representation of the spatial
environment---is broadly discussed in the computational neuroscience literature
for decades. More recent studies point out that hippocampus plays a major role
in producing yet another cognitive framework that incorporates not only
spatial, but also nonspatial memories---the memory space. However, unlike
cognitive maps, memory spaces have been barely studied from a theoretical
perspective. Here we propose an approach for modeling hippocampal memory spaces
as an epiphenomenon of neuronal spiking activity. First, we suggest that the
memory space may be viewed as a finite topological space---a hypothesis that
allows treating both spatial and nonspatial aspects of hippocampal function on
equal footing. We then model the topological properties of the memory space to
demonstrate that this concept naturally incorporates the notion of a cognitive
map. Lastly, we suggest a formal description of the memory consolidation
process and point out a connection between the proposed model of the memory
spaces to the so-called Morris' schemas, which emerge as the most compact
representation of the memory structure.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;How choices are made within noisy environments is a central question in the
neuroscience of decision making. Previous work has characterized temporal
accumulation of evidence for decision-making in static environments. However,
real-world decision-making involves environments with statistics that change
over time. This requires discounting old evidence that may no longer inform the
current state of the world. Here we designed a rat behavioral task with a
dynamic environment, to probe whether rodents can optimally discount evidence
by adapting the timescale over which they accumulate it. Extending existing
results about optimal inference in a dynamic environment, we show that the
optimal timescale for evidence discounting depends on both the stimulus
statistics and noise in sensory processing. We found that when both of these
components were taken into account, rats accumulated and temporally discounted
evidence almost optimally. Furthermore, we found that by changing the dynamics
of the environment, experimenters could control the rats' accumulation
timescale, switching them from accumulating over short timescales to
accumulating over long timescales and back. The theoretical framework also
makes quantitative predictions regarding the timing of changes of mind in the
dynamic environment. This study establishes a quantitative behavioral framework
to control and investigate neural mechanisms underlying the adaptive nature of
evidence accumulation timescales and changes of mind.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We develop a unified theory that encompasses the macroscopic dynamics of
recurrent interactions of binary units within arbitrary network architectures.
Using the martingale theory, our mathematical analysis provides a complete
description of nonequilibrium fluctuations in networks with finite size and
finite degree of interactions. Our approach allows the investigation of systems
for which a deterministic mean-field theory breaks down. To demonstrate this,
we uncover a novel dynamic state in which a recurrent network of binary units
with statistically inhomogeneous interactions, along with an asynchronous
behavior, also exhibits collective nontrivial stochastic fluctuations in the
thermodynamical limit.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A quadratically regularized functional canonical correlation analysis for identifying the global structure of pleiotropy with NGS data</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Nan Lin, Yun Zhu, Ruzong Fan, Momiao Xiong&lt;/p&gt;

Investigating the pleiotropic effects of genetic variants can increase statistical power, provide important information to achieve deep understanding of the complex genetic structures of disease, and offer powerful tools for designing effective treatments with fewer side effects. However, the current multiple phenotype association analysis paradigm lacks breadth (number of phenotypes and genetic variants jointly analyzed at the same time) and depth (hierarchical structure of phenotype and genotypes). A key issue for high dimensional pleiotropic analysis is to effectively extract informative internal representation and features from high dimensional genotype and phenotype data. To explore correlation information of genetic variants, effectively reduce data dimensions, and overcome critical barriers in advancing the development of novel statistical methods and computational algorithms for genetic pleiotropic analysis, we proposed a new statistic method referred to as a quadratically regularized functional CCA (QRFCCA) for association analysis which combines three approaches: (1) quadratically regularized matrix factorization, (2) functional data analysis and (3) canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Large-scale simulations show that the QRFCCA has a much higher power than that of the ten competing statistics while retaining the appropriate type 1 errors. To further evaluate performance, the QRFCCA and ten other statistics are applied to the whole genome sequencing dataset from the TwinsUK study. We identify a total of 79 genes with rare variants and 67 genes with common variants significantly associated with the 46 traits using QRFCCA. The results show that the QRFCCA substantially outperforms the ten other statistics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/o8lOFnQ0TmI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>In plants, apical meristems allow continuous growth along the body axis. Within the root apical meristem, a group of slowly dividing quiescent center cells is thought to limit stem cell activity to directly neighboring cells, thus endowing them with unique properties, distinct from displaced daughters. This binary identity of the...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/DJcEr-zqK3I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>The factors and steps controlling postinfection CD8+ T cell terminal effector versus memory differentiation are incompletely understood. Whereas we found that naive TCF7 (alias “Tcf-1”) expression is FOXO1 independent, early postinfection we report bimodal, FOXO1-dependent expression of the memory-essential transcription factor TCF7 in pathogen-specific CD8+ T cells.

	<description>Nuclear RNA interference (RNAi) is mediated by the canonical RNAi machinery and can lead to transcriptional silencing, transcriptional activation, or modulation of alternative splicing patterns. These effects transpire through changes in histone and DNA modifications via RNAi-mediated recruitment of chromatin-modifying enzymes.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Correlated microtiming deviations in jazz and rock music. (arXiv:1710.05608v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05608</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05608</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Musical rhythms performed by humans typically show temporal fluctuations.
While they have been characterized in simple rhythmic tasks, it is an open
question what is the nature of temporal fluctuations, when several musicians
perform music jointly in all its natural complexity. To study such fluctuations
in over 100 original jazz and rock/pop recordings played with and without
metronome we developed a semi-automated workflow allowing the extraction of
cymbal beat onsets with millisecond precision. Analyzing the inter-beat
interval (IBI) time series revealed evidence for two long-range correlated
processes characterized by power laws in the IBI power spectral densities. One
process dominates on short timescales ($t &amp;lt; 8$ beats) and reflects microtiming
variability in the generation of single beats. The other dominates on longer
timescales and reflects slow tempo variations. Whereas the latter did not show
differences between musical genres (jazz vs. rock/pop), the process on short
timescales showed higher variability for jazz recordings, indicating that jazz
makes stronger use of microtiming fluctuations within a measure than rock/pop.
Our results elucidate principles of rhythmic performance and can inspire
algorithms for artificial music generation. By studying microtiming
fluctuations in original music recordings, we bridge the gap between
minimalistic tapping paradigms and expressive rhythmic performances.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: REM sleep complicates period adding bifurcations from monophasic to polyphasic sleep behavior in a sleep-wake regulatory network model for human sleep. (arXiv:1710.05494v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05494</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05494</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The structure of human sleep changes across development as it consolidates
from the polyphasic sleep of infants to the single nighttime sleep period
typical in adults. Across this same developmental period, time scales of the
homeostatic sleep drive, the physiological drive to sleep that increases with
time spent awake, also change and presumably govern the transition from
polyphasic to monophasic sleep behavior. Using a physiologically-based,
sleep-wake regulatory network model for human sleep, we investigated the
dynamics of wake, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and non-REM (NREM) sleep
during this transition by varying the homeostatic sleep drive time constants.
Previously, we introduced an algorithm for constructing a one-dimensional
circle map that represents the dynamics of the full sleep-wake network model.
By tracking bifurcations in the piecewise continuous circle map as the
homeostatic sleep drive time constants are varied, we establish evidence for a
border collision bifurcation that results in period-adding-like behavior in the
number of sleep cycles per day. Interestingly, this bifurcation is preceded by
bifurcations in the number of REM bouts per sleep cycle that exhibit truncated
period-adding-like behavior. The interaction of these bifurcations in numbers
of sleep episodes and numbers of REM bouts per sleep episode generate
non-monotonic variation in sleep cycle patterns as well as quasi-periodic
patterns during the transition from polyphasic to monophasic sleep behavior.
This analysis may have implications for understanding changes in sleep in early
childhood when preschoolers transition from napping to non-napping behavior,
and the wide interindividual variation observed during this transition.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A Percolation-based Thresholding Method with Applications in Functional Connectivity Analysis. (arXiv:1710.05292v1 [q-bio.QM])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05292</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05292</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite the recent advances in developing more effective thresholding methods
to convert weighted networks to unweighted counterparts, there are still
several limitations that need to be addressed. One such limitation is the
inability of the most existing thresholding methods to take into account the
topological properties of the original weighted networks during the
binarization process, which could ultimately result in unweighted networks that
have drastically different topological properties than the original weighted
networks. In this study, we propose a new thresholding method based on the
percolation theory to address this limitation. The performance of the proposed
method was validated and compared to the existing thresholding methods using
simulated and real-world functional connectivity networks in the brain.
Comparison of macroscopic and microscopic properties of the resulted unweighted
networks to the original weighted networks suggest that the proposed
thresholding method can successfully maintain the topological properties of the
original weighted networks.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Shared High Value Research Resources: The CamCAN Human Lifespan Neuroimaging Dataset Processed on the Open Science Grid. (arXiv:1710.05246v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05246</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05246</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The CamCAN Lifespan Neuroimaging Dataset, Cambridge (UK) Centre for Ageing
and Neuroscience, was acquired and processed beginning in December, 2016. The
referee consensus solver deployed to the Open Science Grid was used for this
task. The dataset includes demographic and screening measures, a
high-resolution MRI scan of the brain, and whole-head magnetoencephalographic
(MEG) recordings during eyes closed rest (560 sec), a simple task (540 sec),
and passive listening/viewing (140 sec). The data were collected from 619
neurologically normal individuals, ages 18-87. The processed results from the
resting recordings are completed and available online. These constitute 1.7
TBytes of data including the location within the brain (1 mm resolution), time
stamp (1 msec resolution), and 80 msec time course for each of 3.7 billion
validated neuroelectric events, i.e. mean 6.1 million events for each of the
619 participants.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The referee consensus solver provides high yield (mean 11,000 neuroelectric
currents/sec; standard deviation (sd): 3500/sec) high confidence (p &amp;lt; 10-12 for
each identified current) measures of the neuroelectric currents whose magnetic
fields are detected in the MEG recordings. We describe the solver, the
implementation of the solver deployed on the Open Science Grid, the workflow
management system, the opportunistic use of high performance computing (HPC)
resources to add computing capacity to the Open Science Grid reserved for this
project, and our initial findings from the recently completed processing of the
resting recordings. This required 14 million core hours, i.e. 40 core hours per

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Emergence of a Balanced Core through Dynamical Competition in Heterogeneous Neuronal Networks. (arXiv:1710.05201v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The balance between excitation and inhibition is crucial for neuronal
computation. It is observed that the balanced state of neuronal networks exists
in many experiments, yet its underlying mechanism remains to be fully
clarified. Theoretical studies of the balanced state mainly focus on the
analysis of the homogeneous Erd$\ddot{\text{o}}$s-R\'enyi network. However,
neuronal networks have been found to be inhomogeneous in many cortical areas.
In particular, the connectivity of neuronal networks can be of the type of
scale-free, small-world, or even with specific motifs. In this work, we examine
the questions of whether the balanced state is universal with respect to
network topology and what characteristics the balanced state possesses in
inhomogeneous networks such as scale-free and small-world networks. We discover
that, for a sparsely but strongly connected inhomogeneous network, despite that
the whole network receives external inputs, there is a small active subnetwork
(active core) inherently embedded within it. The neurons in this active core
have relatively high firing rates while the neurons in the rest of the network
are quiescent. Surprisingly, the active core possesses a balanced state and
this state is independent of the model of single-neuron dynamics. The dynamics
of the active core can be well predicted using the Fokker-Planck equation with
the mean-field assumption. Our results suggest that, in the presence of
inhomogeneous network connectivity, the balanced state may be ubiquitous in the
brain, and the network connectivity in the active core is essentially close to
the Erd$\ddot{\text{o}}$s-R\'enyi structure. The existence of the small active
core embedded in a large network may provide a potential dynamical scenario
underlying sparse coding in neuronal networks.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We introduce a graphical method originating from the computer graphics domain
that is used for the arbitrary and intuitive placement of cells over a
two-dimensional manifold. Using a bitmap image as input, where the color
indicates the identity of the different structures and the alpha channel
indicates the local cell density, this method guarantees a discrete
distribution of cell position respecting the local density function. This
method scales to any number of cells, allows to specify several different
structures at once with arbitrary shapes and provides a scalable and versatile
alternative to the more classical assumption of a uniform non-spatial
distribution. Furthermore, several connection schemes can be derived from the
paired distances between cells using either an automatic mapping or a
user-defined local reference frame, providing new computational properties for
the underlying model. The method is illustrated on a discrete homogeneous
neural field, on the distribution of cones and rods in the retina and on a
coronal view of the basal ganglia.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent years have seen dramatic progress in the development of techniques for
measuring the activity and connectivity of large populations of neurons in the
brain. However, as these techniques grow ever more powerful---allowing us to
even contemplate measuring every neuron in entire brain---a new problem arises:
how do we make sense of the mountains of data that these techniques produce?
Here, we argue that the time is ripe for building an intermediate or
&quot;mesoscale&quot; computational theory that can bridge between single-cell
(microscale) accounts of neural function and behavioral (macroscale) accounts
of animal cognition and environmental complexity. Just as digital accounts of
computation in conventional computers abstract away the non-essential dynamics
of the analog circuits that implementing gates and registers, so too a
computational account of animal cognition can afford to abstract from the
non-essential dynamics of neurons. We argue that the geometry of neural
circuits is essential in explaining the computational limitations and
technological innovations inherent in biological information processing. We
propose a blueprint for how to employ tools from modern machine learning to
automatically infer a satisfying mesoscale account of neural computation that
combines functional and structural data, with an emphasis on learning and
exploiting regularity and repeating motifs in neuronal circuits. Rather than
suggest a specific theory, we present a new class of scientific instruments
that can enable neuroscientists to design, propose, implement and test
mesoscale theories of neural computation.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A New Framework for Determination of Excitatory and Inhibitory Conductances Using Somatic Clamp. (arXiv:1710.05113v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The interaction between excitation and inhibition is crucial for brain
computation. To understand synaptic mechanisms underlying brain function, it is
important to separate excitatory and inhibitory inputs to a target neuron. In
the traditional method, after applying somatic current or voltage clamp, the
excitatory and inhibitory conductances are determined from the synaptic
current-voltage (I-V) relation --- the slope corresponds to the total
conductance and the intercept corresponds to the reversal current. Because of
the space clamp effect, the measured conductance in general deviates
substantially from the local conductance on the dendrite. Therefore, the
interpretation of the conductance measured by the traditional method remains to
be clarified. In this work, based on the investigation of an idealized
ball-and-stick neuron model and a biologically realistic pyramidal neuron
model, we first demonstrate both analytically and numerically that the
conductance determined by the traditional method has no clear biological
interpretation due to the neglect of a nonlinear interaction between the clamp
current and the synaptic current across the spatial dendrites. As a
consequence, the traditional method can induce an arbitrarily large error of
conductance measurement, sometimes even leads to unphysically negative
conductance. To circumvent the difficulty of elucidating synaptic impact on
neuronal computation using the traditional method, we then propose a framework
to determine the effective conductance that reflects directly the functional
impact of synaptic inputs on action potential initiation and thereby neuronal
information processing. Our framework has been further verified in realistic
neuron simulations, thus greatly improves upon the traditional approach by
providing a reliable and accurate assessment of the role of synaptic activity
in neuronal computation.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The interplay between excitatory and inhibitory neurons imparts rich
functions of the brain. To understand the underlying synaptic mechanisms, a
fundamental approach is to study the dynamics of excitatory and inhibitory
conductances of each neuron. The traditional method of determining conductance
employs the synaptic current-voltage (I-V) relation obtained via voltage clamp.
Using theoretical analysis, electrophysiological experiments, and realistic
simulations, here we demonstrate that the traditional method conceptually fails
to measure the conductance due to the neglect of a nonlinear interaction
between the clamp current and the synaptic current. Consequently, it incurs
substantial measurement error, even giving rise to unphysically negative
conductance as observed in experiments. To elucidate synaptic impact on
neuronal information processing, we introduce the concept of effective
conductance and propose a framework to determine it accurately. Our work
suggests re-examination of previous studies involving conductance measurement
and provides a reliable approach to assess synaptic influence on neuronal
computation.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The brain has no direct access to physical stimuli, but only to the spiking
activity evoked in sensory organs. It is unclear how the brain can structure
its representation of the world based on differences between those noisy,
correlated responses alone. Here we show how to build a distance map of
responses from the structure of the population activity of retinal ganglion
cells, allowing for the accurate discrimination of distinct visual stimuli from
the retinal response. We introduce the Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machine to
learn the spatiotemporal structure of the population activity, and use this
model to define a distance between spike trains. We show that this metric
outperforms existing neural distances at discriminating pairs of stimuli that
are barely distinguishable. The proposed method provides a generic and
biologically plausible way to learn to associate similar stimuli based on their
spiking responses, without any other knowledge of these stimuli.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03965</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Bias in perceptual decisions comes to pass when the advance knowledge
colludes with the current sensory evidence in support of the final choice. The
literature on decision making suggests two main hypotheses to account for this
kind of bias: internal bias signals are derived from (a) the residual of motor
response-related signals, and (b) the sensory information residues of the
decisions that we made in the past. Beside these hypotheses, a credible
hypothesis proposed by this study to explain the cause of decision biasing,
suggests that the decision-related neuron can make use of the residual
information of the previous decision for the current decision. We demonstrate
the validity of this assumption, first by performing behavioral experiments
based on the two-alternative forced-choice (TAFC) discrimination of motion
direction paradigms and then, we modified the pure drift-diffusion model (DDM)
based on accumulation to the bound mechanism to account for the sequential
effect. In both cases, the trace of the previous trial influences the current
decision. Results indicate that the probability of being correct in a current
decision increases if it is in line with the previously made decision. Also,
the model that keeps the previous decision information provides a better fit to
the behavioral data. Our findings suggest that the state of a decision variable
which is represented in the activity of decision-related neurons after crossing
the bound (in the previous decision) can accumulate with the decision variable
for the current decision in consecutive trials.

The adaptation of the CRISPR-Cas9 system as a genome editing technique has generated much excitement in recent years owing to its ability to manipulate targeted genes and genomic regions that are complementary to a programmed single guide RNA (sgRNA). However, the efficacy of a specific sgRNA is not uniquely defined by exact sequence homology to the target site, thus unintended off-targets might additionally be cleaved. Current methods for sgRNA design are mainly concerned with predicting off-targets for a given sgRNA using basic sequence features and employ elementary rules for ranking possible sgRNAs. Here, we introduce CRISTA (CRISPR Target Assessment), a novel algorithm within the machine learning framework that determines the propensity of a genomic site to be cleaved by a given sgRNA. We show that the predictions made with CRISTA are more accurate than other available methodologies. We further demonstrate that the occurrence of bulges is not a rare phenomenon and should be accounted for in the prediction process. Beyond predicting cleavage efficiencies, the learning process provides inferences regarding patterns that underlie the mechanism of action of the CRISPR-Cas9 system. We discover that attributes that describe the spatial structure and rigidity of the entire genomic site as well as those surrounding the PAM region are a major component of the prediction capabilities.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GOLPfmV6XL8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Integrative clustering is used to identify groups of samples by jointly analysing multiple datasets describing the same set of biological samples, such as gene expression, copy number, methylation etc. Most existing algorithms for integrative clustering assume that there is a shared consistent set of clusters across all datasets, and most of the data samples follow this structure. However in practice, the structure across heterogeneous datasets can be more varied, with clusters being joined in some datasets and separated in others. In this paper, we present a probabilistic clustering method to identify groups across datasets that do not share the same cluster structure. The proposed algorithm, Clusternomics, identifies groups of samples that share their global behaviour across heterogeneous datasets. The algorithm models clusters on the level of individual datasets, while also extracting global structure that arises from the local cluster assignments. Clusters on both the local and the global level are modelled using a hierarchical Dirichlet mixture model to identify structure on both levels. We evaluated the model both on simulated and on real-world datasets. The simulated data exemplifies datasets with varying degrees of common structure. In such a setting Clusternomics outperforms existing algorithms for integrative and consensus clustering. In a real-world application, we used the algorithm for cancer subtyping, identifying subtypes of cancer from heterogeneous datasets. We applied the algorithm to TCGA breast cancer dataset, integrating gene expression, miRNA expression, DNA methylation and proteomics. The algorithm extracted clinically meaningful clusters with significantly different survival probabilities. We also evaluated the algorithm on lung and kidney cancer TCGA datasets with high dimensionality, again showing clinically significant results and scalability of the algorithm.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dGbVYIyHTbc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Effect of sensory and motor connectivity on hand function in pediatric hemiplegia</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: We tested the hypothesis that somatosensory system injury would more strongly affect movement than motor system injury in children with unilateral cerebral palsy (USCP). This hypothesis was based on how somatosensory and corticospinal circuits adapt to injury during development: while the motor system can maintain connections to the impaired hand from the uninjured hemisphere, this doesn't occur in the somatosensory system. As a corollary, cortical injury strongly impairs sensory function, so we hypothesized that cortical lesions would impair hand function more than subcortical lesions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Twenty-four children with unilateral CP had physiological and anatomical measures of the motor and somatosensory systems and lesion classification. Motor physiology was performed with transcranial magnetic stimulation and somatosensory physiology with vibration-evoked EEG potentials. Tractography of the corticospinal tract and the medial lemniscus were performed with diffusion tensor imaging, and lesions were classified by MRI. Anatomical and physiological results were correlated with measures of hand function using two independent statistical methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Children with disruptions in the somatosensory connectivity, and cortical lesions had the most severe upper extremity impairments, particularly somatosensory function. Motor system connectivity was significantly correlated with bimanual function, but not unimanual function or somatosensory function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Both sensory and motor connectivity impact hand function in children with USCP. Somatosensory connectivity could be an important target for recovery of hand function in children with USCP. This article is protected by copyright.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We explore a combinatorial framework which efficiently quantifies the
asymmetries between minima and maxima in local fluctuations of time series. We
firstly showcase its performance by applying it to a battery of synthetic
cases. We find rigorous results on some canonical dynamical models (stochastic
processes with and without correlations, chaotic processes) complemented by
extensive numerical simulations for a range of processes which indicate that
the methodology correctly distinguishes different complex dynamics and
outperforms state of the art metrics in several cases. Subsequently, we apply
this methodology to real-world problems emerging across several disciplines
including cases in neurobiology, finance and climate science. We conclude that
differences between the statistics of local maxima and local minima in time
series are highly informative of the complex underlying dynamics and a
graph-theoretic extraction procedure allows to use these features for
statistical learning purposes.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural-network models of high-level brain functions such as memory recall and
reasoning often rely on the presence of stochasticity. The majority of these
models assumes that each neuron in the functional network is equipped with its
own private source of randomness, often in the form of uncorrelated external
noise. However, both in vivo and in silico, the number of noise sources is
limited due to space and bandwidth constraints. Hence, neurons in large
networks usually need to share noise sources. Here, we show that the resulting
shared-noise correlations can significantly impair the performance of
stochastic network models. We further demonstrate that this problem can be
overcome by using deterministic recurrent neural networks as sources of
stochasticity, exploiting the decorrelating effect of inhibitory feedback.
Consequently, even a single recurrent network of a few hundred neurons can
serve as a natural noise source for large ensembles of functional networks,
each comprising thousands of units. We test the proposed framework for a
diverse set of networks with different dimensionalities and entropies. A
network reproducing handwritten digits with distinct predefined frequencies
demonstrates the practical relevance. Finally, we show that the same design
transfers to functional networks of spiking neurons.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Mutations of KIF14 cause primary microcephaly by impairing cytokinesis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25044</guid>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25044-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH) is a rare condition characterized by a reduced cerebral cortex accompanied with intellectual disability. Mutations in 17 genes have been shown to cause this phenotype. Recently, mutations in &lt;em&gt;CIT,&lt;/em&gt; encoding CRIK (citron rho-interacting kinase)—a component of the central spindle matrix—were added. We aimed at identifying novel MCPH-associated genes and exploring their functional role in pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25044-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linkage analysis and whole exome sequencing were performed in consanguineous and nonconsanguineous MCPH families to identify disease-causing variants. Functional consequences were investigated by RNA studies and on the cellular level using immunofluorescence and microscopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25044-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified homozygous mutations in &lt;em&gt;KIF14&lt;/em&gt; (NM_014875.2;c.263T&amp;gt;A;pLeu88*, c.2480_2482delTTG; p.Val827del, and c.4071G&amp;gt;A;p.Gln1357=) as the likely cause in 3 MCPH families. Furthermore, in a patient presenting with a severe form of primary microcephaly and short stature, we identified compound heterozygous missense mutations in &lt;em&gt;KIF14&lt;/em&gt; (NM_014875.2;c.2545C&amp;gt;G;p.His849Asp and c.3662G&amp;gt;T;p.Gly1221Val). Three of the 5 identified mutations impaired splicing, and 2 resulted in a truncated protein. Intriguingly, &lt;em&gt;Kif14&lt;/em&gt; knockout mice also showed primary microcephaly. Human kinesin-like protein KIF14, a microtubule motor protein, localizes at the midbody to finalize cytokinesis by interacting with CRIK. We found impaired localization of both KIF14 and CRIK at the midbody in patient-derived fibroblasts. Furthermore, we observed a large number of binucleated and apoptotic cells—signs of failed cytokinesis that we also observed in experimentally KIF14-depleted cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25044-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our data corroborate the role of an impaired cytokinesis in the etiology of primary and syndromic microcephaly, as has been proposed by recent findings on &lt;em&gt;CIT&lt;/em&gt; mutations.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Oral Anticoagulation and Functional Outcome after Intracerebral Hemorrhage</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25079</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25079</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Oral Anticoagulation Treatment (OAT) resumption is a therapeutic dilemma in Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH) care, particularly for lobar hemorrhages related to amyloid angiopathy. We sought to determine whether OAT resumption after ICH is associated with long-term outcome, accounting for ICH location (i.e. lobar vs. non-lobar).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We meta-analyzed individual patient data from: 1) the multi-center RETRACE study (n=542); 2) a US-based single-center ICH study (n=261); 3) the Ethnic/Racial Variations of Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ERICH) study (n=209). We determined whether, within one year from ICH, OAT resumption was associated with: 1) mortality; 2) favorable functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] 0-3); stroke incidence. We separately analyzed non-lobar and lobar ICH cases using propensity score matching and Cox regression models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: We included 1012 OAT-related ICH survivors (633 non-lobar and 379 lobar). Among non-lobar ICH survivors 178/633 (28%) resumed OAT, while 86/379 (23%) lobar ICH survivors did. In multivariable analyses OAT resumption after non-lobar ICH was associated with decreased mortality (Hazard Ratio [HR]=0.25, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]=0.14-0.44, p&amp;lt;0.0001) and improved functional outcome (HR=4.22, 95% CI=2.57-6.94, p&amp;lt;0.0001). OAT resumption after lobar ICH was also associated with decreased mortality (HR=0.29, 95% CI=0.17-0.45, p&amp;lt;0.0001) and favorable functional outcome (HR=4.08, 95% CI=2.48-6.72, p&amp;lt;0.0001). Furthermore, OAT resumption was associated with decreased all-cause stroke incidence in both lobar and non-lobar ICH (both p&amp;lt;0.01).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: These results suggest novel evidence of an association between OAT resumption and outcome following ICH, regardless of hematoma location. These findings support conducting randomized trials to explore risks and benefits of OAT resumption after ICH. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The role of glutamate in neuronal ion homeostasis: A case study of spreading depolarization</title>

Simultaneous changes in ion concentrations, glutamate, and cell volume together with exchange of matter between cell network and vasculature are ubiquitous in numerous brain pathologies. A complete understanding of pathological conditions as well as normal brain function, therefore, hinges on elucidating the molecular and cellular pathways involved in these mostly interdependent variations. In this paper, we develop the first computational framework that combines the Hodgkin–Huxley type spiking dynamics, dynamic ion concentrations and glutamate homeostasis, neuronal and astroglial volume changes, and ion exchange with vasculature into a comprehensive model to elucidate the role of glutamate uptake in the dynamics of spreading depolarization (SD)—the electrophysiological event underlying numerous pathologies including migraine, ischemic stroke, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hematoma, and trauma. We are particularly interested in investigating the role of glutamate in the duration and termination of SD caused by K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; perfusion and oxygen-glucose deprivation. Our results demonstrate that glutamate signaling plays a key role in the dynamics of SD, and that impaired glutamate uptake leads to recovery failure of neurons from SD. We confirm predictions from our model experimentally by showing that inhibiting astrocytic glutamate uptake using TFB-TBOA nearly quadruples the duration of SD in layers 2-3 of visual cortical slices from juvenile rats. The model equations are either derived purely from first physical principles of electroneutrality, osmosis, and conservation of particles or a combination of these principles and known physiological facts. Accordingly, we claim that our approach can be used as a future guide to investigate the role of glutamate, ion concentrations, and dynamics cell volume in other brain pathologies and normal brain function.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AsuHPRHYqL0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: BeWith: A Between-Within method to discover relationships between cancer modules via integrated analysis of mutual exclusivity, co-occurrence and functional interactions</title>

The analysis of the mutational landscape of cancer, including mutual exclusivity and co-occurrence of mutations, has been instrumental in studying the disease. We hypothesized that exploring the interplay between co-occurrence, mutual exclusivity, and functional interactions between genes will further improve our understanding of the disease and help to uncover new relations between cancer driving genes and pathways. To this end, we designed a general framework, BeWith, for identifying modules with different combinations of mutation and interaction patterns. We focused on three different settings of the BeWith schema: (i) BeME-WithFun, in which the relations between modules are enriched with mutual exclusivity, while genes within each module are functionally related; (ii) BeME-WithCo, which combines mutual exclusivity between modules with co-occurrence within modules; and (iii) BeCo-WithMEFun, which ensures co-occurrence between modules, while the within module relations combine mutual exclusivity and functional interactions. We formulated the BeWith framework using Integer Linear Programming (ILP), enabling us to find optimally scoring sets of modules. Our results demonstrate the utility of BeWith in providing novel information about mutational patterns, driver genes, and pathways. In particular, BeME-WithFun helped identify functionally coherent modules that might be relevant for cancer progression. In addition to finding previously well-known drivers, the identified modules pointed to other novel findings such as the interaction between NCOR2 and NCOA3 in breast cancer. Additionally, an application of the BeME-WithCo setting revealed that gene groups differ with respect to their vulnerability to different mutagenic processes, and helped us to uncover pairs of genes with potentially synergistic effects, including a potential synergy between mutations in TP53 and the metastasis related DCC gene. Overall, BeWith not only helped us uncover relations between potential driver genes and pathways, but also provided additional insights on patterns of the mutational landscape, going beyond cancer driving mutations.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Identifying direct contacts between protein complex subunits from their conditional dependence in proteomics datasets</title>

Determining the three dimensional arrangement of proteins in a complex is highly beneficial for uncovering mechanistic function and interpreting genetic variation in coding genes comprising protein complexes. There are several methods for determining co-complex interactions between proteins, among them co-fractionation / mass spectrometry (CF-MS), but it remains difficult to identify directly contacting subunits within a multi-protein complex. Correlation analysis of CF-MS profiles shows promise in detecting protein complexes as a whole but is limited in its ability to infer direct physical contacts among proteins in sub-complexes. To identify direct protein-protein contacts within human protein complexes we learn a sparse conditional dependency graph from approximately 3,000 CF-MS experiments on human cell lines. We show substantial performance gains in estimating direct interactions compared to correlation analysis on a benchmark of large protein complexes with solved three-dimensional structures. We demonstrate the method’s value in determining the three dimensional arrangement of proteins by making predictions for complexes without known structure (the exocyst and tRNA multi-synthetase complex) and by establishing evidence for the structural position of a recently discovered component of the core human EKC/KEOPS complex, GON7/C14ORF142, providing a more complete 3D model of the complex. Direct contact prediction provides easily calculable additional structural information for large-scale protein complex mapping studies and should be broadly applicable across organisms as more CF-MS datasets become available.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pvQ962AXtfg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Biological networks entail important topological features and patterns critical to understanding interactions within complicated biological systems. Despite a great progress in understanding their structure, much more can be done to improve our inference and network analysis. Spectral methods play a key role in many network-based applications. Fundamental to spectral methods is the Laplacian, a matrix that captures the global structure of the network. Unfortunately, the Laplacian does not take into account intricacies of the network’s local structure and is sensitive to noise in the network. These two properties are fundamental to biological networks and cannot be ignored. We propose an alternative matrix &lt;i&gt;Vicus&lt;/i&gt;. The Vicus matrix captures the local neighborhood structure of the network and thus is more effective at modeling biological interactions. We demonstrate the advantages of Vicus in the context of spectral methods by extensive empirical benchmarking on tasks such as single cell dimensionality reduction, protein module discovery and ranking genes for cancer subtyping. Our experiments show that using Vicus, spectral methods result in more accurate and robust performance in all of these tasks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/N-68mvTRJW4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

A large fraction of the proteins that are being identified as key tumor dependencies represent poor pharmacological targets or lack clinically-relevant small-molecule inhibitors. Availability of fully generalizable approaches for the systematic and efficient prioritization of tumor-context specific protein activity inhibitors would thus have significant translational value. Unfortunately, inhibitor effects on protein activity cannot be directly measured in systematic and proteome-wide fashion by conventional biochemical assays. We introduce OncoLead, a novel network based approach for the systematic prioritization of candidate inhibitors for arbitrary targets of therapeutic interest. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; validation confirmed that OncoLead analysis can recapitulate known inhibitors as well as prioritize novel, context-specific inhibitors of difficult targets, such as &lt;i&gt;MYC&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;STAT3&lt;/i&gt;. We used OncoLead to generate the first unbiased drug/regulator interaction map, representing compounds modulating the activity of cancer-relevant transcription factors, with potential in precision medicine.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VxPfG32FVlU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Network propagation is an important and widely used algorithm in systems biology, with applications in protein function prediction, disease gene prioritization, and patient stratification. However, up to this point it has required significant expertise to run. Here we extend the popular network analysis program Cytoscape to perform network propagation as an integrated function. Such integration greatly increases the access to network propagation by putting it in the hands of biologists and linking it to the many other types of network analysis and visualization available through Cytoscape. We demonstrate the power and utility of the algorithm by identifying mutations conferring resistance to Vemurafenib.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UR4nnjuvuFI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biallelic &lt;em&gt;DNAJC12&lt;/em&gt; mutations were described in children with hyperphenylalaninemia, neurodevelopmental delay, and dystonia. We identified &lt;em&gt;DNAJC12&lt;/em&gt; homozygous null variants (c.187A&amp;gt;T;p.K63* and c.79-2A&amp;gt;G;p.V27Wfs*14) in two kindreds with early-onset parkinsonism. Both probands had mild intellectual disability, mild nonprogressive, motor symptoms, sustained benefit from small dose of levodopa, and substantial worsening of symptoms after levodopa discontinuation. Neuropathology (Proband-A) revealed no alpha-synuclein pathology, and substantia nigra depigmentation with moderate cell loss. &lt;em&gt;DNAJC12&lt;/em&gt; transcripts were reduced in both patients. Our results suggest that &lt;em&gt;DNAJC12&lt;/em&gt; mutations (absent in 500 early-onset patients with Parkinson's disease) rarely cause dopa-responsive nonprogressive parkinsonism in adulthood, but broaden the clinical spectrum of &lt;em&gt;DNAJC12&lt;/em&gt; deficiency.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Brain–heart interactions reveal consciousness in noncommunicating patients</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25045-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We here aimed at characterizing heart–brain interactions in patients with disorders of consciousness. We tested how this information impacts data-driven classification between unresponsive and minimally conscious patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25045-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cohort of 127 patients in vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (VS/UWS; n = 70) and minimally conscious state (MCS; n = 57) were presented with the local–global auditory oddball paradigm, which distinguishes 2 levels of processing: short-term deviation of local auditory regularities and global long-term rule violations. In addition to previously validated markers of consciousness extracted from electroencephalograms (EEG), we computed autonomic cardiac markers, such as heart rate (HR) and HR variability (HRV), and cardiac cycle phase shifts triggered by the processing of the auditory stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25045-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;HR and HRV were similar in patients across groups. The cardiac cycle was not sensitive to the processing of local regularities in either the VS/UWS or MCS patients. In contrast, global regularities induced a phase shift of the cardiac cycle exclusively in the MCS group. The interval between the auditory stimulation and the following R peak was significantly shortened in MCS when the auditory rule was violated. When the information for the cardiac cycle modulations and other consciousness-related EEG markers were combined, single patient classification performance was enhanced compared to classification with solely EEG markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25045-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our work shows a link between residual cognitive processing and the modulation of autonomic somatic markers. These results open a new window to evaluate patients with disorders of consciousness via the embodied paradigm, according to which body–brain functions contribute to a holistic approach to conscious processing.

	<title>Neuron: Differential Regulation of Evoked and Spontaneous Release by Presynaptic NMDA Receptors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30874-7?rss=yes</guid>
	<link>http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30874-7?rss=yes</link>
	<description>A long-standing question has been how presynaptic NMDA receptors influence high-frequency evoked neurotransmission but spontaneous release at low rates. Providing resolution, Abrahamsson et al. show that these receptors regulate evoked and spontaneous release via distinct RIM1αβ- and JNK2-dependent mechanisms, respectively.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: To do or not to do? Plasma exchange and timing of steroid administration in PML</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25070</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25070</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: To retrospectively analyze the effect of plasma exchange (PLEX, yes=PLEX+, no=PLEX-) and steroids administration timing (prophylactically –proST- or therapeutically –therST-) on the longitudinal clinical course of patients with natalizumab related progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and full blown immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (PML-IRIS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Clinical and radiological data of 42 Italian patients with PML were analyzed. Patient's data are available until 12 months after PML diagnosis. PLEX and steroids treatment as time-dependent covariates were entered in: i) a Cox model to investigate their impact on full blown PML-IRIS latency; ii) an ANOVA to investigate their impact on IRIS duration; iii) a linear mixed model to assess their impact on the longitudinal clinical course (measured by means of EDSS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Treatment with PLEX was not associated to PML-IRIS latency (HR=1.05, p=0.92), but once IRIS emerged, its duration was significantly longer in patients who underwent PLEX (101 vs 54 days in PLEX+ and PLEX- patients, p=0.028). Receiving proST vs therST was not associated to IRIS latency (HR=0.67, p=0.39) or duration (p=0.95). Patients who underwent proST had a significant higher EDSS increase during PML (0.09 EDSS points per month, p=0.04) as compared to those who had therST.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: this study highlights that: i) caution on the use of PLEX should be considered as the current data do not support a beneficial effect of PLEX; ii) caution on the early use of steroids is suggested since their prophylactic use to prevent full blown PML-IRIS seems to negatively impact on the longitudinal disability course.

	<description>Neuroscience as a broad and growing discipline encompasses many fields of study, from molecular to systems-level, including cognitive and theoretical domains. These are exciting times for neuroscience, when many of these traditionally separate efforts are beginning to converge, and one can envision the day we may be able to respond to some fundamental questions, such as how molecules, cells, and circuits interplay to make us feel, act, and ultimately understand who we are. I am delighted to be the new Editor-in-Chief of Neuron, whose mission is to continue to disseminate the highest quality work in neuroscience.</description>

	<description>How nuclear architecture contributes to transcriptional regulation in neural progenitor cells (NeuPCs) is poorly understood. A study by Toda et al. (2017) now shows that the nuclear pore protein Nup153 associates with the Sox2 transcription factor in the regulation of NeuPC maintenance and neural fate.</description>

	<description>Kupferschmidt et al. probe real-time activity dynamics of associative and sensorimotor cortical projections to striatum during skill learning. They reveal substantive co-engagement and dissociable disengagement of the two pathways across learning and find that associative pathway disengagement predicts subsequent skill learning.</description>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;:To detect and quantify peripheral nerve lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS) by magnetic resonance neurography (MRN).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: 36 patients diagnosed with MS based on the 2010 McDonald criteria (34 with the relapsing-remitting form, 2 with clinically isolated syndrome) with and without disease modifying treatment were compared to 35 healthy age/sex-matched volunteers. All patients underwent detailed neurological and electrophysiological examinations. 3T MRN with large anatomical coverage of both legs and the lumbosacral plexus was performed by using 2D fat-saturated, T2-weighted and dual echo turbo-spin-echo sequences as well as a 3D T2-weighted, fat-saturated SPACE sequence. Besides qualitative visual nerve assessment, a T2w-signal quantification was performed by calculation of proton-spin-density and T2-relaxation time. Nerve diameter was measured as a morphometric criterion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;:T2w-hyperintense nerve lesions were detectable in all MS patients with a mean lesion number at thigh level of 151.5±5.7 vs. 19.1±2.4 in controls (p&amp;lt;0.0001). Nerve proton-spin-density was higher in MS (tibial/peroneal: 371.8±7.7/368.9±8.2) vs. controls (tibial/peroneal: 266.0±11.0/276.8±9.7;p&amp;lt;0.0001). In contrast, T2-relaxation time was significantly higher in controls (tibial/peroneal:82.0±2.1/78.3±1.7) vs. MS (tibial/peroneal:64.3±1.0/61.2±0.9; p&amp;lt;0.0001). Proximal tibial and peroneal nerve caliber was higher in MS (tibial:52.4±2.1mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; peroneal:25.4±1.3mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) vs. controls (tibial:45.2±1.4mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; p&amp;lt;0.0015; peroneal:21.3±0.7mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; p=0.0049).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;:Peripheral nerve lesions could be visualized and quantified in MS &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; by high resolution MRN. Lesions are defined by an increase of proton-spin-density and a decrease of T2-relaxation time, indicating changes in the microstructural organization of the extracellular matrix in peripheral nerve tissue in MS. By showing involvement of the peripheral nervous system in MS, this proof-of-concept study may offer new insights into the pathophysiology and treatment of MS. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Imaging Spinal Cord Atrophy in Progressive Myelopathies: HTLV-I Associated Neurologic Disease (HAM/TSP) and Multiple Sclerosis (MS)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25072</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25072</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Previous work measures spinal cord thinning in chronic progressive myelopathies, including HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) and multiple sclerosis (MS). Quantitative measurements of spinal cord atrophy are important in fully characterizing these and other spinal cord diseases. We aimed to investigate patterns of spinal cord atrophy and correlations with clinical markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Spinal cord cross sectional area was measured in individuals (24 healthy controls (HC), 17 asymptomatic carriers of HTLV-1 (AC), 47 HAM/TSP, 74 RRMS, 17 SPMS, and 40 PPMS) from C1 to T10. Clinical disability scores, viral markers, and immunological parameters were obtained for patients and correlated with representative spinal cord cross sectional area regions at the C2-C3, C4-C5, and T4-T9 levels. In two HAM/TSP patients, spinal cord cross sectional area was measured over three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: All spinal cord regions are thinner in HAM/TSP (56 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; [SD 10], 59 [10], 23 [5]) than in HC (76 [7], 83 [8], 38 [4]) and AC (71 [7], 78 [9], 36 [7]). SPMS (62 [9], 66 [9], 32 [6]) and PPMS (65 [11], 68 [10], 35 [7]) have thinner cervical cords than HC and RRMS (73 [9], 77 [10], 37 [6]). Clinical disability scores (EDSS (p=0.009) and IPEC(p=0.03)) and CD8+ T cell frequency (p=0.04) correlate with T4-T9 spinal cord cross sectional area in HAM/TSP. Higher CSF HTLV-1 proviral load (p=0.01) was associated with thinner spinal cord cross sectional area. Both HAM/TSP patients followed longitudinally showed thoracic thinning followed by cervical thinning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: Group average spinal cord cross sectional area in HAM/TSP and progressive MS show spinal cord atrophy. We further hypothesize that is possible that neuroglial loss from a thoracic inflammatory process results in anterograde and retrograde degeneration of axons, leading to the temporal progression of thoracic to cervical atrophy described here.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Stroke-Induced Chronic Systolic Dysfunction Driven by Sympathetic Overactivity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25073</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25073</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Cardiac diseases are established risk factors for ischemic stroke incidence and severity. Conversely, there is increasing evidence that brain ischemia can cause cardiac dysfunction. The mechanisms underlying this neurogenic heart disease are incompletely understood. While it is established that ischemic stroke is associated with cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial damage, elevated cardiac enzymes and plasma catecholamines in the acute phase, nothing is known about the delayed consequences of ischemic stroke on cardiovascular function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: To determine the long-term cardiac consequences of a focal cerebral ischemia, we subjected young and aged mice to a 30-minute transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and analyzed cardiac function by serial transthoracic echocardiography and hemodynamic measurements up to week 8 after surgery. Finally, animals were treated with metoprolol to evaluate a pharmacologic treatment option to prevent the development of heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Focal cerebral ischemia induced a long-term cardiac dysfunction with a reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction and an increase in left ventricular volumes; this development was associated with higher peripheral sympathetic activity. Metoprolol treatment prevented the development of chronic cardiac dysfunction by decelerating extracellular cardiac remodeling and inhibiting sympathetic signaling relevant to chronic autonomic dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Focal cerebral ischemia in mice leads to the development of chronic systolic dysfunction driven by increased sympathetic activity. If these results can be confirmed in a clinical setting, treating physicians should be attentive to clinical signs of heart failure in every patient after ischemic stroke. Therapeutically, the successful β-blockade with metoprolol in mice could also have future clinical implications. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Traumatic Brain Injury in the Prodromal Period of Parkinson Disease: A Large Epidemiological Study Using Medicare Data</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25074</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25074</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Studies suggest a greater risk of Parkinson disease (PD) after traumatic brain injury (TBI), but it is possible that the risk of TBI is greater in the prodromal period of PD. We aimed to examine the time-to-TBI in PD patients in their prodromal period compared to population-based controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We identified 89,790 incident PD cases and 118,095 comparable controls &amp;gt; 65 years of age in 2009 using Medicare claims data. Using data from the preceding five years, we compared time-to-TBI in PD patients in their prodromal period to controls. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for TBI in a Cox regression, while adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, modified Charlson comorbidity index, smoking, and alcohol use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Risk of TBI was greater in PD patients in their prodromal period across all age and sex groups, with HRs consistently increasing with proximity to PD diagnosis. HRs ranged from 1.64 (95% CI 1.52, 1.77) five years prior to diagnosis to 3.93 (95% CI 3.74, 4.13) in the year prior. The interaction between PD, TBI, and time was primarily observed for TBI attributed to falls. Motor dysfunction and cognitive impairment, suggested by corresponding ICD-9 codes, partially mediated the PD-TBI association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: There is a strong association between PD and a recent TBI in the prodromal period of PD. This association strengthens as PD diagnosis approaches and may be a result of undetected non-motor and motor symptoms, but confirmation will be required. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Age, Vascular Health, and Alzheimer's disease Biomarkers in an Elderly Sample</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;OBJECTIVE&lt;/b&gt;: To investigate the associations between age, vascular health, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) imaging biomarkers in an elderly sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;METHODS&lt;/b&gt;: We identified 430 individuals along the cognitive continuum aged&amp;gt;60 years with amyloid-PET, Tau-PET, and MRI scans from the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. A subset of 329 individuals had FDG-PET. We ascertained presently existing cardiovascular and metabolic conditions (CMC) from healthcare records and used the summation of presence/absence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiac-arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and stroke as a surrogate for vascular health. We used global amyloid from PiB-PET, entorhinal cortex tau uptake (ERC-tau) from Tau-PET, and neurodegeneration in AD signature regions from MRI and FDG-PET as surrogates for AD pathophysiology. We dichotomized participants into CMC=0 (CMC-) vs. CMC&amp;gt;0 (CMC+) and tested for age-adjusted group differences in AD biomarkers. Using structural equation models (SEM), we assessed the impact of vascular health on AD biomarker cascade (amyloid leads to tau leads to neurodegeneration) after considering the direct and indirect age, sex, and APOE effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;RESULTS&lt;/b&gt;: CMC+ participants had significantly greater neurodegeneration than CMC- participants but did not differ by amyloid or ERC-tau. The SEM models showed that i) vascular health had a significant direct and indirect impact on neurodegeneration but not on amyloid; and ii) vascular health specifically the presence of hyperlipidemia had a significant direct impact on ERC-tau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;INTERPRETATION&lt;/b&gt;: Vascular health had quantifiably greater impact on neurodegeneration in AD regions than on amyloid deposition. Longitudinal studies are warranted to clarify the relationship between tau deposition and vascular health. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Prediction of phenotypic severity in mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25069</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25069</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective&lt;/em&gt;: Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA or Sanfilippo disease type A is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder presenting in early childhood, caused by an inherited deficiency of the lysosomal hydrolase sulfamidase. New missense mutations, for which genotype-phenotype correlations are currently unknown, are frequently reported, hampering early prediction of phenotypic severity and efficacy assessment of new disease-modifying treatments. We aimed to design a method to determine phenotypic severity early in the disease course. &lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;: Fifty-three patients were included of whom skin fibroblasts and data on disease course and mutation analysis were available. Patients were phenotypically characterized on clinical data as ‘rapidly progressing' or ‘slowly progressing'. Sulfamidase activity was measured in fibroblasts cultured at 37°C and at 30°C. &lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;: Sulfamidase activity in fibroblasts from patients homozygous or compound heterozygous for a combination of known severe mutations remained below the limit of quantification under both culture conditions. In contrast, sulfamidase activity in fibroblasts from patients homozygous or compound heterozygous for a known mild mutation increased above the limit of quantification when cultured at 30°C. With division on the basis of the patients phenotype, fibroblasts from ‘slowly progressing' patients could be separated from ‘rapid progressing' patients by increase in sulfamidase activity when cultured at 30°C (p&amp;lt;0.001, sensitivity 96%, specificity 93%). &lt;em&gt;Interpretation&lt;/em&gt;: Phenotypic severity strongly correlates with the potential to increase sulfamidase activity in fibroblasts cultured at 30°C, allowing reliable distinction between patients with ‘rapidly progressing' or ‘slowly progressing' phenotypes. This method may provide an essential tool for assessment of treatment effects and for healthcare and life planning decisions. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Bicycling suppresses abnormal beta synchrony in the Parkinsonian basal ganglia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25047</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25047</link>
	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25047-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freezing of gait is a poorly understood symptom of Parkinson disease, and can severely disrupt the locomotion of affected patients. However, bicycling ability remains surprisingly unaffected in most patients suffering from freezing, suggesting functional differences in the motor network. The purpose of this study was to characterize and contrast the oscillatory dynamics underlying bicycling and walking in the basal ganglia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25047-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We present the first local field potential recordings directly comparing bicycling and walking in Parkinson disease patients with electrodes implanted in the subthalamic nuclei for deep brain stimulation. Low (13–22Hz) and high (23–35Hz) beta power changes were analyzed in 22 subthalamic nuclei from 13 Parkinson disease patients (57.5 ± 5.9 years old, 4 female). The study group consisted of 5 patients with and 8 patients without freezing of gait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25047-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In patients without freezing of gait, both bicycling and walking led to a suppression of subthalamic beta power (13–35Hz), and this suppression was stronger for bicycling. Freezers showed a similar pattern in general. Superimposed on this pattern, however, we observed a movement-induced, narrowband power increase around 18Hz, which was evident even in the absence of freezing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25047-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results indicate that bicycling facilitates overall suppression of beta power. Furthermore, movement leads to exaggerated synchronization in the low beta band specifically within the basal ganglia of patients susceptible to freezing. Abnormal ∼18Hz oscillations are implicated in the pathophysiology of freezing of gait, and suppressing them may form a key strategy in developing potential therapies.

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Making Dopamine Connections in Adolescence</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30179-0?rss=yes</guid>
	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30179-0?rss=yes</link>
	<description>A dramatic maturational process ongoing in adolescence is prefrontal cortex development, including its dopamine innervation. Dopamine axons grow from the striatum to the prefrontal cortex, the only known case of long-distance axon growth during adolescence. This is coordinated by the Netrin-1 guidance cue receptor DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer), which in turn controls the intrinsic development of the prefrontal cortex itself. Stimulant drugs in adolescence alter DCC in dopamine neurons and, in turn prefrontal cortex maturation, impacting cognitive abilities.</description>

	<description>The hippocampus community, and the wider groups of neuroscientists studying learning and memory, were shocked to learn of the sudden and unexpected death of Dr Howard Eichenbaum on 21 July 2017. An immensely respected and well-liked figure, Howard made major contributions to our understanding of the neurobiology of memory at a systems level. In addition to his scientific contributions, he was also a diligent member and steward of the neuroscience community as Editor of the journal Hippocampus and in many other ways.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Chandelier Cells Illuminate Inhibitory Control of Prefrontal–Amygdala Outputs</title>

	<description>Inhibitory interneurons comprise a diverse subpopulation of cells that are critical to circuit function. How distinct inhibitory microcircuits control long-range projections remains poorly understood. A recent study by Lu and colleagues uncovered a unidirectional microcircuit of prefrontal chandelier cells that preferentially innervate and suppress long-range amygdala-projecting pyramidal cells.</description>

	<description>Self representation is fundamental to mental functions. While the self has mostly been studied in traditional psychophilosophical terms (‘self as subject’), recent laboratory work suggests that the self can be measured quantitatively by assessing biases towards self-associated stimuli (‘self as object’). Here, we summarize new quantitative paradigms for assessing the self, drawn from psychology, neuroeconomics, embodied cognition, and social neuroscience. We then propose a neural model of the self as an emerging property of interactions between a core ‘self network’ (e.g., medial prefrontal cortex; mPFC), a cognitive control network [e.g., dorsolateral (dl)PFC], and a salience network (e.g., insula).</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Endosomal Traffic Jams Represent a Pathogenic Hub and Therapeutic Target in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>While clues have existed that endosomal trafficking is associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), whether it plays a central role in the disease and if so how has remained unknown. Here we rely on recent genetic and cellular findings to construct a model proposing that traffic jams in the early endosome can act as an upstream pathogenic hub in AD. We also rely on an independent series of findings to suggest how the traffic jams can act as a unified mediator of downstream pathophysiology. The model predicts, therefore, that interventions designed to unjam the endosome carry high therapeutic promise.</description>

	<description>Over the past few years our understanding of estrogen signaling in the brain has expanded rapidly. Estrogens are synthesized in the periphery and in the brain, acting on multiple receptors to regulate gene transcription, neural function, and behavior. Various estrogen-sensitive signaling pathways often operate in concert within the same cell, increasing the complexity of the system. In females, estrogen concentrations fluctuate over the estrous/menstrual cycle, dynamically modulating estrogen receptor (ER) expression, activity, and trafficking.</description>
