	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: 17{beta}-Estradiol Acutely Potentiates Glutamatergic Synaptic Transmission in the Hippocampus through Distinct Mechanisms in Males and Females</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12314?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Estradiol (E2) acutely potentiates glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the hippocampus of both male and female rats. Here, we investigated whether E2-induced synaptic potentiation occurs via presynaptic and/or postsynaptic mechanisms and which estrogen receptors (ERs) mediate E2's effects in each sex. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings of mEPSCs in CA1 pyramidal neurons showed that E2 increases both mEPSC frequency and amplitude within minutes, but often in different cells. This indicated that both presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms are involved, but that they occur largely at different synapses. Two-photon (2p) glutamate uncaging at individual dendritic spines showed that E2 increases the amplitude of uncaging-evoked EPSCs (2pEPSCs) and calcium transients (2pCaTs) at a subset of spines on a dendrite, demonstrating synapse specificity of E2's postsynaptic effects. All of these results were essentially the same in males and females. However, additional experiments using ER-selective agonists indicated sex differences in the mechanisms underlying E2-induced potentiation. In males, an ERβ agonist mimicked the postsynaptic effects of E2 to increase mEPSC, 2pEPSC, and 2pCaT amplitude, whereas in females, these effects were mimicked by an agonist of G protein-coupled ER-1. The presynaptic effect of E2, increased mEPSC frequency, was mimicked by an ERα agonist in males, whereas in females, an ERβ agonist increased mEPSC frequency. Thus, E2 acutely potentiates glutamatergic synapses similarly in both sexes, but distinct ER subtypes mediate the presynaptic and postsynaptic aspects of potentiation in each sex. This indicates a latent sex difference in which different molecular mechanisms converge to the same functional endpoint in males versus females.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Some sex differences in the brain may be latent differences, in which the same functional endpoint is achieved through distinct underlying mechanisms in males versus females. Here we report a latent sex difference in molecular regulation of excitatory synapses in the hippocampus. The steroid 17β-estradiol is known to acutely potentiate glutamatergic synaptic transmission in both sexes. We find that this occurs through a combination of increased presynaptic glutamate release probability and increased postsynaptic sensitivity to glutamate in both sexes, but that distinct estrogen receptor subtypes underlie each aspect of potentiation in each sex. These results indicate that therapeutics targeting a specific estrogen receptor subtype or its downstream signaling would likely affect synaptic transmission differently in the hippocampus of each sex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Graded Elevation of c-Jun in Schwann Cells In Vivo: Gene Dosage Determines Effects on Development, Remyelination, Tumorigenesis, and Hypomyelination</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12297?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12297?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Schwann cell c-Jun is implicated in adaptive and maladaptive functions in peripheral nerves. In injured nerves, this transcription factor promotes the repair Schwann cell phenotype and regeneration and promotes Schwann-cell-mediated neurotrophic support in models of peripheral neuropathies. However, c-Jun is associated with tumor formation in some systems, potentially suppresses myelin genes, and has been implicated in demyelinating neuropathies. To clarify these issues and to determine how c-Jun levels determine its function, we have generated c-Jun OE/+ and c-Jun OE/OE mice with graded expression of c-Jun in Schwann cells and examined these lines during development, in adulthood, and after injury using RNA sequencing analysis, quantitative electron microscopic morphometry, Western blotting, and functional tests. Schwann cells are remarkably tolerant of elevated c-Jun because the nerves of c-Jun OE/+ mice, in which c-Jun is elevated ~6-fold, are normal with the exception of modestly reduced myelin thickness. The stronger elevation of c-Jun in c-Jun OE/OE mice is, however, sufficient to induce significant hypomyelination pathology, implicating c-Jun as a potential player in demyelinating neuropathies. The tumor suppressor P19&lt;sup&gt;ARF&lt;/sup&gt; is strongly activated in the nerves of these mice and, even in aged c-Jun OE/OE mice, there is no evidence of tumors. This is consistent with the fact that tumors do not form in injured nerves, although they contain proliferating Schwann cells with strikingly elevated c-Jun. Furthermore, in crushed nerves of c-Jun OE/+ mice, where c-Jun levels are overexpressed sufficiently to accelerate axonal regeneration, myelination and function are restored after injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In injured and diseased nerves, the transcription factor c-Jun in Schwann cells is elevated and variously implicated in controlling beneficial or adverse functions, including trophic Schwann cell support for neurons, promotion of regeneration, tumorigenesis, and suppression of myelination. To analyze the functions of c-Jun, we have used transgenic mice with graded elevation of Schwann cell c-Jun. We show that high c-Jun elevation is a potential pathogenic mechanism because it inhibits myelination. Conversely, we did not find a link between c-Jun elevation and tumorigenesis. Modest c-Jun elevation, which is beneficial for regeneration, is well tolerated during Schwann cell development and in the adult and is compatible with restoration of myelination and nerve function after injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neural Representations of Hierarchical Rule Sets: The Human Control System Represents Rules Irrespective of the Hierarchical Level to Which They Belong</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12281?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12281?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Humans use rules to organize their actions to achieve specific goals. Although simple rules that link a sensory stimulus to one response may suffice in some situations, often, the application of multiple, hierarchically organized rules is required. Recent theories suggest that progressively higher level rules are encoded along an anterior-to-posterior gradient within PFC. Although some evidence supports the existence of such a functional gradient, other studies argue for a lesser degree of specialization within PFC. We used fMRI to investigate whether rules at different hierarchical levels are represented at distinct locations in the brain or encoded by a single system. Thirty-seven male and female participants represented and applied hierarchical rule sets containing one lower-level stimulus–response rule and one higher-level selection rule. We used multivariate pattern analysis to investigate directly the representation of rules at each hierarchical level in absence of information about rules from other levels or other task-related information, thus providing a clear identification of low- and high-level rule representations. We could decode low- and high-level rules from local patterns of brain activity within a wide frontoparietal network. However, no significant difference existed between regions encoding representations of rules from both levels except for precentral gyrus, which represented only low-level rule information. Our findings show that the brain represents conditional rules regardless of their level in the explored hierarchy, so the human control system did not organize task representation according to this dimension. Our paradigm represents a promising approach to identifying critical principles that shape this control system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Several recent studies investigating the organization of the human control system propose that rules at different control levels are organized along an anterior-to-posterior gradient within PFC. In this study, we used multivariate pattern analysis to explore independently the representation of formally identical conditional rules belonging to different levels of a cognitive hierarchy and provide for the first time a clear identification of low- and high-level rule representations. We found no major spatial differences between regions encoding rules from different hierarchical levels. This suggests that the human brain does not use levels in the investigated hierarchy as a topographical organization principle to represent rules controlling our behavior. Our paradigm represents a promising approach to identifying which principles are critical.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Activation of {gamma}-Secretase Trimming Activity by Topological Changes of Transmembrane Domain 1 of Presenilin 1</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12272?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;-Secretase is an intramembrane cleaving protease that is responsible for the generation of amyloid-β peptides, which are linked to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. Recently, -secretase modulators (GSMs) have been shown to specifically decrease production of the aggregation-prone and toxic longer Aβ species, and concomitantly increase the levels of shorter Aβ. We previously found that phenylimidazole-type GSMs bind to presenilin 1 (PS1), the catalytic subunit of the -secretase, and allosterically modulate -secretase activity. However, the precise conformational alterations in PS1 remained unclear. Here we mapped the amino acid residues in PS1 that is crucial for the binding and pharmacological actions of E2012, a phenylimidazole-type GSM, using photoaffinity labeling and the substituted cysteine accessibility method. We also demonstrated that a piston-like vertical motion of transmembrane domain (TMD) 1 occurs during modulation of Aβ production. Taking these results together, we propose a model for the molecular mechanism of phenylimidazole-type GSMs, in which the trimming activity of -secretase is modulated by the position of the TMD1 of PS1 in the lipid bilayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Reduction of the toxic longer amyloid-β peptide is one of the therapeutic approaches for Alzheimer disease. A subset of small compounds called -secretase modulators specifically decreases the longer amyloid-β production, although its mechanistic action remains unclear. Here we found that the modulator compound E2012 targets to the hydrophilic loop 1 of presenilin 1, which is a catalytic subunit of the -secretase. Moreover, E2012 triggers the piston movement of the transmembrane domain 1 of presenilin 1, which impacts on the -secretase activity. These results illuminate how -secretase modulators allosterically affect the proteolytic activity, and highlight the importance of the structural dynamics of presenilin 1 in the complexed process of the intramembrane cleavage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Multimodal Imaging in Rat Model Recapitulates Alzheimer's Disease Biomarkers Abnormalities</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12263?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Imaging biomarkers are frequently proposed as endpoints for clinical trials targeting brain amyloidosis in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the specific impact of amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation on biomarker abnormalities remains elusive in AD. Using the McGill-R-Thy1-APP transgenic rat as a model of selective Aβ pathology, we characterized the longitudinal progression of abnormalities in biomarkers commonly used in AD research. Middle-aged (9–11 months) transgenic animals (both male and female) displayed mild spatial memory impairments and disrupted cingulate network connectivity measured by resting-state fMRI, even in the absence of hypometabolism (measured with PET [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG) or detectable fibrillary amyloidosis (measured with PET [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]NAV4694). At more advanced ages (16–19 months), cognitive deficits progressed in conjunction with resting connectivity abnormalities; furthermore, hypometabolism, Aβ plaque accumulation, reduction of CSF Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1-42&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations, and hippocampal atrophy (structural MRI) were detectable at this stage. The present results emphasize the early impact of Aβ on brain connectivity and support a framework in which persistent Aβ aggregation itself is sufficient to impose memory circuits dysfunction, which propagates to adjacent brain networks at later stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The present study proposes a &quot;back translation&quot; of the Alzheimer pathological cascade concept from human to animals. We used the same set of Alzheimer imaging biomarkers typically used in large human cohorts and assessed their progression over time in a transgenic rat model, which allows for a finer spatial resolution not attainable with mice. Using this translational platform, we demonstrated that amyloid-β pathology recapitulates an Alzheimer-like profile of biomarker abnormalities even in the absence of other hallmarks of the disease such as neurofibrillary tangles and widespread neuronal losses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cellular and Molecular Analysis of Dendritic Morphogenesis in a Retinal Cell Type That Senses Color Contrast and Ventral Motion</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;As neuronal dendrites develop, they acquire cell-type-specific features including characteristic size, shape, arborization, location and synaptic patterns. These features, in turn, are major determinants of type-specific neuronal function. Because neuronal diversity complicates the task of relating developmental programs to adult structure and function, we analyzed dendritic morphogenesis in a single retinal ganglion cell (RGC) type in mouse called J-RGC. We documented the emergence of five dendritic features that underlie J-RGC physiology: (1) dendritic field size, which approximate receptive field size; (2) dendritic complexity, which affects how J-RGCs sample space; (3) asymmetry, which contributes to direction-selectivity; (4) restricted lamination within the inner plexiform layer (IPL), which renders J-RGCs responsive to light decrements; and (5) distribution of synaptic inputs, which generate a color-opponent receptive field. We found dendritic growth in J-RGCs is accompanied by a refinement in dendritic self-crossing. Asymmetry arises by a combination of selective pruning and elaboration, whereas laminar restriction results from biased outgrowth toward the outermost IPL. Interestingly, asymmetry develops in a protracted dorsoventral wave, whereas lamination does so in a rapid centrifugal wave. As arbors mature, they acquire excitatory and inhibitory synapses, with the latter forming first and being concentrated in proximal dendrites. Thus, distinct mechanisms operate in different spatiotemporal dimensions of J-RGC dendritic patterning to generate the substrate for specific patterns of synaptogenesis. Finally, we asked whether the defining molecular signature of J-RGCs, the adhesion molecule JAM-B, regulates morphogenesis, and showed that it promotes dendro-dendritic interactions. Our results reveal multiple mechanisms that shape a dendritic arbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Visual perception begins in the retina, where distinct types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are tuned to specific visual features such as direction of motion. The features to which each RGC type responds are determined largely by the number and type of synaptic inputs it receives, and these, in turn, are greatly influenced by the size, shape, arborization pattern, and location of its dendrites. We analyzed dendritic morphogenesis in a functionally characterized RGC type, the J-RGC, demonstrating distinct mechanisms that operate in different dimensions to generate the dendritic scaffold and synaptic patterns for feature detection. Our work elucidates cellular and molecular mechanisms that shape dendritic arbors and synaptic distribution, enabling J-RGC connectivity and thus, function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sleep in Humans Stabilizes Pattern Separation Performance</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12238?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12238?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Replay of hippocampal neural representations during sleep is thought to promote systems consolidation of declarative memory. How this reprocessing of memory during sleep affects the hippocampal representation itself, is unclear. Here we tested hippocampal stimulus processing (i.e., pattern separation) before and after periods of sleep and wakefulness in humans (female and male participants). Pattern separation deteriorated across the wake period but remained stable across sleep (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.013) with this sleep–wake difference being most pronounced for stimuli with low similarity to targets (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.006). Stimuli with the highest similarity showed a reversed pattern with reduced pattern separation performance after sleep (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.038). Pattern separation performance was positively correlated with sleep spindle density, slow oscillation density, and theta power phase-locked to slow oscillations. Sleep, presumably by neural memory replay, shapes hippocampal representations and enhances computations of pattern separation to subsequent presentation of similar stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The consolidation of hippocampus-dependent memories is causally related to reactivation during sleep of previously encoded representations. Here, we show that reactivation-based consolidation processes during sleep shape the hippocampal representation itself. We studied the effect of sleep and wakefulness on pattern separation (i.e., orthogonalization of similar representations) and completion performance (i.e., recall of a memory in light of noisy input) that are essential cognitive elements of encoding and retrieval of information by the hippocampus. Our results demonstrate that pattern separation was stabilized after sleep but diminished after wakefulness. We further showed that pattern separation was related to EEG oscillatory parameters of non-REM sleep serving as markers of sleep-dependent memory consolidation and hippocampal reactivation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Network Configurations in the Human Brain Reflect Choice Bias during Rapid Face Processing</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12226?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Network interactions are likely to be instrumental in processes underlying rapid perception and cognition. Specifically, high-level and perceptual regions must interact to balance pre-existing models of the environment with new incoming stimuli. Simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and fMRI (EEG/fMRI) enables temporal characterization of brain–network interactions combined with improved anatomical localization of regional activity. In this paper, we use simultaneous EEG/fMRI and multivariate dynamical systems (MDS) analysis to characterize network relationships between constitute brain areas that reflect a subject's choice for a face versus nonface categorization task. Our simultaneous EEG and fMRI analysis on 21 human subjects (12 males, 9 females) identifies early perceptual and late frontal subsystems that are selective to the categorical choice of faces versus nonfaces. We analyze the interactions between these subsystems using an MDS in the space of the BOLD signal. Our main findings show that differences between face-choice and house-choice networks are seen in the network interactions between the early and late subsystems, and that the magnitude of the difference in network interaction positively correlates with the behavioral false-positive rate of face choices. We interpret this to reflect the role of saliency and expectations likely encoded in frontal &quot;late&quot; regions on perceptual processes occurring in &quot;early&quot; perceptual regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Our choices are affected by our biases. In visual perception and cognition such biases can be commonplace and quite curious—e.g., we see a human face when staring up at a cloud formation or down at a piece of toast at the breakfast table. Here we use multimodal neuroimaging and dynamical systems analysis to measure whole-brain spatiotemporal dynamics while subjects make decisions regarding the type of object they see in rapidly flashed images. We find that the degree of interaction in these networks accounts for a substantial fraction of our bias to see faces. In general, our findings illustrate how the properties of spatiotemporal networks yield insight into the mechanisms of how we form decisions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neuropeptide S Activates Paraventricular Oxytocin Neurons to Induce Anxiolysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12214?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuropeptides, such as neuropeptide S (NPS) and oxytocin (OXT), represent potential options for the treatment of anxiety disorders due to their potent anxiolytic profile. In this study, we aimed to reveal the mechanisms underlying the behavioral action of NPS, and present a chain of evidence that the effects of NPS within the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) are mediated via actions on local OXT neurons in male Wistar rats. First, retrograde studies identified NPS fibers originating in the brainstem locus coeruleus, and projecting to the PVN. FACS identified prominent NPS receptor expression in PVN-OXT neurons. Using genetically encoded calcium indicators, we further demonstrated that NPS reliably induces a transient increase in intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration in a subpopulation of OXT neurons, an effect mediated by NPS receptor. In addition, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) NPS evoked a significant somatodendritic release of OXT within the PVN as assessed by microdialysis in combination with a highly sensitive radioimmunoassay. Finally, we could show that the anxiolytic effect of NPS seen after i.c.v. or intra-PVN infusion requires responsive OXT neurons of the PVN and locally released OXT. Thus, pharmacological blockade of OXT receptors as well as chemogenetic silencing of OXT neurons within the PVN prevented the effect of synthetic NPS. In conclusion, our results indicate a significant role of the OXT system in mediating the effects of NPS on anxiety, and fill an important gap in our understanding of brain neuropeptide interactions in the context of regulation of emotional behavior within the hypothalamus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Given the rising scientific interest in neuropeptide research in the context of emotional and stress-related behaviors, our findings demonstrate a novel intrahypothalamic mechanism involving paraventricular oxytocin neurons that express the neuropeptide S receptor. These neurons respond with transient Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; increase and somatodendritic oxytocin release following neuropeptide S stimulation. Thereby, oxytocin neurons seem essential for neuropeptide S-induced anxiolysis, as this effect was blocked by pharmacological and chemogenetic inhibition of the oxytocin system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Conditional Deletion of Ric-8b in Olfactory Sensory Neurons Leads to Olfactory Impairment</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12202?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The olfactory system can discriminate a vast number of odorants. This ability derives from the existence of a large family of odorant receptors expressed in the cilia of the olfactory sensory neurons. Odorant receptors signal through the olfactory-specific G-protein subunit, Gαolf. Ric-8b, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, interacts with Gαolf and can amplify odorant receptor signal transduction &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. To explore the function of Ric-8b &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, we generated a tissue specific knock-out mouse by crossing OMP-Cre transgenic mice to Ric-8b floxed mice. We found that olfactory-specific Ric-8b knock-out mice of mixed sex do not express the Gαolf protein in the olfactory epithelium. We also found that in these mice, the mature olfactory sensory neuron layer is reduced, and that olfactory sensory neurons show increased rate of cell death compared with wild-type mice. Finally, behavioral tests showed that the olfactory-specific Ric-8b knock-out mice show an impaired sense of smell, even though their motivation and mobility behaviors remain normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Ric-8b is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) expressed in the olfactory epithelium and in the striatum. Ric-8b interacts with the olfactory Gαolf subunit, and can amplify odorant signaling through odorant receptors &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. However, the functional significance of this GEF in the olfactory neurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; remains unknown. We report that deletion of Ric-8b in olfactory sensory neurons prevents stable expression of Gαolf. In addition, we demonstrate that olfactory neurons lacking Ric-8b (and consequently Gαolf) are more susceptible to cell death. Ric-8b conditional knock-out mice display impaired olfactory guided behavior. Our results reveal that Ric-8b is essential for olfactory function, and suggest that it may also be essential for Gαolf-dependent functions in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Auditory selective attention is vital in natural soundscapes. But it is unclear how attentional focus on the primary dimension of auditory representation—acoustic frequency—might modulate basic auditory functional topography during active listening. In contrast to visual selective attention, which is supported by motor-mediated optimization of input across saccades and pupil dilation, the primate auditory system has fewer means of differentially sampling the world. This makes spectrally-directed endogenous attention a particularly crucial aspect of auditory attention. Using a novel functional paradigm combined with quantitative MRI, we establish in male and female listeners that human frequency-band-selective attention drives activation in both myeloarchitectonically estimated auditory core, and across the majority of tonotopically mapped nonprimary auditory cortex. The attentionally driven best-frequency maps show strong concordance with sensory-driven maps in the same subjects across much of the temporal plane, with poor concordance in areas outside traditional auditory cortex. There is significantly greater activation across most of auditory cortex when best frequency is attended, versus ignored; the same regions do not show this enhancement when attending to the least-preferred frequency band. Finally, the results demonstrate that there is spatial correspondence between the degree of myelination and the strength of the tonotopic signal across a number of regions in auditory cortex. Strong frequency preferences across tonotopically mapped auditory cortex spatially correlate with R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-estimated myeloarchitecture, indicating shared functional and anatomical organization that may underlie intrinsic auditory regionalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Perception is an active process, especially sensitive to attentional state. Listeners direct auditory attention to track a violin's melody within an ensemble performance, or to follow a voice in a crowded cafe. Although diverse pathologies reduce quality of life by impacting such spectrally directed auditory attention, its neurobiological bases are unclear. We demonstrate that human primary and nonprimary auditory cortical activation is modulated by spectrally directed attention in a manner that recapitulates its tonotopic sensory organization. Further, the graded activation profiles evoked by single-frequency bands are correlated with attentionally driven activation when these bands are presented in complex soundscapes. Finally, we observe a strong concordance in the degree of cortical myelination and the strength of tonotopic activation across several auditory cortical regions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Working Memory and Decision-Making in a Frontoparietal Circuit Model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12167?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Working memory (WM) and decision-making (DM) are fundamental cognitive functions involving a distributed interacting network of brain areas, with the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) at the core. However, the shared and distinct roles of these areas and the nature of their coordination in cognitive function remain poorly understood. Biophysically based computational models of cortical circuits have provided insights into the mechanisms supporting these functions, yet they have primarily focused on the local microcircuit level, raising questions about the principles for distributed cognitive computation in multiregional networks. To examine these issues, we developed a distributed circuit model of two reciprocally interacting modules representing PPC and PFC circuits. The circuit architecture includes hierarchical differences in local recurrent structure and implements reciprocal long-range projections. This parsimonious model captures a range of behavioral and neuronal features of frontoparietal circuits across multiple WM and DM paradigms. In the context of WM, both areas exhibit persistent activity, but, in response to intervening distractors, PPC transiently encodes distractors while PFC filters distractors and supports WM robustness. With regard to DM, the PPC module generates graded representations of accumulated evidence supporting target selection, while the PFC module generates more categorical responses related to action or choice. These findings suggest computational principles for distributed, hierarchical processing in cortex during cognitive function and provide a framework for extension to multiregional models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Working memory and decision-making are fundamental &quot;building blocks&quot; of cognition, and deficits in these functions are associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. These cognitive functions engage distributed networks with prefrontal cortex (PFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) at the core. It is not clear, however, what the contributions of PPC and PFC are in light of the computations that subserve working memory and decision-making. We constructed a biophysical model of a reciprocally connected frontoparietal circuit that revealed shared and distinct functions for the PFC and PPC across working memory and decision-making tasks. Our parsimonious model connects circuit-level properties to cognitive functions and suggests novel design principles beyond those of local circuits for cognitive processing in multiregional brain networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Morphological Constraints on Cerebellar Granule Cell Combinatorial Diversity</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Combinatorial expansion by the cerebellar granule cell layer (GCL) is fundamental to theories of cerebellar contributions to motor control and learning. Granule cells (GrCs) sample approximately four mossy fiber inputs and are thought to form a combinatorial code useful for pattern separation and learning. We constructed a spatially realistic model of the cerebellar GCL and examined how GCL architecture contributes to GrC combinatorial diversity. We found that GrC combinatorial diversity saturates quickly as mossy fiber input diversity increases, and that this saturation is in part a consequence of short dendrites, which limit access to diverse inputs and favor dense sampling of local inputs. This local sampling also produced GrCs that were combinatorially redundant, even when input diversity was extremely high. In addition, we found that mossy fiber clustering, which is a common anatomical pattern, also led to increased redundancy of GrC input combinations. We related this redundancy to hypothesized roles of temporal expansion of GrC information encoding in service of learned timing, and we show that GCL architecture produces GrC populations that support both temporal and combinatorial expansion. Finally, we used novel anatomical measurements from mice of either sex to inform modeling of sparse and filopodia-bearing mossy fibers, finding that these circuit features uniquely contribute to enhancing GrC diversification and redundancy. Our results complement information theoretic studies of granule layer structure and provide insight into the contributions of granule layer anatomical features to afferent mixing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cerebellar granule cells are among the simplest neurons, with tiny somata and, on average, just four dendrites. These characteristics, along with their dense organization, inspired influential theoretical work on the granule cell layer as a combinatorial expander, where each granule cell represents a unique combination of inputs. Despite the centrality of these theories to cerebellar physiology, the degree of expansion supported by anatomically realistic patterns of inputs is unknown. Using modeling and anatomy, we show that realistic input patterns constrain combinatorial diversity by producing redundant combinations, which nevertheless could support temporal diversification of like combinations, suitable for learned timing. Our study suggests a neural substrate for producing high levels of both combinatorial and temporal diversity in the granule cell layer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Interlayer Repulsion of Retinal Ganglion Cell Mosaics Regulates Spatial Organization of Functional Maps in the Visual Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In higher mammals, orientation tuning of neurons is organized into a quasi-periodic pattern in the primary visual cortex. Our previous model studies suggested that the topography of cortical orientation maps may originate from moiré interference of ON and OFF retinal ganglion cell (RGC) mosaics, but did not account for how the consistent spatial period of maps could be achieved. Here we address this issue with two crucial findings on the development of RGC mosaics: first, homotypic local repulsion between RGCs can develop a long-range hexagonal periodicity. Second, heterotypic interaction restrains the alignment of ON and OFF mosaics, and generates a periodic interference pattern map with consistent spatial frequency. To validate our model, we quantitatively analyzed the RGC mosaics in cat data, and confirmed that the observed retinal mosaics showed evidence of heterotypic interactions, contrary to the previous view that ON and OFF mosaics are developed independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Orientation map is one of the most studied functional maps in the brain, but it has remained unanswered how the consistent spatial periodicity of maps could be developed. In the current study, we address this issue with our developmental model for the retinal origin of orientation map. We showed that local repulsive interactions between retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) can develop a hexagonal periodicity in the RGC mosaics and restrict the alignment between ON and OFF mosaics, so that they generate a periodic pattern with consistent spatial frequency for both the RGC mosaics and the cortical orientation maps. Our results demonstrate that the organization of functional maps in visual cortex, including its structural consistency, may be constrained by a retinal blueprint.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Ubiquitin E3 Ligase TRAF6 Exacerbates Ischemic Stroke by Ubiquitinating and Activating Rac1</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12123?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stroke is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and excitotoxicity contribute to neuronal death during ischemic stroke; however, the mechanisms underlying these complicated pathophysiological processes remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we found that the expression of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) was markedly increased after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in mice. TRAF6 ablation in male mice decreased the infarct volume and neurological deficit scores and decreased proinflammatory signaling, oxidative stress, and neuronal death after cerebral I/R, whereas transgenic overexpression of TRAF6 in male mice exhibited the opposite effects. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that TRAF6 induced Rac1 activation and consequently promoted I/R injury by directly binding and ubiquitinating Rac1. Either functionally mutating the TRAF6 ubiquitination site on Rac1 or inactivating Rac1 with a specific inhibitor reversed the deleterious effects of TRAF6 overexpression during I/R injury. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that TRAF6 is a key promoter of ischemic signaling cascades and neuronal death after cerebral I/R injury. Therefore, the TRAF6/Rac1 pathway might be a promising target to attenuate cerebral I/R injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Stroke is one of the most severe and devastating neurological diseases globally. The complicated pathophysiological processes restrict the translation of potential therapeutic targets into medicine. Further elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury may open a new window for pharmacological interventions to promote recovery from stroke. Our study revealed that ischemia-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) upregulation binds and ubiquitinates Rac1 directly, which promotes neuron death through neuroinflammation and neuro-oxidative signals. Therefore, precisely targeting the TRAF6-Rac1 axis may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for stroke recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Detailed Dendritic Excitatory/Inhibitory Balance through Heterosynaptic Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12106?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs is a key feature of cortical dynamics. Such a balance is arguably preserved in dendritic branches, yet its underlying mechanism and functional roles remain unknown. In this study, we developed computational models of heterosynaptic spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) to show that the excitatory/inhibitory balance in dendritic branches is robustly achieved through heterosynaptic interactions between excitatory and inhibitory synapses. The model reproduces key features of experimental heterosynaptic STDP well, and provides analytical insights. Furthermore, heterosynaptic STDP explains how the maturation of inhibitory neurons modulates the selectivity of excitatory neurons for binocular matching in the critical period plasticity. The model also provides an alternative explanation for the potential mechanism underlying the somatic detailed balance that is commonly associated with inhibitory STDP. Our results propose heterosynaptic STDP as a critical factor in synaptic organization and the resultant dendritic computation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Recent experimental studies reveal that relative differences in spike timings experienced among neighboring glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses on a dendritic branch significantly influences changes in the efficiency of these synapses. This heterosynaptic form of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is potentially important for shaping the synaptic organization and computation of neurons, but its functional role remains elusive. Through computational modeling at the parameter regime where previous experimental results are well reproduced, we show that heterosynaptic plasticity serves to finely balance excitatory and inhibitory inputs on the dendrite. Our results suggest a principle of GABA-driven neural circuit formation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: FGF-FGFR Mediates the Activity-Dependent Dendritogenesis of Layer IV Neurons during Barrel Formation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12094?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and FGF receptors (FGFRs) are known for their potent effects on cell proliferation/differentiation and cortical patterning in the developing brain. However, little is known regarding the roles of FGFs/FGFRs in cortical circuit formation. Here we show that &lt;i&gt;Fgfr1&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;/3 and &lt;i&gt;Fgf7&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;9&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;10&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;22&lt;/i&gt; mRNAs are expressed in the developing primary somatosensory (S1) barrel cortex. Barrel cortex layer IV spiny stellate cells (bSCs) are the primary recipients of ascending sensory information via thalamocortical axons (TCAs). Detail quantification revealed distinctive phases for bSC dendritogenesis: orienting dendrites toward TCAs, adding &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; dendritic segments, and elongating dendritic length, while maintaining dendritic patterns. Deleting &lt;i&gt;Fgfr1&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt; in bSCs had minimal impact on dendritic polarity but transiently increased the number of dendritic segments. However, 6 d later, FGFR1/2/3 loss of function reduced dendritic branch numbers. These data suggest that FGFs/FGFRs have a role in stabilizing dendritic patterning. Depolarization of cultured mouse cortical neurons upregulated the levels of several &lt;i&gt;Fgf&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Fgfr&lt;/i&gt; mRNAs within 2 h. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt;, within 6 h of systemic kainic acid administration at postnatal day 6, mRNA levels of &lt;i&gt;Fgf9&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Fgf10&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Fgfr2c&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Fgfr3b&lt;/i&gt; in S1 cortices were enhanced, and this was accompanied by exuberant dendritogenesis of bSCs by 24 h. Deleting &lt;i&gt;Fgfr1&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt; abolished kainic acid-induced bSC dendritic overgrowth. Finally, FGF9/10 gain of function also resulted in extensive dendritogenesis. Together, our data suggest that FGFs/FGFRs can be regulated by glutamate transmission to modulate/stabilize bSC dendritic complexity. Both male and female mice were used for our study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Glutamatergic transmission plays critical roles in cortical circuit formation. Its dysregulation has been proposed as a core factor in the etiology of many neurological diseases. We found that excessive glutamate transmission upregulated mRNA expression of &lt;i&gt;Fgfrs&lt;/i&gt; and their ligands &lt;i&gt;Fgfs&lt;/i&gt;. Deleting &lt;i&gt;Fgfr1&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt; not only impaired bSC dendritogenesis but also abolished glutamate transmission-induced dendritic overgrowth. Overexpressing FGF9 or FGF10 in cortical glutamatergic neurons results in excessive dendritic outgrowth within 24 h, resembling the changes induced by excessive glutamate transmission. Our findings provide strong evidence for the physiological role of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and FGF receptors (FGFRs) in establishing and maintaining cortical circuits. Perturbing the expression levels of FGFs/FGFRs by excessive glutamatergic neurotransmission could lead to abnormal neuronal circuits, which may contribute to neurological and psychiatric disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: February 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Zilong   Qiu&lt;br /&gt;  MECP2 is a critical gene for neural development, mutations or duplication of which led to severe neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Rett syndrome (RTT) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Extensive works during the past decade yield ample insights into the molecular and cellular functions of MeCP2 in neural development. Furthermore, genetic manipulations in Mecp2 mouse models strongly suggested that deficiency in synaptic plasticity and various behaviors of Mecp2 null or transgenic mice could be rescued in adulthood. Further studies elucidating neural circuits responsible for symptoms in MECP2-associated disorders in rodent and non-human primate models will shed light on the development of potential therapeutic interventions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: December 2017&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 47&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Mary A   Logan&lt;br /&gt; Glial cells are essential for proper formation and maintenance of the nervous system. During development, glia keep neuronal cell numbers in check and ensure that mature neural circuits are appropriately sculpted by engulfing superfluous cells and projections. In the adult brain, glial cells offer metabolic sustenance and provide critical immune support in the face of acute and chronic challenges. Dysfunctional glial immune activity is believed to contribute to age-related cognitive decline, as well as neurodegenerative disease risk, but we still know surprisingly little about the specific molecular pathways that govern glia-neuron communication in the healthy or diseased brain. Drosophila offers a versatile in vivo model to explore the conserved molecular underpinnings of glial cell biology and glial cell contributions to brain function, health, and disease susceptibility. This review addresses recent findings describing how Drosophila glial cells influence neuronal activity in the adult fly brain to support optimal brain function and, importantly, highlights new insights into specific glial defects that may contribute to neuronal demise. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: December 2017&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 47&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Alicia   Hidalgo, Ann   Logan&lt;br /&gt; The regenerative response of ensheating glia to central nervous system (CNS) injury involves proliferation and differentiation, axonal re-enwrapment and some recovery of behaviour. Understanding this limited response could enable the enhancement of it. In Drosophila, the glial progenitor state is maintained by Notch, an activator of cell division and Prospero (Pros), a repressor. Injury provokes the activation of NFκB and up-regulation of Kon-tiki (Kon), driving cell proliferation. Homeostatic switch-off comes about as two negative feedback loops involving Pros terminate the response. Importantly, the functions of the kon and pros homologues NG2 and prox1, respectively, are conserved in mammalian NG2 glia. Controlling these genes is key for therapeutic manipulation of progenitors and stem cells to promote regeneration of the damaged CNS. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: June 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Guosong   Hong, Xiao   Yang, Tao   Zhou, Charles M   Lieber&lt;br /&gt; Existing implantable neurotechnologies for understanding the brain and treating neurological diseases have intrinsic properties that have limited their capability to achieve chronically-stable brain interfaces with single-neuron spatiotemporal resolution. These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to ‘look and behave’ like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Critical to progressing the field is the identification of molecular underpinnings necessary for microglia to carry out these important functions within neural circuits. Here, we focus a review specifically on roles for microglial cytokine signaling within developing and mature neural circuits. We review exciting new studies demonstrating essential roles for microglial cytokine signaling in axon outgrowth, synaptogenesis and synapse maturation during development, as well as synaptic transmission and plasticity in adulthood. Together, these studies identify microglia and cytokines as critical modulators of neural circuits within the healthy brain, with implications for a broad range of neurological disorders with disruptions in synaptic structure and function. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;h3&quot;&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; height=&quot;178&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S095943881730137X-fx1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;301&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

The morphological and molecular heterogeneity of oligodendrocytes and their progenitors point to functions beyond establishing saltatory nerve conduction. Here, we review the diversity in the oligodendroglial lineage as well as the classical and new functions identified for oligodendrocytes and their progenitors. Because oligodendroglia remain highly responsive to environmental changes, they likely contribute to various neurological and psychiatric diseases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Human neuroimaging studies consistently show a hunger-dependent, selective enhancement of responses to images of food in association cortex and amygdala. More recently, cellular-resolution imaging combined with circuit mapping experiments in behaving mice have revealed underlying neuronal population dynamics and enabled tracing of pathways by which hunger circuits influence the assignment of value to visual objects in visual association cortex, insular cortex, and amygdala. These experiments begin to provide a mechanistic understanding of motivation-specific neural processing of need-relevant cues in healthy humans and in disease states such as obesity and other eating disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Since the earliest days of embryology, lineage questions have been addressed with methods of increasing specificity, capacity, and resolution. Yet, a full realization of individual cell lineages remains challenging for complex systems. A recent explosion of technical advances in genome-editing and single-cell sequencing has enabled lineage analysis in an unprecedented scale, speed, and depth across different species. In this review, we discuss the application of available as well as future genetic labeling techniques for tracking neural lineages in vivo in the mammalian nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

During development, individual gene activity can dynamically engage different signaling networks; thus genetic mutations can lead to different functional changes at different times. Interpretation of phenotypes can be further complicated if initial functional changes trigger compensatory mechanisms. Examining genetic mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders reveals cellular phenotypes that change over the course of development and exist long before behavioral deficits are assessed. Correspondingly, earlier genetic interventions in these disorder models have often been more effective at improving behavioral deficits than late interventions. The restricted period of effective intervention demonstrates that identifying a target window is an essential component of treatment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Recent work suggests that they play a key role in regulating brain energy supply by increasing blood flow to regions where neurons are active, and setting the baseline level of blood flow. Controversy persists over whether lactate derived from astrocyte glycolysis is used to power oxidative phosphorylation in neurons, but astrocytes sustain neuronal ATP production by recycling neurotransmitter glutamate that would otherwise need to be resynthesised from glucose, and by providing a short-term energy store in the form of glycogen that can be mobilised when neurons are active. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: December 2017&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 47&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Elizabeth R   Lamkin, Maxwell G   Heiman&lt;br /&gt; Glia adopt remarkable shapes that are tightly coordinated with the morphologies of their neuronal partners. To achieve these precise shapes, glia and neurons exhibit coordinated morphological changes on the time scale of minutes and on size scales ranging from nanometers to hundreds of microns. Here, we review recent studies that reveal the highly dynamic, localized morphological changes of mammalian neuron–glia contacts. We then explore the power of Drosophila and C. elegans models to study coordinated changes at defined neuron–glia contacts, highlighting the use of innovative genetic and imaging tools to uncover the molecular mechanisms responsible for coordinated morphogenesis of neurons and glia. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Derived from the yolk sac during development, microglia self-renew, self-regulate their numbers during homeostatic conditions, and show a robust proliferative capacity even in adulthood. Together with monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), microglia coordinate the regeneration of CNS myelin around axons, termed remyelination. Gene expression analyses and experimental modelling have identified pro-remyelination roles for microglia/MDM in clearance of myelin debris, secretion of growth factors, and remodelling of the extracellular matrix. Further investigations into the molecular mechanisms controlling these regenerative functions will reveal novel therapeutic strategies to enhance remyelination, by harnessing the beneficial effects of the innate immune response to injury. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

However, microglia enter the brain during embryogenesis and recent studies have revealed additional early functions of these immune cells in prenatal and perinatal cerebral development. Such findings are of importance since prenatal inflammation and microglia dysfunction have been associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders. This review provides a selective overview of the early roles of microglia, their link with a specific spatiotemporal distribution and how they can be modulated by intrinsic factors or environmental signals. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

This neural activity reflects internal processes by which the brain plans and executes volitional movements. The study of motor planning offers an opportunity to understand how the structure and dynamics of neural circuits support persistent internal states and how these states influence behavior. Recent advances in large-scale neural recordings are beginning to decipher the relationship of the dynamics of populations of neurons during motor planning and movements. New behavioral tasks in rodents, together with quantified perturbations, link dynamics in specific nodes of neural circuits to behavior. These studies reveal a neural network distributed across multiple brain regions that collectively supports motor planning. We review recent advances and highlight areas where further work is needed to achieve a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying motor planning and related cognitive processes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Studies have found that sensory, prefrontal, hippocampal, cerebellar, and striatal regions, as well as the circuits that connect them, are perturbed in mouse models of ASD and ID. Dissecting the disruptions in morphology and activity in these neural circuits might help us to understand the shared risk between the two disorders as well as their clinical heterogeneity. Treatments that target the balance between excitation and inhibition in these regions are able to reverse pathological phenotypes, elucidating this deficit as a commonality across models and opening new avenues for intervention. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Numerous genes in the endo-lysosomal pathways have been found to associate with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations of these genes lead to dysfunction in multiple steps of the endo-lysosomal network: autophagy, endocytic trafficking and lysosomal degradation, resulting in accumulation of pathogenic proteins. Although the exact pathogenic mechanism varies for different disease-associated genes, dysfunction of the endo-lysosomal pathways represents a converging mechanism shared by these diseases. Therefore, strategies that correct or compensate for endo-lysosomal dysfunction may be promising therapeutic approaches to treat neurodegenerative diseases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A geometric model of multi-scale orientation preference maps via Gabor functions. (arXiv:1712.04329v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04329</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04329</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper we present a new model for the generation of orientation
preference maps in the primary visual cortex (V1), considering both orientation
and scale features. First we undertake to model the functional architecture of
V1 by interpreting it as a principal fiber bundle over the 2-dimensional
retinal plane by introducing intrinsic variables orientation and scale. The
intrinsic variables constitute a fiber on each point of the retinal plane and
the set of receptive profiles of simple cells is located on the fiber. Each
receptive profile on the fiber is mathematically interpreted as a rotated Gabor
function derived from an uncertainty principle. The visual stimulus is lifted
in a 4-dimensional space, characterized by coordinate variables, position,
orientation and scale, through a linear filtering of the stimulus with Gabor
functions. Orientation preference maps are then obtained by mapping the
orientation value found from the lifting of a noise stimulus onto the
2-dimensional retinal plane. This corresponds to a Bargmann transform in the
reducible representation of the $\text{SE}(2)=\mathbb{R}^2\times S^1$ group. A
comparison will be provided with a previous model based on the Bargman
transform in the irreducible representation of the $\text{SE}(2)$ group,
outlining that the new model is more physiologically motivated. Then we present
simulation results related to the construction of the orientation preference
map by using Gabor filters with different scales and compare those results to
the relevant neurophysiological findings in the literature.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Concept Formation and Dynamics of Repeated Inference in Deep Generative Models. (arXiv:1712.04195v1 [stat.ML])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04195</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04195</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep generative models are reported to be useful in broad applications
including image generation. Repeated inference between data space and latent
space in these models can denoise cluttered images and improve the quality of
inferred results. However, previous studies only qualitatively evaluated image
outputs in data space, and the mechanism behind the inference has not been
investigated. The purpose of the current study is to numerically analyze
changes in activity patterns of neurons in the latent space of a deep
generative model called a &quot;variational auto-encoder&quot; (VAE). What kinds of
inference dynamics the VAE demonstrates when noise is added to the input data
are identified. The VAE embeds a dataset with clear cluster structures in the
latent space and the center of each cluster of multiple correlated data points
(memories) is referred as the concept. Our study demonstrated that transient
dynamics of inference first approaches a concept, and then moves close to a
memory. Moreover, the VAE revealed that the inference dynamics approaches a
more abstract concept to the extent that the uncertainty of input data
increases due to noise. It was demonstrated that by increasing the number of
the latent variables, the trend of the inference dynamics to approach a concept
can be enhanced, and the generalization ability of the VAE can be improved.

	<description>Parkinsons disease (PD) is an age-dependent neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of substantia nigra dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons in ventral midbrain (MB). Identification of interactions between aging and the known risk variants is crucial to understanding the etiology of PD. Recessive mutations in SYNJ1 have recently been linked to familial early-onset atypical Parkinsonism. We now show an age-dependent decline of SYNJ1 expression in the striatum as well as in striatal DAergic terminals of aged mice. Heterozygous deletion of SYNJ1 in mice causes selective elevation of PIP2 in the MB, and manipulation of PIP2 levels also impairs synaptic vesicle recycling preferentially in MB neurons. SYNJ1+/- mice display progressive PD-like behavioral alterations and DAergic terminal degeneration. Furthermore, we found down-regulation of human SYNJ1 transcripts in a subset of sporadic PD brains, corroborating the role of an age-dependent decrease in SYNJ1 in predisposing DAergic neuron vulnerability and PD pathogenesis.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Ultrafast glutamate sensors resolve synaptic short-term plasticity</title>

	<description>Glutamatergic synapses display a rich repertoire of plasticity mechanisms on many different time scales, involving dynamic changes in the efficacy of transmitter release as well as changes in the number and function of postsynaptic glutamate receptors. The genetically encoded glutamate sensor iGluSnFR enables visualization of glutamate release from presynaptic terminals at frequencies up to ~10 Hz. However, to resolve glutamate dynamics during high frequency bursts, faster indicators are required. Here we report the development of fast (iGluf) and ultrafast (iGluu) variants with comparable brightness, but increased Kd for glutamate (137 M and 600 M, respectively). Compared to iGluSnFR, iGluu has a 6-fold faster dissociation rate in vitro and 5-fold faster kinetics in synapses. Fitting a three-state model to kinetic data, we identify the large conformational change after glutamate binding as the rate-limiting step. In rat hippocampal slice culture stimulated at 100 Hz, we find that iGluu is sufficiently fast to resolve individual glutamate release events, revealing that glutamate is rapidly cleared from the synaptic cleft. Depression of iGluu responses during 100 Hz trains correlates with depression of postsynaptic EPSPs, indicating that depression during high frequency stimulation is purely presynaptic in origin. At individual boutons, the recovery from depression could be predicted from the amount of glutamate released on the second pulse (paired pulse facilitation/depression), demonstrating differential frequency-dependent filtering of spike trains at Schaffer collateral boutons.</description>

	<description>Mechanical allodynia is a major symptom of neuropathic pain whereby innocuous touch evokes severe pain. Here we identify a population of peripheral sensory neurons expressing TrkB that are both necessary and sufficient for producing pain from light touch after nerve injury. Mice in which TrkB-Cre expressing neurons are ablated are less sensitive to the lightest touch under basal conditions, and fail to develop mechanical allodynia in a model of neuropathic pain. Moreover, selective optogenetic activation of these neurons after nerve injury evokes marked nociceptive behavior. Using a phototherapeutic approach based upon BDNF, the ligand for TrkB, we perform molecule-guided laser ablation of these neurons and achieve long-term retraction of TrkB positive neurons from the skin and pronounced reversal of mechanical allodynia across multiple types of neuropathic pain. Thus we identify the peripheral neurons which transmit pain from light touch and uncover a novel pharmacological strategy for its treatment.</description>

	<description>The neural mechanisms underlying face and object recognition are understood to originate in ventral occipital-temporal cortex. A key feature of the functional architecture of the visual ventral pathway is its category-selectivity, yet it is unclear how category-selective regions process ambiguous visual input which violates category boundaries. One example is the spontaneous misperception of faces in inanimate objects such as the Man in the Moon, in which an object belongs to more than one category and face perception is divorced from its usual diagnostic visual features. We used fMRI to investigate the representation of illusory faces in category-selective regions. The perception of illusory faces was decodable from activation patterns in the fusiform face area (FFA) and lateral occipital complex (LOC), but not from other visual areas. Further, activity in FFA was strongly modulated by the perception of illusory faces, such that even objects with vastly different visual features were represented similarly if all images contained an illusory face. The results show that the FFA is broadly-tuned for face detection, not finely-tuned to the homogenous visual properties that typically distinguish faces from other objects. A complete understanding of high-level vision will require explanation of the mechanisms underlying natural errors of face detection.</description>

	<description>Humans have the largest cerebral cortex among primates. A long-standing controversy is whether association cortex, particularly prefrontal cortex (PFC), is disproportionately larger in humans compared to nonhuman primates, as some studies report that human PFC is relatively expanded whereas others report uniform PFC scaling. We address this controversy using MRI-derived cortical surfaces of many individual humans, chimpanzees, and macaques. We present two parcellation-based PFC delineations based on cytoarchitecture and function and show that a previously used morphological surrogate (cortex anterior to the genu of the corpus callosum) substantially underestimates PFC extent, especially in humans. We find that the proportion of cortical gray matter occupied by PFC in humans is up to 86% larger than in macaques and 24% larger than in chimpanzees. The disparity is even greater for PFC white matter volume, which is 140% larger in humans compared to macaques and 71% larger than in chimpanzees.</description>

	<description>Covert visual attention has been shown repeatedly to enhance performance on tasks involving the features and spatial locations to which it is deployed. Many neural correlates of covert attention have been found, but given the complexity of the visual system, connecting these neural effects to performance changes is challenging. Here, we use a deep convolutional neural network as a large-scale model of the visual system to test the effects of applying attention-like neural changes. Particularly, we explore variants of the feature similarity gain model (FSGM) of attention---which relates a cell's tuning to its attentional modulation. We show that neural modulation of the type and magnitude observed experimentally can lead to performance changes of the type and magnitude observed experimentally. Furthermore, performance enhancements from attention occur for a diversity of tasks: high level object category detection and classification, low level orientation detection, and cross-modal color classification of an attended orientation. Utilizing the full observability of the model we also determine how activity should change to best enhance performance and how activity changes propagate through the network. Through this we find that, for attention applied at certain layers, modulating activity according to tuning performs as well as attentional modulations determined by backpropagation. At other layers, attention applied according to tuning does not successfully propagate through the network, and has a weaker impact on performance than attention determined by backpropagation. This thus highlights a potential discrepancy between neural tuning and function.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: White matter correlates of hemi-face dominance in emotional expression</title>

	<description>The neural underpinnings of human emotional expression are thought to be unevenly distributed among brain hemispheres. However, little is known on the anatomy supporting this claim, particularly in the cerebral white matter. Here we explored the relationship between hemi-face dominance in emotional expression and cerebral white matter asymmetries in 33 participants. Measures of emotional expression were derived from picture of their faces in a happy smiling and a sad frowning conditions. Chimeric faces were constructed by assembling right and left hemi-faces, respectively, with their mirrored version. These faces were presented in competition at the extremities of a 155mm segment to be marked according to the emotional intensity. A jury made of 10 additional participants evaluated the set of chimeric facial stimuli. Hemispheric asymmetry of the uncinate, the cingulum and the three branches of superior longitudinal fasciculi were derived from diffusion-weighted imaging tractography dissections. Group effect analyses indicated that the degree of asymmetry in emotional expression was not as prominent as reported in the literature with a large inter-individual variability. Secondly, anatomical dissections replicated previous finding in white matter anatomical lateralisation. Lastly, a strong relationship was revealed between SLF I and happy hemi-face dominance so that the greater the hemispheric lateralisation of SLF I, the more the expression of happiness in the contralateral half of the face. This result brings up interesting hypotheses on the relationship of the SLF I and emotional expression, especially its role in mood disorders.</description>

	<description>Electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and related techniques are prone to glitches, slow drift, steps, etc., that contaminate the data and interfere with the analysis and interpretation. These artifacts are usually addressed in a preprocessing phase that attempts to remove them or minimize their impact. This paper offers a set of useful techniques for this purpose: robust detrending, robust rereferencing, outlier detection, data interpolation (inpainting), step removal, and filter ringing artifact removal. These techniques provide a less wasteful alternative to discarding corrupted trials or channels, and they are relatively immune to artifacts that disrupt alternative approaches such as filtering. Robust detrending allows slow drifts and common mode signals to be factored out while avoiding the deleterious effects of glitches. Robust rereferencing reduces the impact of artifacts on the reference. Inpainting allows corrupt data to be interpolated from intact parts based on the correlation structure estimated over the intact parts. Outlier detection allows the corrupt parts to be identified. Step removal fixes the high-amplitude flux jump artifacts that are common with some MEG systems. Ringing removal allows the ringing response of the antialiasing filter to glitches (steps, pulses) to be suppressed. The performance of the methods is illustrated and evaluated using synthetic data and data from real EEG and MEG systems. These methods, which are are mainly automatic and require little tuning, can greatly improve the quality of the data.</description>

	<description>The present study aimed at investigating whether associated motivational salience causes preferential processing of inherently neutral faces similar to emotional expressions by means of event-related brain potentials (ERPs) and changes of the pupil size. To this aim, neutral faces were implicitly associated with monetary outcome, while participants (N = 44) performed a subliminal face-matching task that ensured performance around chance level and thus an equal proportion of gain, loss, and zero outcomes. Motivational context strongly impacted processing of all - even task-irrelevant - stimuli prior to the target face, indicated by enhanced amplitudes of subsequent ERP components and increased pupil size. In a separate test session, previously associated faces as well as novel faces with emotional expressions were presented within the same task but without motivational context and performance feedback. Most importantly, previously gain-associated faces amplified the LPC, although the individually contingent face-outcome assignments were not made explicit during the learning session. Emotional expressions impacted the N170 and EPN components. Modulations of the pupil size were absent in both motivationally-associated and emotional conditions. Our findings demonstrate that neural representations of neutral stimuli can acquire increased salience via implicit learning, with an advantage for gain over loss associations.</description>

Recurrent and feedback networks are capable of holding dynamic memories. Nonetheless, training a network for that task is challenging. In order to do so, one should face non-linear propagation of errors in the system. Small deviations from the desired dynamics due to error or inherent noise might have a dramatic effect in the future. A method to cope with these difficulties is thus needed. In this work we focus on recurrent networks with linear activation functions and binary output unit. We characterize its ability to reproduce a temporal sequence of actions over its output unit. We suggest casting the temporal learning problem to a perceptron problem. In the discrete case a finite margin appears, providing the network, to some extent, robustness to noise, for which it performs perfectly (i.e. producing a desired sequence for an arbitrary number of cycles flawlessly). In the continuous case the margin approaches zero when the output unit changes its state, hence the network is only able to reproduce the sequence with slight jitters. Numerical simulation suggest that in the discrete time case, the longest sequence that can be learned scales, at best, as square root of the network size. A dramatic effect occurs when learning several short sequences in parallel, that is, their total length substantially exceeds the length of the longest single sequence the network can learn. This model easily generalizes to an arbitrary number of output units, which boost its performance. This effect is demonstrated by considering two practical examples for sequence learning. This work suggests a way to overcome stability problems for training recurrent networks and further quantifies the performance of a network under the specific learning scheme.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ezNQD0Wd52s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Expansion microscopy (ExM) allows scalable imaging of preserved 3D biological specimens with nanoscale resolution on fast diffraction-limited microscopes. Here, we explore the utility of ExM in the larval and embryonic zebrafish, an important model organism for the study of neuroscience and development. Regarding neuroscience, we found that ExM enabled the...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/REUCV1alMrs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>The PhoQ/PhoP two-component system plays an essential role in the response of enterobacteria to the environment of their mammalian hosts. It is known to sense several stimuli that are potentially associated with the host, including extracellular magnesium limitation, low pH, and the presence of cationic antimicrobial peptides. Here, we show...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/XRxSgCmJqmQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>ESX (ESAT-6 system) export systems play diverse roles across mycobacterial species. Interestingly, genetic disruption of ESX systems in different species does not result in an accumulation of protein substrates in the mycobacterial cell. However, the mechanisms underlying this observation are elusive. We hypothesized that the levels of ESX substrates were...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/7FyDtB2jU9Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked disorder with dystrophin loss that results in skeletal and cardiac muscle weakening and early death. Loss of the dystrophin–sarcoglycan complex delocalizes nitric oxide synthase (NOS) to alter its signaling, and augments mechanosensitive intracellular Ca2+ influx. The latter has been coupled to hyperactivation of...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/3Vqcy2VTsj8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25106-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess the spectrum of genetic anomalies in a cohort of children presenting at least one cerebral or spinal pial arteriovenous fistula (AVF), and to describe their clinical characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25106-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 1988 to 2016, all consecutive patients with at least one cerebral or spinal pial AVF were screened for genetic disease. All patients aged &amp;lt;18 years were included. Symptoms associated with AVF were recorded: heart failure, neurological deficit/seizure, and hemorrhage. The outcome was assessed using the modified Rankin Scale and school performance in children with cerebral AVF and the American Spinal Injury Association impairment scale in children with spinal AVF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25106-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forty-three children were included. Twenty-five children were male and 18 were female. A germline mutation was identified in 23 probands (53.5 ± 14.9%): 8 in &lt;em&gt;ENG&lt;/em&gt; (34.8 ± 14.2%), 1 in &lt;em&gt;ACVRL1&lt;/em&gt; (4.3 ± 6%) leading to a diagnosis of HHT, and 14 in &lt;em&gt;RASA1&lt;/em&gt; (60.9 ± 14.4%) leading to a diagnosis of capillary malformation/arteriovenous malformation type 1. No &lt;em&gt;EphB4&lt;/em&gt; gene mutation was identified. HHT patients presented a significantly lower rate of heart failure at diagnosis (p = 0.047). A trend toward an increased bleeding rate at presentation was observed in HHT (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.069) and an increased rate of giant venous pouch in children in whom no mutation was identified (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.097). Finally, an association with &lt;em&gt;RASA1&lt;/em&gt; mutation was observed in children with associated skin capillary hemangioma (&lt;em&gt;p &amp;lt; &lt;/em&gt; 0001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25106-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results highlight the importance of genetic testing in this setting in view of the high frequency of gene mutations in pediatric cerebrospinal AVFs, and show the predominance of RASA1 over HHT mutations.

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25107-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We performed a series of postmortem immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent stainings, as well as Western blot analyses, on cervical and lumbar sections of the spinal cord in patients diagnosed with HD (n = 11 of all grades of disease severity) along with sex- and age-matched healthy controls (n = 9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25107-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We observed that mHTT was preferably expressed within the anterior horn of the gray matter, in both cervical and lumbar sections. At the cellular level, mHTT aggregates were more often encountered in the extracellular matrix but could also be observed within cell bodies and neurites as well as within the endothelium of blood vessels with an increase in the density of small blood vessels in cervical sections of HD cases. These vasculature changes were accompanied with features of BSCB leakage, as assessed by the presence of increased levels of fibrinogen in the surrounding parenchyma and enhanced leukocyte infiltration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25107-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This alteration in BSCB integrity may be explained, in part, by the dysregulation we found in some of the main proteins associated with it such as junctional adhesion molecule-1 and vascular endothelial cadherin. These observations have important implications for our understanding of HD pathology and may also have significant therapeutic implications.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The effect of single pyramidal neuron firing across and within layers in mouse V1</title>

	<description>The influence of cortical cell spiking activity on nearby cells has been studied extensively in vitro. Less is known, however, about the impact of single cell firing on local cortical networks in vivo. In a pioneering study, Kwan et al. (Kwan et al., 2012) reported that in mouse layer 2/3 (L2/3), under anesthesia, stimulating a single pyramidal cell recruits ~1.7% of neighboring pyramidal units. Here we employ two-photon calcium imaging, in conjunction with single-cell patch clamp stimulation, to probe, in both the awake and lightly anesthetized states, how i) activating single L2/3 pyramidal neurons recruits neighboring units within L2/3 and from layer 4 (L4) to L2/3, and whether ii) activating single pyramidal neurons changes population activity in local circuit. To do this, it was essential to develop an algorithm capable of quantifying how sensitive the calcium signal is at detecting effectively recruited units (followers). This algorithm allowed us to estimate the chance of detecting a follower as a function of the probability that an epoch of stimulation elicits one extra action potential (AP) in the follower cell. Using this approach, we found only a small fraction (&amp;lt;0.75%) of L2/3 cells to be significantly activated within a radius of ~200 microns from a stimulated neighboring L2/3 pyramidal cell. This fraction did not change significantly in the awake versus the lightly anesthetized state, nor when stimulating L2/3 versus underlying L4 pyramidal neurons. These numbers are in general agreement with, though lower than, the percentage of neighboring cells (2.1%) reported by Kwan et al. to be activated upon stimulating single L2/3 pyramidal neurons under anesthesia (Kwan et al., 2012). Interestingly, despite the small number of individual units found to be reliably driven, we did observe a modest but significant elevation in aggregate population responses compared to sham stimulation. This underscores the distributed impact that single cell stimulation has on neighboring microcircuit responses, revealing only a small minority of relatively strongly connected partners.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Structurally conserved primate lncRNAs are transiently expressed during human cortical differentiation and influence cell type specific genes</title>

	<description>The cerebral cortex has expanded in size and complexity in primates, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms are obscure. We generated cortical organoids from human, chimpanzee, orangutan, and rhesus pluripotent stem cells and sequenced their transcriptomes at weekly time points for comparative analysis. We used transcript structure and expression conservation to discover thousands of expressed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Of 2,975 human, multi-exonic lncRNAs, 2,143 were structurally conserved to chimpanzee, 1,731 to orangutan, and 1,290 to rhesus. 386 human lncRNAs were transiently expressed (TrEx) and a similar expression pattern was often observed in great apes (46%) and rhesus (31%). Many TrEx lncRNAs were associated with neuroepithelium, radial glia, or Cajal-Retzius cells by single cell RNA-sequencing. 3/8 tested by ectopic expression showed [≥]2-fold effects on neural genes. This rich resource of primate expression data in early cortical development provides a framework for identifying new, potentially functional lncRNAs.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Non-linear auto-regressive models for cross-frequency coupling in neural time series</title>

We address the issue of reliably detecting and quantifying cross-frequency coupling (CFC) in neural time series. Based on non-linear auto-regressive models, the proposed method provides a generative and parametric model of the time-varying spectral content of the signals. As this method models the entire spectrum simultaneously, it avoids the pitfalls related to incorrect filtering or the use of the Hilbert transform on wide-band signals. As the model is probabilistic, it also provides a score of the model “goodness of fit” via the likelihood, enabling easy and legitimate model selection and parameter comparison; this data-driven feature is unique to our model-based approach. Using three datasets obtained with invasive neurophysiological recordings in humans and rodents, we demonstrate that these models are able to replicate previous results obtained with other metrics, but also reveal new insights such as the influence of the amplitude of the slow oscillation. Using simulations, we demonstrate that our parametric method can reveal neural couplings with shorter signals than non-parametric methods. We also show how the likelihood can be used to find optimal filtering parameters, suggesting new properties on the spectrum of the driving signal, but also to estimate the optimal delay between the coupled signals, enabling a directionality estimation in the coupling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Gf07XBnb5Pg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Thalamocortical control of propofol phase-amplitude coupling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005879</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Austin E. Soplata, Michelle M. McCarthy, Jason Sherfey, Shane Lee, Patrick L. Purdon, Emery N. Brown, Nancy Kopell&lt;/p&gt;

The anesthetic propofol elicits many different spectral properties on the EEG, including alpha oscillations (8–12 Hz), Slow Wave Oscillations (SWO, 0.1–1.5 Hz), and dose-dependent phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between alpha and SWO. Propofol is known to increase GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; inhibition and decrease H-current strength, but how it generates these rhythms and their interactions is still unknown. To investigate both generation of the alpha rhythm and its PAC to SWO, we simulate a Hodgkin-Huxley network model of a hyperpolarized thalamus and corticothalamic inputs. We find, for the first time, that the model thalamic network is capable of independently generating the sustained alpha seen in propofol, which may then be relayed to cortex and expressed on the EEG. This dose-dependent sustained alpha critically relies on propofol GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; potentiation to alter the intrinsic spindling mechanisms of the thalamus. Furthermore, the H-current conductance and background excitation of these thalamic cells must be within specific ranges to exhibit any intrinsic oscillations, including sustained alpha. We also find that, under corticothalamic SWO UP and DOWN states, thalamocortical output can exhibit maximum alpha power at either the peak or trough of this SWO; this implies the thalamus may be the source of propofol-induced PAC. Hyperpolarization level is the main determinant of whether the thalamus exhibits trough-max PAC, which is associated with lower propofol dose, or peak-max PAC, associated with higher dose. These findings suggest: the thalamus generates a novel rhythm under GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; potentiation such as under propofol, its hyperpolarization may determine whether a patient experiences trough-max or peak-max PAC, and the thalamus is a critical component of propofol-induced cortical spectral phenomena. Changes to the thalamus may be a critical part of how propofol accomplishes its effects, including unconsciousness.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EiDZlgif6Xg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Predicting the pathogenicity of novel variants in mitochondrial tRNA with MitoTIP</title>

Novel or rare variants in mitochondrial tRNA sequences may be observed after mitochondrial DNA analysis. Determining whether these variants are pathogenic is critical, but confirmation of the effect of a variant on mitochondrial function can be challenging. We have used available databases of benign and pathogenic variants, alignment between diverse tRNAs, structural information and comparative genomics to predict the impact of all possible single-base variants and deletions. The Mitochondrial tRNA Informatics Predictor (MitoTIP) is available through MITOMAP at www.mitomap.org. The source code for MitoTIP is available at www.github.com/sonneysa/MitoTIP.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1VQ29nO77z4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Antisense suppression of glial fibrillary acidic protein as a treatment for Alexander disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25118</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25118</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Alexander disease is a fatal leukodystrophy caused by autosomal dominant gain-of-function mutations in the gene for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an intermediate filament protein primarily expressed in astrocytes of the central nervous system. A key feature of pathogenesis is over-expression and accumulation of GFAP, with formation of characteristic cytoplasmic aggregates known as Rosenthal fibers. Here we investigate whether suppressing GFAP with antisense oligonucleotides could provide a therapeutic strategy for treating Alexander disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: In this study we use GFAP mutant mouse models of Alexander disease to test the efficacy of antisense suppression and evaluate the effects on molecular and cellular phenotypes and non-cell autonomous toxicity. Antisense oligonucleotides were designed to target the murine &lt;em&gt;Gfap&lt;/em&gt; transcript, and screened using primary mouse cortical cultures. Lead oligonucleotides were then tested for their ability to reduce GFAP transcripts and protein, first in wild-type mice with normal levels of GFAP, and then in adult mutant mice with established pathology and elevated levels of GFAP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Nearly complete and long-lasting elimination of GFAP occurred in brain and spinal cord following single bolus intracerebroventricular injections, with a striking reversal of Rosenthal fibers and downstream markers of microglial and other stress related responses. GFAP protein was also cleared from cerebrospinal fluid, demonstrating its potential utility as a biomarker in future clinical applications. Finally, treatment led to improved body condition and rescue of hippocampal neurogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: These results demonstrate the efficacy of antisense suppression for an astrocyte target, and provide a compelling therapeutic approach for Alexander disease.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The work of a single musician, group or composer can vary widely in terms of
musical style. Indeed, different stylistic elements, from performance medium
and rhythm to harmony and texture, are typically exploited and developed across
an artist's lifetime. Yet, there is often a discernable character to the work
of, for instance, individual composers at the perceptual level - an experienced
listener can often pick up on subtle clues in the music to identify the
composer or performer. Here we suggest that a convolutional network may learn
these subtle clues or features given an appropriate representation of the
music. In this paper, we apply a deep convolutional neural network to a large
audio dataset and empirically evaluate its performance on audio classification
tasks. Our trained network demonstrates accurate performance on such
classification tasks when presented with 5 s examples of music obtained by
simple transformations of the raw audio waveform. A particularly interesting
example is the spectral representation of music obtained by application of a
logarithmically spaced filter bank, mirroring the early stages of auditory
signal transduction in mammals. The most successful representation of music to
facilitate discrimination was obtained via a random matrix transform (RMT).
Networks based on logarithmic filter banks and RMT were able to correctly guess
the one composer out of 31 possibilities in 68 and 84 percent of cases
respectively.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Differential default-mode network functional connectivity and morphometric changes in Alzheimers disease</title>

	<description>We report group level differential detection of functional connectivity disruption and morphometric changes in the CN to MCI transition in an age-, education- and gender-matched 105 subjects ADNI database, using same-session structural MRI and rsfMRI. In Dementia-MCI and Dementia-CN comparisons, but not MCI-CN comparisons of FreeSurfer estimates of thickness in 68 cortical regions, 28 subcortical volumes, and 22 hippocampal subfield volumes, characteristic atrophy was detected by one-way, three-factor ANOVA and post hoc pairwise t tests. By contrast, functional connectivity analysis of 57 left hemisphere medial temporal lobe and subcortical ROIs with 82 ROIs in both hemispheres, and 69 right MTL and subcortical ROIs with 120 ROIs in both hemispheres, detected significant MCI-CN changes. Confirmatory findings include an anterior-posterior cortical DMN disconnect. Novel findings include a bilateral hemispheric disconnect, a posterior DMN left-right hemisphere disconnect and a DMN dorsal-ventral disconnect involving thalamus, hippocampus, and posterior MTL. A novel data-driven approach for ROI identification and selection was developed and implemented with the AFNI toolkit. These findings position resting-state functional MRI connectivity biomarkers within a model Alzheimers disease pathophysiological cascade as coincident with and potentially in advance of morphometric biomarkers of the CN to MCI transition.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A chemosensory switch couples genetic sex to behavioral valence</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/231936v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/231936v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>As a fundamental dimension of internal state, biological sex modulates neural circuits to generate naturally occurring behavioral variation. Understanding how and why circuits are tuned by sex can provide important insights into neural and behavioral plasticity. Here, we find that sexually dimorphic behavioral responses to C. elegans ascaroside sex pheromones are implemented by the functional modulation of shared chemosensory circuitry. In particular, the sexual state of a single sensory neuron pair, ADF, determines the nature of an animal's behavioral response regardless of the sex of the rest of the body. Genetic feminization of ADF causes males to be repelled by, rather than attracted to, ascarosides, while masculinization of ADF is sufficient to make ascarosides attractive to hermaphrodites. Genetic sex modulates ADF function by tuning chemosensation: ADF is able to detect the ascaroside ascr#3 only in males, a consequence of cell-autonomous action of the master sexual regulator tra-1. Genetic sex regulates behavior in part through the conserved DMRT gene mab-3, whose male-specific expression in ADF promotes ascaroside attraction. The sexual modulation of ADF has a key role in reproductive fitness, as feminization or ablation of ADF renders males unable to use ascarosides to locate mates. These results demonstrate that DMRT genes can functionally modulate shared neural circuits; moreover, they reveal an adaptive mechanism in which chromosomal sex controls a cell-autonomous switch that tunes sensory function, determines behavioral valence, and promotes reproductive fitness.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Value Encoding in the Globus Pallidus: fMRI reveals an interaction effect between reward and dopamine drive</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/231910v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>The external part of the globus pallidus (GPe) is a core nucleus of the basal ganglia (BG) whose activity is disrupted under conditions of low dopamine release, as in Parkinson's disease. Current models assume decreased dopamine release in the dorsal striatum results in deactivation of dorsal GPe, which in turn affects motor expression via a regulatory effect on other nuclei of the BG. However, recent studies in healthy and pathological animal models have reported neural dynamics that do not match with this view of the GPe as a relay in the BG circuit. Thus, the computational role of the GPe in the BG is still to be determined. We previously proposed a neural model that revisits the functions of the nuclei of the BG, and this model predicts that GPe encodes values which are amplified under a condition of low striatal dopaminergic drive. To test this prediction, we used an fMRI paradigm involving a within-subject placebo-controlled design, using the dopamine antagonist risperidone, wherein healthy volunteers performed a motor selection and maintenance task under low and high reward conditions. ROI-based fMRI analysis revealed an interaction between reward and dopamine drive manipulations, with increased BOLD activity in GPe in a high compared to low reward condition, and under risperidone compared to placebo. These results confirm the core prediction of our computational model, and provide a new perspective on neural dynamics in the BG and their effects on motor selection and motor disorders.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Toxoplasmosis, but not borreliosis, is associated with psychiatric disorders: A cross-sectional survey on 46 thousand of subjects</title>

	<description>Infection by the parasite Toxoplasma, which affects about 33% of world population, is associated with increased risk of several mental health disorders, the most strongly with schizophrenia. It is unknown whether toxoplasmosis really plays a substantial role in the etiopathogenesis of these disorders and whether schizophrenia is associated with this infection the most strongly, or whether this association has just been the most intensively studied for historical reasons. We used the data from 3,440 and 7,800 subjects tested for toxoplasmosis and borreliosis, respectively, who took part in an internet survey, for searching in the associations of these infections with 22 mental health disorders and other indices of impaired mental health. The typical symptom associated with toxoplasmosis was anxiety, and the typical toxoplasmosis-associated disorders were autism (OR=4.86), schizophrenia (OR=3.34), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (OR=3.02), Asperger syndrome (OR=2.49), antisocial personality disorder (OR=1.81), OCD (OR=1.69), and anxiety disorder (OR=1.57). Borreliosis was associated only with symptoms of depression and with major depression (OR=1.65). The negative effects of borreliosis were detectable only in the Toxoplasma-infected subjects. Toxoplasmosis could play a substantial role in the etiopathogenesis of mental health disorders and its association with schizophrenia is the second strongest association, after autism.</description>

	<description>Identifying the maximal element (max, argmax) in a set is a core computational element in inference, decision making, optimization, action selection, consensus, and foraging. We show that running sequentially through a list of N fluctuating items takes Nlog(N) time to accurately find the max, prohibitively slow for large N. The power of computation in the brain is ascribed to its parallelism, yet it is theoretically unclear whether, even on an elemental task like the max operation, leaky and noisy neurons can perform a distributed computation that cuts the required time by a factor of N, a benchmark for parallel computation. We show that conventional winner-take-all circuit models fail to realize the parallelism benchmark and worse, in the presence of noise altogether fail to produce a winner when N is large. If, however, neurons are equipped with a second nonlinearity so that weakly active neurons cannot contribute inhibition to the circuit, the network matches the accuracy of the serial strategy but does so N times faster, partially self-adjusting integration time for task difficulty and number of options and saturating the parallelism benchmark without parameter fine-tuning. Finally, in the regime of few choices (small N), the same circuit predicts Hick's law of decision making; thus Hick's law behavior is a symptom of efficient parallel computation. Our work shows that distributed computation that saturates the parallelism benchmark is possible in networks of noisy and finite-memory neurons.</description>

	<description>In most animals, the brain controls the body via a set of descending neurons (DNs) that traverse the neck and terminate in post-cranial regions of the nervous system. This critical neural population is thought to activate, maintain and modulate locomotion and other behaviors. Although individual members of this cell class have been well-studied across species ranging from insects to primates, little is known about the overall connectivity pattern of DNs as a population. We undertook a systematic anatomical investigation of descending neurons in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, and created a collection of over 100 transgenic lines targeting individual cell types. Our methods allowed us to describe the morphology of roughly half of an estimated 400 DNs and create a comprehensive map of connectivity between the sensory neuropils in the brain and the motor neuropils in the ventral nerve cord. Like the vertebrate spinal cord, our results show that the fly nerve cord is a highly organized, layered system of neuropils, an organization that reflects the fact that insects are capable of two largely independent means of locomotion -- walking and fight -- using distinct sets of appendages. Our results reveal the basic functional map of descending pathways in flies and provide tools for systematic interrogation of sensory-motor circuits.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Sensory and decisional components of endogenous attention are dissociable.</title>

	<description>Endogenously cueing a stimulus for attention enhances sensory processing of the attended stimulus, and efficiently selects information from the attended stimulus for guiding behavioral decisions. Yet, it is unknown if these sensory and decisional components of endogenous attention are under the control of common, overlapping or distinct mechanisms. Here, we tested human observers in a multi-alternative visuospatial attention task with probabilistic spatial cues, whose predictive validity varied across spatial locations. Observers' behavioral choices were analyzed with a multidimensional signal detection model, derived from Bayesian decision theory. The model effectively decoupled attention's effects on perceptual sensitivity from those on decisional thresholds (bias), and revealed striking dissociations between them. Sensitivity was highest at the cued location, and not significantly different among uncued locations, suggesting a spotlight-like allocation of sensory resources at the cued location. On the other hand, bias varied systematically with endogenous cue validity, suggesting a graded distribution of decision thresholds across all locations. Cueing-induced modulations of sensitivity and bias were uncorrelated within and across subjects. Finally, bias selectively correlated with key measures of decision-making: reaction times were strongly correlated with bias, cueing-induced benefits in reaction times were correlated with bias changes independently of sensitivity changes, and subjects who exhibited higher bias, rather than higher sensitivity, toward the cued location produced more optimal behavioral decisions. Our model and findings demonstrate that endogenous cueing of attention does not engage a unitary selection mechanism, but rather involves the operation of dissociable sensory enhancement and decisional selection processes.</description>

	<description>Focused ultrasound has been shown to be effective at stimulating neurons in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro preparations. Ultrasonic neuromodulation is the only non-invasive method of stimulation that could reach deep in the brain with high spatial-temporal resolution, and thus has potential for use in clinical applications and basic studies of the nervous system. Understanding the physical mechanism by which energy in a high acoustic frequency wave is delivered to stimulate neurons will be important to optimize this technology. Two primary candidates for a physical mechanism are radiation force, the delivery of momentum by the acoustic wave, and cavitation, oscillating gas bubbles. We imaged the isolated salamander retina during ultrasonic stimuli that drive ganglion cell activity and observed micron scale displacements consistent with radiation force. We recorded ganglion cell spiking activity with a planar multielectrode array and changed the acoustic carrier frequency across a broad range (0.5 - 43 MHz), finding that increased stimulation occurs at higher acoustic frequencies, a result that is consistent with radiation force but not cavitation. A quantitative radiation force model can explain retinal responses, and could potentially explain previous in vivo results in the mouse, suggesting a new hypothesis to be tested in vivo. Finally, we found that neural activity was strongly modulated by the distance between the transducer and the electrode array showing the influence of standing waves on the response. We conclude that radiation force is the physical mechanism underlying ultrasonic neurostimulation in the ex vivo retina, and that the control of standing waves is a new potential method to modulate these effects.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Deep Brain Stimulation for Parkinson's disease changes perception in the Rubber Hand Illusion</title>

	<description>Parkinson's disease (PD) alters cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic circuitry and susceptibility to an illusion of bodily awareness, the Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI). Bodily awareness is thought to result from multisensory integration in a predominantly cortical network; the role of subcortical connections is unknown. We studied the effect of modulating cortico-subcortical circuitry on multisensory integration for bodily awareness in PD patients treated with subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) using the RHI experiment. Typically, synchronous visuo-tactile cues induce a false perception of touch on the rubber hand as if it were the subject's hand, whereas asynchronous visuo-tactile cues do not. However, we found that in the asynchronous condition, patients in the off-stimulation state did not reject the RHI as strongly as healthy controls; switching on STN-DBS partially 'normalised' their responses. Patients in the off-stimulation state also misjudged the position of their hand, indicating it to be closer to the rubber hand than controls. However, STN-DBS did not affect proprioceptive judgements or subsequent arm movements altered by the perceptual effects of the illusion. Our findings support the idea that the STN and subcortical connections have a key role in multisensory integration for bodily awareness. Decision-making in multisensory bodily illusions is discussed.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Effect of sleep on overnight CSF amyloid-β kinetics</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep disturbances are associated with future risk of Alzheimer's disease. Disrupted sleep increases soluble amyloid-β, suggesting a mechanism for sleep disturbances to increase Alzheimer's disease risk. We tested this response in humans using indwelling lumbar catheters to serially sample cerebrospinal fluid while participants were sleep-deprived, treated with sodium oxybate, or allowed to sleep normally. All participants were infused with &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-leucine to measure amyloid-β kinetics. We found that sleep deprivation increased overnight amyloid-β-38, amyloid-β-40, and amyloid-β-42 levels by 25-30% via increased overnight amyloid-β production relative to sleeping controls. These findings suggest that disrupted sleep increases Alzheimer's disease risk via increased amyloid-β production. This article is protected by copyright.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25101-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infantile-onset spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is the most common genetic cause of infant mortality, typically resulting in death preceding age 2. Clinical trials in this population require an understanding of disease progression and identification of meaningful biomarkers to hasten therapeutic development and predict outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25101-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A longitudinal, multicenter, prospective natural history study enrolled 26 SMA infants and 27 control infants aged &amp;lt;6 months. Recruitment occurred at 14 centers over 21 months within the NINDS-sponsored NeuroNEXT (National Network for Excellence in Neuroscience Clinical Trials) Network. Infant motor function scales (Test of Infant Motor Performance Screening Items [TIMPSI], The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test for Neuromuscular Disorders, and Alberta Infant Motor Score) and putative physiological and molecular biomarkers were assessed preceding age 6 months and at 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months with progression, correlations between motor function and biomarkers, and hazard ratios analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25101-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motor function scores (MFS) and compound muscle action potential (CMAP) decreased rapidly in SMA infants, whereas MFS in all healthy infants rapidly increased. Correlations were identified between TIMPSI and CMAP in SMA infants. TIMPSI at first study visit was associated with risk of combined endpoint of death or permanent invasive ventilation in SMA infants. Post-hoc analysis of survival to combined endpoint in SMA infants with 2 copies of &lt;em&gt;SMN2&lt;/em&gt; indicated a median age of 8 months at death (95% confidence interval, 6, 17).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25101-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;These data of SMA and control outcome measures delineates meaningful change in clinical trials in infantile-onset SMA. The power and utility of NeuroNEXT to provide “real-world,” prospective natural history data sets to accelerate public and private drug development programs for rare disease is demonstrated.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the first section, Introduction, we present our experimental design. In
the second section, we characterize the grand average occipital and temporal
electrical activity correlated with a contrast in access. In the third section,
we characterize the grand average occipital and temporal electrical activity
correlated with a contrast in phenomenology and conclude characterizing the
grand average occipital and temporal electrical activity co-occurring with
unconsciousness.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Quantifying how much sensory information in a neural code is relevant for behavior. (arXiv:1712.02449v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Determining how much of the sensory information carried by a neural code
contributes to behavioral performance is key to understand sensory function and
neural information flow. However, there are as yet no analytical tools to
compute this information that lies at the intersection between sensory coding
and behavioral readout. Here we develop a novel measure, termed the
information-theoretic intersection information $I_{II}(S;R;C)$, that quantifies
how much of the sensory information carried by a neural response R is used for
behavior during perceptual discrimination tasks. Building on the Partial
Information Decomposition framework, we define $I_{II}(S;R;C)$ as the part of
the mutual information between the stimulus S and the response R that also
informs the consequent behavioral choice C. We compute $I_{II}(S;R;C)$ in the
analysis of two experimental cortical datasets, to show how this measure can be
used to compare quantitatively the contributions of spike timing and spike
rates to task performance, and to identify brain areas or neural populations
that specifically transform sensory information into choice.

Computational biology is an interdisciplinary field, and many computational biology research projects involve distributed teams of scientists. To accomplish their work, these teams must overcome both disciplinary and geographic barriers. Introducing new training paradigms is one way to facilitate research progress in computational biology. Here, we describe a new undergraduate program in biomolecular structure prediction and design in which students conduct research at labs located at geographically-distributed institutions while remaining connected through an online community. This 10-week summer program begins with one week of training on computational biology methods development, transitions to eight weeks of research, and culminates in one week at the Rosetta annual conference. To date, two cohorts of students have participated, tackling research topics including vaccine design, enzyme design, protein-based materials, glycoprotein modeling, crowd-sourced science, RNA processing, hydrogen bond networks, and amyloid formation. Students in the program report outcomes comparable to students who participate in similar in-person programs. These outcomes include the development of a sense of community and increases in their scientific self-efficacy, scientific identity, and science values, all predictors of continuing in a science research career. Furthermore, the program attracted students from diverse backgrounds, which demonstrates the potential of this approach to broaden the participation of young scientists from backgrounds traditionally underrepresented in computational biology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tVxiwYI9Ryc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Automated classification of dolphin echolocation click types from the Gulf of Mexico</title>

Delphinids produce large numbers of short duration, broadband echolocation clicks which may be useful for species classification in passive acoustic monitoring efforts. A challenge in echolocation click classification is to overcome the many sources of variability to recognize underlying patterns across many detections. An automated unsupervised network-based classification method was developed to simulate the approach a human analyst uses when categorizing click types: Clusters of similar clicks were identified by incorporating multiple click characteristics (spectral shape and inter-click interval distributions) to distinguish within-type from between-type variation, and identify distinct, persistent click types. Once click types were established, an algorithm for classifying novel detections using existing clusters was tested. The automated classification method was applied to a dataset of 52 million clicks detected across five monitoring sites over two years in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). Seven distinct click types were identified, one of which is known to be associated with an acoustically identifiable delphinid (Risso’s dolphin) and six of which are not yet identified. All types occurred at multiple monitoring locations, but the relative occurrence of types varied, particularly between continental shelf and slope locations. Automatically-identified click types from autonomous seafloor recorders without verifiable species identification were compared with clicks detected on sea-surface towed hydrophone arrays in the presence of visually identified delphinid species. These comparisons suggest potential species identities for the animals producing some echolocation click types. The network-based classification method presented here is effective for rapid, unsupervised delphinid click classification across large datasets in which the click types may not be known &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/a_L8itdWy3E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The second aim was to determine whether these putative hypersensitive terminals could constitute a significant target for drugs effective in RLS, including dopamine agonists (pramipexole and ropinirole) and α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;δ ligands (gabapentin).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The method also allows analysis of the effect of local perfusion of compounds within the same area being sampled for glutamate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25104-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;BID rats showed hypersensitivity of corticostriatal glutamatergic terminals (lower frequency of optogenetic stimulation to induce glutamate release). Both hypersensitive and control glutamatergic terminals were significant targets for locally perfused pramipexole, ropinirole, and gabapentin, which significantly counteracted optogenetically induced glutamate release. The use of selective antagonists demonstrated the involvement of dopamine D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor subtypes in the effects of pramipexole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Selective D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; receptor agonists, by specifically targeting these terminals, should provide a new efficient treatment with fewer secondary effects.

We recently identified a defect in repetitive firing of lower motor neurons as a novel contributor to intensive care unit acquired weakness. To develop therapy for intensive care unit acquired weakness, it was necessary to determine the mechanism underlying the defect in repetitive firing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25105-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both computer simulation and in vivo dynamic voltage clamp of spinal motor neurons in septic rats were employed to explore potential mechanisms underlying defective repetitive firing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25105-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest alteration in subthreshold voltage-activated currents might be the mechanism underlying defective repetitive firing. It has been shown previously that pharmacologic activation of serotonin receptors on motor neurons increases motor neuron excitability, in part by enhancing subthreshold voltage-activated inward currents. Administration of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved serotonin agonist (lorcaserin) to septic rats greatly improved repetitive firing and motor unit force generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25102-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sensation is essential for recovery after peripheral nerve injury. However, the relationship between sensory modalities and function of regenerated fibers is uncertain. We have investigated the relationships between touch threshold, tactile gnosis, and mechanoreceptor and sensory fiber function after nerve regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25102-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-one median or ulnar nerve lesions were repaired by a collagen nerve conduit or direct suture. Quantitative sensory hand function and sensory conduction studies by near-nerve technique, including tactile stimulation of mechanoreceptors, were followed for 2 years, and results were compared to noninjured hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25102-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;At both repair methods, touch thresholds at the finger tips recovered to 81 ± 3% and tactile gnosis only to 20 ± 4% (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) of control. The sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) remained dispersed and areas recovered to 23 ± 2% and the amplitudes only to 7 ± 1% (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). The areas of SNAPs after tactile stimulation recovered to 61 ± 11% and remained slowed. Touch sensation correlated with SNAP areas (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.005) and was negatively related to the prolongation of tactile latencies (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01); tactile gnosis was not related to electrophysiological parameters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25102-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recovered function of regenerated peripheral nerve fibers and reinnervated mechanoreceptors may differentially influence recovery of sensory modalities. Touch was affected by the number and function of regenerated fibers and mechanoreceptors. In contrast, tactile gnosis depends on the input and plasticity of the central nervous system (CNS), which may explain the absence of a direct relation between electrophysiological parameters and poor recovery. Dispersed maturation of sensory nerve fibers with desynchronized inputs to the CNS also contributes to the poor recovery of tactile gnosis.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Maps of Visual Importance. (arXiv:1712.02142v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The importance of an element in a visual stimulus is commonly associated with
the fixations during a free-viewing task. We argue that fixations are not
always correlated with attention or awareness of visual objects. We suggest to
filter the fixations recorded during exploration of the image based on the
fixations recorded during recalling the image against a neutral background.
This idea exploits that eye movements are a spatial index into the memory of a
visual stimulus. We perform an experiment in which we record the eye movements
of 30 observers during the presentation and recollection of 100 images. The
locations of fixations during recall are only qualitatively related to the
fixations during exploration. We develop a deformation mapping technique to
align the fixations from recall with the fixation during exploration. This
allows filtering the fixations based on proximity and a threshold on proximity
provides a convenient slider to control the amount of filtering. Analyzing the
spatial histograms resulting from the filtering procedure as well as the set of
removed fixations shows that certain types of scene elements, which could be
considered irrelevant, are removed. In this sense, they provide a measure of
importance of visual elements for human observers.

	<description>Early brain activity is crucial for neurogenesis and the development of brain networks. However, it has been challenging to localize regions in the developing human brain that contribute to spontaneous waves of neuronal activity. Recently, Arichi and colleagues reported that the temporal and heteromodal insular cortices have a central role in propagating these neural instructional signals.</description>

	<description>Lei et al. have discovered NRAP-1, the first identified NMDAR auxiliary protein. NRAP-1, secreted from presynaptic neurons, modulates the properties of postsynaptic NMDARs. Trans-synaptic modulation of receptor function by NRAP-1 reveals a novel mechanism used to regulate synaptic strength.</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Autonomous development and learning in artificial intelligence and robotics: Scaling up deep learning to human--like learning. (arXiv:1712.01626v1 [cs.AI])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Autonomous lifelong development and learning is a fundamental capability of
humans, differentiating them from current deep learning systems. However, other
branches of artificial intelligence have designed crucial ingredients towards
autonomous learning: curiosity and intrinsic motivation, social learning and
natural interaction with peers, and embodiment. These mechanisms guide
exploration and autonomous choice of goals, and integrating them with deep
learning opens stimulating perspectives. Deep learning (DL) approaches made
great advances in artificial intelligence, but are still far away from human
learning. As argued convincingly by Lake et al., differences include human
capabilities to learn causal models of the world from very little data,
leveraging compositional representations and priors like intuitive physics and
psychology. However, there are other fundamental differences between current DL
systems and human learning, as well as technical ingredients to fill this gap,
that are either superficially, or not adequately, discussed by Lake et al.
These fundamental mechanisms relate to autonomous development and learning.
They are bound to play a central role in artificial intelligence in the future.
Current DL systems require engineers to manually specify a task-specific
objective function for every new task, and learn through off-line processing of
large training databases. On the contrary, humans learn autonomously open-ended
repertoires of skills, deciding for themselves which goals to pursue or value,
and which skills to explore, driven by intrinsic motivation/curiosity and
social learning through natural interaction with peers. Such learning processes
are incremental, online, and progressive. Human child development involves a
progressive increase of complexity in a curriculum of learning where skills are
explored, acquired, and built on each other, through particular ordering and
timing. Finally, human learning happens in the physical world, and through
bodily and physical experimentation, under severe constraints on energy, time,
and computational resources. In the two last decades, the field of
Developmental and Cognitive Robotics (Cangelosi and Schlesinger, 2015, Asada et
al., 2009), in strong interaction with developmental psychology and
neuroscience, has achieved significant advances in computational

	<description>Bioprinting is a method by which a cell-encapsulating bioink is patterned to create complex tissue architectures. Given the potential impact of this technology on neural research, we review the current state-of-the-art approaches for bioprinting neural tissues. While 2D neural cultures are ubiquitous for studying neural cells, 3D cultures can more accurately replicate the microenvironment of neural tissues. By bioprinting neuronal constructs, one can precisely control the microenvironment by specifically formulating the bioink for neural tissues, and by spatially patterning cell types and scaffold properties in three dimensions.</description>

	<description>On October 20, 2017, John Lisman sadly passed. Being very ill did not hinder his determination, as he was continuing full speed in his research, keeping several collaborations in parallel, writing papers, and giving talks until the very last moment. Impressively, John gave an excellent talk on his work on synaptic plasticity at Brandeis University from his hospital bed in the ICU. In his long scientific career, John made numerous scientific contributions that have shaped the field of neuroscience, spanning from novel insights on second-messenger cascades to human memory.</description>

	<description>Apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4) is the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. Despite nearly 25 years of research, the mechanism by which apoE4 confers increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease remains enigmatic. In this issue of Neuron, Liu et al. (2017) and Huynh et al. (2017) shed new light on this important question.</description>

	<description>Re-myelination of CNS nerves after injury is ineffective. Here, Petersen et al. (2017) show that the blood clotting protein fibrinogen inhibits nerve repair by preventing oligodendrocyte progenitor cells from differentiating into myelinating oligodendrocytes. Targeting fibrinogen or its downstream BMP signaling pathway may help with CNS repair.</description>

	<description>Liu et al. have developed cell-type-specific and inducible apoE mouse models and demonstrate that astrocytic apoE4 is a potent factor in promoting amyloidosis during the seeding stage, but not the rapid growth period, of amyloid development. ApoE4 impairs Aβ clearance and accelerates Aβ aggregation, leading to enhanced amyloid pathology and neuritic dystrophy.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Single-unit activities during the transition to seizures in deep mesial structures</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focal seizures are assumed to arise from a hypersynchronous activity affecting a circumscribed brain region. Using microelectrodes in seizure-generating deep mesial regions of 9 patients, we investigated the firing of hundreds of single-neurons before, during and after ictal EEG discharges. Neuronal spiking activity at seizure initiation was highly heterogeneous and not hypersynchronous. Furthermore, groups of neurons showed significant changes in activity minutes before the seizure with no concomitant changes in the corresponding macroscopic EEG recordings. Altogether, our findings suggest that only limitedsubsets of neurons in epileptic depth regions initiate the seizure-onset and that ictogenic mechanisms operate in sub-millimeter-scale microdomains.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A meta-analysis of 142 positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography studies that have investigated striatal presynaptic dopamine function in Parkinson disease (PD) was performed. Subregional estimates of striatal dopamine metabolism are presented. The aromatic L-amino-acid decarboxylase (AADC) defect appears to be consistently smaller than the dopamine transporter and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 defects, suggesting upregulation of AADC function in PD. The correlation between disease severity and dopamine loss appears linear, but the majority of longitudinal studies point to a negative exponential progression pattern of dopamine loss in PD.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A localized pallidal physiomarker in cervical dystonia</title>

In Parkinson's disease, a disease-specific physiomarker was identified that is now used to investigate adaptive closed-loop stimulation in first studies. In dystonia, such a physiomarker is missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25095-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pallidal oscillations were recorded from 153 contact pairs in 27 patients. We investigated whether power amplitudes in theta and beta bands correlate with dystonic symptom severity across patients. We then projected theta power from each contact pair onto standard subcortical anatomy. In this way, we defined a theta hot spot on a group level and investigated whether proximity of the active DBS contacts to it correlated with clinical improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25095-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dystonic symptom severity significantly correlated with theta but not beta oscillatory amplitudes (ρ = 0.4, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.009) and interhemispheric coherence (ρ = 0.5, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.002). The sweet spot of theta activity localized to the posterior third of the internal pallidum and theta power correlated with proximity to this location (ρ = 0.23, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.002), which coincided with 3 previously published coordinates describing optimal stimulation targets. Finally, motor improvement through pallidal long-term DBS correlated with theta peak amplitude (ρ = 0.38, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.018).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25095-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that theta oscillations in the internal pallidum are robustly associated with dystonic symptoms in cervical dystonia and may be a useful biomarker for adaptive closed-loop stimulation. Furthermore, theta oscillatory activity may have a predictive value for the clinical benefit after chronic DBS that could be used to improve intraoperative neurophysiological target mapping during electrode implantation.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Coupled Molecular Feedback Loops Maintain Synaptic Long-Term Potentiation: A Computational Model. (arXiv:1712.00683v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00683</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00683</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The brain stores memories by adjusting the strengths of connections between
neurons. Such synaptic plasticity comes in different forms that strengthen or
weaken synapses and range from very short-lived to long-lasting. One of the
most well-studied forms of plasticity is long-term potentiation, LTP, a
phenomenon whereby synaptic strength is persistently increased in response to
stimulation. Different forms of LTP are known to play important roles in both
short-term and long-term memory.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many different proteins have been identified in the sub-cellular molecular
processes that are involved in LTP. An important question is how these
proteins, with lifetimes measured in hours or days, can maintain memories for
months or years. We present a computational model that shows how this problem
can be solved by two interconnected feedback loops of molecular reactions, one
involving the atypical protein kinase PKM{\zeta} and its messenger RNA, the
other involving PKM{\zeta} and GluR2-containing AMPA receptors. The model
demonstrates that robust bistability - stable equilibria in the synapse's
potentiated and unpotentiated states - can arise from simple molecular
reactions. Our simulations are able to account for a wide range of empirical
results, including induction and maintenance of late-phase LTP, cellular memory
reconsolidation and the effect of different pharmaceutical interventions.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Functional brain networks reveal the existence of cognitive reserve and the interplay between network topology and dynamics. (arXiv:1712.00462v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00462</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00462</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We investigated how the organization of functional brain networks was related
to cognitive reserve (CR) during a memory task in healthy aging. We obtained
the magnetoencephalographic functional networks of 20 elders with a high or low
CR level to analyse the differences at network features. We reported a negative
correlation between synchronization of the whole network and CR, and observed
differences both at the node and at the network level in: the average shortest
path and the network outreach. Individuals with high CR required functional
networks with lower links to successfully carry out the memory task. These
results may indicate that those individuals with low CR level exhibited a dual
pattern of compensation and network impairment, since their functioning was
more energetically costly to perform the task as the high CR group.
Additionally, we evaluated how the dynamical properties of the different brain
regions were correlated to the network parameters obtaining that entropy was
positively correlated with the strength and clustering coefficient, while
complexity behaved conversely. Consequently, highly connected nodes of the
functional networks showed a more stochastic and less complex signal. We
consider that network approach may be a relevant tool to better understand
brain functioning in aging.

Chemical reaction networks are ubiquitous in biology, and their dynamics is fundamentally stochastic. Here, we present the software library pSSAlib, which provides a complete and concise implementation of the most efficient partial-propensity methods for simulating exact stochastic chemical kinetics. pSSAlib can import models encoded in Systems Biology Markup Language, supports time delays in chemical reactions, and stochastic spatiotemporal reaction-diffusion systems. It also provides tools for statistical analysis of simulation results and supports multiple output formats. It has previously been used for studies of biochemical reaction pathways and to benchmark other stochastic simulation methods. Here, we describe pSSAlib in detail and apply it to a new model of the endocytic pathway in eukaryotic cells, leading to the discovery of a stochastic counterpart of the cut-out switch motif underlying early-to-late endosome conversion. pSSAlib is provided as a stand-alone command-line tool and as a developer API. We also provide a plug-in for the SBMLToolbox. The open-source code and pre-packaged installers are freely available from http://mosaic.mpi-cbg.de.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mOauxiRU7Zc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Efficient encoding of motion is mediated by gap junctions in the fly visual system</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005846</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Siwei Wang, Alexander Borst, Noga Zaslavsky, Naftali Tishby, Idan Segev&lt;/p&gt;

Understanding the computational implications of specific synaptic connectivity patterns is a fundamental goal in neuroscience. In particular, the computational role of ubiquitous electrical synapses operating via gap junctions remains elusive. In the fly visual system, the cells in the vertical-system network, which play a key role in visual processing, primarily connect to each other via axonal gap junctions. This network therefore provides a unique opportunity to explore the functional role of gap junctions in sensory information processing. Our information theoretical analysis of a realistic VS network model shows that within 10 ms following the onset of the visual input, the presence of axonal gap junctions enables the VS system to efficiently encode the axis of rotation, θ, of the fly’s ego motion. This encoding efficiency, measured in bits, is near-optimal with respect to the physical limits of performance determined by the statistical structure of the visual input itself. The VS network is known to be connected to downstream pathways via a subset of triplets of the vertical system cells; we found that because of the axonal gap junctions, the efficiency of this subpopulation in encoding θ is superior to that of the whole vertical system network and is robust to a wide range of signal to noise ratios. We further demonstrate that this efficient encoding of motion by this subpopulation is necessary for the fly's visually guided behavior, such as banked turns in evasive maneuvers. Because gap junctions are formed among the axons of the vertical system cells, they only impact the system’s readout, while maintaining the dendritic input intact, suggesting that the computational principles implemented by neural circuitries may be much richer than previously appreciated based on point neuron models. Our study provides new insights as to how specific network connectivity leads to efficient encoding of sensory stimuli.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gB67vf_2z4E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A model of the onset of the senescence associated secretory phenotype after DNA damage induced senescence</title>

Cells and tissues are exposed to stress from numerous sources. Senescence is a protective mechanism that prevents malignant tissue changes and constitutes a fundamental mechanism of aging. It can be accompanied by a senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that causes chronic inflammation. We present a Boolean network model-based gene regulatory network of the SASP, incorporating published gene interaction data. The simulation results describe current biological knowledge. The model predicts different &lt;i&gt;in-silico&lt;/i&gt; knockouts that prevent key SASP-mediators, IL-6 and IL-8, from getting activated upon DNA damage. The NF-κB Essential Modulator (NEMO) was the most promising &lt;i&gt;in-silico&lt;/i&gt; knockout candidate and we were able to show its importance in the inhibition of IL-6 and IL-8 following DNA-damage in murine dermal fibroblasts &lt;i&gt;in-vitro&lt;/i&gt;. We strengthen the speculated regulator function of the NF-κB signaling pathway in the onset and maintenance of the SASP using &lt;i&gt;in-silico&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in-vitro&lt;/i&gt; approaches. We were able to mechanistically show, that DNA damage mediated SASP triggering of IL-6 and IL-8 is mainly relayed through NF-κB, giving access to possible therapy targets for SASP-accompanied diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zqDR2IVRyVA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Ischemic core thresholds change with time to reperfusion: A case control study</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Introduction&lt;/b&gt;: We aimed to identify if acute ischemic stroke patients with known complete reperfusion after thrombectomy had the same baseline CTP ischemic core threshold to predict infarction as thrombolysis patients with complete reperfusion. &lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Patients who underwent thrombectomy were matched by age, clinical severity, occlusion location, and baseline perfusion lesion volume to patients who were treated with intravenous alteplase alone from the International Stroke Perfusion Imaging Registry. A pixel-based analysis of co-registered pre-treatment CT perfusion (CTP) and 24 hour diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was then undertaken to define the optimum CTP thresholds for the ischemic core. &lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: There were 132 eligible thrombectomy patients and 132 matched controls treated with alteplase alone. Baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Score (median 15, IQR 11-19), age (median 65, IQR 59 - 80) and time to IV treatment (median 153min, IQR 82- 315min) were well-matched (all p&amp;gt;0.05). Despite similar baseline CTP ischemic core volumes using the previously validated measure (rCBF &amp;lt;30%), thrombectomy patients had a smaller median 24 hour infarct core of 17.3mL (IQR 11.3-32.8mL) versus 24.3 mL (IQR 16.7-42.2mL, p=0.011) in alteplase-treated controls. As a result, the optimal threshold to define the ischemic core in thrombectomy patients was rCBF &amp;lt;20% (AUC 0.89, 95% CI: 0.84, 0.94), while in alteplase controls the optimal ischemic core threshold remained rCBF &amp;lt;30% (AUC 0.83, 95% CI: 0.77, 0.85). &lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Thrombectomy salvaged tissue with lower CBF, likely due to earlier reperfusion. For patients who achieve rapid reperfusion, a stricter rCBF threshold to estimate the ischemic core should be considered. This article is protected by copyright.

Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is likely the underlying phenomenon of aura. The possible correlation between the multifaceted phenomenology of aura symptoms and the effects of CSD on the brain has not been ascertained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25096-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five migraine patients were studied during various forms of aura symptoms induced by hypoxia, sham hypoxia, or physical exercise with concurrent photostimulation. The blood oxygenation level–dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal response to visual stimulation was measured in retinotopic mapping–defined visual cortex areas V1 to V4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25096-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found reduced BOLD response in patients reporting scotoma and increased response in patients who only experienced positive symptoms. Furthermore, patients with bilateral visual symptoms had corresponding bihemispherical changes in BOLD response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25096-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that different aura symptoms reflect different types of cerebral dysfunction, which correspond to specific changes in BOLD signal reactivity. Furthermore, we provide evidence of bilateral CSD recorded by fMRI during bilateral aura symptoms. Ann Neurol 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Parkinson disease (PD), mitochondrial dysfunction associates with nigral dopaminergic neuronal loss. Cholinergic neuronal loss co-occurs, particularly within a brainstem structure, the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN). We isolated single cholinergic neurons from postmortem PPNs of aged controls and PD patients. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and mtDNA deletions were increased significantly in PD patients compared to controls. Furthermore, compared to controls the PD patients had significantly more PPN cholinergic neurons containing mtDNA deletion levels exceeding 60%, a level associated with deleterious effects on oxidative phosphorylation. The current results differ from studies reporting mtDNA depletion in nigral dopaminergic neurons of PD patients. Ann Neurol 2017;00:000–000&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

We then performed follow-up analyses to assess the impact of significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on disease risk and longitudinal cognitive performance in a large independent data set (n = 870).

Furthermore, this variant is associated with altered gene expression in peripheral blood and altered &lt;em&gt;PPPP4R3A&lt;/em&gt; transcript expression in temporal cortex, suggesting a role at the molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article examines the serious shortcomings that characterize the current taxonomy of postcomatose disorders of consciousness (DoC), and it provides guidelines for how an improved DoC taxonomy might be developed. In particular, it is argued that behavioral criteria for the application of DoC categories should be supplemented with brain-based criteria (eg, information derived from electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging), and that the categorical framework that currently characterizes DoC should be replaced by a multidimensional framework that better captures the performance of patients across a range of cognitive and behavioural tasks.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Relation between firing statistics of spiking neuron with delayed fast inhibitory feedback and without feedback. (arXiv:1712.00359v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00359</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00359</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We consider a class of spiking neuronal models, defined by a set of
conditions typical for basic threshold-type models, such as the leaky
integrate-and-fire or the binding neuron model and also for some artificial
neurons. A neuron is fed with a renewal process. Each output impulse is applied
to the neuron itself after a finite delay $\Delta$. This impulse acts as being
delivered through a fast Cl-type inhibitory synapse. We derive a general
relation which allows calculating exactly the probability density function
(pdf) $p(t)$ of output interspike intervals of a neuron with feedback based on
known pdf $p^0(t)$ for the same neuron without feedback and on the properties
of the feedback line (the $\Delta$ value). Similar relations between
corresponding moments are derived. Furthermore, we prove that initial segment
of pdf $p^0(t)$ for a neuron with a fixed threshold level is the same for any
neuron satisfying the imposed conditions and is completely determined by the
input stream. For the Poisson input stream, we calculate that initial segment
exactly and, based on it, obtain exactly the initial segment of pdf $p(t)$ for
a neuron with feedback. That is the initial segment of $p(t)$ is
model-independent as well. The obtained expressions are checked by means of
Monte Carlo simulation. The course of $p(t)$ has a pronounced peculiarity,
which makes it impossible to approximate $p(t)$ by Poisson or another simple
stochastic process.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Interplay of activation kinetics and the derivative conductance determines the resonance properties of neurons. (arXiv:1712.00306v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00306</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00306</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In a neuron with hyperpolarization activated current ($I_h$), the correct
input frequency leads to an enhancement of the output response. This behavior
is known as resonance and is well described by the neuronal impedance. In a
simple neuron model we derive equations for the neuron's resonance and we link
its frequency and existence with the biophysical properties of $I_h$. For a
small voltage change, the component of the ratio of current change to voltage
change ($dI/dV$) due to the voltage-dependent conductance change ($dg/dV$) is
known as derivative conductance ($G_h^{Der}$). We show that both $G_h^{Der}$
and the current activation kinetics (characterized by the activation time
constant $\tau_h$) are mainly responsible for controlling the frequency and
existence of resonance. The increment of both factors ($G_h^{Der}$ and
$\tau_h$) greatly contributes to the appearance of resonance. We also
demonstrate that resonance is voltage dependent due to the voltage dependence
of $G_h^{Der}$. Our results have important implications and can be used to
predict and explain resonance properties of neurons with the $I_h$ current.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The human brain is one of the most complex living structures in the known
Universe. It consists of billions of neurons and synapses. Due to its intrinsic
complexity, it can be a formidable task to accurately depict brain's structure
and functionality. In the past, numerous studies have been conducted on
modeling brain disease, structure, and functionality. Some of these studies
have employed Agent-based approaches including multiagent-based simulation
models as well as brain complex networks. While these models have all been
developed using agent-based computing, however, to our best knowledge, none of
them have employed the use of Agent-Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE)
methodologies in developing the brain or disease model. This is a problem
because without due process, developed models can miss out on important
requirements. AOSE has the unique capability of merging concepts from
multiagent systems, agent-based modeling, artificial intelligence, besides
concepts from distributed systems. AOSE involves the various tested software
engineering principles in various phases of the model development ranging from
analysis, design, implementation, and testing phases. In this paper, we employ
the use of three different AOSE methodologies for modeling the Multiple
Sclerosis brain disease namely GAIA, TROPOS, and MASE. After developing the
models, we further employ the use of Exploratory Agent-based Modeling (EABM) to
develop an actual model replicating previous results as a proof of concept. The
key objective of this study is to demonstrate and explore the viability and
effectiveness of AOSE methodologies in the development of complex brain
structure and cognitive process models. Our key finding include demonstration
that AOSE methodologies can be considerably helpful in modeling various living
complex systems, in general, and the human brain, in particular.

While nucleosome positioning on eukaryotic genome play important roles for genetic regulation, molecular mechanisms of nucleosome positioning and sliding along DNA are not well understood. Here we investigated thermally-activated spontaneous nucleosome sliding mechanisms developing and applying a coarse-grained molecular simulation method that incorporates both long-range electrostatic and short-range hydrogen-bond interactions between histone octamer and DNA. The simulations revealed two distinct sliding modes depending on the nucleosomal DNA sequence. A uniform DNA sequence showed frequent sliding with one base pair step in a rotation-coupled manner, akin to screw-like motions. On the contrary, a strong positioning sequence, the so-called 601 sequence, exhibits rare, abrupt transitions of five and ten base pair steps without rotation. Moreover, we evaluated the importance of hydrogen bond interactions on the sliding mode, finding that strong and weak bonds favor respectively the rotation-coupled and -uncoupled sliding movements.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/a3QV103gjno&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Long-distance olfactory search behaviors depend on odor detection dynamics. Due to turbulence, olfactory signals travel as bursts of variable concentration and spacing and are characterized by long-tail distributions of odor/no-odor events, challenging the computing capacities of olfactory systems. How animals encode complex olfactory scenes to track the plume far from the source remains unclear. Here we focus on the coding of the plume temporal dynamics in moths. We compare responses of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and antennal lobe projection neurons (PNs) to sequences of pheromone stimuli either with white-noise patterns or with realistic turbulent temporal structures simulating a large range of distances (8 to 64 m) from the odor source. For the first time, we analyze what information is extracted by the olfactory system at large distances from the source. Neuronal responses are analyzed using linear–nonlinear models fitted with white-noise stimuli and used for predicting responses to turbulent stimuli. We found that neuronal firing rate is less correlated with the dynamic odor time course when distance to the source increases because of improper coding during long odor and no-odor events that characterize large distances. Rapid adaptation during long puffs does not preclude however the detection of puff transitions in PNs. Individual PNs but not individual ORNs encode the onset and offset of odor puffs for any temporal structure of stimuli. A higher spontaneous firing rate coupled to an inhibition phase at the end of PN responses contributes to this coding property. This allows PNs to decode the temporal structure of the odor plume at any distance to the source, an essential piece of information moths can use in their tracking behavior.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9shIb_kQ8HI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

We experimentally and numerically investigate the evolutionary dynamics of four competing strains of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; with differing expansion velocities in radially expanding colonies. We compare experimental measurements of the average fraction, correlation functions between strains, and the relative rates of genetic domain wall annihilations and coalescences to simulations modeling the population as a one-dimensional ring of annihilating and coalescing random walkers with deterministic biases due to selection. The simulations reveal that the evolutionary dynamics can be collapsed onto master curves governed by three essential parameters: (1) an expansion length beyond which selection dominates over genetic drift; (2) a characteristic angular correlation describing the size of genetic domains; and (3) a dimensionless constant quantifying the interplay between a colony’s curvature at the frontier and its selection length scale. We measure these parameters with a new technique that precisely measures small selective differences between spatially competing strains and show that our simulations accurately predict the dynamics without additional fitting.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Metabomatching: Using genetic association to identify metabolites in proton NMR spectroscopy</title>

A metabolome-wide genome-wide association study (mGWAS) aims to discover the effects of genetic variants on metabolome phenotypes. Most mGWASes use as phenotypes concentrations of limited sets of metabolites that can be identified and quantified from spectral information. In contrast, in an &lt;i&gt;untargeted&lt;/i&gt; mGWAS both identification and quantification are forgone and, instead, all measured metabolome features are tested for association with genetic variants. While the untargeted approach does not discard data that may have eluded identification, the interpretation of associated features remains a challenge. To address this issue, we developed &lt;i&gt;metabomatching&lt;/i&gt; to identify the metabolites underlying significant associations observed in untargeted mGWASes on proton NMR metabolome data. Metabomatching capitalizes on &lt;i&gt;genetic spiking&lt;/i&gt;, the concept that because metabolome features associated with a genetic variant tend to correspond to the peaks of the NMR spectrum of the underlying metabolite, genetic association can allow for identification. Applied to the untargeted mGWASes in the SHIP and CoLaus cohorts and using 180 reference NMR spectra of the urine metabolome database, metabomatching successfully identified the underlying metabolite in 14 of 19, and 8 of 9 associations, respectively. The accuracy and efficiency of our method make it a strong contender for facilitating or complementing metabolomics analyses in large cohorts, where the availability of genetic, or other data, enables our approach, but targeted quantification is limited.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Yt1iJ6VP9SY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The identity of information: how deterministic dependencies constrain information synergy and redundancy. (arXiv:1711.11408v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11408</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding how different information sources together transmit information
is crucial in many domains. For example, understanding the neural code requires
characterizing how different neurons contribute unique, redundant, or
synergistic pieces of information about sensory or behavioral variables.
Williams and Beer (2010) proposed a partial information decomposition (PID)
which separates the mutual information that a set of sources contains about a
set of targets into nonnegative terms interpretable as these pieces.
Quantifying redundancy requires assigning an identity to different information
pieces, to assess when information is common across sources. Harder et al.
(2013) proposed an identity axiom stating that there cannot be redundancy
between two independent sources about a copy of themselves. However,
Bertschinger et al. (2012) showed that with a deterministically related
sources-target copy this axiom is incompatible with ensuring PID nonnegativity.
Here we study systematically the effect of deterministic target-sources
dependencies. We introduce two synergy stochasticity axioms that generalize the
identity axiom, and we derive general expressions separating stochastic and
deterministic PID components. Our analysis identifies how negative terms can
originate from deterministic dependencies and shows how different assumptions
on information identity, implicit in the stochasticity and identity axioms,
determine the PID structure. The implications for studying neural coding are
discussed.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The Frequent Subgraphs of the Connectome of the Human Brain. (arXiv:1711.11314v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11314</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11314</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In mapping the human structural connectome, we are in a very fortunate
situation: one can compute and compare graphs, describing the cerebral
connections between the very same, anatomically identified small regions of the
gray matter among hundreds of human subjects. The comparison of these graphs
has led to numerous recent results, as the (i) discovery that women's
connectomes have deeper and richer connectivity-related graph parameters like
those of men, or (ii) the description of more and less conservatively connected
lobes and cerebral regions, and (iii) the discovery of the phenomenon of the
Consensus Connectome Dynamics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today one of the greatest challenges of brain science is the description and
modeling of the circuitry of the human brain. For this goal, we need to
identify sub-circuits that are present in almost all human subjects and those,
which are much less frequent: the former sub-circuits most probably have
functions with general importance, the latter sub-circuits are probably related
to the individual variability of the brain structure and functions. The present
contribution describes the frequent connected subgraphs (instead of
sub-circuits) of at most 6 edges in the human brain. We analyze these frequent
graphs and also examine sex differences in these graphs: we demonstrate
numerous connected sub-graphs that are more frequent in female or the male
connectome. While our results describe subgraphs, instead of sub-circuits, we
need to note that all macroscopic sub-circuits correspond to an underlying
connected subgraph.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data source is the public release of the Human Connectome Project, and we
are applying the data of 426 human subjects in this study.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A network diffusion approach to inferring sample-specific function reveals functional changes associated with breast cancer</title>

&lt;i&gt;Guilt-by-association&lt;/i&gt; codifies the empirical observation that a gene’s function is informed by its neighborhood in a biological network. This would imply that when a gene’s network context is altered, for instance in disease condition, so could be the gene’s function. Although context-specific changes in biological networks have been explored, the potential changes they may induce on the functional roles of genes are yet to be characterized. Here we analyze, for the first time, the network-induced potential functional changes in breast cancer. Using transcriptomic samples for 1047 breast tumors and 110 healthy breast tissues from TCGA, we derive sample-specific protein interaction networks and assign sample-specific functions to genes via a diffusion strategy. Testing for significant changes in the inferred functions between normal and cancer samples, we find several functions to have significantly gained or lost genes in cancer, not due to differential expression of genes known to perform the function, but rather due to changes in the network topology. Our predicted functional changes are supported by mutational and copy number profiles in breast cancers. Our diffusion-based functional assignment provides a novel characterization of a tumor that is complementary to the standard approach based on functional annotation alone. Importantly, this characterization is effective in predicting patient survival, as well as in predicting several known histopathological subtypes of breast cancer.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/S_U61W1bmfg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Early processing of consonance and dissonance in human auditory cortex. (arXiv:1711.10991v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10991</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10991</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Pitch is the perceptual correlate of sound's periodicity and a fundamental
property of the auditory sensation. The interaction of two or more pitches
gives rise to a sensation that can be characterized by its degree of consonance
or dissonance. In the current study, we investigated the neuromagnetic
representations of consonant and dissonant musical dyads using a new model of
cortical activity, in an effort to assess the possible involvement of
pitch-specific neural mechanisms in consonance processing at early cortical
stages.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first step of the study, we developed a novel model of cortical pitch
processing designed to explain the morphology of the pitch onset response
(POR), a pitch-specific subcomponent of the auditory evoked N100 component in
the human auditory cortex. The model explains the neural mechanisms underlying
the generation of the POR and quantitatively accounts for the relation between
its peak latency and the perceived pitch.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we applied magnetoencephalography (MEG) to record the POR as elicited
by six consonant and dissonant dyads. The peak latency of the POR was strongly
modulated by the degree of consonance within the stimuli; specifically, the
most dissonant dyad exhibited a POR with a latency that was about 30ms longer
than that of the most consonant dyad, an effect that greatly exceeds the
expected latency difference induced by a single pitch sound.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our model was able to predict the POR latency pattern observed in the
neuromagnetic data, and to generalize this prediction to additional dyads.
These results indicate that the neural mechanisms responsible for pitch
processing exhibit an intrinsic differential response to concurrent consonant
and dissonant pitch combinations, suggesting that the perception of consonance
and dissonance might be an emergent property of the pitch processing system in
human auditory cortex.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural networks with tightly balanced excitatory and inhibitory coupling show
high computational performance. They operate close to a critical point
characterized by the joint activation of large populations of neurons. Yet,
macaque motor cortex shows very different dynamics with weak fluctuations on
macroscopic scales. In this light motor cortex seems to operate in a
sub-optimal regime. Here we show the opposite: The large dispersion of
correlations across neurons is a signature of a rich dynamical repertoire,
hidden from macroscopic brain signals, but essential for high performance in
such concepts as reservoir computing. Our findings suggest a refinement of the
view on criticality in neural systems: network topology and heterogeneity endow
the brain with two complementary substrates for critical dynamics of largely
different complexity.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A new fMRI data analysis method using cross validation: Negative BOLD responses may be the deactivations of interneurons. (arXiv:1711.10814v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10814</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10814</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is widely used for the
study of brain functions, the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) effect
is incompletely understood. Particularly, negative BOLD responses(NBRs) is
controversial. This paper presents a new fMRI data analysis method, which is
more accurate than the typical conventional method. The authors conducted the
experiments of simple repetition, and analyzed the data by the new method. The
results strongly suggest that the deactivations(NBRs) detected by the new
method are the deactivations of interneurons, because the deactivation ratios
obtained by the new method approximately equals the deactivation ratios of
interneurons obtained by the study of interneurons. The (de)activations
detected by the new method are largely different from those detected by the
conventional method. The new method is more accurate than the conventional
method, and therefore the (de)activations detected by the new method may be
correct and the (de)activations detected by the conventional method may be
incorrect. A large portion of the deactivations of inhibitory interneurons is
also considered to be activations. Therefore, the right-tailed t-test, which is
usually performed in the conventional method, does not detect the whole
activation, because the right-tailed t-test only detects the activations of
excitatory neurons, and neglect the deactivations of inhibitory interneurons. A
lot of fMRI studies so far by the conventional method should be re-examined by
the new method, and many results obtained so far will be modified.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Effect of fixation target on the contrast sensitivity in the foveal and parafoveal area. (arXiv:1711.10586v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10586</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10586</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Purpose
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the influence on the contrast sensitivity when the stimulus
contains a fixation target in two retinal locations, foveal and parafoveal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four young adults with 0.0 logMar acuity participated in this study. The
stimulus was based on vertical sinusoidal gratings masked by a circular (for
foveal area) or a ring (for parafoveal area). To increase the luminance
resolution of the display a bit-stealing technique was used. Four different
sets of stimuli were generated, two for exploring the foveal sensitivity and
two for the parafoveal area. The difference between the sets designed for the
same area was the presence, or absence, of a fixation target (a white cross) in
the centre of the stimulus. A modified staircase method was implemented.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results show a drop in the contrast sensitivity when the fixation target
was present on the stimulus for frequencies smaller than 4 cycles per degree.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusions
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of fixation targets diminishes the contrast sensitivity for low
to mid frequencies over different concentric areas of the retina. This could be
due to the fixational eye movements, different patterns of eye movements were
found using an eye tracker. The relationship between the sensitivity in the
foveal area and the parafoveal agrees with those reported by other authors
using different designs confirming that the new stimulus design is suitable to
measure the contrast sensitivity outside the foveal area.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging meta-analysis is an area of growing interest in statistics. The
special characteristics of neuroimaging data render classical meta-analysis
methods inapplicable and therefore new methods have been developed. We review
existing methodologies, explaining the benefits and drawbacks of each. A
demonstration on a real dataset of emotion studies is included. We discuss some
still-open problems in the field to highlight the need for future research.

	<description>A longstanding question in cellular neuroscience is how microtubules in the axon become organized with their plus ends out, a pattern starkly different from the mixed orientation of microtubules in vertebrate dendrites. Recent attention has focused on a mechanism called polarity sorting, in which microtubules of opposite orientation are spatially separated by molecular motor proteins. Here we discuss this mechanism, and conclude that microtubules are polarity sorted in the axon by cytoplasmic dynein but that additional factors are also needed.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Alejandro F. Villaverde, Julio R. Banga&lt;/p&gt;

The concept of dynamical compensation has been recently introduced to describe the ability of a biological system to keep its output dynamics unchanged in the face of varying parameters. However, the original definition of dynamical compensation amounts to lack of structural identifiability. This is relevant if model parameters need to be estimated, as is often the case in biological modelling. Care should we taken when using an unidentifiable model to extract biological insight: the estimated values of structurally unidentifiable parameters are meaningless, and model predictions about unmeasured state variables can be wrong. Taking this into account, we explore alternative definitions of dynamical compensation that do not necessarily imply structural unidentifiability. Accordingly, we show different ways in which a model can be made identifiable while exhibiting dynamical compensation. Our analyses enable the use of the new concept of dynamical compensation in the context of parameter identification, and reconcile it with the desirable property of structural identifiability.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/s5puXhenAZ8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Complex network analysis of brain functional connectivity under a multi-step cognitive task. (arXiv:1711.10376v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10376</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Functional brain network has been widely studied to understand the
relationship between brain organization and behavior. In this paper, we aim to
explore the functional connectivity of brain network under a \emph{multi-step}
cognitive task involving with consecutive behaviors, and further understand the
effect of behaviors on the brain organization. The functional brain networks
are constructed base on a high spatial and temporal resolution fMRI dataset and
analyzed via complex network based approach. We find that at voxel level the
functional brain network shows robust small-worldness and scale-free
characteristics, while its assortativity and rich-club organization are
slightly restricted to order of behaviors performed. More interestingly, the
functional connectivity of brain network in activated ROIs strongly correlates
with behaviors and behaves obvious differences restricted to order of behaviors
performed. These empirical results suggest that the brain organization has the
generic properties of small-worldness and scale-free characteristics, and its
diverse function connectivity emerging from activated ROIs is strongly driven
by these behavioral activities via the plasticity of brain.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whole genome sequencing in psychiatric disorders: the WGSPD consortium&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole genome sequencing in psychiatric disorders: the WGSPD consortium, Published online: 28 November 2017; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-017-0017-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-017-0017-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;As technology advances, whole genome sequencing (WGS) is likely to supersede other genotyping technologies. The rate of this change depends on its relative cost and utility. Variants identified uniquely through WGS may reveal novel biological pathways underlying complex disorders and provide high-resolution insight into when, where, and in which cell type these pathways are affected. Alternatively, cheaper and less computationally intensive approaches may yield equivalent insights. Understanding the role of rare variants in the noncoding gene-regulating genome through pilot WGS projects will be critical to determining which of these two extremes best represents reality. With large cohorts, well-defined risk loci, and a compelling need to understand the underlying biology, psychiatric disorders have a role to play in this preliminary WGS assessment. The Whole Genome Sequencing for Psychiatric Disorders Consortium will integrate data for 18,000 individuals with psychiatric disorders, beginning with autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder, along with over 150,000 controls.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/lduqf_2TMTE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Chronic stress is shown to alter blood–brain barrier permeability, allowing an inflammatory response to penetrate the brain. The deficit is mostly around the nucleus accumbens, an area central to motivation.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The effect of spatial randomness on the average fixation time of mutants</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005864</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Suzan Farhang-Sardroodi, Amir H. Darooneh, Moladad Nikbakht, Natalia L. Komarova, Mohammad Kohandel&lt;/p&gt;

The mean conditional fixation time of a mutant is an important measure of stochastic population dynamics, widely studied in ecology and evolution. Here, we investigate the effect of spatial randomness on the mean conditional fixation time of mutants in a constant population of cells, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. Specifically, we assume that fitness values of wild type cells and mutants at different locations come from given probability distributions and do not change in time. We study spatial arrangements of cells on regular graphs with different degrees, from the circle to the complete graph, and vary assumptions on the fitness probability distributions. Some examples include: identical probability distributions for wild types and mutants; cases when only one of the cell types has random fitness values while the other has deterministic fitness; and cases where the mutants are advantaged or disadvantaged. Using analytical calculations and stochastic numerical simulations, we find that randomness has a strong impact on fixation time. In the case of complete graphs, randomness accelerates mutant fixation for all population sizes, and in the case of circular graphs, randomness delays mutant fixation for &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; larger than a threshold value (for small values of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;, different behaviors are observed depending on the fitness distribution functions). These results emphasize fundamental differences in population dynamics under different assumptions on cell connectedness. They are explained by the existence of randomly occurring “dead zones” that can significantly delay fixation on networks with low connectivity; and by the existence of randomly occurring “lucky zones” that can facilitate fixation on networks of high connectivity. Results for death-birth and birth-death formulations of the Moran process, as well as for the (haploid) Wright Fisher model are presented.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3sCQG2z-mIQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Strawberry: Fast and accurate genome-guided transcript reconstruction and quantification from RNA-Seq</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005851</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/2lhGlr9xQ2s/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Ruolin Liu, Julie Dickerson&lt;/p&gt;

We propose a novel method and software tool, Strawberry, for transcript reconstruction and quantification from RNA-Seq data under the guidance of genome alignment and independent of gene annotation. Strawberry consists of two modules: assembly and quantification. The novelty of Strawberry is that the two modules use different optimization frameworks but utilize the same data graph structure, which allows a highly efficient, expandable and accurate algorithm for dealing large data. The assembly module parses aligned reads into splicing graphs, and uses network flow algorithms to select the most likely transcripts. The quantification module uses a latent class model to assign read counts from the nodes of splicing graphs to transcripts. Strawberry simultaneously estimates the transcript abundances and corrects for sequencing bias through an EM algorithm. Based on simulations, Strawberry outperforms Cufflinks and StringTie in terms of both assembly and quantification accuracies. Under the evaluation of a real data set, the estimated transcript expression by Strawberry has the highest correlation with Nanostring probe counts, an independent experiment measure for transcript expression. Availability: Strawberry is written in C++14, and is available as open source software at https://github.com/ruolin/strawberry under the MIT license.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2lhGlr9xQ2s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reducing the RNA binding protein TIA1 protects against tau-mediated neurodegeneration in vivo&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reducing the RNA binding protein TIA1 protects against tau-mediated neurodegeneration in vivo, Published online: 20 November 2017; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-017-0022-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-017-0022-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Apicco and colleagues show that reducing TIA1 inhibits tau-mediated neurodegeneration and improves survival in a mouse model of tauopathy. This rescue occurs with a transition in tau aggregation from oligomeric to fibrillar forms of tau. These findings suggest a key role for RNA binding proteins in the pathophysiology of tau.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/MfulZMZVa8Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: The Emerging Neurobiology of Bipolar Disorder</title>

	<description>Bipolar disorder (BD) is a leading cause of global disability. Its biological basis is unknown, and its treatment unsatisfactory. Here, we review two recent areas of progress. First, the discovery of risk genes and their implications, with a focus on voltage-gated calcium channels as part of the disease process and as a drug target. Second, facilitated by new technologies, it is increasingly apparent that the bipolar phenotype is more complex and nuanced than simply one of recurring manic and depressive episodes.</description>
